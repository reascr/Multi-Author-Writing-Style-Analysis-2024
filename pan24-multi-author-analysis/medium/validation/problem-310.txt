So this article makes it seem like there was an entire ring that was in on it. Multiple people brought in and confirmed the act with both women. As we all know, when a woman is in the presence of an armed person who is going through their phone to look for evidence of them being at the protests, it gets them aroused to the point where they want to fuck multiple men right there in a van...... No one can honestly believe that these women were not under threat of violence for these "consensual" acts.
There is no misrepresentation of rape. Itâ€™s rape. The validation of this behavior is one indicator, of many, as to how absolutely fucked up this ideology is. The government of Iran can go get fucked.
Agreed, but this kind of paranoia is what passes for logic in oppressive regimes. "We can't tell the truth about any bad thing that's happened, or our enemies will use it to destroy us.".
it's not that it's too woke or whatever, it's just that it would require them to protect women from sexual violence, which is not something they want to do.
They \could\ make an example of the rapists and spin the story that Iran protects its women from sexual violence by anyone, but I guess that's too woke or whatever.
Iran should be publicly parading these guards before sending their asses to prison to show people they care about women. It would be lies of course but at least they could pretend to try.
