This is against the company, not Trump himself. Even if they determine some small-ish level of crime (below $2M), the company may likely go defunct and would have to dissolve like his charitable organization. It may do that anyway if the NY civil suit wins against it since that is one of the things it is seeking. That hurts Trump far more than any jail sentence would, since it's so unlikely that he would get one anyway, and since this is his bread and butter (or was, since his international Presidential grifts seem to have far exceeded anything business-related, though that may be arguable, given his properties were largely Russian laundry machines, purportedly). Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
