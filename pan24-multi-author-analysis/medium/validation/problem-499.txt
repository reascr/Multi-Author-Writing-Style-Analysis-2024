I have almost got to the stage where I don't give a shit any more, I recycle everything, I buy items with less packaging, I insulated my house, I bought low powered cars which are much better of fuel, etc etc etc. Yet none of that makes even the slightest bit of difference as the goverments and corporations who actually can make a huge difference will do fk all because they will have to make a little less profit.
The issue is transparency availability and again it's a broken system. No matter how hard I try (another American here) nothing matters. They burn and dump all our shit in the same spots. Make sure to make ev impossible. Where we spend our dollars ends up back in like 10 companies hands who also have a large stake in oil. It's time for a French revolution type of solution but it's not feasible in today's age. So all were left with is throwing ice into the ocean hoping it helps as corporations ensure it doesn't matter.
At the global scale we know how. Reduce fossil fuel dependence/ emissions, increase sustainability of our food and consumer products, and protect and restore global ecosystems. We know what corporations are having the biggest impact. So individually, in my opinion, the biggest impact each of us can make is with how we spend our dollars. The motivation is profit driven.
Ill raise you one, we (Australia) had a program called REDcycle where people could drop off soft plastics to be recycled at major supermarkets. Turns out it was just being stockpiled in warehouses creating a fire hazard so the EPA has directed them to dump all 5200 tonnes of soft plastic into landfill.
Yup, that's where i'm going now, I am getting solar panels fitted next year and that is solely to drop my reliance on the grid so I no longer have to pay so much for power etc.
