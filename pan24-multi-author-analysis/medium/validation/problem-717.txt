I read one WP article on this and think it's true the midterms kinda proved it. No matter how good the economy is the current GOP base will only vote for a white xtian theocracy. Gas prices and inflation are just fodder for them and makes no difference if they're transitory. There's no way they're gonna support any bipartisan let alone Democratic plan to take any sort of action to solve any economic or social issue at this point. They simply don't care. It boils down to demographics younger people aren't excited to live in a country that resembles Iran or Afghanistan.
