Also doesn't help when the nominally-Democratic Mayor of NYC is on TV repeating Zeldin's talking points about crime ad-nauseum and lending validity to that attack point. You can even see the impact in other states that had some of their counties fall within the NYC media market (like CT/NJ/PA).
I'm startled something this detailed is coming out only after an election. Did everyone involved with opposition research for the New York Democratic Party just stick their heads collectively in the sand? Confirming claims about employment and education are things you'd typically catch early on in a cycle!
EDIT: Stumbled across , and from a cursory glance it looks like they spent a lot more time on digging into the things he said vs. the things he did (or claimed to do). Bullet points on the validity of his charity and shadiness on his financial disclosures are on pages 7 and 8, sandwiched in between some quotes of his about how "Biden's going to take your guns" and "Ukraine is a totalitarian regime". Claims about employment and education are taken at face value. Him giving $10 to a right-wing Queens County group takes up as much space as his multiple civil judgements.
How is it that you can lie THIS much and get elected? Do we not have rules in place for getting on ballots? Do you not have to present a resume like a job, considering this IS a job, one of the highest in the nation? It should have a ton of scrutiny. If you say you were employed at a place, it should be verified. Same with school. Military. Charity. Anything and everything. You posted to some r/furry thread - better believe we as voters should know it!
