"Stolen" isn't really used in a legal sense here. Most of the African artifacts in European museums were taken as bounties of war or were taken by an empire during the colonial period. None of this was illegal at time (though there was also plenty of illegal grave robbing ect.). It is by today's moral standards that we regard this as theft not necessarily by legal ones.
And most of the Bronzes are still in London and THOSE people have the gall to say that the Bronzes are for "everyone" and that Nigeria shouldn't get them back.
Cool... can a Nigerian just board a plane for the cost of a bus ticket, take a plane ride to London and just enter visa free to take a look at their OWN HISTORY? Those aren't just "some statues". The rulers of Benin commissioned them after any significant event in their history. So instead of history books, their history is "written" within those statues.
"History is for all" is cool and all, but primarily it should be for those that take their heritage from it. A sense of shared history is essential for a shared identity which is essential for a stable and functioning nation.
