Subheading for those, like me, not in the know: "An Oregon court has ruled that local governments in the state can’t declare themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries and ban police from enforcing certain gun laws".
I dont agree with most of the stuff the U.S. Supreme Court has been doing lately but If state laws violate the U.S. constitution, and police officers and sheriffs declare an oath to the constitution...Guess who is going to win in the courts? This does not erode the legitimacy of the courts.
The state wanted this to end up in the courts otherwise they would not have pushed gun control they knew would be overturned on constitutional grounds. They are wasting tax payer dollars to make a political statement.
That’s because you republican dummies have been wildly misinformed about how our constitution and federalism works. There is a difference between a local municipality defying state law and States or local municipalities choosing not to utilize state funds and resources to enforce federal laws.
