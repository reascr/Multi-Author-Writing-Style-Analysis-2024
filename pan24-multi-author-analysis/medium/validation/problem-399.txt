Yeah. Not to mention the vast majority of the military-industrial complex's corruption is out in the open. I mean, in the United States it's legal for transnational corporations to give money directly to elected officials for political purposes, as long as everybody files the right paperwork with the FEC. And egregious criminal behaviour often does get prosecuted. I don't see a strong argument that the US government is any softer on corruption at Lockheed or General Dynamics than they are on the big Wall Street banks or any other major industry in the US that's rolling in easy money.
That's more than the total since 2014, the United States has committed more than $21 billion [1] in security assistance to Ukraine - if passed brings to $58.7 Billion.
Half of Russia’s OFFICIALLY CLAIMED military budget. I’m sure the total that actually goes towards military equipment and maintenance is a lot smaller once you account for the bribes and grifts along the way.
You Americans are just jealous that when you approve billions of dollars for new military hardware a bunch of luxury yachts and mansions don't just spawn.
In any case, nobody's disputing that other countries have corruption. But pretending that corruption in the West is anything like the kind of corruption you have in a country where all semblance of rule of law has broken down is like comparing a vacuum cleaner to the vacuum of outer space. Similar in concept, different in nature.
