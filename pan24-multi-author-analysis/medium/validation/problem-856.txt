Not true. Back when Peter Norton ran things, the Norton suite was must-have software for anyone in IT.
Edit /u/Happy_Lil_Atoms: Norton Utilities predates your anecdote. It was released in 1982. "Always" includes more time than your limited experience.
In principle you're not wrong, except one massive issue with the LastPass breach is the passwords weren't guaranteed to be hashed with a sufficient number of iterations. The standard minimum these days is 100,000 iterations but if you had an old account (merely more than a couple years) then your master password might only have 5000 hashes which is readily attackable especially if it wasn't super complex (but even somewhat attack even if it was complex). The fact that they didn't update the iterations automatically over time but just left it at the "factory' setting in your profile was an absolute miscarriage of security.
I like cloud password services (especially when combined with 2FA/TOTP), but you expect services like LastPass to always follow best practices and they made some serious mistakes.
What does it matter if the passwords are salted using a master password? The only thing they get is a useless hash. No idea why all these comments are raving about how password managers are bad. They are perfectly fine so long as you have a long, powerful master password as is required for using things like LastPass.
It's not like your usual login where password recovery simply means replacing your hashed password with a new hashed password. Replacing the hashed master password is useless if the old password wasn't used to decrypt the vault first.
Though, quantum computers for example will be able to crack open all of these vaults. Which is dizzyingly concerning, but password storage software will be updated long before it's a reality, and migrating the vault to a more secured encryption algorithm won't be any different than changing the master password by the user.
