Dems have 212 so if 6 republicans have the sense to not let the country default and vote with Dems, the debt ceiling goes to the senate. The senate is majority dem (51) and the debt ceiling increase would pass, no? This is all posturing as usual?

What a strange article. I sort of get what appears to be what they're trying to say. Nonetheless, in my opinion they didn't discuss sufficiently that subtitle. Maybe it just seems that because this post is emphasizing the subtitle by pretending it is the title.
So... they seem to be saying this time things might be different because this time the GOP is a disorganized, chaotic, clueless mess with weak leadership and no true coherent goal.
Part of what is weak in this reasoning is the pretense that these characteristics weren't present every other time this occurred.
If we're lucky, the Biden administration will do something that simply nips this nonsense in the bud and prevents a next time. Platinum coin or simply an executive order to ignore the law. Whatever. The US is bound by the constitution to pay its debts. The constitution and this obligation rather clearly supersedes any law or right of Congress to continue to play these utterly stupid games.
