She's been de-platformed before and could be again and isn't getting multi-million dollar offers for brand representation, etc. like Kanye was. There's not really much else to "cancel" her from and anyone that's not also racist or a hard line right winger or q nut thinks she's a loony. You can't remove someone from elected office if they're racist, you just have to work to get them out, but when she lives in an area that votes for her there's not much you can do. Strom Thurmond was racist as hell and served in the senate for 48 years into 2003 for example.
