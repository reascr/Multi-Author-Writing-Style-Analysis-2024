How in the Kentucky Fried fuck is that following a Chain of command? That is the exact opposite of how it is supposed to work. When a problem gets elevated to your boss he or she deals with it. Not push it down to your subordinates, that is lazy leadership or "leaders" not willing to confront any problems. I am disgustingly disappointed in how people act towards teachers and how the administration just rolls over the past couple of years. And parents who only now just show up to school meetings claiming that their son/daughter is being fed "lies" and being forced to use a litter box. Despite never asking their child what they learn every day or how their day was at school.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
