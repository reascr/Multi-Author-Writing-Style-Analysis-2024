Reading the article rather than the crappy headline. The doctors are largely concerned about the GM crop being a roundup resistant variant. i.e. this allows them to unleash spraying roundup on everything to death.
Shit should be illegal. Not only is that shit going to destroy the ecosystem, Bayer is going to use accidental cross-polination to get rid of anyone who doesn't use their shit.
The simple fact that it even does still cross-polinate is a good indicator that it's intentional. What, you don't think they could add a gene where only the pure strain remains viable?
So you are implying that a question can not be answered until you can find a single college graduate that holds a contrarian opinion? As long as you can find a single creationist mathematician, we can not assume Earth is older than 5000 years? As long as you can find an anti-vaxer lawyer, we can not assume vaccines are safe?
Or there might exist methods to assess evidence and actually decide what is the correct answer to a question?
