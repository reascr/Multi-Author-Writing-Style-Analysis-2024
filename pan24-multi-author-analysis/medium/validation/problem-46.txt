Thank you for the suggestions I already do all this minus the mail in suggestion. I prefer to go cast my vote in person and I take that day off work expecting to stand in line for a minute. I bring my foldable chair and ish. Upvote for others who may see this.

not a real concern, gop just want to make voting more cumbersome in the hope thatâ€™ll make some people fed up enough to stay home and not vote against their dumb shit.
Arizona has mail in voting. Good luck w that. Most just get their ballots ahead of time, jot down their vote then go to polling place to drop it off instead of mailing it in. Requires signature verification.
