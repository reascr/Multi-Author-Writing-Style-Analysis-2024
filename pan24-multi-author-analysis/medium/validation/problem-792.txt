When I was in Poland this past summer, we’d be chilling in the backyard at my grandmas house and every once in a while you’d see American military planes fly over. In the town I was staying in, there’s a lot of Ukrainian refugees. My family said they love seeing them fly by because it just shows power. It’s cool to see allies in action and in force. People forget that Poland went to Afghanistan and fought the Taliban alongside the US. It makes me proud that we can all stick together and defend Ukraine. It’s globally so overwhelmingly popular. Governments are tripping over themselves coming to aid. Poland just bought a buttload of South Korean tanks and were training alongside Korean troops this summer, which is pretty badass.
Russia understands one language only and that’s power and intimidation. You show weakness, you’re done. Think high school politics, and that’s how you navigate it.
Nah, the US imprisons about 500 people for every 100,000 of it citizens. That's about the same as the average estimates for North Korea, FYI. Russia imprisons only 300 people for every 100,000 of its citizens.
