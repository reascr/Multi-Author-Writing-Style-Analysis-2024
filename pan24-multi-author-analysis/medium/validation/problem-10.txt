If the public pressure was real Biden would have done this earlier. Instead he waited until basically the day after the Georgia runoff to ensure the 51-49 Senate lead for his party.
The timing is too coincidental. He knew this would be unpopular at home and would be heavily criticized and hurt his party at the ballot box. He does this the day after the last vote is in, announces it and hopes that everyone forgets in 2 years before the next election. The only surprise of this whole thing is he announced in on a Thursday and didn't do the classic Friday afternoon bad news drop.
The whole reason why the deal included Griner and Bout was based on division. Now there are two sides to the whole debate, Democrats who view it as a step in the right direction to help an American who was in need of help from their government and Republicans who see it as an issue that a black, lesbian, basketball player was traded for a lord of war.
The trade couldn't have gone any better for Putin, he received an ally of the Russian government, the US received a citizen in need of help, and now Russian bots can push their beliefs against others they seem undesirable while dividing the US even further over an issue that, arguably, doesn't even matter to the lives of the average American.
