From the article it seems that the family was shot at, starved, lost everything and almost died as the Russians sieged and took the city. But they survived. Now the mother works in the occupant "administration" of the territory and this gives the family an income and some security for now. A chance to live.
Yeah, I saw this "concert". Fucking disgraceful but typical of the lenhs that Putins propaganda ministry will go to. And the stupid sheep in the audience of whom many were forced to be there, lap it up. Utter cringe fest of nationalist vomit.
I hate that I'm saying this but I would absolutely have worked for occupational forces if it meant the survival of my children. The world is horrific. Some people are force to do fucked up shit to protect their own.
They may not expect the city to be ever liberated by Ukrainian forces, so they adapt and lick the boot they need to lick to not starve and freeze or be shot in a ditch. Even people who would stand up for themselves no mattter the cost will often grin and bear it when their childrens' lives are on the line, and I will not judge them for that.
