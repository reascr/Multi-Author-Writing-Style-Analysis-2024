Ya, I drive through Damascus and Boring to get to work, and I bet in the next few weeks I see some FTK (Fuck Tina Kotek) stickers on every jacked up truck with the US and Gadsden flag flying in the back. Those people are such a cliche at this point.
For sure, just come up with some sub-4th grade insult for a Democrat, print up stickers and T's, watch the money come in, then donate a bunch of the money to Planned Parenthood.
Sell 'Fuck Tina Kotex' stickerabto raise menstrual awareness, create hype, Starr ballot measures for free menstrual products in schools, profit.
When they lose their shit with 'Tina Kotex' all over the place whoever owns that trademark sues for heavy damages, and gets the concession to provide said products at a lower-than market rate.
