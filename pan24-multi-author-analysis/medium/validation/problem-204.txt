Settlements: With the Treaty, the agreements between Japan and Korea concerning the settlement of problems in regard to property and claims and economic cooperation was also signed. Japan provided South Korea with $300 million grant in economic aid and $200 million in loans together with $300 million in loans for private trust, a total of $800 million as "reparation fee" that Japan had to pay for their illegal occupation.\[8\] The official policy of Japanese governments has been that, in regard to war-time property issues and individual claims for compensation, such issues were settled completely and finally by this agreement. But Korean Supreme court decided that all the charges related to individuals still are alive.
It appears Korean government at the time failed to distribute funds to the individuals who qualified and simply spent it so the onus is on Korean government.
Japan thought this was settled in 1965, but Korean courts are supporting lawsuits against Japanese companies in Korea for compensation. Few if any wartime labor survivors will see any money. This will drag on for years to come.
