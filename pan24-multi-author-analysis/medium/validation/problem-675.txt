Have to wonder how many "reshuffles" does it take for the Russians start to wonder whether the "special operation" is doomed and the blame is somewhere higher..
Military analysts think getting practically the highest possible ranked person to take over is a major escalation in the war; they theorise a reorganisation of the various fronts under a unified command structure and new offensives being planned.
Considering that the highest rank in Russian army has never served in army, yes i‚Äôm talking about Shoigu, and how russia failed this bs invasion. I think Gerasimov‚Äôs outcome will be as bad as shoigu. Too old, too corrupted, too drunk(yeah you can find YouTube clips when Gerasimov is drunk in front of soldiers ü§£).
And yeah, calling ‚Äúrandom nobodies‚Äù the ‚Äúones before him‚Äù is kinda wild. Surovikin and Dvornikov. Surovikin were also partially commander in Syrian war, and he was commanded of space/aero forces before appointment at this shitshow invasion. They both were comms in the Syrian war.
Actually you‚Äôre probably right, even the Russian mil bloggers have doubts over Gerasimov and preferred Surovikin.
Political appointment because he‚Äôs a close friend of Putin and he‚Äôs not ethnically Slavic so low possibility of him replacing Putin (supposedly, so goes the rumours).
He was a public servant, member of the communist party during the Soviet Union, eventually became a politician.
Haha you know what I meant when I said that - in comparison/relative to, considering his very high position.
I am aware of him; the thing is they keep on changing leadership on various levels as if that would magically fix the underlying issues. In reality frequent changes will likely just add to the confusion so seems like just a deflection of blame from Putin to anyone else.
It‚Äôs the 3rd or 4th time they changing commanders I recall? This makes no sense to me tbh. I feel that Asian people want Putin to win for some reason, but another change of commander won‚Äôt fix the root reasons behind Russian fail.
Just another way for Putin to shift blame in the media. With Gerasimov in overall command Putin can now say "It was his idea to begin with and even he can't make it work.".
