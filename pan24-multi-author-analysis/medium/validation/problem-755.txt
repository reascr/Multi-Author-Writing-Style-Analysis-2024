When I become dictator of the world and institute free healthcare it will then become child abuse to do blatantly evil things such as this. How dare those parents place their child’s lives at risk because of their own stupidity.
^and ^because ^then ^everyone ^would ^hate ^Reed ^Richards ^as ^much ^as ^he ^does ^for ^trying ^to ^stop ^him.
He realized that if he's a very good and empathetic ruler that provides for his people that once he takes over the world his rule will be secured by popular acclaim.
Whatever the ethical implications of actually implementing that would be, I sincerely doubt that any of these people will make it anywhere close to a dictatorship position.
So what I was taught in bioethics - at least for the US - is that the physician can overrule parental decisions like this in the situation where the child’s life is at risk. So for example - if a child is under the age of 12, and they’re a Jehovah’s Witness, and parents refuse blood transfusion on grounds of religion, physician can overrule that decision (going through correct channels of course).
They’re saying that once people aren’t fearing for their lives about not being able to meet basic life requirements people will become paranoid and evil.
