If a former Republican can get 40% of the vote and a strong Democrat candidate lost by less than 1%, I think that's an obvious indicator he isn't as popular as people think. Even Republicans like Rand Paul won with a larger margin in their state in 2022.
Which is also hilarious because if he runs against Trump, he's going to say Desantis is vaccinated, which he is.

People forget that Desantis got the vaccine for all his rich donors before everyone else in the state lol.
Without Truml on his side, and I mean fully on board and campaigning for him, I don't think DeSantis pulls as many people as Trump. He's not even that popular in Florida tbh. He BARELY and I mean barely won in 2018 with a decent democrat candidate. (Won easily in 2022 because, well, it was goddamn Crist...) With all his fascist moves, I wouldn't be surprised if he's polling lower with key demographics across the state. I'm getting tired of hearing about him as if Floridians love him like they do Trump. They simply DONT.
