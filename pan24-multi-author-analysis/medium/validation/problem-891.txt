>News Corp made more than $140 million in taxable income but didnâ€™t pay any tax. Apart from $200,000 in tax from its investment arm in 2018 and $8 million in tax from its Foxtel investment arm in 2016, News Corp has paid no tax for many years in Australia, and in fact has received more in taxpayer handouts than it has paid in tax in total. In contrast, Nine paid $109 million in tax from $364 million in taxable income.
Oh dude, our misguided gov has given licence to reopen a coal mine and restart a few coal fired power stations. And the coal we have left is dirty sulferous stuff, not good. The energy producing companies are raking in the profits, whilst citizens go hungry and cold due to sky high, unaffordable energy costs.
But at least you don't get almost all your energy from the dirtiest coal, with numerous new mines announced lol.
There should be a cap on energy prices, and it should be affordable by the poorest. Its an essential service after all.
I'd like to think an expansion of this 15% to 20% or more, in the future could fund a Universal Basic Income.
