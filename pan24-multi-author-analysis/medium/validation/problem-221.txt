this proactive crossing the center straight line activity happens soooo many times regularly or even daily basis, I think the majority of Chinese and Taiwanese people are really immune to it, unless something much more severe happens like actions when Pelosi landed, compared to westurn audiences who are not exposed to these news much, who think this is a very big deal and war signal.
Or they could be fake-attacking Taiwan often enough that when the real attack comes Taiwan assumes it's another feint and doesn't respond in time.
Or they could be doing this to pull Taiwan's airframes into the air so often that their maintenance can't keep up and their planes are down for servicing on the day the real attack comes.
Or they're doing this to judge how big their attack needs to be to break through Taiwan's air defenses.
There’s a huge difference between China sending a couple squadrons over the strait over actually building up enough assets to invade. The former is a nuisance while the latter will be spotted months in advanced.
A war would only make China's population problem worse. They already have an aging population that will be supported by almost half that population of workers.
If you start allowing the young to be killed and maimed that's even fewer workers to support retirees. The situation is unsustainable now. Short of sending retirees to go fight I don't see how a war helps their economic outlook.
If anything, that window is opening. This decade presents the most favorable naval conditions that China is likely to see in the near future because the US navy is decommissioning ships in the next few years without immediate replacements. At the same time China is rapidly expanding its own navy, scheduled to add another 60 naval ships by 2025 and an additional 40 on top of that by 2030. In that time period the US is retiring 7 of its 17 active Ticonderoga class cruisers and the replacement DDG(X) class is only slated to begin production in 2030, and the design hasn't even been finalized yet. The new Constellation class frigates are going to begin trickling into the navy starting 2026. China just launched their 3rd aircraft carrier this year and is supposed to complete their 4th late this decade, and most importantly for an invasion of Taiwan they are completing a number of amphibious transport vessels to enable them to actually carry over the troops they would need.
I didn't say China was going to outnumber the US navy, I said it's building it's navy during a time period where the US navy is going to be shrinking for awhile. So it's still the best time window China is likely to see for awhile whether you want to compare them by numbers, tonnage, spending, VLS cells, or any other metric you'd like to use. And the ships they're building aren't just a bunch of weak trash. The Type 055, 052D, and 054A are respectable combatants.
And the west supported the KMT because they were the ones fighting Japan whilst the CCP was hiding out in the countryside.
My brother in Christ you conveniently left out the part where China is relevant as an economy at all was largely due to the west allowing China to join the WTO.
Because everyone was lining up to trade with China in the 50s and 60s right? Lol. You tankies crank me up. Why don’t you have a look at what their gdp was before the west started trading with them.
…no. No they’re not going to field a 6th gen bomber and 12 nuclear super carriers by 2030. To assume they can even get halfway there in 8 years is absurd.
And it's the same argument Chamberlain made about Hitler. Just let Germany have the Rhineland, it isn't worth a war over. Just let Germany have Austria, it isn't worth a war. Just let them have the Sudetenland...
When an aggressive country discovers they can extort things from the world by threats, they tend to demand more through threats, not less. After all if it's working then why stop?
