Meanwhile they appoint and award all the top level managers, VPs, etc, whilst us, who actually are boots on the ground DOING the work are largely ignored, never consulted, and pegged into lower level positions with no chance for advancement. Are told we should consider ourselves lucky we have our jobs, though WE are the cogs that keep the machine rolling and actually CARE about our students. It's quite frustrating.
It's depressingly common. I'm currently over a year into litigation against a school that did this in PA, CEO said similar things regularly, i'm told average is 2-3 years to reach a settlement, in the best possible scenario. In the meantime, most employers won't touch me with a 10-ft pole. Also their only legal obligation in the end is for them to pay the difference between what I would've made at their job vs what I actually made instead. Would sure be nice if Biden and congress emboldened the NLB, and/or Shapiro and the newly Democratic state house made right to work laws a priority. As long as the entire system is stacked in their favor, employers will continue to act this way.
