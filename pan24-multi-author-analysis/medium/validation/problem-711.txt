The proposal was never meant for Ukraine. It is internal propaganda and merely the first step at that. The whole plot will go down something like this.
This is not an honest offer. This is just another lie designed to escalate now and give apologists in later decades an argument of Putin being the victim instead of the villain here. Something Putin's successors will draw upon, because there sure as hell is not going to be any change in Russia in the decades to come. Russia will be North Korea 2.0 soon.
Putin declares the armistice on a religious holiday. No matter what happens Putin will claim the Ukrainians broke it on the holiest of days. This attack will be named as the reason to close the borders, declare a mobilization and bring more companies under direct control for the purposes of a war economy.
You don't get to invade your neighbour and then demand a ceasefire when you are losing. That is crazy, even for Putin. I think he knew it would be refused and he just wanted something to show domestic audiences that Ukraine is the bad guy.
