Any mention of his name from the officials means a lot for us. The islamic republic is a coward, meaning that if UN just like how they kicked them out of the women council, speak about the executions, they will be paralyzed and it would be a great chance for us to overthrow them. Yes, they would not be involved directly, but indirectly. Any truth spoken about this revolution and this executions will weaken the islamic republic.
but all those karma whores out there want to profit off this protestor's death. They can't win the internet if they dont pretend they're doing something instead of actually contributing like phoning/messaging political representatives and demanding action against Iran.
If many, like many people retweet or share this information, most likely the UN or western governments would step up and stop the execution. You all live in a free speech world and it would be super helpful for us Iranians to overthrow this dictatorship. By emailing this to your government, retweeting this crime, sharing it with your family during the holidays and etc, you can save our lives.
If example needed, Mahsa Amini when killed, was retweeted millions and millions times. The مهسا_امینی became one of the most retweeted hashtag in the history, everyone spoke about her and now, her name is a code in Iran, just like she wanted (Written on her grave “Mahsa, your name will become a symbol”.).
