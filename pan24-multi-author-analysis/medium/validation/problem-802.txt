"But I read that they were running low on their stockpile of thousands upon thousands of artillery rounds yesterday.... why haven't they run out today?
Poor Russia, all that aggression and nothing to show for it but a collapsing economy and mass exodus of prime age working men. The unnecessary loss of life on both sides is devastating and Putin should be ashamed.
The thing is he trying to create a monarchi that works as soviet country and this is cannot work by the idea. And idea of what country putin and his cronies want is Just soviet era propaganda posters without understanding how ussr works. It mostly imitation and cargo cult kinda state at this point.
i know it's to control your population and other things but man...i hope we can rid the world of it some day.
It really depresses me that I read these kinds of sentiments every day from people that aren't joking....
I totally understand that, and I'm in very much the same boat as you, but I have a fairly rudimentary understanding of logistics....
But whenever I don't understand something like this I try to think in terms of what I do understand.... like if I stop paying my bills today, then it's not like I'm going to be homeless tomorrow, and if my job cuts my pay, then I know that if I don't figure it out, then eventually I will be homeless...
If it takes a few months for a nobody like me to run out of resources, then I can at least understand that the scale of what's happening with Russia is so far beyond my experience that it's not surprising when it takes a while for their failures to be obvious to those of us that aren't directly involved with the logistics.
