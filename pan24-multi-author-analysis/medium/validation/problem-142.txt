Does the world want a new China though. The existing one became quite problematic when it got powerful.
The main issue with india is the lack of infrastructure. They would need trillions of investment to compete.
Takes time but India will get there. China has ONE moving part and that's CCP. India otoh jesus Christ. I'd root for an open democracy anyday over a covert and malign authoritarian regime to flourish.
It won't be easy because Indian infrastructure is garbage compared to China. It will be impossible to create efficient supply chains from so many factories in India.
But I suppose none of that matters as corporations will just buy from the cheapest country anyway. (Edit: Or maybe not, all eggs in one basket approach has shown itself to be problematic. Guess it will depend on how much risk vs low prices corporations will accept.).
On its own side AKA only caring about yourself is pretty much the definition of not being a team player.
You are like the football player who refuses to pass the ball because you want to score and pad your personal record, who doesnâ€™t care about how other players on the team feel, or even if it means your team is less effective - i.e. not team player.
