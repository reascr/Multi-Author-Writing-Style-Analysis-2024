I really can't see the UK sustaining this type of social crisis for very long until it reaches to a very critical point.
This critical point could be people starting to die in droves because they simply can't afford to live. It could be that this situation causes permenant severe mental and physical health issues for a very significant portion of the population, which cuts down the national life expectancy, results in overall loss of productivity and a permanent dependency on welfare (I'd argue we're already here with this one). It could even be people responding to policy decisions with violence and an overall hostile and aggressive attitude is developed towards politics and politicians.
Whatever this critical point looks like, the signs are glaringly obvious that we are heading there and we could realise it within a matter of months and then what?
More inaction? More posturing? More false promises? More borrowing? At what point does a conservative politician wake up and realise that they actually have to start doing something more productive than giving pretty speeches to the camera? If never, then why the fuck are they in power and how stupid do you have to be to vote for this kind of person?
This is pedantic in the extreme. Do you deny that a rational person with a reasonable amount of knowledge of Britain's current economic condition would correctly understand the statement "heat or eat"? If so, then the shorthand works.
Yes, how an article is framed and what tone is used can absolutely direct public opinion. But this ain't it chief.
