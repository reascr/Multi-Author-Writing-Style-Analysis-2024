On Twitter, I followed a few stand-up comedians (they dont do overtly political material but they do lean left), some talented fan-artists, some bands so I know if they're touring or have new albums coming out, and a few museums that post interesting scientific ot historical facts.
Even before Musk bought it, I'd get random-ass right-wing pundits and heavily slanted conservative news sites with clickbait headlines. It got exponentially worse after Musk bought it, complete with shit like Kyle Rittenhouse whining and Donald Trump Jr.'s misspelled rants against Joe Biden.
This morning I was looking for a compilation of funny scenes from an anime (a goofy comedy about a woman who has a dragon for a maid) and about every eighth one was some smug right-winger ranting about...whatever. Note, this is even after I've blocked channels and clicked "Not interested in this type of content " constantly.

This NEVER happens the other way. I never get some weird result that has leftist content. In fact, I don't even get weird neutral or apolitical results that don't make sense.
I'll look up videos about Warhammer 40,000 lore and I dont get some random-ass unrelated game instead. I don'teven get "sorta close but wrong" results like Warcraft or War Thunder....but JOE ROGAN DESTROYS WOKE CULTURE sure as fuck will show up.
Earlier today I was looking for nirvana live at the paramount videos and it legitimately kept giving me recommendations that were all basically. THE DEATH OF AMERICA. BIDEN MUST BE REMOVED and other nonsense shit. I put not interested and block them but those fuckers keep appearing.
YouTube? Music videos, anime and video game reviews, sci-fi & fantasy movie trailers, cooking and household DIY repair stuff....but then Joe Rogan, Benny Shapiro, and some random-ass Fox News clips constantly show up.
