Just to play devils advocate for a second. For anyone who does not know about international travel by state aircraft, the same freedom of navigation rules applied to civilian aircraft are not applied to state aircraft. In order to fly over a sovereign nation you have to get a diplomatic clearance, usually granted from a government body similar to the department of state. These “dips” can be used to either cover a specific entry/exit time or provide a lenh of time like -24/+72 from expected entry time. Every country has a specific process and lead time for dips. It could be automatic if the countries have good relations or it could be a firm 14 days. It depends. I don’t know how Pakistan deals with its dips normally and if there is a precedent for them not allowing immediate dips. I’m not saying whether it’s correct or not but the article provides very little information surrounding why the dips were denied.
