When drugs can be used for profit due to scarcity and illegality, nobody is safe. There are 2 solutions, legalization and government production of all drugs which removes incentive for any cartel by killing profitability, or extreme and anonymous violence designed to eliminate them, and the option to implicate rival cartel against each other. But neither will happen, drugs are part of the justification for the police state, without drugs, the only reason for crime is the poverty capitalism creates by exploitation.
I always agreed with this.. legitimize the current drug dealers but I’m not so sure anymore. If weed is any indication of how “legalization” would work it may help a little but the government will overtax it, keeping the demand for black market around and still larger than the legit markets. Legal manufacturing and sales will have to compete with cartels paying no fiscal tax, offering a cheaper price. The government would have to lay low for a decade or so on taxation and charging millions to get a license.
They could just fund it entirely, like they do social programs, meanwhile attempt to get people independent from the drugs, destroy demand eventually if possible. There is a way to do this, I don't think it's wanted though. I believe the system is just how they like it.
I somewhat agree with some Legalization points, however the government isn’t going to be handing out kilos of cheap meth to everyone on the block. Similar to how pharmacy’s can’t give you too much of specific drugs. Cartels would still very much have a market in cheaper meth in larger quantities.
