All of the evidence was there: the ego, the past frauds, the debts, the complete inability to speak articulately or even coherently, the weird comportment and awful makeup, that coiffure, the fact that he bankrupted a casino, the absurd “policy” positions and insane promises, the sexism, the fact that his “debating” consisted almost exclusively of insulting people, the terrible reputation among New Yorkers and others who knew him, the draft-dodging, all of the sex assault allegations, the fact that he cheated on his third or fourth wife with a pornstar while they were pregnant, the fact that he bragged on TV about committing sexual assault, the fact that he talked about wanting to fuck his daughter, the fact that he publicly solicited help from Russia in swaying the election, and on and on… And a not-insubstantial number of self-proclaimed “patriots” thought that they knew better than intelligent people and still voted for this known conman.
It still never ceases to amaze me that there are people of such extreme, almost unfathomable levels of wanton and abject stupidity that they actually voted for this guy.
Does this give the doj a green light search warrant for all his properties, including Ivana's spacious coffin with purportedly only a cremation urn in it?
