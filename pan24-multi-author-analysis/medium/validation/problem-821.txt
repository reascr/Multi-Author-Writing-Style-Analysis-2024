The info I found says that sore loser laws are mainly for congressional candidates, not presidential elections. Only South Dakota and Texas apply it to presidential candidates.
Man... can you imagine if DeSantis creamed Trump in the primary and in a fit of rage, Trump ran a third party spoiler campaign? You know that would be just like him. It would be such a beautiful trainwreck.

This poll certainly adds weight to that side of the scale.
