There is no incentive for the US, France or the UK to push for a ceasefire. A Russian win is a loss for western Europe. Plus, and action like that would likely require military intervention, which the three western permanent members won't have the stomach for (they've been supplying Ukraine, you think they want to fight them?).
Can they? I am no expert on the UN, but wouldn't anything with any teeth have to go through the security council, which would require the US to sign off?
...Ukraine has all the momentum....no point in stopping now....they are going to keep fighting until they've taken all their land back.
If backroom deals are made to stop this from becoming ww3 or it looks like it will go on forever in a stillmate they will most likely force a ceasefire and become another north and south Korea.
The US is watching their longest term enemy fall on it's face, they have no incentive to help them out of the pickle they've gotten themselves into. We are certainly costing them more money than we are spending (and we have more money to spend anyways), and aren't risking a single American soldier. It's the best situation for us.
