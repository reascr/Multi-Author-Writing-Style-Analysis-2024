The title is so misleading. Basically its a little like lego toy that can melt and mostly get in the same shape when solidifying. And it needs help to get it back in rough same shape and it uses magnets to do it.
it's just metal that can be melted & is magnetic. there is zero intelligence or logic components in it and you need external hardware. has nothing to do with a "robot". its just metal moved by a magnet.
No they didn’t. This is complete bullshit. They magnetized gallium and ran a current through it.(Gallium melts at room temperature) Then in another article the “scientists” admitted that the video was faked.
still is disappointing that everytime you see news about soft robotic or metal robots that its clickbait.. you always need huge external hardware that makes it not useable in any real reallife usecase.. this researchers just burn money and time and act like they just invented the new big thing.. but then its just a floppy piece of rubber they inflate with a compressor or a piece of metal they move by magnets. its just.. sigh.. :/.
