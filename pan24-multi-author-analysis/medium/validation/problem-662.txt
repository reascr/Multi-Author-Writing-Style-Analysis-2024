So does this mean that denying or minimizing the Holodomor will now be a crime in Germany? My understanding is Germany has criminalized genocide denial.
I don't know if you know this, but the USSR's Capital was Moscow and heavily practiced Russian Imperialism... Good luck trying to understand the world.
Of course your a pro-Russian troll. Poor fella has a worldview only shaped by Rage Against the Machine and troll farm propaganda.
The Nazis actively killed millions of people in literal death camps. It is unambiguously genocide. They also meticulously recorded their crimes, so there’s no ambiguity over what happened.
But there are a lot of situations where what happened is somewhat disputed, and if it constitutes genocide is disputed. But one legal ruling and suddenly a legitimate historical interpretation of events, possibly even the correct interpretation, is illegal. You could end up in a position where it’s illegal to be correct.
Genocide is a crime which requires intent. It’s very rare to have an unambiguous genocide unless the perpetrator admits it.
“We were faced with the question: what about the women and children?–I have decided on a solution to this problem. I did not consider myself justified to exterminate the men only—in other words, to kill them or have them killed while allowing the avengers, in the form of their children, to grow up in the midst of our sons and grandsons. The difficult decision had to be made to have this people disappear from the earth.”.
So no, you couldn’t argue that. They intended to kill them. They weren’t merely okay with letting them die, they actively exterminated them. You could maybe make the argument for other groups that were victims of the holocaust? But then the question isn’t “did the Nazis commit genocide” but “against exactly which groups did the Nazis commit genocide”.
To be blunt, the European Parliament are not historians. You don’t determine if something is genocide by having the European Parliament vote on it. You might as well ask them to vote on if P=NP.
Not to mention, just imagine if this law goes into effect in Germany, and then another genocide vote reaches the European Parliament. A German member of parliament considers the evidence, and votes no. He is outvoted, and it is classed as genocide. After the vote he is asked why he voted no. He can’t say he voted no because he doesn’t think it met the criteria, that’s now illegal for him to say.
Up for debate by whom? Even the vote that just took place in the European Parliament had 12 votes against. They debated it. They also aren’t qualified to make the decision either way.
Maybe you mean by academics? Well if you could find a genocide where all academics unanimously agree that would be nice. Of course, if you don’t, and proceed with the law, you will make it illegal for academics to agree with their own work, or to defend why they wrote it.
Let’s say new evidence comes out which, unambiguously, clears it of being genocide. It was actually just incompetence or whatever. It’s illegal to admit you believe the new evidence. It’s illegal to ask for the law to be changed to reflect the new evidence, unless you do so in such a way as to make it clear you don’t actually believe this new evidence, you just want German law to reflect the evidence you don’t believe….
The Nazis went out of there way to tick all of the boxes, it’s like they looked at the definition of genocide as a list of requirements, and then made sure to record their intentions just in case you tried to argue the deaths were merely incidental.
Personally, I don’t agree with it being illegal to deny it, simply because I don’t believe opinions should be illegal, but denying the holocaust was genocide (not quite the same thing as holocaust denial) is not an opinion anyone is going to hold in good faith after any research.
Genocide has a precise definition, there are many absolutely horrifically immoral policies that are not genocide.
Assuming prescriptive linguistics, we can’t disagree on if a given action, carried out with a given intent, was genocide.
Prescriptivist linguist I see. But sure, we will go with the UN definition. We will go with exactly the UN definition, because any deviation from a single word, and we will introduce ambiguity.
To use this analogy, we might disagree on the boiling point of water because we disagree on the atmospheric pressure in the room.
“In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;.
“The intent is the most difficult element to determine. To constitute genocide, there must be a proven intent on the part of perpetrators to physically destroy a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”.
Yes, Ukrainians are being killed, but the intent, going by the first few days of the war, was to capture the country with its population intact.
There is a war happening. Genocidal is a big question. I’ll agree Putin wants to end the existence of Ukraine, and therefore the Ukrainian national group, but I don’t think his intent is to do that via any of the required means.
Yes, serious bodily and mental harm is being inflicted, it’s war, but it’s inflicted to capture the country not to eliminate its population.
Inflicting conditions to bring about the destruction of the group you’d have a better argument for, but you could also argue that’s just trying for military victory.
Probably the fact Holodomer was classified as a genocide by politicians, while the country accused of committing that genocide was invading the victims.
It might have been a case of politics winning out over a dispassionate analysis of history against the UN definition of genocide.
The European Parliament has put its hatred of the UK for leaving the EU into prospective for the time being, especially given the UK has been more than pulling its weight in support for Ukraine.
It would also be more difficult to prove intent just due to Ireland being so much longer ago, but I don’t think the European Parliament will necessarily care.
So people of your political orientation should view this thing as good, but this thing shouldn’t be a political tool.
If it’s not political, being a leftist is irrelevant. Since you seem to think it is relevant, you seem to think it is political. If you think it’s political you think it’s bad, but you say it’s good for your political orientation….
Yes it is. Of course, if you enacted a policy that killed millions of people, you will have almost certainly committed a long list of other crimes for which you will die in prison. A large number of murders, if, say, you wanted them to die but not because of their membership of a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. I’m not sure what the international equivalent of gross negligence resulting in death is, but that would be a distinct possibility.
Killing people because you just don’t care if they have enough food to survive isn’t genocide. For it to be genocide you have to deliberately reduce their number.
The best case you would have would be the transferred children. But Russia has a demographic crisis. They might be taking children and re-educating them to create more Russians, not reduce the number of Ukrainians, which wouldn’t count.
The exact same actions may or may not count depending on if the deaths were desired or merely not-not desired.
