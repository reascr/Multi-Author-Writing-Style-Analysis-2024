Right now George Santos manufacturing a fake resume to get elected to Congress is the least illegal thing he's done. He's also wanted for check fraud in Brazil, had a scam marriage for a green card, stole dogs from Amish dog breeders, raised money for treating a veteran's sick dog then kept the money and disappeared, and is facing potential charges from the FEC for lying about people contributing to his campaign to hide where the money really came from.
