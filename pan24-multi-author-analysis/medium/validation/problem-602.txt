The whole "water will freeze at 0C" is only true for "normal" water (not pure water) at atmospherical pressure. We don't know if that river is under an heavier pressure than atmospherical or not or if the water is saline or not. I just assumed that the water is, at least, saline. I might be wrong.
How do you suppose that it's liquid? Higher pressure and temperature below 0C would indicate that it's probably frozen. Maybe it's saline?
If it's saline, it can definitely be in liquid state below 0C. If it's under pressure, even more. Water won't freeze as easily when put under a certain amount of pressure.
From what I've read, these rivers form due to geothermal heating and friction. Since that's the case, this sort of thing has probably been going on for quite some time. So I doubt it's saline.
You did said that higher pressure would indicate that it's frozen, which is not true. Anyway, the fact is, we don't know yet. My assumption is just that, an assumption. Like, if I had to bet 10 bucks, I'd bet them on liquid below zero C, that's it. (also, that wouldn't be a river if it was solid ice anyway).
