As someone who knows nothing about classified documents - my view on it is that probably not every classified document originates with some authority that checks them in and out to credentialed borrowers. Someone compiles some info and maybe stamps CLASSIFIED on it and then hands it to someone like Biden's team and then it gets forgotten. It never made it to the national archives or whatever body is responsible for recording them so nobody knows to ask for it back. This isn't for every classified document, but for all the people asking "why didn't the national archives ask for them back at some point?" ... I would guess that the national archives didn't know about them. I just find it hard to believe that as soon as something is marked classified it has to be immediately sent to the archives and all the bureaucracy that entails before anyone else is allowed to look at it.
