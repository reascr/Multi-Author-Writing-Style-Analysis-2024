Form a new NATO of every other country that is sane in the alliance and focus on that, let Turkey, Hungry, etc apply to that, disband the original NATO.
Just let the US, UK, France, Germany sign bilateral agreements with them so that they can tell Turkey they won't be getting a damn thing and stand up to the non-democratic bullshit there.
Both scenarios oust Turkey who has a very strategic location which has been used repeatedly by western countries for their own means.
Option 2 does not oust Turkey. It just blocks them from extortion, it doesn't end NATO and the UK already signed such an agreement I think with them.
The US has defense agreements with other countries: Australia, Japan, S. Korea, etc. They are the primary partner that matters.
They’re not stupid. They know what their value is. They will know if someone is trying to diminish their influence.
Option 2 will happen if Turkey blocks them for long enough Finland and Sweden know this or have already been told it quietly, but have been told to try to work it out I suspect.
I can assure you Turkey will know what the purpose is and it is ousting them without ousting them which was your entire point. You even say “they won’t be getting a damn thing.”.
(yes I'm ignoring technology because my point is: they have a shit load of personnel where there may be tension.
