I wouldn’t be so sure of this. Georgia’s population is highly concentrated into a few cities, which skew very democrat. For example, 50% of Georgia’s population lives in the greater Atlanta area and an additional 5% lives in the cities of Macon, Augusta, Savannah, and Columbus. Judging by vote recipient for down ticket offices is not that reliable because as a Georgia voter myself, many of those candidates run unopposed and many voters do not view these offices as political in nature. I have no issue voting for a republican coroner even though I am a pretty staunch democrat because it’s not really a political office in any meaningful way.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
