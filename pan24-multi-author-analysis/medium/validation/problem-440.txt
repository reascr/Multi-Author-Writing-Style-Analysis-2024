I did live in the US, for a number of years. I lived in Newport Beach, CA. I worked in Irvine. Company I worked for transferred me from Vancouver, to Irvine, to Toronto. Yes, I'm Canadian, but we're all North Americans as far as I'm concerned. The 49th parallel has been a virtually unmanned border for as long as I can remember...so please dispense with the "you don't live in the US, bologna." Canada has its issues, too. No doubt about it....but no country on earth is as terror-filled - aside from Israel/Palestine and actual hot war zones - than the USA is presently. My family used to vacation in Florida annually. We stopped in 2019 for fear of the rising trend of violence and insanity, and the nickle & dime-ing we had to put up with by our landlords/rental agencies (and environmental issues like Ft. Myers flooding). There's a large enough contingent of the American population that have become so desperate, they're lashing out in violence on the regular. They see violence as the only solution because they have no leadership...and the few leaders they do quasi look up to, they're all corrupt.
Idiot racists and people who target Asian street gangs. Normal, law abiding people get caught in the middle. We have the same racism problems as the rest of the world, but far more firearms than most. Pretty tragic combination.
