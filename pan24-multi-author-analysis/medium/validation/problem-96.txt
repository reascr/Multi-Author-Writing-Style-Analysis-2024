Problem with the data is that we do not know if these are solely new car sales or used car sales. The data from KBB, from the article, only cites new cars which are down from the previous year by double-digits. So, I presume whomever wrote this article is omitting that the resales are up not new EV purchases.
During the gas crisis in the 1970s we saw a massive explosion in fuel efficiency, we went from 7mpg muscle cars to 30mpg econoboxes in a matter of years.
Massive economic upheaval and international conflict would not have been my preferred means to spur EV adoption, but I'm not gonna turn my nose up at it either.
Shit, if we don't hurry our butts up on sustainable energy sources that will still hold true. If we have to burn shit to create the electricity that goes into the car we didn't really solve anything.
Of course, doing any of this without immediately going after things like cruise ships is all bluster. 1 hour of cruise ship operation uses something like 850 car-lifetimes of gasoline.
