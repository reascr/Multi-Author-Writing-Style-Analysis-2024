The problem is that in too many places single family housing is the only type that can be built, there are zoning laws preventing the building of high capacity housing, there are NIMBYs who complain about the skyline and bemoan the demolition of historic parking lots, there are ordinances all over saying what can be built where and for what purposes, and the result is that the demand for housing is significantly outstripping the supply.
It made sense at the time, owning your own home was seen as a source of equity and providing economic security, after all if the shit ever hit the fan at least you could sell or mortgage your house and not be broke.
it was fine until speculative, concentrated capital stepped in. Same with middle class wages. Same with pensions. Same with manufacturing. Same with grocery store pricing.
Our love of single family homes is part of what's driving up housing prices. If one county only allows one home per acre of land, and another allows twenty homes per acre of land, all else being equal which one is going to be more expensive? The one with the restricted supply.
