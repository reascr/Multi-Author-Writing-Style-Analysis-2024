Went to a school where the girls regularly had to line up and kneel in front of the principal so they could measure if our skirts fell within 2” from our knees. All the girls that were rolling their skirts would just unroll them before they got measured and re roll them on the way back to class. If these schools honestly have that much of a problem with short skirts why don’t they just make everyone wear pants? Why even have skirts as a uniform option.
Oh and the principal of their school knew and did nothing about it, told the girls they were lying and that’s probably what discouraged them from coming out overall.
Yep, friend of mine went to a charter highschool and the male yoga teacher would literally “check” their downward dog by standing behind them and grabbing their ass.
At the time they wernt doing anything about it so I tried to by telling my school counselors and they pretty much said unless the girls come out about nothing will happen, everyone refused to come out about it and I imagine that pedophile creep is still working there.
