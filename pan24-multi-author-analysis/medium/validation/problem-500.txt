Three months but you are a wreck at the end of it and really need to eat. Water is the more important substance in this case that you can go about four days without before you start having problems.
If we miss a meal we get angry, if we can’t eat for a while we are gonna be pretty upset, sad, etc. This man, on day 23 of eating ketchup, looked at his reflection in the water and went not today motherfucker, and kept on living.
Jesus Christ that’s gnarly. I know humans can last a pretty long time without food, but I want you all to think about this for a second with me.
I know we all want to live, but after a month of eating ketchup alone on a boat? This man has something to live for.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. There’s still plenty of meat on that bone. Now you take this home, throw it in a pot, add some broth, a potato. Baby, you’ve got a stew going.
Bouillon cubes used to be in little basic survival kits, mostly because they don’t spoil and you can mix them with water. Beef or chicken normally, boil it up if you have a heat resistant cup and it gets a warm soup broth. Not huge calories but it can help in a pinch.
Yeah bouillon cubes is a generic name for all of them short for beef bouillon. They also make a chicken cube for chicken stock. Makes cooking soup easier if you don’t have time to make your own stock.
