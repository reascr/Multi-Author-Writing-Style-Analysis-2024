Article should be titled ‘Sore Losers file bullshit challenges with no evidence’. Media needs to stop sugarcoating obvious bad faith actions from GOP nuts.
Great strategy It worked so well in 2020 and based on the mid-term results people are clearly behind the fight.

Don't let the comments become political. I don't really care which party is challenging the results or counting. I think our election system should be continuously scrutinized to ensure security, accessibility, and accuracy.

You’re literally posting in a politics sub. I have no issues improving the voting process, but we have one side claiming irregularities with zero evidence; that is not good faith criticism, that is sore loserism and a lack of respect for our democratic process. Plus they offer no actual solutions, and the plans they do support actively make voting worse for many people.
