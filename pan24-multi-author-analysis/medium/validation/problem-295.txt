I'm not too hopeful for the peaceful protestors, in Syria the regime kept killing the peaceful ones until only the extremist ones were left (because duh).
Also a peaceful protestor who watches half their friends get shot by police stands a solid chance of deciding “fuck it, guess I’m a violent freedom fighter now.”.
I mean, halfway through the war we had literally hardcore Sunni fundamentalist fighters, all touting the same batshit ideology, shooting the shit out of each other AND other freedom fighters because they were backed by different countries or organizations.
This gave the loyalists much needed reprieve which allowed them to consolidate and then reinforce via the IRGC, Hizbollah and finally Russia.
Mass imprisonment and executions have been used by Russia, China, N Korea, and other nations to effectively control their country. It looks like they're banking of the making an example approach. 15K is relatively small when it comes to government mass executions, but announcing the executions vs disappearing people is relatively uncommon. If this were China, they'd publically execute 3 people and quietly execute 100K over this protest all the while claiming they champion human rights, but I guess Iran has a different culture.
Protesters have friends, family, people who weren't arrested. Finding 100K people to target for execution from 15K arrested is doable, if you want to go the Chinese route.
