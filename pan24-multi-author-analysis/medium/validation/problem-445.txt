Correction: our gouvernement supports the Oekraïne war and is self hating the own population. Is killing it by tax laws. I myself am paying 53% income tax, 75% tax on energy , 21% on groceries , gas is €2.10 per liter and so on…….
Yet, Russia's GDP is 1.7 trillion and Netherlands' is 1 trillion... and now Russia finds out that those pissed off Dutch can afford a decent amount of weaponry.
Russians shot MH17 out of the air, and Russia was insanely obnoxious about it when the Dutch didn't like the murder of their citizens.
If it was the Austrian one it would have the same bright red as the Norwegian, Lithuanian or British flags. Also you can see the Latvian flag on the right side of the picture.
You’re right about the 9% vat on groceries, my bad. Income tax is determined on income levels or boxes. The first box income to €68.508 is 37,10% , the second €69.399 is 49.50% . Then there are all kinds of taxes because I drive a company car and so on. So I work the first 4 hours of the day for the government. Yes I’m having a good income……but if you divide this by the hours I make I am not earning much more the the average income per hour. And because I have the funds to invest in solar energie on power and warm water, alternative heating , electric car. I can take advantage of the subsidies provided by the government. This is at cost of the lower incomes but I get some of my payed taxes back.
