> “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”.
I heard some"expat" living in Qatar being interviewed yesterday downplaying the migrant labor thing, talking about how happy the security guards seem. Then she talked about how hot it gets in summer and how just walking 20m from the doorway to her parked car is an exhausting ordeal, without any mental click between her ordeal in having to walk across a parking lot and the experience of people working construction jobs in that heat. Just complete self absorbed "expat" shit, like "there's a real community, people from all over the world", like yeah, no shit, you're in an expat bubble hanging out with expats.
The lack of a specific number is pretty concerning in and of itself, shows a careless disregard for life and an absolute complete lack of accountability. I mean imagine telling OSHA between 100 and 200 people died at your work sites... first of all is it 100 or 200??
That's... That's not a good defense. "Look, it's only a small fraction of foreign workers that we throw into a meat grinder with zero concern for their welfare".
They made decisions that killed hundreds of people. In most industrialized nations, there are laws on the books to hold them accountable.
