I was raised Christian around good people thanks to my beyond awesome grandpa. Once I stopped going to the church I went to (moved to the states) I full on stopped going to church. It was fucking night and day. If I was hanging around the people who were going to heaven at the churches I’ve seen in the states, I’d opt out. Luckily I get how that is gonna go for those people. They think just saying their are Christian is the key. You actually have to live like one and they don’t seem to get it. They are using a religion as a bartering tool and a weapon, which naturally means I can’t stand it. Solo worship ftw. Call out all the hypocrites you encounter. “You’re going to hell.” We aren’t supposed to judge. “Sex outside of marriage is a sin” you fucked your man in 12th grade Karen and you married him after college. “Man shall not sleep with man” that was a revision, it’s man shall not sleep with boy. If they believe everything in the book (king James and the other translated versions) without question, then they are just pawns in a crooked men’s schemes.
Tell that to the USA Congress, only the foot soldier are getting prosecuted while the top level agitators where promote to be in charge of the House in Congress.
