Apparently, it was a traditional Japanese bear hunting knife attached to a pole. They would've shot it with a rifle, but this happened in a school so maybe they wanted to avoid stray bullets.
In addition to your point I'd be surprised if animal control the Agricultural Promotion Division in Japan has quick access to firearms, especially the kind of rifle you need to safely bring down pissed off 175 pound wild boar. That may depend on the local wildlife situation though. When I lived there I remember seeing news about a problem bear that kept coming into a town in Hokkaido and they basically had a couple of designated bear hunters.
Wild boars are pretty bad-tempered animals at the best of times, and looks like it was well within a dense urban area so piggy was probably in a thoroughly angry and annoyed mood.
I can't tell if you are being sarcastic or not. It seems genuine... but it's almost like you are filling out a reddit user parody template at the same time.
Your English is fine. It's hard to explain but it's like if Germans are famous for being being on time, drinking beer, and eating sausage. If you said one of those things "I always try to be on time" it would be normal, but if you say all three in the same sentence "I like to be on time, drink beer and eat sausage". The German might wonder if you are joking around and teasing them. You just said a few very common reddit things together .
