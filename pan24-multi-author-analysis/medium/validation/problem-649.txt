These are all excellent points, but I do want to add that while we were lucky the Roe reversal was timed so poorly for the GOP, it is inevitable due to their party’s nature that they will continue to take advantage of their position and pull further attacks upon the rights of the citizens all for their own Christian nationalist extremism. There just is no curbing extremism, and once it gets power, like they do in the SCOTUS, they’ll just keep pushing.

I have a lot of misgivings about voting for a guy who would be 83 when inaugurated. It feels like some entitlement bullshit. Is there no one else in the Dem party who can run besides this old man? Seriously.
