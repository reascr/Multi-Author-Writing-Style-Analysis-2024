But i would bet more that it is a test to see how the individual NATO counties react to it, while making it look like an accident.
If war with Russia is inevitable anyways, then better get it over with. For many in the US, this might be far away, but for us in Europe, this is happening right in our neighborhood.
And it's not just Putin, there are many people in Russia who support this war, especially the elite - so just removing Putin alone would not change much.
I mean, what is the alternative, if they now just keep firing missiles into all of Ukraine, and some inevitably hitting into Polish territory?
That cannot be tolerated in my opinion. The least aggressive pathway would be installing air defense against all kinds of missiles all over the eastern border of NATO (and honestly, I'm baffled as to why this isn't already done).
So many people frothing at the mouth for Article 5 to be enacted and for NATO to go to war with Russia. I don’t think they understand “WW3” is the end of life on earth as we know it. As soon as nuclear weapons start flying, it’s pretty much the end for all of us.
The loss of life in Poland is tragic, but ending civilization in a nuclear holocaust over this seems like a shitty solution.
Beef up the weapons and supplies to Ukraine, give them weapons and tech we have been holding back on.
