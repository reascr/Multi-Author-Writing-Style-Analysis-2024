curious, if they weren't so corrupt how much of it they could have maintained. Either way the Artillery is still going a year later and a bit worried if they manage to start ramping production.
I used to be a technician for the army decades ago. My company's main task was to maintain about 250 armored vehicles built in the 1960s.
Each vehicle was sealed in large oxygen-less bags to preserve them. Every vehicle had to be unsealed every 2 years to be tested and inspected. Any broken parts will be repaired or replaced before the vehicle is sealed up again.
This was a full time job for a company's worth of mechanics and technicians. And my unit had been doing this for at least 30 years. Most vehicles that come out of the bag just need minor fixes before they are ready for use in the field. So I'd say if they were well maintained, there shouldn't be any major issues having 90-95% of the vehicles operational in a short amount of time.
In an ideal world, yes things likely won't break. Most of the time its usually just minor things like rubber seals and hoses, plastic coatings naturally breaking down over time. Things just need lubrication before they start working.
What parts would break during oxygen free storage? Seems odd that if they get stuffed into a garage in an oxygen free bag, anything that wasnâ€™t broke when going in could be broke on the out.
A vehicle might have been accidentally left in the rain and water pooled in an area we couldn't see. Since water is part hydrogen and part oxygen, that meant corrosion can still happen in the two year period.
However, this is the real world. All sorts of weird and statistically low or even outright impossible things can happen.
Sometimes, the sealing bags failed. Seams get broken. Driving the multi-tonne vehicle a little too roughly over the bag might have caused a tear. A bit of metal sticking out from vehicle might poke a small hole in the bag (Seen it happen once or twice with an antenna stub or a weapon mount). Wild animals, even rats, can somehow bite through the thick bag material.
We have a machine hooked up to the bag that routinely pump stuff into the bag to maintain the atmosphere inside. If the hole is small enough to not cause a significant pressure drop, no alerts are triggered but oxygen could still leak in and wreck random havoc. Once, we were alerted of a bag with low pressure failure and we found a dog had somehow made a meter-wide gash in the bag. She had given birth to puppies under the vehicle.
Then there are freak accidents. One vehicle was destroyed and two adjacent vehicles had significant damage when a bolt of lightning punched through the roof of the warehouse to strike the vehicle. I guess the chemicals used to maintain the oxygen-less atmosphere also somehow caused the accumulation of static electricity? Who knows. All I know is that was the first time I saw the vehicle's inch and a half thick top armor plating bent open and torn off the vehicle along the weld lines.
There was one year, when almost every vehicle we opened had the same fault - the protective coating around a flexible cord all became rigid and fell apart on contact, exposing the wires inside. That turned out to be an unexpected manufacturer defect that required finding a replacement material. This was beyond my paygrade, so I don't know the exact details but I heard it was a several year project trying to find a replacement that a company was willing to commit to manufacturing small quantities of for many decades.
Luckily the bloke who was trying to do something about the corruption and "more than me jobs worth, mate" culture of Russia's military was fired and replaced by the current time server.
