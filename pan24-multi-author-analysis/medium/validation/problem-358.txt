Thanks. It's Sunday so I'll put aside some time today to read up more on Brazil. I just have a very top level knowledge, but always found the place fascinating.
wow just saw thatâ€™s from 7 years ago. I think about it often. It really is interesting just how dumb money is.
I don't follow Brazil closely, but this seems like encouraging news. Brazil has the resources to be a major economic power but it always seems to go haywife.
From what little I know, Brazil could be a major player in every industry. As a yank, all I can think of is like Venezuela, corruption in politics has been institutionalized. It's a disease that is hard to get rid of. I would love to see Brazil kicking ass again.
Corruption in politics is definitely spreading here in the US as well. It's always been present, and anyone who thinks otherwise hasn't been paying attention. But it's just growing at such an alarming rate now as regulatory capture has been rammed down our throats by the GOP and their uber-rich financiers. It almost feels like it's illegal in the US to prosecute embezzlement, tax evasion, or libel - so long as the person doing those things is rich.
