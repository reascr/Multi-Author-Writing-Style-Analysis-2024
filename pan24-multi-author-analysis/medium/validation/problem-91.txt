A lot of European countries have strict rules regarding what’s allowed as swimwear. I’ve noticed in the US, people can generally wear whatever tf they want in pools including diapers (🤮 ). Even the showers are optional. In Europe, there’s a much bigger expectation that you don’t contribute to dirtying the pool water including showering before entering and wearing clothes meant solely for swimming and nothing else and the backlash with Burkhinis isn’t that they’re Muslim, but that being Muslim shouldn’t justify making an exception in the rules that everyone else follows. Europe is a big place and not every place does this and I’m sure some people use this reasoning to hide their bigotry but I’m just pointing out that it’s a more complex issue involving local customs and religious requirements and not just “Muslims bad.”.
Mate I’m probably up there with most anti-religious person on this site but this is the dumbest far fetched take there is. No one in Switzerland is voting to make a religious garb mandatory.
It’s not unknowable. It’s obvious. Switzerland is not a Muslim country and will never be majority. Theocracies need a majority or a power base and they have neither there.
