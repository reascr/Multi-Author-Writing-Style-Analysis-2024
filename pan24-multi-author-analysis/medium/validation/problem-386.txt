Given that Republicans have a razor thin majority they will struggle to do anything because any single faction of the GOP House can and will torpedo the first thing that they don't like. The Freedom Caucus is going to be a rock around the neck of the House GOP because they absolutely will not give even a single inch if it means giving any other faction within the party a win.
This is to say nothing of the fact that the House will have scheduled and unscheduled departures on the Republican side due to retirements, death, and indictments. The first departure is going to cause utter chaos within the Republican party.
