Florida starts their election 10+ days before election day AND they count their votes as they receive them (those votes are REQUIRED to be counted and tabulated prior to election day). Many of us just do early voting (not ballot drop off).
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This is why I post my ballot or drop it off at least a week before election day. This year I received my ballot on 10/14, it was in the mail by 10/15, received and signature verified by 10/18.
I didn't return mine that quickly, but it was signature verified on 11/2, and then counted in a batch on 11/4.
Early ballots must arrive before polls close at 7pm on election day, whether by mail or being dropped off in person.
Arizona counts early ballots as they're received too. And early voting here starts Oct 12th. But the counting of early ballots isn't completed prior to election day, and unlike Florida, there isn't a requirement for it to be.
County elections departments in Arizona post lists of what ballot batch is counted when. Looking at the one for Pima County, early ballots that arrived up to a week prior may still have taken until election day to get counted.
Florida put resources in place that help to count ballots faster. Ballot envelope scanners, machines to open envelopes, etc.
Dropping off mail ballots on election day in Arizona would require an update in the law to change. So would a deadline like Florida has to finish counting early ballots returned before election day.
But there are other completely nonpartisan things Arizona could do, like other states have, that wouldn't require a change in the law. They would just require more $$.
