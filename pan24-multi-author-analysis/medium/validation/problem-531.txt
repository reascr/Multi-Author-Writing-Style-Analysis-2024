If you were all wondering like i did how Russia got more ships into the Black Sea for the “sudden surge” to occur ….
This was observed prior to large scale missle attacks from the sea. Another possibility mentioned was that RU could have Intel on another UA drone attack like the one that occurred in Sevastopol last year and are clearing the base.
There's plenty of click bait nonsense out there, but this article isn't in that category. Read the article, it's pretty insightful.
The article doesn't mention anything related to the Bosphorus. Just that the Russians deployed a large number of ships from their ports in an unusual way.
The phrase “sudden surge” in the Black Sea, sounded to me like these are “new ships and submarines” entering the Black Sea.
I wasn’t saying the article was click bait, just that the title made me initially think of a different scenario.
I assume, since it's been a few weeks since the last massive missile attack, that Russia has been tracking down the last few operable missiles from their stockpile, and then added the 10 or 15 they were able to build since then.
