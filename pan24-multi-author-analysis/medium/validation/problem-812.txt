So Japan, Australia and USA included India in Quad to oppose China. India needed that badly, they needed some soft power, but now they're back tracking and siding with Russia and in turn China? China will fuck India up, no matter how much they coddle to it. With Russia's economy in dire straits, it's not a country to side with. How incompetent your foreign policy can be?
And how exactly is India colluding with China? Like, I must know how hoops your mind jumped through while reading that article, to come to such a conclusion.
Increasing trade with Russia is more to the Chinese detriment. If China were to be the supermajority consumer of Russian resources, then there is no doubt that by that point, Russia would have forgone every bit of its economic autonomy.
Only Indian nationalistic dumbasses think Russia will any longer come to the aid of India in a Sino-Indian conflict. And only western simpleminded blabbermouths would be sure that Russia would ever give up its strategic relations with both countries to try and intervene militarily. Also, both India and China have made it clear that what happens between them, remains between them. At best they'll try to slink in diplomatic support, but nothing more.
"How incompetent can your foreign policy be". Mate, there are smarter and better-informed people than you who handle these tasks. That's how they got their jobs for goodness sake.
