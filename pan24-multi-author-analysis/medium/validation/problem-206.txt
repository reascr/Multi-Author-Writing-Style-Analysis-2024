If McCarthy can't find 218 votes, he can't be speaker. If he needs to ask Dems for their support, I can't wait to see what they want in return...

"Hey Nancy old buddy old pal, how's it going? Hey, crazy question, but would you be willing to support my bid for speaker?
What do you mean I called you all kinds of crazy things? What do you mean I am responsible for an attempted coup? I only pretend to carry water for putin I was only joking when I said that about Biden I do too want to help the American people, I just refused to vote for any of the dem bills as a joke!
OTOH, Nancy is way more pragmatic than me. Her conversations would probably include questions like "What's in it for me?" Then she'd put them all in a list, and pick the one that offers the most or asks the least.
While I enjoy imagining it, it doesn't seem all that likely. All the reasonable ones voted to impeach Trump and got primaried out.
To give Trump credit: People have (abruptly) become much more familiar with how our government works since he became president. Who knew there were so many obscure quirks?
Just because they are out doesn't mean they can't be elected speaker. You don't have to be a house member for that (which is why people keep floating Trump's name).
Still, I can easily picture Republicans bickering to the point where Democrats have to step up or nothing at all will get accomplished. We've got a country to run, after all.
That said, I'm not sure who they'd be willing to sell out their party for. Depends on who's doing the selling I spose.
It's true that the Speaker doesn't have to be a member of the House, but do you know how often that has happened?
Speaker is a powerful position, quite aside from being 3rd in line to the presidency. Giving that away to an 'outsider' isn't going to be a popular option among those who have sought (and achieved) power.
Plus the "5 or so moderates" might have candidates of their own in mind as the price for their apostasy, and Liz's name isn't going to be viewed favorably by their supporters back home.
And while Liz's name is viewed positively by many on the left outside of Washinon, I'm not sure how many friends she really has in the House. Getting 100% of Dems to vote for her may not be as easy as all that.
From a more pragmatic point of view: While Liz has shown that she's very anti-Trump and pro-democracy, she's a very hard-core conservative. So even if it could be made to work, why would the Dems want to do it? What would they get in return besides "not McCarthy?".
I do think that House Dems should be floating variations of this idea to their Republican fellows though. Who knows? They may hit upon a name that both sides can agree upon.
Ultimately he may be the one turning to the Dems seeking their support. For which the Dems will surely make him pay through the nose.
Besides, making people consider alternatives (and seek profit for themselves) will make McCarthy's life hell, a worthy goal all by itself. Heck, if the split is as close as I'm hoping, McCarthy is going to have to mortgage his soul for every bill for the next 2 years or nothing will ever get done.
PS While it's about as likely as Liz getting the position, it's not impossible that Pelosi could end up speaker again. That lady does know how to craft a deal and she knows where all the bodies are buried (having buried a number herself). And the benefits she could bring to the negotiations with "the 5" are not trivial:
