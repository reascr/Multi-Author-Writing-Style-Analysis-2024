Suicide Hotline Pro Tip: The hospital is going to assume the worst, so they'll take your shoelaces and belt as a precaution. Wear slippers and pants/shorts with a stretchy waistband.
This .... 100x this. It's so easy to lose someone forever over an impulsive decision. No matter how bad things seem, please pick up the phone and talk. There are better ways to get out of a bad situation.
When I called, they asked me if I wanted an ambulance, someone to talk to in person, or just talk on the phone. I asked for someone to come over, and two people from a local suicide prevention center (behind the Taco Bell around the corner - I had no idea) came and talked with me. They didn't pressure me or anything like that. They just wanted to assist me with whatever option I choose.

He is one of the slimy politicians I have ever seen. He will literally say anything or take any side as long as it keeps him in power. When Trump talked shit about his wife and he still kissed his ass if made me want to fucking puke. Cruz has no spine.
It was nice to not see ANY negative posts on Twitter from people who hate Cruz regarding his daughter. I guess that is the way that people who are civilized act in a situation like this.
They took me to the local hospital and made sure that I was admitted and under the hospital's care before they left. Good people.
There was a large bill at the end, but I showed them my bank balance and they forgave the whole thing.
