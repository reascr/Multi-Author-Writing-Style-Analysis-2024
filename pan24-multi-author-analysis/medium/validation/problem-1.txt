They were so very lucky the capital Police didnt use their weapons Police have the right to defend themselves, and its illegal to put your hands or objects on a police officer. The police defended as patriotic Heroes. The one person whom was shot was intentionally breaking the LAW and with treats to the lives inside the building. Our LAWS will be followed. Our Police will never be hurt by mini maga extremists again. That Mother did not teach about the meaning and consequences of brainwashing, so i am only am sad about a death not the reason for that death which is justified by the majority of the people. i feel sorry for her and now especially that those mini magas have influenced mom as well. It will be over soon, magas are a small number of brainwashed certain area people whom are easily influenced. and many grow older by the day. BYE BYE evil.
