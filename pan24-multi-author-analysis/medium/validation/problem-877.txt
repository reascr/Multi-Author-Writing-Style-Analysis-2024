-Wagenknecht has called for the dissolution of NATO and for a new security agreement that links Germany and Russia. Throughout her career, Wagenknecht has argued in favor of a closer relationship with Russia; in 1992, she penned an essay praising Stalinist Russia.
-In the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Wagenknecht was a prominent defender of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, arguing on February 20, 2022 that while the United States was trying to "conjure up" an invasion of Ukraine, "“Russia has in fact no interest to march into Ukraine.”.
-Wagenknecht opposed sanctions against Russia over the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and, in a speech in September 2022, accused the German government of "launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier".
Most germans would probably agree that lady is thoughly fcked in the head and might just destroy what was left of "Die Linke" (far left party) all by her lonesome. Her views are extremely niche and she personally started essentially having a mental breakdown in public. since covid started her deterioation in rational thought has become especially alarming. I can just hope for her own sake that she will retire soon. So we can stop listening to her utterly mind-rotten ideas and her party colleagues, many of which are actually still sane despite her, can take over the spotlight.
