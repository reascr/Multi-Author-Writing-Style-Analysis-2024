Highly doubt this comes out to be true. India would officially take the Russian side, and not just Russia, Iran as well, which makes it way worse, and sanctions would absolutely cripple them. As much as Indians want to claim, we really are not as self sufficient, and there’s only so much tiptoeing you can go about before you’re hit by sanctions. So I’m holding my reservations, and I hope this doesn’t happen, but what do ik.
Note also- how i keep saying US corporations. Because in the end, every single legislation in the US is backed by corporate lobbying- who look for shareholder interests .
Everything can be exempted from sanctions. Thats just the way the US works. They lay out blanket sanctions and then selectively give exemptions based on their own national interests- which here overlaps with India’s national interest.
US corporations are looking to shift manufacturing away from China and into India/Vietnam etc. Guess where will India get the raw materials to support those giant manufacturing complexes?
US corporations will also benefit from a general rising of middle class in India. They are already locked out of the Chinese market. Who will they sell their shit to ? Where will their next billion dollar growth come from ? Which means that the Indian economy , as a whole, has to be helped to grow and grow. So that it can keep consuming Western products.
I mean I can definitely see that happen, but I can't see India jumping off the rope they've been walking on. They're tiptoeing as it is, I highly doubt they'll make it this obvious. Plus, after what's happened with Russia, India wouldn't wanna risk it so soon. India still hasn't gotten a share out of China's pie in manufacturing, they're making strides. It would just mess the situation up far more imo.
Try getting your Congress to act on it then. Let us know how it goes . They just narrowly elected a House Speaker. Sth tells me that your 118th House wont be passing any significant legislations anytime soon.
Exactly, we're making strides, but we aren't even competing with China at the level many want to claim. A lot of IT and software industry work is still not product oriented, atleast not as much as service. So yeah I highly doubt India would agree to this, it seems they aren't going behind cheap oil atm.
I am just giving an example- i am noy a diplomat- but the idea that sanctions apply to everyone the same way is unfounded since US ( and the West) are known to put exemptions for every sanction they dole out.
Yeah because Americans make ignorant statements like you did , only on Reddit , when they are in between their second or third McDonald’s meal of the day.
