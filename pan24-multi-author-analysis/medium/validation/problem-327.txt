Fear mongering, populism, fake news and divisive politics. Exactly the elements that brought you Trump and Brexit. Additionally, since Israel is a parliamentary democracy, meaning that the prime minister is the person who can form a coalition from the multitude of parties, unlike in the US where it's only two parties, Bibi was willing, unlike his adversaries, to pretty much sell out the country for sectoral parties with exorbitant demands to benefit their own sectors on the expense of everyone else (eg, orthodox parties). Despite all of the above, he lost the previous elections and was close to losing this one, mainly won due to bad organization of the opposing bloc. While his party is the biggest and he is immensely popular the same way Trump is (ie personality cult), there is a very significant opposition to him across the political spectrum.
To be fair Israel is becoming a text book example of fascism, it’s not all the way there yet but it’s definitely heading that direction. the way Israel treats Palestinians is awfully reminiscent of how other fascist governments treated marginalized groups that they used as a scape goat.
