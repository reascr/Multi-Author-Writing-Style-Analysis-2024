It’s so crazy to me that the Iranian revolution which fought to end a government that didn’t reflect its he interests of its populace through violence and incarceration…has now reduced itself to being exactly like that government.
Khomeini was arrested and exiled; and now the man he appointed to succeed him supports the same practices against others including his niece. There is something to be learned by all including governments by reading chapter 76 of Tao Te Ching, that being open to flexibility and change as a person or organization allows you to live on while being rigid leads you towards eventual death. The government of Iran can survive if it allows for change reflecting and protecting the will of its people; or eventually it and the nation will decline and die….and the efforts of the 1979 revolution will have been in vain.
It’s honestly much worse than the previous government. All of the issues from 1979 still exist: lack of political freedom, lack of artistic freedom, no free press, mandatory hijab… which is basically just the same but opposite of the Shahs idea to ban hijab, political violence and repression. They’re just worse now because this government is more evil than Pahlavi’s.
It’s why I fear another person coming in and making themselves the “figurehead” of the revolution the same way Khomeini did when he was in France.
It’s just silly that a government installed by a citizen revolution…is blind to citizens demonstrating peacefully and then it discredits itself further by a crackdown employing murder and sexual assault as a tool of oppression.
He came in, co-opted the revolution and lied to everyone: to Iranians, to world leaders, everyone - and then utilized the US hostage crisis to really seize control and move more progressive minds out of government. And later into prisons to face execution. It was a hijacked revolution in the end.
Mahsa Amini & the other kids martyred for freedom should be the face of our revolution. They lost their lives for… nothing really… and then there’s no danger of any cult of personality, where someone shady comes in and tells people what they want to hear until they have their opportunity to fuck us all again.
It’s funny how these citizens revolutions to overthrow oppression often end-up with a oppressor who’s oppressed things that are different than the last.
Iran straight giving reasons everyday to get overthrown. It's like the Ayatollah and his crew forgot how they came into power. Gun powder can't kill everybody.
And that's where they REALLY messed up. The Chinese disappear people, but make em be nice when they call home. It is ALL THE WAY MESSED UP what they've done to the Uyghurs, but as far as oppression goes, they're the best at using it to keep people quiet.
