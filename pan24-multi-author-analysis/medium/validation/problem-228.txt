They aren't very clear on how far this goes. Its illegal to smoke on beaches and parks here in Canada, at least in the city where I live, Ottawa. There is no law against smoking on the sidewalk, but you can't smoke within 9 metres of a bus stop or a bunch of other publicly owned facilities. You can't smoke on outdoor restaurant patios.
The article really doesn't give much detail on how it will be enforced and exactly what the restrictions are.
I was just wondering that too and I don't think so. The wiki says the maternity ward but says it was just their suite (in the ward?) that was declared extraterritorial:
>Before she gave birth to Princess Margriet, the federal government declared their four-room hospital suite to be temporarily ‘extraterritorial,’ ensuring that the new princess would only have Dutch citizenship, which is passed through the parents, and not also Canadian citizenship, which is given to anyone born on Canadian soil.
I remember making a rollie after a gig my first trip to Germany (from Ireland) and a woman very pointedly tells me I can't smoke inside which I thought went without saying, I was just making it.
