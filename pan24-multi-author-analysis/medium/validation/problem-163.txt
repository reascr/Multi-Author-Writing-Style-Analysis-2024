A lot of Fox News’ revenue comes from the fact that it is bundled in most cable packages as “basic cable.” So if you subscribe to a cable service, you are bankrolling Fox News even if you don’t watch it. It’s fair to criticize Hulu on this one, since it’s a similar idea.

People forget.. Disney said they support their employees in the Don't Say Gay debate. Desantis didn't say anything.
But then Disney said they were stopping political donations and Desantis blew up over that.. no one screws with his kickbacks!
They don't own Fox News, though. They own 20th Century FOX, but FOX News is a separate entity under the FOX Corporation that's still chaired by Rupert Murdoch.
