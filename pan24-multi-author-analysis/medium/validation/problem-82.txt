I don't know how it is in the Netherlands, but in Germany, if that demo has been forbidden after registering, it's a felony.
Blocking the roads is illegal, making the protest illegal. Wether you agree with it or not, the judge is upholding the law. It has nothing to do with freedom of speech.
That has been like this for years and has happened quite a few times. Also, Demos are not forbidden because of political reasons (a judge would be removed from office immediately), but because it's a hazard that can't be controlled ,the police has not enough people or other reasons like that...
I don't know why you think lawfulness is at odds with dystopian. There's plenty of fucked up, immoral laws around, coincidentally they protect the genocidal oligarchs.
1 a term of imprisonment not exceeding nine years or a fine of the fifth category, if this is likely to endanger the safety of traffic;.
2 a term of imprisonment not exceeding fifteen years or a fine of the fifth category, if this is likely to endanger the safety of traffic and the act results in the death of someone.
That's why all those Friesian racists were arrested when they blocked the road to stop the bus filled with people going to protest against the racist Black Piet, right? Right?
I’m not ok with farmers doing it and I’m not ok with climate protestors doing it. And it’s certainly not something that should be normalised.
While blocking highways is not as bad as murder or terrorism, it’s still considered a major offense in most countries. But I’m sure that in this case the circumstances will be taken into account and these people won’t face any serious punishment.
And I agree, the government is clearly not treating farmers and climate protestors equally but that still doesn’t have anything to do with the point I’m trying to make here.
If you were openly conspiring to do something illegal in the US and tried using social media to recruit people to help you, you’d also get a knock on the door.
And most of us are sick of people blocking our infrastructure for their protests. So don’t try to speak for us.
I’m just giving the reason why they were arrested. It doesn’t really effect me because I don’t live in The Hague and don’t even have a car. But personally I don’t think protestors should block roads for any reason.
Oh, fuck off, I was only giving the reason why they were arrested. It doesn’t even matter what you think. As it turns out, Inciting people to do something that is illegal is also illegal by itself.
Blocking roads not only inconveniences people, it also endangers them. We either allow all protestors to block roads or we allow none. I’m going for the latter.
