I'm here in tinajin, so like 100km from Beijing and honestly it's gone mad, everyone now has covid. Pretty mild symptoms but you can't even get a delivery driver for shopping. We went to 3 septate restaurants this evening and everone was closed because lack of staff.
crazy, in my country I haven't heard anything about covid for a year, it has completely disappeared from everyday life.
We have only just moved to China and it has been like living in a different world, we get asked alot by Chinese nationals about how many people are dying outside china and if it's true that we don't have any covid controls anymore.
Now Xi can claim to be the adult who tried to protect the protestors, but they didn't listen and got into trouble. Of course CCP is also saying no deaths at all.
It blows me away how insanely effective the vaccines have been in the US. Cases have stuck to 25/100,000 since March after the massive omicron spike. People are still occasionally getting it, but it's mild symptoms where they just stay home a few days.
Have you lived here or visited? It's really not what people think. The people are nice, the rules are well followed but its mostly the same as anywhere else I have lived.
We have only been here since August. We came, it shut down a little bit, no lock ins just mass city wide testing. The same test and go stuff and the qr code check in everywhere. But now, there is nothing, I have been and tested at the booths this Monday and Tuesday and I still don't have the results on the app which makes it completely useless, that being said you now don't need it to do anything. The school provided us with rapid lateral flow tests. My wife and I are triple vaccinated and have both had it before so we don't really care about it's spread ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
