I lived in a trapezoid shaped apartment and had 18 square meters and no hot water in Barcelona. Shit is fucked in the cities and the city is so goddamn corrupt it refuses to kick out squatters and clamp down on illegal shit.
I lived in an 25m² apartment for a little over a year. Together with a girlfriend aswell. It had some issues that you kind of got used to manage, constant cleaning was needed, way more than a larger apartment.
As they should. 18 square meters is an absolute disgrace and it definitely shouldn't be called an "apartment". That's roughly twice the space of a 1 star hotel room for 1 person. Developers are free to join two such constructions into one if they want these to be certified.
Edit: apparently you cant just take 25 meters and directly convert that to feet. Oops. I should have said 5m by 5m is roughly 16 feet by 16 feet - which is actually a decent size.
I just assumed it at this level the bathroom and kitchen would have to be in shared space and not in the rooms themselves. But yeah, if those have to be in hat 10x8 then it’s even worse than I thought.
