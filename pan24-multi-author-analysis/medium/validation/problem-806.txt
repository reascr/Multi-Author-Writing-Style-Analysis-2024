The Russian Orthodox church has been working on fostering relations with Evangelical churches since the 80s. Anyone studying Russian corruption and the link with the GOP takes a good look at the religious link. They get along on a lot of points like bigotry.
I think it has become common for the Kremlin to blame others/the West for what the Russian ruling elite is practicing itself.
Andrei Kordochkin is an Orthodox priest now based in Madrid who was one of 300 priests who previously signed an open letter urging authorities to end the "fratricidal war" in Ukraine.
Kordochkin told the Moscow Times that Russian officials are repeating similar language as that used during the Middle Ages, which Pope Urban referenced to bless the Crusades.
This is a huge thing in "New Life", "Vinyard", and various other Pentacostal offshoots. Funny thing is; every single one of these churches I'm familiar with, has a recent (last 10 year) scandal of youth pastors fucking kids, or worship leaders fucking parishoners (male and female).
