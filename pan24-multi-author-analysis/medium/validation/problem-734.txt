Yep, this is a scheme that is the origin of the current 9-justice composition of the court. There were 9 circuits so therefore 9 justices. Of course, the fact that there are now 11 circuits, plus the DC and Federal circuits kinda makes it seem like we need to have more justices. Weird how no one in the government seems to agree with that.

Amusingly, Thomas has the smallest assignment out of all of them. He only has one circuit and it only has three states in it, and I am SURE that its totally coincidental that those states have been at the center of virtually every election related piece of court malfeasance: Alabama, Florida, Georgia.
Adding some additional rules like a 75 vote confirmation requirement and rules like "the Garland rule" which is a time limit on the Senate for voting on a nominee. If the nominee isn't voted on by the full senate within 3 months of being nominated he is automatically approved. Another necessary rule is the 2 strikes rule. If two nominees get shot down by the senate, then a randomly selected judge from the next lower court in the same party as the president is automatically promoted.
We need to expand the judiciary 3 fold across the board. The SCOTUS should have 28 justices, yes twenty eight. There should be 4 courts of 7 and the makeup of each court should be randomly selected from the pool of 28 at the start of each annual term. This will help prevent gaming the court because you never know who will be in which court or which of the four courts your case will end up in.
As I mentioned at the beginning, all lower courts need to be expanded in order to be able to deal with the increased caseload.
