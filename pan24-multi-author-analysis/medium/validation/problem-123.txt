>Well, Dem early vote has come in better than NV in AZ, GA, MI, MN, IA, IN, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TX, VA, WA, WI? (D share vs 20).
Virginia's 2nd District: Luria (D-incumbent) vs Kiggans (R) - It's a toss up, so if Luria wins, it's good news for dems. If Luria loses outright, it is a bad sign. If it's too close to call for a good chunk of the night, then things are going about as expected.
Virginia's 7th District: Spanberger (D-incumbent) vs Vega (R) - This is a +6 Biden district and Spanberger should win the race. If she loses, it's likely going to be a bad night for Dems. If it's too close to call, then that's also not a great sign. If she wins, things are looking okay for Dems.
New York's 17th District: Sean Patrick Maloney (D-incumbent) vs Lawler (R) - Sean Patrick Maloney is the chair of the House Democrats campaign arm and is unexpectedly facing a pretty close race. It's a toss up right now. If he hangs on to his seat, that's a great sign for Democrats.
Illinois' 17th Disctrict: Sorenson (D) vs King (R) - It's a blue state and after redistricting, it's a +8 Biden district. If Republicans pick it up, then expect a good night for them.
Michigan Governor's Race: Whitmer (D-incumbent) vs Dixon (R) - Whitmer is expected to win this race, which should bode well for down ballot candidates. Keep an eye out for how close it is though; if it's in the low single digits, then that suggests a better night than anticipated for Republicans.
Watch Miami-Dade County in Florida. If it stays blue, that's a good sign. If it goes red, that would be the first time in decades. The margin is important.
