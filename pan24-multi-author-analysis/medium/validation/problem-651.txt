Funny that so many local cars in NYC where I live are registered in Florida for the lower insurance. To whom in Florida shall New York State send the bill?
When I first moved to Florida (a while back) they had this “impact fee” for out of state cars. It was like $300+ per car to register. It was, in every sense, a tax on people (northerners) moving to Florida. It was deemed unconstitutional a few years later and we got refunds (which was nice).

There's generally an office for unclaimed funds in most states. Might be worth doing a search for you on there. Got a long-unclaimed safety deposit back like 5 years after the fact once.
