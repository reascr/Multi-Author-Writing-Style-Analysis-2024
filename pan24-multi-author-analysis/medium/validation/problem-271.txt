I'm in the UK and would LOVE to go electric. But the government insists on letting the private sector lead on infrastructure growth with fuck all meaningful incentives, and the private sector is slacking because not many people are choosing to buy electric cars. As a result, many people are putting off buying them.
I travel a lot for work. A LOT, all over the country. In some areas, I'm going to be fine. But if I get sent up to the lake district, many areas of Wales or frankly nearly anywhere north of Manchester, I feel like I'd be rolling the dice.
Actually getting hold of an electric car isn't really a problem. Like you said, there are incentives. It's the supporting infrastructure that's the problem.
Petrol stations are, understandably, everywhere. You're rarely stuck for finding somewhere to refill the car.
Electric charging stations are patchy. Some areas are immensely well populated, others are... not. You don't want to feel like you're dancing with the devil when you're running low.
That said, the government need to commit more support for EV charging, private companies will not invest too quickly as they won't get money back quickly enough. The government need to do more to incentivise roll out.
I think it makes a big difference if you opt for a Tesla vs another brand as you have a lot more options.
I rented a Tesla in the UK and did a road trip from Cheshire to the Isle of Skye, which ended up taking about 12 hours due to traffic and having to stop. There are ways of making it work pretty much anywhere. When I arrived at the AirBnb I charged using a standard household outdoor socked the owner used for plugging his lawnmower in and gave him some money for the electricity. It worked fantastically well.
