Our border with Russia is 1344 km long, which makes this issue quite difficult. The war is of course possible. On the other hand Finland and Russia have such a long tradition of "friendship" policy, that it might help even in this situation right now, when the Russian-Finnish relationship is freezingly cold. It is really at the lowest level since 1920's. That's like a total U-turn compared to previous. But still the history of our relationship might help us to prevent the war.
It might take years to get us in. In Finland we feel though, that we are relatively well prepared for the war. Finland is buying huge amounts of weapons right now. Deals worth of billions have been made during the past half a year. And Finland's already existing weapon storages are huge. They say that all Finland's weapons put to a one train would make the train over thousand kilometers long.
On the other hand we have one of the most successful welfare states in the whole world. If the war some day appears, the welfare state might vanish. I personally believe that Finland and Russia will avoid full scale war.
I believe they'll avoid full scale war with Finland because they won't have anything left to invade it with. Tanks, AF, all disappeared at the hands of Ukraine. Slava ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.
