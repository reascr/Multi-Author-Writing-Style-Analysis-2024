Saudi Arabia tried to influence our midterm elections with the timing on their announcement of the cut in oil production. They were trying to boost a possible red wave because Dems had dared to talk about the Saudis many human rights abuses. They essentially took a shot at the king, and they missed. Yet the Biden admin's response is to do nothing about it?
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The Saudis don't give a damn about that. They were just looking out for their own economy, which is petrol based and would be damaged by low oil prices. Which is also why Biden didn't actually do anything, because he knew it as well as I do.
That such an absurdly illogical argument is being parroted as fact is a great argument against freedom of speech.
If you consider permitting Chevron t9 import Venezuelan oil and limiting our dependence on Saudi oil nothing.
Not 5o mention the price cap on Russian oil. Any increase in production eases dependence on Saudi oil.
Not for their egos, but because pro Iran Houthi militias overthrew the government and waged a brutal civil war against the former government. Since the Saudis hate the Iranian government and were allies of the previous Yemeni government, they intervened.....and got their butts kicked for the same reasons Russia did.
So we helped them bomb the Houthis to dislodge a government that is friendly to Iran, because we aren't fond of the Iranian regime either.
