There is this thing called history. Territorial boundaries are easy, but cultural boundaries are not. Lots of places in Europe have cultures that overlap territorial boundaries. The Crimea and Ukraine are just one.
The majority are unlikely to be illegal occupants, but culturally they made identify and side with Russia. When the Ukraine left the Soviet Union they were likely considered countrymen, but now they may not be and may be considered a threat.
In Czechia for example, many of the Germany speaking Czechs migrated to Austria then eventually to the US. While Austria was a more hospitable place, the drums of war and lack of opportunity pushed them out.
We just have to be more aware of cultural boundaries and make accommodations for differing cultures within territorial boundaries. We do that and we can end a lot of unnecessary war.
No need to apologize. The real problem is gonna be those families that were there before invasion that ended up getting Russian/separatist citizenship and decide to stay when Ukrainian government takes back all of Ukraine.
Ukraine has several areas where the land was occupied by people that identified as Russian and use Russian as their primary language. It's been that way for hundreds of years. That isn't a justification for invasion by Putin nor annexation.
