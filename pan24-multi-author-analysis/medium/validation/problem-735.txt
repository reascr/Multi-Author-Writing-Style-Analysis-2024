Wait so these big sprawling highway networks that we plowed under farmland for and build suburban one off housing all over the place using is stupidly expensive to keep maintaining? Well by all means, I’m sure since you pride your citizens on their civic pride they will surely pay tax by a largeish increase to property, and other local taxes. This is the question people, why are we not consolidating resources for important things like healthcare, childcare instead of expanding roads even further.
It’s actually because we collect road taxes through gas sales, so if we go all electric people won’t be paying their part for the roads if they don’t change how that is collected. You can’t tax something else like tires, because people can just go out of state every 50k miles.
That makes sense only if they are evening out the average. Meaning that they have found that the average person pays $300 in tax from filling up their gas tank. Google says the average driver uses about 650 gallons a year. Tn charges 27.4 cents per gallon. So, approximately $178 dollars a year in tax per person earned through a gas tax. They want to up the electric tax to $300. So, unless TN drivers have a much higher average usage, or google is wrong, they're overcharging electric car users by approximately $122 a year.
I broke it down elsewhere, but according to google the average person buys 650 gallons of gas a year. So, at 27.4 cents per gallon they will be paying $178 a year in gas taxes. Tn is increasing the charge for EV drivers to $300, which is $122 more than what the average person driving a gas vehicle is paying.
So, unless TN drivers are well above the average, it seems that they're certain punishing EV drivers with a heavier tax burden. Also, I've seen some indication that the 650 per person is high. If that's the case, then the increase is even less warranted and an even more egregious punishment.
