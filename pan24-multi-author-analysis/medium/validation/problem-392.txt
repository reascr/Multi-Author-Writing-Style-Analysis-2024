It's a moot point though isn't it? If the Russian missiles were not fired at Ukraine then this would not have happened.
So while we obviously don't have a case for article 5, the moral blame for the two Polish deaths (and the terror that it's brought to eastern Poland) is squarely on the doorstep of the Russian federation.
They repeatedly repeat the russian claims it's proof that ukraine is trying to manipulate nato into war with russia.
but there are countless other media reporting that there is some speculation from Poland that it was a Russian missle, but even more other nations that are leaning towards it was an Ukrainian missle that was trying to shoot down a russian missle.
jpost, at least, did end the article that this is an ongoing incident with more information to come.
It's insane how many news networks have dogpiled on to the original associated press article that only mentioned 3 anonymous sources, and even those 3 sources weren't as confident as the editorialized headlines suggest.
