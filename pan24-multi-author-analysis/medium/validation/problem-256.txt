Except it wasn't? Either you don't know what parties made the coalition or you just don't know that Meretz and Ha'avoda are left/far left and Ra'am are Arabs. That means the last coalition definitely wasn't a centrist coalition.
Ra'am supports the creation of a Palestinian state, which its capital will be Jerusalem, via ending the "occupation" and evicting all Jewish people from Judea and Samaria. It's also supports the release of all Palestinian prisoners, and the right of return to all Palestinians.
Left and right aren't global terms. In Israel, you can't support the list above and identify yourself as right wing. If you don't understand that then you don't understand Israeli politics.
The division of votes in the last election was between far-right and centre-right parties. The left vote was not of serious consequence, and it hasn't been for years now. Lapid might have had a better chance of staying in government if Labor and Meretz had tied up together, but they will next time, I'm sure. Everyone, doubtless, is preparing for another election already, so we'll see what happens.
