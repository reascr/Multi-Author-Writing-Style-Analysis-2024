An arms dealer who is in no small part partially responsible for the critical lack of military hardware and ammunition that's killing Russian servicemen at an alarming rate and they applaud his safe return?
Is it mandatory to have a cocaine addiction or something to work in the Kremlin, cuz the logic in celebrating Victor's return is just not there.
As I understand it Bout was a monster, but one that served Russian interests, so to them it was helping someone on their team. It's also not a popular trade so they enjoy that it undermines the White House's PR. It's unlikely they expect Bout to go back to business, his value is purely to be a fly in the ointment for American diplomacy.
People are forgetting Biden got Trevor Reed out of there earlier this year - another US military service member... Russia will arrest any Americans and trump up charges just to have a trade for when we inevitably catch more Russian spies. I think it's weird that people are upset that an American is free. Plus the fact that Griner was sent to a penal colony where she would've most likely died and Whelan is sitting in a prison in Moscow. Putin is playing right into US far-right propaganda. Look at social media and the reactions of conservatives. It's fueling more division, and that's what he wants.
