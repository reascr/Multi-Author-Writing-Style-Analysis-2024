Geologists said that pressure builds up in the fault lines and needs to be released every so often. This particular fault line hasn't released its pressure in a while.
I took a geology class and what they said is fairly accurate to what I was taught. Basically pressure builds over time if it isn't released you get bigger earthquakes. Earthquakes shift the pressure elsewhere in the fault causing potentially more earthquakes. There is a bit more to how it works going into plate tectonics but that is the simple version.
They seem relatively soft in magnitude in that fault (seems they happen often enough not a huge amount of energy accumulates) and building codes are followed there, so buildings can withstand that much without issues, not much to worry about tbh.
Just open the door of the apartment (only if you can safely) if you are on the upper floors when it happens because the movement will screw with the door frame and can leave you unable to leave the apartment. That said, considering the historical record I don't think an earthquake there can create that much movement to deform the frames unless you get one that breaks the pattern.
I was in an 8 story complex in 2010, in Chile, and most neighbors in the last 2 floors could not open their front doors at all after the event.
