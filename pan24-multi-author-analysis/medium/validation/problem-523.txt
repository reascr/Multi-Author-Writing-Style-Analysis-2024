The whole situation is ridiculous on its face since it asserts that the prior situation (the default) is illegal. It's an inane power grab over foreign affairs by the judicial.
A complete and total violation of the separation of powers. Trying to prevent the president from doing his job via a bogus interpretation of administrative law. God only knows how many administrative laws Trump broke, and I didn't hear a damn thing from the GOP then. It's not about the law, it's about controlling the opposing party and denying them the ability to enact their policies.
Summerhays said in his ruling that the Biden administration violated administrative procedure laws and that lifting Title 42 would cause “irreparable harm” because the states would have to spend money on health care, law enforcement, education and other services for migrants.
“In sum, the Court finds that the Plaintiff States have established a substantial likelihood of success based on the CDC’s failure to comply with the rulemaking requirements of the [Administrative Procedure Act]. This finding is sufficient to satisfy the first requirement for injunctive relief,” Summerhays wrote in his ruling.
No, the context is perfectly fine. If the executive branch can rewrite the rules, then other branches can't say they're in violation of the current rules when the administration can simply rewrite them to reflect current policy.

If they can find jobs, let them work...our immigration policy is absolutely insane. White people do not own this land, and our Constitution is suppose to protect all law-abiding people.

They're coming in for the same reason our own immigrant ancestors did: for better opportunities.
