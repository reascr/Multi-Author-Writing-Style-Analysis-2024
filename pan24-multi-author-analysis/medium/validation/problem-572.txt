The federal government made a deal with RWE: RWE is allowed to mine the coal sitting underneath the village, but instead of phasing out coal all together by 2038 they have to phase it out in 2030. Why are the protesters still pissed you ask? On the one hand Some studies suggest coal would have been unlucrative by 2030 anyway due to cost of the european CO2 emissions certificates trade, so RWE got the government fooled and is making quite some profit off of that. On the other hand some estimate the amount of coal around the village is almost as high as underneath it, so if RWE would mine that instead the village could be preserved.
They phased out coal and nuclear in order to instead use natural gas. With the current war going on, they stopped buying Russian gas, but still have to get their energy from somewhere.
Even if they changed direction and wanted to focus on nuclear again that would still take a long time to get going and many industries aren't geared towards using electricity for their production needs.
small protests over coal mining in one town are easier to quell than large protests over high energy prices in every town.
