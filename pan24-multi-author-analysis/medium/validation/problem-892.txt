I would have to guess it'll depend on how they organize afterwards. A lot of the equipment will also have gone through a tough war and most is older stuff. Probably a lot will be scrapped, some might be returned if working and still used in those countries inventories. It'll take a long time since I'm sure they'll want to reduce equipment variety and restart their own arms industry again.
I doubt it,if anything Ukraine will keep receiving military aid for years in the future. The conflict will be there forever now ( no matter how this war goes) so it would not make sense to send it back.
I believe a lot of countries are using the aid to Ukraine also as a way to offload dated or overstocked equipment. Essentially, the donation to Ukraine is a good excuse to replace them with newer systems.
For example, Germany is in the process of replacing its Marders with a new IFV called the Puma. Hence why they are willing to donate the Marders.
As such, I wouldn’t expect any country to ask for its donated systems back. They will be worn out and already replaced. Doesn’t really make sense to keep a stockpile of worn and outdated stuff.
Similarly, the French last year were looking to update the Caesar platform. Instead of retrofitting the existing systems, they are now probably donating (most of) them to Ukraine and just ordering the upgraded version new.
In the case of Spain, getting rid-off the 50 or so tanks on deep storage that our army was trying to sell but nobody wanted.
I do wonder if our and are also on the table. As our army is starting to replace them with different variants of the 8x8 Dragon (our version of the.
I mean the replacement/upgrade program of the Caesar was announced already 5 days before the actual invasion started. I do think the whole program got hurried along at a greater pace since then to make these donations possible though.
My point isn’t to so much to say that stuff going to Ukraine is outdated and bad. Simply that countries are using the opportunity to justify buying even better stuff.
Also, on the scale of military procurement in peace time, delivery starting in 2024 might as well be next week.
All nice and dandy, but that still doesn’t change anything about my comments above. Yes it will take a while, but still they are using the opportunity to justify even getting the new system. I never said they didn’t dip into supplies to do it.
Yes peace time. Is the French or any NATO army currently directly fighting Russia? Is the whole economy diverted to arms production? No? That’s what we call peace time economy.
Also, your examples are just bad. F22 was never intended to replace the F16/F18, it fulfils a different role. And large vessels like aircraft carriers are not at all comparable to artillery pieces, as you only have one/a few and they take way longer to replace. French isn’t handing over all its artillery, they still keep plenty for their own immediate needs. Guess you’d know either of these things if you didn’t watch so much Teletubbies.
Again, if for one second you’d actually read, you’d see that I didn’t say they are not dipping into their own stockpiles to supply Ukraine. That still doesn’t mean that they are not using the “oh look our stockpiles are running low” as an excuse to upgrade. Militaries always have to justify why they need the money for new equipment, and what better justification than “we generously provided support to Ukraine”.
There will probably be some downsized of the Ukrainian army. As war-time numbers are not sustainable long-term.
Of course. The upside is that they will probably downsized by retiring Soviet gear (or at least putting them in deep storage) and keeping at least part of the NATO equipment.
I do wonder what would this mean for the Ukrainian Arms Industry, tho. Prior to the war it was decently sized.
