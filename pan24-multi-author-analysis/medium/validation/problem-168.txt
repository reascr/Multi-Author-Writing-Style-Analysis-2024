Like I hated Schrader too, but the district was a highly competitive one, and even strong incumbents have been struggling in a lot of places. It wasn't an unreasonable decision to prioritize other races they thought they had a better chance in, especially when money doesn't translate directly into votes. It's not like we can say "If they'd spent X million, she WOULD have won" - all we can say is "Maybe she would have, maybe they'd have wasted a ton of money that did more good elsewhere.".
You say that now, but you're operating with 20/20 hindsight. It's entirely possible that the amount of money required to put her over the top is either near-infinite (meaning that no amount of money was going to sway enough voters, and any that it motivated it would also counter-motivate others), or that it would have been so much that it would mean losing 2-3+ other races that the money went to instead.
I can't imagine why, in a year that was expected to be really bad when Democrats were trying to defend a ton of seats, that they would decide not to fund what they saw as a risky challenger likely to lose.
The fact that McLeod-Skinner finished just a few points behind the Republican despite getting left for dead by the rest of the party pretty strongly suggests that decision was a mistake. Obviously there's no way to no for sure what would have happened, but it seems like if she had gotten a little bit of support from Democratic campaign organizations we could have gotten another seat in the house.
The bottom line is that progressive candidates just don't have a good track record of winning highly competitive districts, especially in challenging election cycles. And if progressives want to count on establishment support then the burden is kind of on them to prove they're good enough to win, especially when you're in the process of knocking off establishment incumbents.
And WA-03, my district, wound up being a good opportunity because the Republicans nominated a crazy person instead of their lonime incumbent. They dumped a bunch of outside support in, and he still lost.
So, no - ultimately it's on the candidate to run a good enough race and raise the money they need to win. It's great when outside help is available, but you cannot simply expect the establishment to come swoop in and carry you, especially when you're coming in as an anti-establishment challenger.
