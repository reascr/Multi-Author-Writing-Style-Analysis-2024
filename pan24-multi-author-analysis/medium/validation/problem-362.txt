i always wondered about just how much collateral damage is wrought by this entire iron dome concept of missile defense . you have a missile incoming , let's launch another one over our own territory to intercept it . i suppose a hit just rains debris over a large area alleviating a gigantic blast but a miss just doubles the effectiveness of the initial launch . so is war ?
Never forget that the cause of this is ultimately Russia. In a war on close borders this will keep happening. An unfortunate accident that gives the tiniest taste of the reality of everyday for the Ukrainians.
It’s another horror of war that would not be happening if Russia didn’t invade a sovereign state and start launching missiles at civilians.
