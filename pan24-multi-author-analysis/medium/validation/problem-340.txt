and there I was, sitting there, very innocently by the way, had your Beautiful First Lady, you all know who I'm talking about, and all of a sudden I see my people, they're coming up to me, "Sir, Sir," I said what is it, "it's the Radical Left, Sir, they're trying to get Allen to flip," and we don't like Flippers do we folks, and I know a lot about it, I've been watching it happen for a long time, you have people who are maybe good people and then some things happen, we're talking bad things, and then they're maybe not so good, and then there are what you would call some problems, and we never have problems under Trump, but then you look at what's going on, Sleepy Joe stealing your Taxes and using it for Late Term Abortions, it's horrible what they're doing. we used to be over 100% under Trump but now, now we're Dead In The Water, ok, you can thank me whenever you feel like it, have a nice time, don't forget, you wouldn't have a Constitution without me.
I hate how prosecutors use the threat of indictments to get witnesses to cooperate, either they committed a crime by breaking the law or they did not. Leniency for cooperation should ONLY be available during sentencing, not for indictments. One of the best recent example of this is Jeffrey Epsteinâ€™s NPA. Another example is the prosecution of Cohen while Trump walks free.
