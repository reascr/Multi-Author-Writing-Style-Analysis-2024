I mean India doesn't offer much rn and is riddled with poverty as well. I live in the US and actual developed countries are generations into the future compared to all of south asia. But The northern areas of Pakistan where Gilgit Baltistan is are some of the richest and developed areas of the country. India would have to become developed to the level of US or western Europe to be able to realistically overcome their patriotism and even then I doubt it. So the only way India is getting that land is by fighting for it and waging an offensive war through the karakoram mountain range, so never. and Kashmiris don't live in this region anyways. In fact even in Azad Kashmir, it's mainly Punjabis/Paharis that live there. So there is no longing by the people to join up with the Kashmir valley, in fact the Gilgit Baltistanis want their own province seperate from the politics of Azad Kashmir and Kashmir valley. So India doesn't offer much to Pakistan in any fashion to concede this territory. India has never controlled this territory and never will control this territory unless it's willing to wage an offensive war which comes with the risk of nuclear weapons hitting every major city in India. I think your pov on this situation is very limited and optimistic thinking 1) people will turn, as someone who grew up in the nation, 99% of the people are sheep and love the military (the actual entity that controls everything) 2) that even if they did turn they would go with India.
Bruh Pakistan has been nothing bust hostile since inception, India truly doesn't need Pakistan. Sure, would it be nice if Pakistan was friendly and/or they handed over Kashmir? Yes, but it's not necessary, on the other hand, without aid, Pakistan is in dore straits soon.
