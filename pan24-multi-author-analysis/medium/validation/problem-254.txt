For those unfamiliar with Russian, "mir" means peace and Earth and was the name of their long orbiting space-station. Reagan proposed we name ours "freedom" in response, but what eventually got made with partnerships was the ISS "International Space Station".
I hope you understand that whether they target civilians is only a diplomatic and strategic consideration. There are no "good guys" in real armed conflicts.
Living is getting harder and harder there, but people still stay. Mostly the elderly, but not exclusively. It’s amazing the strenh of physiological ties people have to their homes, although reportedly poor conditions in collective centers for IDPs also definitely play a role.
I think his point is that reducing the complexity of a war to “good guys” versus “bad guys” is a dramatic oversimplification of the facts. You can support whoever you support, but it is never as simple as “good guys” versus “bad guys.” Indeed, your conception of it as such is largely a product of confirmation bias and the type of media you are consuming.
But what does “good” mean in this context, other than “the ones we feel we should be supporting.” There is some argument for the fact that NATO encroachment is threatening to countries that have been explicitly rejected from NATO. If the CSTO is was powerful enough to threatening to US, and Mexico was poised to join the CSTO, would the US consider that a threat? Certainly.
