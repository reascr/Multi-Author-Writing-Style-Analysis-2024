This isn’t even all about hurting Russia. Drone swarm attacks are looking like the future, and the US is sure as hell going to be facing these type of attacks in future battlefields. More so now that Russia and Iran are out to get us for what we have done to them. They’ll be selling them to our enemies worldwide if they can. We need to be sure our anti-drone weaponry can counter them. There’s no turning back now.
We tried not helping in South Ossetia and Crimea and all it got us was the larger Ukraine invasion. A few billion dollars to embarrass and defang Russia like this is actually a good deal geopolitically.
Yeah, we've been gifted the gutting of the Russian military for pennies on the dollar. We're getting to test logistical and weapons systems as well as tactics in drone warfare. At least for drones, we're also building the muscle for doing extremely rapid weapons development and procurement outside the normally stultifying pentagon processes. It's like a war game to prep us for an eventual conflict with China.
