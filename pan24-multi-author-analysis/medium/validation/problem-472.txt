I think scrutinizing Trump's personal life, and constantly going after him for every little thing, just makes the establishment look more and more Petty. also, I can't imagine anything from his tax returns that would make me like him any less.
I suspect that he'll just delay until the Republicans take over the House. Then the process starts all over again if the Senate can get its act together to demand them.

This is it. Trump is no longer useful for the GQP, the purging of him begins and it will be death by a thousand cuts. The best we can hope for is he goes toe to toe against them and fractures the GQP in the process.
