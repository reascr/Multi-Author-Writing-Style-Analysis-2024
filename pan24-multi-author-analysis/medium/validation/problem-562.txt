The talks were never actually offered. News reporters asked Biden if he was having talks with Russia and he just said that the US was not talking to Russia unless Russia pulled out.
That's not what this article says. Putin just has to indicate interest in leaving Ukraine for talks to proceed.
Nobody is talking to either party right now. It’s not even on the table. There are no offers to turn down by either party.
Yes, he’d want to talk if Putin wants to end the war by pulling out of Ukraine. I read the interview last Thursday when it happened. There is more to that interview. I’ll see if I can find it and I’ll edit this post.
> Mr. Putin is — I need to choose my words very carefully. I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if, in fact, there is an interest in him — he's looking for a way to end the war. He hasn't done that yet.".

Toward the end to where Biden says “There's one way for this war to end, the rational way: Putin could pull out of Ukraine, No. 1. It appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy prince for failing to do it.".
So the only way for Biden to want to talk to Putin is if Putin intends to end the war by pulling out of ukraine.
Another part of the interview Biden stated “There's one way for this war to end, the rational way: Putin could pull out of Ukraine, No. 1. It appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy prince for failing to do it." So he’s only willing to talk to Putin if Putin intends to leave Ukraine.
