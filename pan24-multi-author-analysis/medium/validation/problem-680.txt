Let's be honest. She doesn't need the money. She has money and comes from a family who's quite comfortable financially. If I can try to read her mind for a moment, what she's saying out loud is that she's been working so hard to save America from any of her made up threats to our democracy that she is not being rewarded for her stewardship. Me thinks that in the recesses of her mind, she's entitled to way more money after she's appeared to be an opponent of actually working as an elected leader to the United States Congress. It's an honor and a privilege to be in that position. Considering that $174k/year is plenty, plus all of the financial allowances and benefits she receives as she's a Congressperson. I'm almost certain she plays dirty with money and buys stocks just like a great many of them on both sides. When Cawthorne makes $41 million as a freshman congressperson, you have to follow the trail. There's money to be made legally, but no big donors are stepping forward to support her because she's toxic. And to think she'll go on the speaking circuit with anyone actually wanting to listen to her blabber off a litany of tropes and slurs as if anyone is yearning for it. She is a whiner and a blowhard. I don't feel sorry for her, I feel sorry for all of America because this is what we have as elected leaders to run the country.
