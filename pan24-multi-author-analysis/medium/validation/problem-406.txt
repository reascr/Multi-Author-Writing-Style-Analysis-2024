Generally people don’t go AWOL in an active war zone for obvious reasons. When your stateside in garrison it’s no different than a normal job nobody monitors your movements unless you’ve given them reason too. They just leave and don’t show up for duty. If you refuse your right they won’t put a gun to your head, we used to half heartedly say what are you going to do send me to Iraq. But I have put belly chains on guys and brought them to a military prison. The truth is you will be jailed and get real familiar with making big rocks into little rocks hard labor sentences are real and that’s how you will spend the remainder of your contract plus whatever sentence they deem appropriate they just extend you till your release date. You are still subject to the UCMJ and now have a federal conviction on your record. And most if not all your benefits are gone as you were not honorably discharged. Very few good employers will touch you with a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge following you around. I’m sure there’s more but I wasn’t an MP so I just transferred them into custody. If you really lucky and the just want to be rid of you they will just article you and give you the boot.
Navy times says he was listed as a deserter which fits for the duration of his absence. As you can see from the first link, both of those are potential charges for an unauthorized absence but desertion is also a listing for status.
They don’t even actively chase you down for the most part even during the war in Iraq we would get a few awol soldiers here in there back to the unit they always were stopped for something unrelated its basically a bench warrant. They were Articled sometimes jailed and then quickly out processed with a dishonorable or OTH after completing the disciplinary actions.
