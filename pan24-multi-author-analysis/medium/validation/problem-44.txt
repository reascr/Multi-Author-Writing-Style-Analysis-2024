Presidents &ndash; or any politicians, really &ndash; shouldn't be visiting disaster sites at all. People in those situations have enough to deal with without having to worry about a presidential visit and all the logistical hassles that come with it.

Biden offered the governor anything he wanted and he turned it down. Even with that, we still had 4+ agencies on ground investigating and providing help. We are holding Norfolk accountable for cleanup.
