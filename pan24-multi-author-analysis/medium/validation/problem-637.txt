The 2nd amendment existed so the people could form their own militias using the latest tech without interference. We are a constitutional republic not a democracy, the bill of rights is us telling the government what it can’t do. Not the other way around. The issue today is people decided to become batshit crazy in the past 50 years and start killing innocent people for no reason. The firearms available today are not the reason for this. When you go into a place with unarmed people and have free rain for at least 7 minutes even a single shot rifle can cause mass causalities. Guns like Ar15s and Shotguns are only better than single shot rifles when facing armed people where the goal is to overwhelm. With unarmed people you don’t need to overwhelm them because they can’t easily resist an attack.
The NRA is not a rights organization. They are an industry group. They exist only to sell more guns. Well, and traffic Russian intelligence assets too apparently. I guess everyone has a side gig these days.
