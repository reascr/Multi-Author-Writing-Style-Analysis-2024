except thanks to HIMARS that had kinda been neutralized quite some time ago. Since HIMARS outranges Russian batteries. Ukraine opens up on mobniks, Russia returns fire, maybe the Ukranian artillery is damaged by a lucky shot instead of an inaccurate shell from a worn out Russian barrel, but a nearby HIMARS will counter fire and eliminate the Russian artillery anyway.
Cannon fodder only works to draw out artillery if you don't have counter fire waiting for you. Like a pawn in chess protected from capture by a knight.
HIMARS should not be used in counter artillery fire.....that's not what it's good at. Especially since your not going to hurt those systems. Your hoping to kill the operators in a counter fire mission.
At almost a million dollars a rocket I hope the UKR sticks to the soft targets the HIMARS is designed to destroy.
Statement: Conscription is for Russia to use cannon fodder to identify ukrainan artillery targets to destroy.
Response: HIMARs ensures any Russian counter battery fire on Ukrainian targets is neutralized without reprisal which makes the purpose of arty spotting cannon fodder pointless as a casualty of not just the fodder but the artillery team using them as bait.
The definition of "working" here is that russian mobik is valued far lower then a Ukrainian Heroy. Putin doesn't care if 10 untrained gopniks die in order to take out of war a single well trained and equipped soldier with experience and dedication. For russia and russians a single injured Ukrainian is worth his/her weight in gold.
Edit: just wanted to point out that u/PariahOrMartyr is correct in their assumption that Russians are fucked. They're just misguided by who's doing the fucking. The answers is: a little from column A, a little from column B.
Neutralised how exactly? On the frontlines they have come to a gridlock, as was recently stated by Ukraines defence ministry. And HIMARS arenâ€™t stopping all missiles that are hitting Ukrainian infrastructure and civilians nearly every single day from the front lines all the way through to Odessa, Kyiv and Lviv. Ukraine might be knocking 70+ /100 missiles a day but many are still making its way through, hence the constant power outages across country.
they got the fresh intake of weapons and armour from the Ukranian museums they looted. now the next wave of mobniks can march into Ukraine with Poleaxes and maces.
