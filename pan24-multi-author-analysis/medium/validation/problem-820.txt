but i would argue they have a reason to arm Iran protesters because they are now interfering in Ukraine war.
The Iranian protesters are armed especially in areas where there's a large population of Kurds, there's videos of guns battles happening between the protesters and goverment forces. Guns are flowing from Kurdish factions outside of Iran, I'd also wager other Middle Eastern powers will supply arms to the protesters. Russias armed forces is way too busy in Ukraine and their State police forces are way too busy suppressing their own people to really effectively help Iran out.
This Iranian-Russian alliance is a thing we are going to hear a lot more in the future. Russia is not going to attack any western nation. Russia does not have a capability to that. We will see more Russian activity in the Middle East.
I fear this could be 1 step closer towards to civil war in Iran. Depending on how brutal the Russian (a.k.a. foreign) security forces are, revolts and with that brutality could increase to the point Iranian Army could be forced by its people to intervene, which would threaten the regime and start a war between the army and protestors vs IRG.
