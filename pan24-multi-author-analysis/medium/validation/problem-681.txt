From watching so many of his followers, I've found it isn't necessarily him they love (at least when he first started making waves) it was the fact that he said exactly what they were thinking and that mixed with the fact that he said/behaved exactly like they would've has they been on the stage with Hilary.
The people here, this kind of congregation for example, are bombarded with scary stories from right-wing media constantly. They listen to it on their drive to work (the 1 radio station in the state has a morning show that is very right-wing), they talk about it with their co-workers during the day, they listen to it on their drive home, they watch it on the TV over dinner, and at night they read about it on their phone before they fall asleep.
The left always need to have an outreach to these folk, if not to convert them, then to neutralize them from the brainwashing of the right. The Left cant afford to get complacent or ignore them.

This isn't possible. Churches, especially in the South where I'm familiar with, are nothing more than mandatory right-wing community meetings with Christian window dressing. One time I attended a church in Pascagoula, MS with a former friend and I kid you not it was like watching a 1hr speech prepared by Fox News opinion writers where they spoke out against immigrants, atheists, and the evil Democrats. I went to several churches with this person (they were in the choir) and it was the same every time.
I'm not sure how you reach out to that. Without aggressive, questionable, measures I don't think there is a way. They are programmed to hate Democrats and liberals no matter what. They don't see Democrats and liberals as "people" even. Just the "enemy". An enemy they are convinced they are at war with.
His base has felt victimized and left behind for years by the university educated liberal movement. When they see someone viciously going after those "enemies" and watching the left have everything they've build go up in flames would've been emotionally akin to having a heroin high for the first time....and they've been chasing that high ever since.
