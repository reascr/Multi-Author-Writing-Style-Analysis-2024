I try to inform these rural Texas who spout about “their tax money” that they’re not even coming close to paying their own way, and wouldn’t have electricity, phones, internet, paved roads, etc. if it weren’t for the blue cities in Texas and blue states in the US subsidizing the hell out of them. They either don’t believe indisputable reality even with sources proving I’m right, or they come back with “what would the cities do without food, huh?” Well, we have money and hence can buy food from elsewhere if we had to. And we’d have a lot more money if our taxes weren’t paying their bills plus our own.
State Rep. Jared Patterson, R-Frisco, filed House Bill 714 and House Joint Resolution 50 last week that would create a new “District of Austin” to replace Texas’ capital.
So they want to take away all elected officials of one of the biggest citys in Tx so they can control it with people who are elected by people who dont live there, essentially taking away and voting power the people of Austin have.
