This speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese governance. The ones with true power, like Jiang, don't need to hold office. Jiang stacked the party with loyalists so he could be certain he would be able to continue influencing politics despite being formally retired. Xi needs a third term because he lacks a clique he can continue to influence upon retirement.
Despite no longer being general secretary, Jiang still remained in charge of the military during the first year of Hu Jintao's term. Many agree Hu was unable to fully realize his goals because of Jiang's interference. A WikiLeaks transcript showed Hillary Clinton informing her private audience that China's foreign policy was ultimately controlled by their military establishment, not Hu.
If you criticize Xi for underhandedly cementing power by enshrining Xi Jinping Thought into the constitution, you should also criticize Jiang for doing the same when he enshrined his "Three Represents" ideology into the constitution.
As far as I know, US government only goes after individuals from the Jan 6 group that actually attacked the capitol, not anyone and everyone associated.
Hell trump & his supporter were heavily influenced by Epoch Times, the tabloid funded directly by Falungon.
It's much more complicated than that, and not at all like the Jan 6 event in the US, because Jiang still had power after officially leaving office, where Trump had only influence.
Political cults like Falun Gong are not new to China. The Taiping Rebellion was started by a political cult, and more people died in the Taiping Rebellion than in WW1.
Falun Gong is China's version of QAnon. China's solution was heavy-handed, but most Chinese would argue it was necessary to prevent the unrest we in the US have to deal with due to our political cult, QAnon.
They weren't a political cult, either, they began as a spiritual movement and were forced to take a political stance by persecution.
Jiang (and all Chinese leaders) are not afraid of religious movements in general, they are afraid of any institution that threatens the CPC's authority over China. Most sects of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity are tolerated, as long as they keep they promise to never question the CPC or discuss political issues. Tibetan Buddhism and Islam in Xinjiang were suppressed because they were afraid of separatist movements. Jehovah's Witness was banned because it taught its followers to refuse to swear allegiance to a specific nation. However, Hui Islam, Mahayana Buddhism, and the Catholic Patriotic Association are tolerated because they don't conflict with the CPC's political agenda.
A foundational belief of Falun Gong is that the CPC is illegitimate, so it's not a surprise they got suppressed. I'm not shedding any tears, it was an insanely racist cult. Li Hongzhi is not an idiot, he knows he can't actually levitate, he's just making this stuff up to build a following in order to influence Chinese politics.
His "ability to maintain good relationships with western powers" is BS. He oversaw the third cross-strait crisis. The only reason you don't remember the times he disagreed with the West is because we never took China seriously as a potential peer competitor. Back then, we could silence China's disapproval of a Taiwanese leader with a basic naval exercise. Jiang and Xi's policies towards the West haven't changed, most of the change comes from the West not being as cooperative because it realizes China is an imminent threat to it's hegemony.
Never thought I'd see the day where Westerners praise Jiang. Just goes to show how easily Westerners forget about the past to eat up the new narrative about why this time, China's leader is really bad.
Jiang had a unique view of the US. While he believed the American values were incompatible with China, he still respected America. He memorized excerpts from the US Declaration of Independence and Gettysburg Address. He was the last mainland president to go on 60 Minutes. Jiang cared less about ideological purity, and more about understanding the values of other countries. That is what sers him apart from the current general secretary of China.
