Its almost like if you release murderers from Russia's hellish prison system, they will continue to murder.. and there is no love lost on the people who held them there in the first place.
I think you're right, but there's a difference between giving a criminal a gun and saying "See that nation, I don't want to." And saying "All the friends and family you know on the outside are under threat of foreign invaders, help us defend our home".
The Russian criminal has no reason to want to fight this war beyond getting out of prison, and it's very obvious they are meat for the grindr. The Ukrainian prisoners most likely have friends and family on the outside who are suffering because of russian occupation and IIRC they aren't being conscripted so much as being offered the opportunity.
“Would you like to stay in this box, or fight alongside your countrymen and friends to defend our nation of Ukraine?”.
“Come on kadyrov, time to fight in 20° weather with little food or clothing for no real honorable goal until you’re dead.”.
Russia have repeatedly stated that they want Ukraine to "not exist". That applies to Ukrainian prisoners too. It's in the best interests of even the most sociopathic to use their murdery skills against people who are trying to genocide them.
