You know I'm not fan of the liberal party but I have been listening to Christopher Pyne's podcast where he interviews Australian politicians from both Labor and the liberal party sometimes I don't like his guests sometimes I do ( like he had albo as a guest who I like) anyway he had Malcolm Turnbull on & Christopher Pyne said he hadn't caught a train for like 40 years until Malcolm Turnbull made him. Malcolm Turnbull said it's important to catch the train to connect with the common people and talk with them.
So he's still like heaps out of touch, I mean who catches the train to connect with people lol. He probably has that chauffeur you are talking about but at least he tries I guess lol.
It's a video linked from a Murdoch media owned website. Same Fox News right-wing shithouse as the rest so it's no wonder they'd come out in droves to throw shade.
You donâ€™t need bots to comment filth about a genuinely good bloke when LNP key donors own literally every scrap of media in the country, with the exception of the ABC and SBS.
Turns out when you have a propaganda monopoly, you can dupe enough people into wanting anyone dead for such controversial things as supporting adults in consensual relationship as other adults.
If someone down here is referring to Mardi Gras, they'll be talking about the Sydney festival for LGBT.
