I think the problem is language. the word "chicken" means chicken. The word grape can mean all kinds of things. grape flavor, grape the fruit, grape the juice etc. So if I see grape drink, it's a little deceptive but my brain at least is looking for the modifier. But chicken is chicken. Fried chicken, chicken strips, chicken broth, etc all have meat in them. "vegan chicken" is new and unfamiliar. You should check out this other sub where they were talking about how many people fundamentally don't know what the word "vegan" even means. One person thought Vegan=Organic. Another thought it meant "healthy" or sustainably raised, like people are legit calling eggs "vegan" because they came from a friend's chickens.
I can look at the ingredients when I purchase something at the store. At a restaurant I find it weird not knowing what my vegan “chicken” actually is. Putting the “vegan” in front of it only tells me what it isn't.
not sure what that has to do with this article. If the restaurant can't say vegan chicken then they will say "protein strips" or something. you still won't know what it is.
