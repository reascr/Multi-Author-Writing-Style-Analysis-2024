This appears to be an appropriate and sufficient response. Reznikov says there are contracts with 8 suppliers. That doesn't sound like a corrupt system to me.
Western media needs to be careful in choosing to report these kinds of things, regardless of whether they're true.
"Ukraine is corrupt" has been the main Russian propaganda line for like a decade at this point, and this will do nothing but feed the typical rumors about selling weapons on the black market, or ministers squirreling away funds into offshore accounts. It's important to remember that Ukraine isn't Afghanistan or Iraq - even if some percentage of money and support gets skimmed off, it's not going to be a complete theft like in previous wars.
It's not mentioned in the article, but there was another story yesterday about Ukrainian repair contracts for certain vehicles being severely overpriced (e.g., $150k to repair a vehicle worth half that when new). And while yes, war profiteering isn't ideal, at least the vehicles still get repaired and can support Ukraine's fight.
Well it's not just the main Russian propaganda line. It's a big enough issue that Zelenskyy outright set out to tackle it in order to make a bid for NATO. There is corruption, but they're working to improve it.
