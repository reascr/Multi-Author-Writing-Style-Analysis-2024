I poke my head into right-wing areas every so often to keep a bead on things, and this is honestly the closest to an anti-Trump consensus I've seen among right-wing people since 2015. Actually, Trump basically didn't exist as a political leader for them at all prior to 2015, so I think ... since his rise to power, really, I've never seen so many of them turn on him.
Everyone is saying it, they come up to me on the street and say “Sir - can you believe how great a loser this trump guy is? I’ve never seen someone lose as good as him. One of the world’ great losers”.
This will be the pivot. Watch conservative shock jocks start to shift support to a quote-unquote winnable candidate in DeSantis. However, what would be really entertaining was a party fracture over this. The Republican party has dogwhistled to the Trumpopulists for too long for this to go over smoothly. The party will want to push with all of their media power to get support for a more run of the mill Republican. Trump's ego will not be able to take this and much of his support base will not accept the pivot. Imagine if Trump runs as an independent/third party candidate, splitting the vote significantly across the entire country delivering the Democrats a strong win in 2024.
As a purely uninformed outsider opinion, it’s almost better if the Dems don’t send him to jail, as this would not only make it easy for the GOP to select De Santis but also galvanise the Republican base. Let them fight and don’t interrupt your opponent while they’re making a mistake.
I think you're right. Looking at the comments on Fox news and /r/conservative right now, this might have been the silver bullet. Comments range from "I love him, and he did good things for the country, but it's time for Trump to step aside" to "he's going to ruin us in 2024 if he can't keep his mouth shut!".
