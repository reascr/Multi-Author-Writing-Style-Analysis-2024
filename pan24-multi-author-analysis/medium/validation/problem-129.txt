Of course I want NATO and the US to supply Ukraine with even more and it is frustrating to see them refuse to supply long range munitions while my relatives have to hide in the basement from missile strikes, but I'm also grateful that NATO and other nations have provided so much and continue to assert their support for Ukraine. If support was not provided - both when the war started in 2014 and when it escalated in 2022 - I know that people would have still fought against Russia but it would have been even more brutal and difficult for the people to stand against Russian imperialism.
But at least the average Russian knows what they're dying for. Palaces and yachts that they'll never be allowed within 20km of.
It's a shame his palaces are so large. Would be a shame if we knew which window he was at and participate in some classic defenestration.
Do newer spellings with "Ãª" have the same pronunciation as the antiquated version? I have no knowledge of French pronunciation, but I'm assuming it is just a spelling modernization, like an Eszett in German?
