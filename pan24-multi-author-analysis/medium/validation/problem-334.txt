McCarthy is promising everything to get the votes from extremist, it's not unreasonable that if the dems have a unified front, they can convince a some republicans to vote for someone else if they are promised something of worth. Basically selling a vote for some politicians agenda.

I think the dems only need to flip 5 people to have a majority vote on the matter, and there are republicans in districts who could still do well if they sided with dems, as it's pretty apparent that republicans just want to do nothing and obstruct as much as possible.
