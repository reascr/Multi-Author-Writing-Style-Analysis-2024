look at it this way, as long as they spend their money on pointless Western and Asian luxury goods, all the money the world pays them for oil just flows right back.
If you're suggesting the bribed the ref, Saudi Arabia got 6 yellow cards during that match lmao. Ref was handing them out like candy to Saudi. The fact of the matter is, Argentina became over confident after half time and Saudi's very risky offside trap paid off. They simply put performed them in the 2nd half.
Now go back to watching your hand egg matches where half your players end up with brain injuries by 30. We'll stick to the real sport.
Typical American which knows nothing about football. Argentina is a contender to win the world cup. They have way more on the line to lose by losing the match than any bribe. This is also Messi's last worldcup and no amount of money would ever make him consider fixing the match since he already has more money than you could imagine. He wants to achieve a world cup victory with his country. So which is it, do you know nothing about football or are you just racist against Arabs.
