I meant infected in the sense of the virus entering your body. Vaccines do not stop a virus from entering your body. What they do is allow your body to gain the ability to fight off a virus. Some vaccines are effective enough that the virus is killed by the body before the virus has a chance to cause the body to show any symptoms of infection. That is what immunity is. You are immune from the effects of the virus. Also, your body may be able to kill the virus before it can be transferred to another host. Obviously, some viruses like influenza, and covid, reproduce and evolve at such a rapid rate that the antibodies created by the body in response to a vaccine to deal with the virus are no longer effective against new variants and additional vaccination is required.
Because no vaccinations stop you from becoming infected. That just isn't possible. Vaccines allow your body to deal with a simulation of infection and produce the necessary antibodies to fight the infection without also having to deal with the additional adverse reactions that a live virus brings. Once you are vaccinated, if you are infected by the real virus, your body already has the tools to put up a much better fight than if it had not been given a trial run via the vaccine.
I've heard some old people who would otherwise go to retirement homes basically go and live on cruise ships to have all their needs taken care of and also get to travel at the same time.
I did Norwegian Escape when it was the “biggest.” 5,000 passengers and a couple thousand crew. Absolutely gross. Too many f’ing people, lines everywhere. Horrible and never again.
