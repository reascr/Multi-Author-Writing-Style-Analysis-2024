At first I was giving him the benefit of the doubt considering it took 3 years to nail Nixon for Watergate. Despite the overwhelming evidence of Trump and Congress of that time, you'd want to be 1000% sure before you drop the gavel that there was in fact a crime committed, especially for a sitting president.
I called it not long after 1/6 saying the fix was in for Trump and those in Congress participated in the coup; they should all have been charged immediately and weren't. When I worked as an investigator and we had a serious case with urgency behind it we worked it nearly 24/7... But with Garland weeks turned into months, and months into years. I suspect Smith is only there to clean up the mess and loose ends - it's nearly too late to indict Trump anyway, as we're approaching the 2024 election rapidly, and soon that case will time out because of it's political implications... But then again WTF do I know - maybe Garland will figure out where his balls dropped off and decide to put them back on for a day or two.
But then the 1/6 committe ended and nothing came of it through midterms. And then, Biden was immediately investigated for classified documents being found. Where is the investigation for Pence, whom was also found to have documents laying around. Our boy Trump got caught red handed with a couple hundred classified documents some of which no president even has the authorization or knowledge to look at.
I can only imagine where we would be had McConnel not blocked Merrick Garland from being SCOTUS cause right now he's the perfect Republican Asset.
