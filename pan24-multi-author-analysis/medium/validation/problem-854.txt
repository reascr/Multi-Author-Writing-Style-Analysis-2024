Just don't google the time Microsoft hired 8,000 workers and titled them 'independent contractors' rather than 'employees' so they couldn't get company benefits.
Been this way forever, and it was worse before, Supervisors working more than 40hrs a week got "paid" at the rate for a GS-10 step 10 OR could take "compensatory time off" - 1 hr of comp time for each hour worked. Also, the total annual pay could not exceed the base pay for a freshman Congressman. so if you were a non-supervisory GS-12 or above deployed with the troops for Desert Storm and worked 70-hr weeks, when you got home, you could owe back thousands of dollars because with overtime, your WEEKLY pay worked out to more than said freshman congressman's weekly pay. That is, you didn't exceed the ANNUAL pay for the Congresscritter, but you busted the "cap" on a weekly basis. One of my guys got slammed for $12,000 because he risked his life for his country, but Republicans were in charge of the administration, and didn't think that was worth an exception to the rule.
