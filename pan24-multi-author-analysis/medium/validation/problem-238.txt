Switzerland, a favoured destination for wealthy Russians, has also seen 15 Russian properties seized.
Switzerland has frozen a total of 7.5 billion Swiss francs in Russian assets, in connection with the sanctions imposed over Russia's war in Ukraine.
The amount, which has been fluctuating for months, is nearly one billion francs more than the figure provided by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) in July.
Erwin Bollinger, in charge of bilateral economic relations at SECO, stressed to reporters that the amount frozen at any given time does not necessarily "reflect the efficacy of the sanctions".
Depends where you are from but when I was there as a 16 year old Czech I felt a lot of arrogance and sense of superiority from the locals. Most of the interactions made me uncomfortable.
We were visiting but we were there for about 3 months. Stayed with 4 different families all throughout Switzerland. Literally drove around the entire country, we really didn't meet or interact with anyone like that. Seems like Nord has some issues.
