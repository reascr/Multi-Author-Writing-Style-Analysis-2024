Except claiming that Dems claims that "women wouldnâ€™t be able to get health care and would be punished" as a result of overturning Roe v Wade is itself a demonstrable outright lie.
All it takes is a cursory look at the daily headlines to see how women and girls have been and are being denied access to healthcare and yes, punished for seeking an abortion, for chrissakes.
Rightwing extremists like Musgrave are incapable/unwilling to tell the factual truth even if their very lives depended on their doing so.
Just like the anti-abortion extremists ongoing Big Lie that they are "pro-life". That's like claiming Donald Trump is an honest man (30,000+ documented lies and counting).
