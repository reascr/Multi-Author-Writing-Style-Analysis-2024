> Both lawyers note that the company did not initiate the legal action in this case, but only made the time theft claim in response to the woman filing her own claim alleging wrongful dismissal.
This article leaves out very important context, which is that she was originally the one to sue her company for $5000 for wrongful termination which ultimately failed as they had evidence that she was not actually working for some portion of the time she was claiming she had.
If she would've just lived with the fact that she had been lying to her employer about her hours worked and been fired quietly, they never would've pursued her for the measly $1500 as it's likely more costly than that to pursue her. It's not more costly however to just respond to her case with the facts and have the tribunal order her to pay their costs and $1500.
Read the article, she was caught fraudulently billing clients and only had to pay back what she got for "wrongful termination." This isn't "some person was lazy at work and got sued for it.".
