"Trusted" seems like kind of a strong word. In terms of policy maybe, but in terms of politics I don't trust the UAE as far as I can throw them and I doubt our elected officials trust them much more.
There was a line from the amazing book about Exxon by Steve Coll, said by and about oil billionaires in the M. East, something like, “From camels to private jets, but to camels we will return.” They know that the era of oil will come to an end. Will be interesting to see how they pivot. Might not matter at that point — we’re all fucked.
Dubai is a city I can’t wait to see fall. “The foolish man built his house on the sand.” Well they built a whole goddamn city on the sand, and then poured a shitton of sand into the water and built more.
I have strong feelings about Dubai, it strikes me as ostentatious, splendor for splendor's sake, but I don't have many thoughts on it beyond my feelings.
For my part I'd just like to see Saudi Arabia get their shit together and join the modern world, ostentatiousness bothers me less than beheadings, y'know? Dubai can be the biggest and most prosperous city on earth for all I care - if it meant the UAE embraced civil rights and liberties, which they haven't.
Dubai is a city built on slavery and the death of slaves. If anything its helped the UAE regress further into a corrupt hellhole.
I hope the ground opens up and swallows that city hole. That would help the UAE embrace civil rights: Removing all the rich people who don't believe in them.
I agree with you entirely and still think Dubai will become a literal metaphor for how opulence will be their downfall. Glasshouses for US and all that, but it’s still striking just how terrible in design that city theoretically is, yet all we see or hear about is the success of it. Feels forced.
