That's huge, the UK just announced hundreds including bulldogs, with the potential for strikers from the US maybe to be announced. People are fixated on the tanks but other armoured deliveries seem to be ramping up a lot as well.
... And good IFVs that can quickly cross rough terrain in large numbers are definitely useful for offensives and breaking through lines. With ATGM everywhere, it's not that sure that having a few tens of tanks is better than a few hundreds of IFVs. Tanks seem to take a role as fire support now that they can be countered by squads with ATGM. They'll probably be a good complement for a spearhead with hundreds of IFVs, but not that decisive on their own.
I think what made the dike burst was Russia's second mobilization announcement. They're really going to try to flood the region with bodies in 2023, and it's given the West a sense of urgency that wasn't there before. They've got a window of probably about 6 months to arm several powerful Ukrainian mobile armored brigades and train those units for a big push.
Basically, everyone has realized that Ukraine can win this. Everyone realized that Russia wasn’t going to stop at gobbling up Ukraine, and the next targets included NATO countries and EU members. If Russia takes on NATO or the EU, that will likely turn into a full WWIII. So instead, once Ukraine showed they were willing to fight, the plan became to stop Russia in Ukraine.
It was thought at the start of the war that it would take 9-12 months for Ukraine to develop the logistics to handle NATO vehicles. It’s been 11 months and suddenly the NATO armory doors are being flung open wide.
So, it sounds like a lot more equipment from US surplus is about to be unloaded. The US usually lists those items with the cost to purchase them directly, even if they are the US getting rid of surplus equipment and saving on maintenance and storage. Still, great news. I wonder what toys Ukraine is getting.
You must remember, it was the Soviet Union, not Russia, that spent 10 years fighting in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union was a much more powerful country than modern-day Russia and losing all those people and money in Afghanistan helped lead to the Soviet Union breaking up. Losing 26k people and a ton of equipment in Afghanistan broke a wealthier and more powerful country than the modern Russian federation.
Never forget to remind that prominent Wagner members have a proven track record of neo nazi advocacy, but Russia doesn't give a damn. If they really wanted to fight nazism, they wouldn't rely on the services of Wagner mercenaries.
Ukraine’s favored tactic this war has been rope-a-dope. Right now Russia is full of strenh from the mobiks raised in the fall. Ukraine is letting Russia bleed men to get a few feet of ground, while generally preserving its own strenh. Once Russia exhausts the mobiks, which should happen soon since the current wave of mobiks have been thrown at Bakhmut in heavy waves for almost a month now. Russia officially raised 300,000 and sent half to Ukraine, concentrating them at Bakhmut and Soledar. If a force is meaningless when it has one man dead in ten and Russia loses 500 a day, Russia can’t go much longer with the current wave. That’s Ukraine’s cue to start pushing.
Oh this old bit of propaganda. One of Russia’s favorite claims is that X is endless, so why bother. Now it is true that Russia can produce a certain number of missiles a month. However, from the reduced frequency of missile tantrums, it isn’t that many.
