To anyone confused: type 1 diabetes is generally diagnosed in youth (of course there are exceptions), and ALL type 1s need insulin to live. Pretty much everyone who’s a type 1 diabetic is still screwed, aside from the lucky ones who’ve made it to 65. But that’s a VERY tiny percentage of us.
I don’t know any type 1 diabetics over 65, personally. The vast VAST majority of diabetics over that age are type 2. If they need insulin, I’m glad they’re able to get it now, but this isn’t even close to helping solve the insulin situation for the people that need it most.
But the general public has zero knowledge of the differences between type 1 and 2, and really overestimate the percentage of insulin dependent diabetics that qualify for this .
Yeah type 1 is the genetically fucked not your fault but uncared-for diabetics in the USA. Type 2 are the generally shitty lifestyle types (I know it can be stress, etc but predominantly it's poor life choices c'mon now).
