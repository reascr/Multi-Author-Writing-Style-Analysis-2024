IMO: Yes Presidents should still have the power to unilaterally act during a crisis... the democratic process is often too slow and fraught with endless debates, arguing, and gerrymandering (edit: Filibusters) to get things done when they need to get done NOW.
Suspending evictions of people who were forced out of jobs due to covid, for example, was absolutely a good thing. Suspennding debt repayment because the workplace was massively effected was a good thing. Completely forgiving the debt was debatable, and certainly declaring an emergency to build a wall that was never going to work was out of bounds.
Using emergencies as a 'Tactic', should have some kind of oversight, but not to the degree of preventing its use when it's needed. I do like the idea of auto-expiring periods where extensions need to be confirmed.

It's a little different though because the democratic process isn't so slow. Often times parties have a majority and can really pass any bill they want.
