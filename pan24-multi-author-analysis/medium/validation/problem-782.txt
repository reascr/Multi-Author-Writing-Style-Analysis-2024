But in all seriousness, Turkey’s rampant inflation and collapsing economy is going to have major implications for the whole world and make other countries and the region less stable.
I feel like 85% inflation basically means you are in a failed economy and failed state. I mean what’s the point of working, saving, investing at that point? Other than to meet your basic needs. All trust in the financial system is lost and nobody will want to participate again for a very long time.
If you reach a high enough inflation rate, how do you get people to even work anymore…??? Like 85% inflation means money is becoming quite worthless, and the financial system that is supposed to support the economy is failed.
85% is not close to hyperinflation. Rule of thumb is it needs to be 50% per month which per year is 12,874.63%.
I’m not targeting Turkey with my comment here either. Venezuela, Zimbabwae, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, and many other countries today are facing hyperinflationary pressures.
A large, major industrial nation like Turkey having this kind of economic upheaval?? Bruh there is no way that is going to be contained to just Turkey.
