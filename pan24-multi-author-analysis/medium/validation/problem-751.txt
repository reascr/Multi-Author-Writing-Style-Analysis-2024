Oh yeah. Totally have access to the LAPD entire armory, bro. I like Putin so much, I'll give him all, man.
He does a drug raid and it’s like, imagine the front door barely busts open and it’s Steven segal lmao.
Edit: it’s hilarious to think about bc imagine smoking a joint and playing battlefield or whatever and fatassed Steven segal blows through the door lol, I’d be like….fucking what? Go away segal.
And yeah, it was probably around that time where the “Kunar province operator” was the rage for cops.
Sheriffs in Louisiana are allowed to deputize whoever the fuck they want. No certifications or training required so long as they're accompanied by a certified officer.
Are they in such bad shape that they can’t produce worthwhile and accurate precision sniper rifle ammo?
My favorite part is when the show claims he was deputized in the 80s and shows a grainy black and white photo clearly showing Seagal in all his 2000s fatness. Or all the law enforcement certificatons he claimed to have, all of which have been refuted by the issuing authorities.
