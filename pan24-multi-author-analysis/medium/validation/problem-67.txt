I am sick of the stupid "spy balloon" story. It shows me how easily the entire narrative in the US can be directed towards unimportant events. We aren't rioting over being expected to survive an economy where 90 percent of the revenue is taken off the top by a small minority of ridiculously wealthy people, we aren't demanding a total reformation of our police despite rampant abuse of power and corruption, we aren't taking any steps to prevent daily mass shootings, we aren't even mad that an entire political party is openly embracing fascism. We are yelling at a fucking balloon. The system is functioning as intended.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
