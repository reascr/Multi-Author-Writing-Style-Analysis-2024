And if North Korea sends troops to Ukraine, South Korea must seriously consider doing so as well, or at least a very large number of non--combatant Abrams and F-16 maintenance technicians, fully equipped. Just as Israel and Saudi Arabia Iraq, and Turkey must more than respond to what Iran has done in Ukraine. The Pacific Rim nations must respond to what China and India (after their abstention votes in the UN) are or are not, doing in Ukraine. As the worlds most populous neighbors, they both have the most to gain from the "support the non-aggressor" precedents increasingly being reinforced in Ukraine.
Even power outages in Ukraine might be less severe than in areas of NK. Can you imagine what their reactions will be when they enter places that are still largely intact? Food, services, basic conveniences? When you can get shot for watching a western movie in NK(if testimonies are true) - the chance to live free, to escape, and be hidden as a “ casualty of war”? I’d be screaming, “take it Defect and fight for Ukraine” I’d bet on that being the better choice by a mile.
