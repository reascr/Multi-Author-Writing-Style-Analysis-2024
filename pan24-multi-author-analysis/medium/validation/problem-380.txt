It's not though. Taiwan alone accounts for 65% of the semiconductors and 90% of the advanced chipsets manufactured worldwide. A large scale conflict in Taiwan causing manufacturing stoppages would cripple the global economy. It would make the multi-year chip shortage caused by covid look like a mere hiccup. Not to mention that if China were to gain control of those factories, they would then have the ability to inject whatever spyware they want in those products natively and create mass security threats in electronic systems everywhere.
That was like 25-30 years ago, China has made it extremely difficult for other countries to export stuff since, literally the only one that still does is the U.S, and even then a lot of arms packages given to Taiwan in the past 20 years have been pretty lackluster until now.
Also after from the la fayette deal that resulted in not only taiwan getting totally taken advantage of but also the deaths of around a dozen people involved, its unlikely they would go with the French again even if they could.
Though unlike Ukraine, my guess would would be that other nations would be far more willing to get directly involved in the fighting if Taiwan was invaded.
TSMC has basically made themselves the most invaluable company in the tech industry so yeah, nobody wants to see them fall into the CCPâ€™s grubby paws, outside of the CCP itself, and maybe Russia too.
