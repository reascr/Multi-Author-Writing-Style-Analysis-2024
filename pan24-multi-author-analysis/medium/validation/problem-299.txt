Well, history shows that this sophisticated surveillance balloon has been part of recognized Chinese territory for thousands of years, and as a part of traditional Chinese lands, the American warmongers have taken a disappointing action in violation of national sovereignty that requires a response.
China isn't a friend to the US and would very much prefer a "multipolar" world in which there are several world powers they could play off of one another and they could have a sphere of influence in which no one else could say anything about what they're doing. You know, a cold war or age of imperialism sort of scenario, only with them on top this time. Something that approximates the way China was in any time before the 1800s.
Itâ€™s still about the loss of face. They have projected this image, to their people, that they cannot lose, own everything they may have visited thousands of years ago, and are destined to rule the world.
It's also a pretty standard negotiation tacitc, if they do have talks with America they don't want to be on a back foot.
Yea and brinkmanship. The Americans publicly announced it (not saying that is wrong) and dealt with it. It leaves China having to either response or back down and they won't want to back down. So they will saber rattle a bit.
Let's face it, the US has outsized power and will use it aggressively. Sometimes for very good reasons. Sometimes for really petty and emotional ones. The US has the best military in the world and can put it anywhere they want, and they will do so for decades at a time even when that's not a good idea. The US has the leading world economy and is so interwoven into so much of the global economy that the 20% or so GDP badly undersells the influence the US has economically. The US also have a dizzying array of global alliances so that you're never facing off against just the US either.
Russia as well. That's why there is a war in Ukraine right now. It was supposed to cause a fatal breach in NATO between a dovish Germany and a hawkish Poland and Farnce, reveal the US as being too internally divided to support Ukraine and thus be untrustworthy, and maybe even cause such a bit of strife that an EU already wounded by Brexit might fold completely. The timing wasn't going to get better for a Russian attempt to overthrow the US-led world order, since time after Trump meant US would slowly regain some semblance of unity and credibility and the shocks caused by Brexit would end up overcome by European diplomacy.
Both China and Russia announced (and continue to reiterate) that the age of American dominance is over and a new world order in which the US is only one of many world powers with no special status to demand things like 'don't send ethnic minorities to camps'.
Of course, every time the US is able to present a unified front with their allies and convince Chinese neighbors to throw in with the US against China those claims from China are undercut. Just like every time the US delivers aid to Ukraine and the Russian military fails to defeat them the Russian claim that they are a leading world military is also badly undercut.
We can absolutely have a world order based on cooperation, but everyone would have to agree to ceding power to others. That's a hard sell, even relatively minor limits like the UK's membership in the EU imposed can be intolerable if the advantages aren't immediately obvious.
I, personally, doubt that these power struggles would get us. We can generally see these things coming. It's not the thing we see coming that will get us, it's either something unexpected and sudden or something quiet and slow that we won't be able to notice until its too late that will.
Except we are doing things about global warming. It's not a loss of competitiveness that stops people from cutting fossil fuels out completely. It's the loss of quality of life of citizens.
Global warming is one of the big challenges, but it's also something that will unfold over decades and centuries and therefore something we have time to do things about.
Things were the best they had ever been in human history. Even things falling off for a few years still puts us in an amazing place. No famines, a reasonable effective response to a plague, a good job market with historically competitive pay... Yeah, there's a hell of a lot wrong, but a lot of it was always wrong but we simply had bigger fish to fry. Now that we fixed most of the easy stuff we're left with the stuff that's really hard and to fix.
But we're actually aware that there are problems. Leaders come and go and are bound by public sentiment. Broken shit that leaders benefit from get fixed all the time. Reform is a constant process, sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't but nothing ever stays the same for long periods of time.
The fact of the matter is that Xi needs a signature success to hang his hat on. All the previous leaders had a signature policy that they can point to and say that was what made them great. Xi was originally on the "made China respected" train with the Olympics being a success and a 'coming out' party for China to be a co-equal on the world stage. Between that, the yuan becoming a reserve currency, and China taking the lead on a number of international organizations it seemed that was going to be the defining thing. But... a lot of that stuff didn't go great. The Winter Olympics they held a few years later had a lot of people questioning why there industrial parks mixed among the ski slopes and a lot of people were boycotting stuff over the treatment of the Uighur. So that ended up a bust.
Then it was "he stopped Covid". The harsh lockdowns stalled the pandemic in China even as it escaped to the rest of the world. If the harsh lockdowns keep Chinese people from suffering the way the rest of the world did then he'd win. Only, lockdowns only stall disease. They don't stop disease. Rather than having a signature policy exit strategy he kept on the lockdowns until the wheels came off.
Okay, so what other thing could Xi do in order to justify him being at the top for an unprecedented lenh of time? Well, there's only a couple of things since it needs to be grander than anything else he's tried. One of the big ones is "ending the civil war and integrating the foreign-dominated parts of China". Even Mao couldn't do that.
The problem is that there's not a good way to integrate the Nationalists on Taiwan. They aren't exactly going to willingly subjugate themselves to the whims of the CCP. Jumping the gun on Hong Kong and Macau makes any kind of talk about "one nation, two systems" into laughable nonsense. That leaves force.
