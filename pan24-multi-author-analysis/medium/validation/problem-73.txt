So, it’s 2023, and you risk your life as an American to raise a point in the Red Square, and this is it? Wow. Nevermind the cows, Russians are torturing children. Doesn’t sound like the most rational individual.

So I can respect some forms of vegan activism even if they can be controversial. However, to parade animals in a protest fashion, knowing the likelihood of you getting arrested is high and with no knowledge of what will happen to the animal post arrest, is completely hypocritical.
Yeah the first trade was awful and for a few minor political points but the dude is probably washed at this point. Like I said, my crystal ball is pretty good, and I think it’s better than yours. Probably no trade for this person.
Who was a minor celebrity and stumbled into prison through naive idiocy…. Vs no namer who was asking to get picked up.
