I was in Santeram a few months back and I noticed a guy with a young wife. They both had a lot of gold jewellery around their necks. Friend told me he must be in charge of a gold mine somewhere Para/Amazonia.
As a Brazilian, if I told you that our media is pretty fucked up, people would downvote me and call me fascist...
He has said several times that the indigenous groups should have been exterminated. He said that during the dictatorship, the military were incompetent and they should have killed all the natives. Heâ€™s not afraid of saying that type of shit. Every single decisions aimed at the natives were focused at harming them. This is 100% an intentional genocide (the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group).
Dude spent money that should go to aiding the natives with christian NGOs and companies owned by the illegal miners, leaving the native people to starve.
Media may be fucked up, but Bolsonaro's lies are far worse than that. Or you're gonna say we imported the hungry natives from Venezuela to make a scene?
Just a reminder: even without direct killing action, illegal mining poisons the land, leaving the natives with few resources to sustain themselves.
