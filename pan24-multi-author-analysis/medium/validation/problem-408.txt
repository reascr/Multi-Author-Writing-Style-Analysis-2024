Only could read the first paragraph ( paywall) but the brown woman in the photo seems to be the election denier. So probably not the best article to pivot to gender/race for no real reason.
There’s a good chance Trump wants to distance himself from that specific movement. It didn’t work out so far and is probably a bad investment into his 2024 run.
Still pretty crazy that people are so into the election claims that they value that over Trump’s actual pick.
This makes sense. The only reason Trump became an election-denier was because it was HIS election and it was a psychological defense mechanism to protect his fragile ego.
their thing is denialism, not trumpism. refusing the evidence at the end of their noses. fantasy land. Typically any white man with the potential to grab pussy (which means they are cisgender) will do. But women and minorities seem to be on the move within it, which is the weirdest thing to see. Maybe it's a grab for wider appeal by burying the misogynistic parts of Trump's legacy?
My comment was about voters. Really not sure what the angle was for the reply. Poc can be grifters but lets never forget about white men?
I don’t know how you get people who don’t want to think about racial inequality to do so. But if bringing it up every opportunity on the internet even when its not quite relevant was ever going to work it the problem would be solved by now.
