What if we're in a movie trailer and the Transformers, the Fallout Series, and the Simpsons for that matter are all only relevant to us since we're in that trailer?
Since January we’ve been living inside a Transformers trailer. There is no other explanation for the combination of dizzying technological progress and ominous if not nonsense events.
Music’s better at least in Fallout, even if there is way too much reliance on atomic vehicles as opposed to semiautonomous electric ones. Butcher Pete playing.
This is a big step, but not the grail, that would be stable plasma confinement in a tokomak. This does allow us to gather a lot of data on fusion reactions, a notoriously difficult circumstance to achieve.
You ever watch a movie which makes a reference to some mass media thing which only exists within the canon of that film? Think like how in the Simpsons, they have Itchy & Scratchy, but it only exists within the Simpsons.
Ignition was achieved a few years ago, this was ignition with an energy output greater than the laser energy, a first ever. Laser confinement is not considered a viable energy source however, it is not turning into electricity, rather they measured the heat energy released (or some other similar method). The point is that reliable, repeatable fusion reactions can give a lot of insight into how to get successful conditions for this and other fusion reactions.
