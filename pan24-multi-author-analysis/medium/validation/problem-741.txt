So this is how far Russia has come since Khrushchev's attack against Stalinism. They errect statues to long gone tyrant and they theorise reverting the name of the city back to him.
Khrushchev would be rolling in his grave that still people in power laud this mass murdering psychopath. Putinism in a nut shell.
No support for renaming it back to its original of Царицын (Tsaritsyn— Tsar’s station) I guess, for the same “historical” (bullshit) reasons, amirite?
A recent survey conducted by state pollster VTsIOM found that 67% of residents in Volgograd, Russia are against renaming the city to Stalingrad, which was its name from 1925 to 1961 in honor of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. In contrast, 26% of the city's population of nearly 1 million people support the idea of reverting to Stalingrad, with 14% citing historical significance and 12% referencing the memory of the Great Patriotic War. Meanwhile, 21% of those who oppose the name change believe it would be expensive, 12% consider it pointless, and 11% think it is too focused on the past. Putin has stated that he would not object to the renaming if the residents of Volgograd support it. The 80th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad will be commemorated this week, and Putin is expected to visit the city.
