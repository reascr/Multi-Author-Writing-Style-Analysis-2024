Russia just announced they are expanding to 1.5 million troops. US commits another $2.5 billion including armored vehicles. A shitload of additional support announced from other Ukraine allies today.
Probably not, but Russia can’t keep this up forever. Their financial and Human Resources are being expended. Ukraine is obviously suffering but as long as NATO countries continue to provide aid, Ukraine can keep it up however long is needed.
Quickest way this ends is with Putin being removed or Russia collapsing. Which might happen. But also might not and if not, it’ll be a grind until Russia is pushed out.
The more innocents that the Russians kill, the less likely Ukraine is going to be to want to negotiate. You don't negotiate with people who murdered your family and drove you away from your home. Early on in the conflict, maybe, but the longer this drags on, the more Ukraine's resolve is just going to strenhen.
The Nazis learned this about the Russians themselves in WWII… not that either side wanted to negotiate, but the atrocities definitely hardened the Soviets.
