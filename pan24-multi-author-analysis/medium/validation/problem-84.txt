Read the fcking article. "Assistant" professor that said it is a japanese himself, and his suggestion of mass suicide of the old people made him a celebrity in japan among the youths.
Also it seems like he's carrying a bit of a personal cross and some trauma here tbh. Bit of edgelord behavior imho.
A lot of faculty are edge-lords. I went to Yale and the majority of the professors I knew there had serious personality flaws. You don’t get hired at a place like that because you’re a well rounded person, you get there because you’ve poured your entire life into a single academic area and the politics that come with it. The result is that most of these people are adult children with massively underdeveloped social skills and empathy.
The vast majority of people I went to school with were good people and are doing good things now. You get shitty people from anywhere and they all find ways to succeed. Just because someone went to an Ivy doesn’t make them bad and just because someone went to a state school doesn’t make them good. Wall Street pulls from everywhere and they are equally bad.
Let's not pretend that there isn't an enormous amount of nepotism, politics, and money that goes into Ivy League acceptances.
And if the Queen had balls we'd call her King, I don't think it's unrealistic to start preparing for hard times.
