How could they legally lie about that? Thats what I dont understand . How did they get away with that from a legal point of view? Why does nobody ask where that money is?
Second, I don't know, really. I know UK doesn't have the same free speech rights that the US does, but I imagine that people can't really be charged to significantly for just driving a bus around with words on it.
They've been caught multiple times funding and spreading far-right nationalism is many countries so ya, they did play a large role in the right wing craziness we've seen the last 6 or so years.
The world needs to wake up and realize this is happening everywhere. The rise of far right nationalism and other alt right ideologies isn't an accident. In every single instance you can ask "what adversarial nation would benefit most from this?" and every single time the answer will be Russia.
Funny you're oblivious to democracy being under attack around the world. It's already happened in Europe - see Hungary. The US just saw an attempt to overthrow the Constitution. Democracy in Brazil has been under constant attack. None were by left leaning people. Does it happen? Of course. It's just far more likely and is happening with right leaning people.
I'm sorry if that offends you but it's reality. If it were left leaning groups I'd be calling them out. If it's left leaning groups in 50 years I'll call them out. But just look back over the last 4 decades and think about which groups overwhelmingly commit terrorism. Far right lunatics. The manipulation works the same with terrorists as it does with far right authoritarians. It's much easier to radicalize conservative minded people. Just look at history. And it's happening now with conservative minded people.
Remember though, it doesn't matter what you're ideology is when democracy is destroyed. Either way, you and I no longer have a choice in laws, policy, or domestic and foreign affairs. I could care less about your political views but I know if you lean right, the odds of you being radicalized is far greater.
But that's besides the point. The topic at hand is an authoritarian regime manipulating the populace of other nations to erode support for their democracy, push policies that negatively impact the other nation (Brexit), and sow unrest and dissent.
We are talking about nations that overwhelmingly support democracy and have been democratic for a long time being manipulated with propaganda to erode the systems that have made their country very successful. Your comment makes no sense.
What? The United States had been democratic for it's entire existence. Most western countries have been for generations.
I know you think you're making a point but you're not. Nothing you're saying makes any sense whatsoever. Frankly, your comments are willfully ignorant. Not to mention you can't even stay on topic and pick one thing to counter while ignoring the rest.
Figured you were one of those iamverysmart folks. Which is why you refute small things thinking it invalidates the entire point.
To which I responded democratic nations that have democratic for a long time are under attack by autocratic nations.
I don't think you're capable of making coherent points let alone coherent arguments. I have no interest in arguing with you. You are typical of ppl jumping into discussing several comments in and arguing things out of context. I don't care about your opinion, nothing you've said even makes sense, and sorry to be blunt but you're an idiot.
No, 200+ years isn't a long time in the history of the world. But the context for the statement is important. The US has been democratic for 10 generations. That's a long time. So some western European nations have been democratic for 3 generations. That's a long time. It's all they've known and all their parents knew.
Lol what??? More than half the countries in the world are democratic. Support for democracy worldwide is still very strong.
What examples can you provide of far right nationalism and other far right ideas in countries that would benefit China or the US the most?
>"The indictment outlines a campaign so effective at reaching American voters, US businesses began paying the Russians to run promotional material. The IRA would charge the businesses - presumably unaware who was behind the account - between $25-$50 per post.".
Of course, you can't answer this. So save your "everyone does it" bullshit. Even if that were true, no one is dumb enough to state that the world would be better off with Russian ideologies instead of American ideologies.
Weird you conclude it's far fetched but Boris Johnson's government prevented an inquiry into it then eventually your government was inconclusive while admitting Russian troll farms had been actively putting a significant effort into influencing UK politics.
Really makes you wonder why you're deliberately claiming something that is objectively false and easy to research through a simple Google search. Are you purposely ignorant or deliberately pushing false indignation? It can only be one or the other.
