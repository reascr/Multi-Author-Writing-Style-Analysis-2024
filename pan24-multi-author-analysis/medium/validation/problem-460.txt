Personally I'm still surprised by the number of former Republican leaders (from the suburban small business wing of the party) who went from being anti-Trump to now just outright Biden supporters.
Wisconsin's right seems to have a grudging respect for him despite everything they've been told about Democrats since 1996.
I was talking with some guy who was convinced Trump would beat Biden in a debate if they debated again...fundamentally not realizing that Biden won his one debate with Trump with the voters he needed by being annoyed with Trump. That resonated with everyone who wasn't in Trump's base.
Biden's no nonsense, gets shit done, and just a bit ornery. That appeals to a large cross-section of Americans. It's also why things like "Dark Brandon" got turned into a meme.
