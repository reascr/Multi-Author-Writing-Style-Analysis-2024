Or that this spending is a direct reaction to a major world event and won’t likely continue in future years so it’s just saving 2% for one year. Maybe two?
You got some subtraction very wrong there. At this point I think you’re doing the math wrong just to mess with me.
At the same time, the plan would raise the age at which Medicare kicks in, which is still 65, to match the Social Security age. Given the Social Security proposal, this means delaying Medicare eligibility by five years, to the age of 70, and possibly delaying it even further in the future. Jesus.
True. I am agree with you. You are right. In case, some people are unable to bootstrap due to access issues, such as a health issue and other factors.

Are you trying to count interest from the fund? You can’t balance the budget with that if the fund is being depleted because the interest goes away. Even if you did balance the budget with that, COLA is the highest it has been in decades, inflation fast outpacing the meager interest. We need a self-sustaining SSA and the only way to do that is to take in as much money as it disburses.
Not to mention that SS comes from a legally mandated separate fund distinct from the general budget. But then we’re leaving basic mathematical literacy and moving into an understanding of US government and that’s for next class.
Again, basic mathematical literacy would be so nice. SS disburses that much every year. So the deficit would still grow every year. The savings would still be just under 4% for the cost of an enormous amount of soft power.
I absolutely agree with you that the military budget of $773 billion is incredibly bloated and should be cut. And to make up the deficit in SS, we just need to cut it by 37.8%. Good luck with that.
You came in stone-first. If you want a respectful discourse, don’t start by being a jerk. It’s really that easy.
I want to kindly respond your message. Unfortunately, may I ask you a question that the Conservative member of the Supreme Court will hear? I pray. hopefully, they will listen this issue.
