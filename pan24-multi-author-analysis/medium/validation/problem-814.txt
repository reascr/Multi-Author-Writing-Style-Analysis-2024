You spend your entire life sheltered and hidden away, your family life has got to be absolutely fucked, and then one day you inherit leadership of the most fucked up country on the planet. What are you supposed to do? Enacting any sort of change might get you assassinated by your generals/ family/ elite class. You can’t just leave, again you’d probably be assassinated and you also don’t have any wealth beyond the country. Diplomatically who do you reach out to? Your country has spent the last half century being the boogeyman & laughing stock of the world and your options for world super powers & regional powers are Russia and China 2 shitty authoritarian governments, America who you have legitimate historical beef with for flattening every building in your country back in the 50s, Japan who has never admitted fault for WW2, and South Korea which really does not want to deal with your shit. Even if you could throw up your hands and say fuck it and hand the country over to South Korea they probably wouldn’t take it, and/or it would star a war with China.
Americans laughing all day at your “Nodong” missiles, your bestie Donald got fired, all your townsfolk just pretend to like you, and no one believes your dad hit 18 hole-in-ones with 17 strokes that one time in the summer of 98’ after the best pizza party ever.
