Why on earth would Trump ever be tough on China, though? They were funneling money to him via his hotels when he was in office, and they gave his daughter a ton of trademarks. He even pays more taxes to China than he does to the US.
How do you retroactively do something? Build a time machine and go back in time to shoot it down? Didn't tell anyone? Well someone knew at some point...do you mean didn't tell the public?
That doesn't mean ignored. Ignored is them flying over, knowing they are currently flying over, and deciding not to do anything or say anything.
If someone is poking you and you decide to do nothing, that's ignoring...if some one pokes you, you don't realize it until a few days later when you have a bruise...that's not ignoring it, that's just realizing it after the fact.
