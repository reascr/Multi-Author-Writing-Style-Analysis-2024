This is like the 20th article I've seen on this, they didn't admit to enriching uranium to 84%, they just admitted that someone has said they did. They are still denying it.Why is this news.
I'll imagine it'll take more than a missile strike. You'll probably find a lot of the infrastructure is underground/far away from Israel. If it was ad simple as a missile strike they would of done it by now.
The moment a nation builds a nuclear stockpile is the moment it becomes so much harder to mess with that nation. Any military action taken against a nuclear-armed nation becomes much riskier due to the possibility of nuclear retaliation.
Not really , countries with nukes can potentially fight them as MAD policy comes in which prevents both from using nukes but conventional war and weakening the other guy works , what Iran needs to do is build a stockpile of nukes( about 200, the region’s average amount ) and missile systems and then do a test to publicly show the world that they are a nuclear country , after that it depends on politics , whether war or discussions occur , the only thing that is stopping Iran from doing the above is that they signed the NPT so they can’t legally make nukes , while Israel , Pakistan and India didn’t sign the treaty and thus were allowed to keep their nukes as they weren’t subject to the NPT and negotiations occurred which led to the power heiarchy of the world to remain stable.
