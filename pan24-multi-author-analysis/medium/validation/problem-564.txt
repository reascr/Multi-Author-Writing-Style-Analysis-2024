Inside is a picture of him serving at a soup-kitchen for the poor when he was middle-aged. The next picture is him graduating from the seminary.
Next is a picture of his wife and child who were killed many years ago, when he was much younger. A tear comes to his eye as he kisses the picture and turns it over, face down.
The last picture is him as a smiling bright-faced young man accepting a silver medal...as an Olympic rifleman.
Ukraine recently received the artillery ammo capable of hitting every square inch of occupied territory (sans Crimea).
Because of this NOWHERE in the occupied territories is now safe for Russians and their supplies. Every single one of them can now be targeted at any point.
Ukraine also has a well trained (by west) and heavily present partisan movement behind enemy lines. They pass coordinates to strategic buildings (soldier hotels, ammo depots, heavily guarded places) to long range artillery which takes them out swiftly. Nobody wants to be in those places now, especially high ranking people and politicians.
