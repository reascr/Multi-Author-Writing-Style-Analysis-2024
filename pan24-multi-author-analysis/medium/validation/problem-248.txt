ITS TWITTER WHY DO PEOPLE CARE SO MUCH. FUCK TWITTER, YOU CAN LITERALLY POST ANYTHING YOU WANT AND THE FACT STANDS IT LITERALLY MEANS NOTHING. I really don’t know why people are sooooooo obsessed with twitter. I could literally post about the shit I took this morning. Why do people follow this shit like the gospel. People literally sleep, eat, and live for the shit that’s on twitter when it absolutely means nothing. Here’s a proposal… everyone who sees this should delete their twitter and never use it again. I’m sure the impact on your life would be very minimal. Hell you might even save yourself a headache each day. Like really guys who the fuck cares. These crazy mfs will get their word out one way or another. Why’s it gotta revolve around some dumb ass social media platform.
