It sounds like the person you replied to was speaking generally, and not necessarily that the US has the highest standard of living. Regardless, just like there are quality of life differences between living in different parts of Europe, there are big differences between different US regions and states (many of which have economies and populations that rival whole EU nations). With regards to metrics, many US states rank high and compare favorably, but the overall rankings are often dragged down by certain states. My own experience as an immigrant to the US with family friends in various parts of EU, UK and Israel is that the US is still one of the best places to live, especially for immigrants.
I can't imagine how utterly delusional you have to be to say America has the highest standard of living in history. While yes, you can't compare the Taliban and the GOP, America sits in the mid-twenties in every ranking of Quality of Life, even ones made by Americans. Among western countries, america is one of the worst places to live.
