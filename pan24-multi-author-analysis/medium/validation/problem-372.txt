Hilarious that these idiots still cling to the idea of small government when every Republican since Nixon has expanded the federal government’s powers. Same with fiscal responsibility. The deficit balloons under Republican presidents. It’s all a joke. They’ve got nothing to offer except tax breaks for the rich and self righteous anger. That’s it.
Spot on. The GOP is not known for their introspection. Their only solution to losing elections is to change the rules, gerrymander, and suppress votes. It's never their shitty policy ideas.
Yup, The voters used to be conservative. This is why even Democratic presidents were conservative or moderate, but the voters are becoming more liberal and progressive-leaning. The GOP knows this so for them to stay in power they either need to change or end free elections. They have picked to end free elections.

Young millennial and Gen Z voters now outnumber voters over age 65. They can have all the power if they vote in high enough numbers. In this election, only 27% of voters under age 30 voted, but they voted 65% Democrat. Look at the result. Imagine if even half of them voted.
