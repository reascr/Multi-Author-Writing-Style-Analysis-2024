Did you visit outside the rich cities? Most places are like hellholes, poor, isolated and full of garbage and misery. Many are unemployed, addicts and/or have HIV. The rest are alcoholics that get hammered every day with cheap russian vodka. There is no future for anyone. A total misery of a country. The wealth is concentrated around moscow and st.petes.
Putin lies about everything. I would not trust his surrender agreement. The best move is exactly what is being done - support Ukraine in all ways possible, ignore Lavrov as a meaningless slob of a blithering human, wait for Putin to die, and take a piss on his grave.
Exactly, there is no point in listening to anything Russia is saying, whether it's about what they have done, what they are doing, or what they will do.
But hey arguing semantics over a country whoâ€™s government is committing genocide says a lot more about you then this guy .
Its people need to figure out that this isn't what they want for their future. Until they do and act upon it, their country remains what it is.
