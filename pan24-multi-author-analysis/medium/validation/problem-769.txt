And when it didn't, did she lose faith? Or maybe she thought somebody scammed her by selling her fake holy water...
Agreed. Gay people don’t have a choice under Christianity but to live a life in the closet, or to live a double life. Most Christians are homophobic pieces of shit. Especially Catholics who pretend that their religion didn’t rape and murder millions of people in the name of God. I’ll be clear in that i believe in the faith that people have in Jesus, but I hate the institutions and I especially hate their hateful, mysoginistic and homophobic preaching. Gay people deserve better than to be a part of that bullshit. There are better ways of belonging in the world - of being a part of a civilized and inclusive society - which gives people a sense of meaning and fulfillment. Fellowship isn’t relegated to only the church with its typical hypocritical male at the pulpit.
The fact that they didn't burn or melt upon contact with the holy water should be a pretty clear indicator to this woman that at least some portion of her beliefs are incorrect.
