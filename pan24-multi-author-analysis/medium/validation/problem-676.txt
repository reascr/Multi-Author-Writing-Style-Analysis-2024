I mean, I’m not so well versed in modern Catholic or Radical Protestant (common rabble) interpretations, but I know it’s tied up in one of those irreconcilable doctrinal disputes between the different churches of the Anglican Communion.
Now I’m a High Church Episcopalian type. I came down on Archbishop Laud’s side of the Golden Fence. And although this is America and we’re a Republic and bow to no King these days (other than the one in Heaven, of course), I take my Processions with Incense and bend at the HIGH ALTER for communion from one common chalice, NOT with the rabble at the low alter like some Low Church types or, God forbid, from little separate glasses in pews like some Puritanical Savages.
