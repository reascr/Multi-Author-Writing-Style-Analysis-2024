My guess is they craft an opinion that allows some check on state courts to intervene but nothing close to the worst case scenario that the NC attorneys are asking for.
You can’t always tease out a justice’s position from oral arguments, but in this case quite a few of them seemed pretty hostile to the argument NC lawyer was making, with only Gorsuch and Alito being full throated in their support of a maximalist idea of the independent state legislature theory. Even Thomas didn’t seem all that enthused.
Even that still isn't a great result. We'd probably end up in 2030 dealing with a bunch of legislatures doing what Ohio did: running out the clock by repeatedly submitting unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps and getting them struck down over and over again until it reaches the point that it's too late for a new map and the election goes ahead with a gerrymandered one.
