So it says that the religious exemption is only for non-profits. While the legal protections in terms of the government and what marriage grants you is good... But are we sure we want to force people to participate in things that they disagree with religiously, or even if it is something that they don't like? Since there isn't a problem in finding people to make your wedding website, bake your wedding cake, or anything else like that I can't understand why the government can force you to participate in something you don't want to be part of. What happens when it is something you disagree with down the line? My inner libertarian comes out for stuff like this and I can't help but be against anything that forces someone to participate in an activity they don't want to. Like, just hire someone else.
Kind of. Yeah. It's been working out fine. Especially if it is religious. How can the government tell you to participate in something that you believe is a sin and has been stated so even before said government existed? And either way, it isn't discrimination when it is fundamentally different.
And yes, this is fundamentally different from interracial marriage because that is just skin color. Same-sex marriage is different because man and woman actually serve a different purpose in terms of the family and reproduction element which is what marriage is kind of about.
