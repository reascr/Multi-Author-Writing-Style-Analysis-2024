The history of the future is still unwritten. The bulk of fossil fuels are in the ground. There are forests yet standing.
Thank you! I tried to research what happened and found very little. The son of the last president reported that all board members were actively working to destroy the company, (probably a major crime) and all the president could do was keep a good shareholder payout.
Whatâ€™s really dumb is those carbon industries could have got off their ass and started up the new energy systems, and would be getting even richer. Gulf Corp was working on this in the 1960s. They were the high tech company that found most of the oil throughout most of the 20th century using the gravity sensor.
The oil companies as a group all decided to hire the tobacco-cancer denial machine instead of transitioning to renewables. Sad to think of the world we could have had otherwise.
I was wishing the research data was findable. They were breeding a bacteria to eat oil, maybe for oil spill reclamation and other things. I said at the time that solar electric seemed impractical, but the lead scientist said just give it time.
