JERUSALEM, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court ordered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to remove a senior minister over a past tax fraud conviction, in a setback for the new right-wing coalition government.
The 10-to-one ruling on Shas party leader Aryeh Deri looks likely to further stoke tensions between the Cabinet and Israel's Supreme Court over government reform plans which aim to rein in the top court.
They cannot allow such a ridiculous law--the ability to overrule the High Court with a simple majority--to pass. It would mean that the legislative can ignore any and every law, to the point of even getting rid of democracy altogether. Such a law won't make Israel undemocratic, but it will enable an autocratic takeover, which means it cannot be allowed to pass because it threatens Israel's democracy.
Not if the High Court trash that law, which it should. If it doesn't, then it would mean the government could theoretically delete the courts, legislation, and executive, and install a fascist theocracy with a king (to take an extreme example) with absolutely no legal mechanism to stop them.
Castrating the High Court with no constitution or any other mechanism to rein in a potentially corrupt legislative will mean Israel won't be a democracy anymore--as far as democracy is actually defined, which requires: suffrage, 3 branches of power (judicial, legislative, executive) with separation of powers implemented, a free press, human rights to prevent suppression of voters, and as a KPI of sorts for how well it performs: the transfer of power.
A law that will allow Israel to become undemocratic (and also instantly makes it a flawed democracy, even more flawed than the U.S.) is, by virtue, an undemocratic law, which should be straightforward for the courts to overrule.
Israel is Jewish and Democratic and any law that attempts to contradict the characteristics of the state--as defined in the Basic Laws and the declaration of independence--is is an invalid law. Or so the Supreme Court is supposed to rule.
Not yet. This ruling is incredibly soft and allows Deris party to retain his ministries, and for Deri to remain a member of knesset (even though he's signed a plea deal as a condition of one of his convictions promising that he won't return to public life). As well, the government is planning to pass laws which allow a simple majority in the knesset to overrule the supreme court, effectively nullifying it. So the battle is far from won.
This is not merely a summary. 'Jewish' and 'Democratic' is in the Basic Law defining Liberty in the State of Israel.
The Basic Law even goes to expressly forbid the ability to change the Basic Law, even under a state of emergency, so the executive can't circumvent it and the Knesset can't legislate the word democratic out of it, either.
He's basically the one to be blamed for the Oslo accords - the one that gave Israel 0 benefits, and only launched an Intifada against us, where terror attacked by the Palestinians only grew stronger, buses exploded left and right, daily terror attacks throughout Israel. It only caused misery to the Israelis and didn't help one bit to the peace in the area - especially since the PA shortly after dropped the act and didn't do anything from what was promised.
Nothing from what was promised happened by the PA, hundreds of civilians died, thousands got injured, people couldn't feel safe walking in the street of their house in Tel Aviv without fearing being bombed by a Palestinian. But yay That was sure helpful and didn't only help the PA killing more civilians with the more control they now have.
Safe allowance for Jews to Joseph's tomb? Nope, everytime terrorists shoot the soldiers accompanying the incoming Jews who just want to pray, and throw dozens of molotovs each week (the video from this week you just see literally fire driving around because of so many molotovs). Acknowledging Israel's right to exist? Nope. Stopping terrorists? Happen, but barely and probably more for the own benefit. They have a rule of paying blood money to terrorists who are jailed in Israel for killing a civilian.
