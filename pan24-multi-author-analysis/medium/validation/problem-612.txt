Yes that's what we are all mentioning. Russians are lying and the figure of 600 they gave is similar to what Ukraine probably took out a few days ago. So they mention a similar number for their base back home to show they are doing something and that they got revenge.
The thing about projection though is that the idea provides a tool for understanding people's psyche, and an important part is that it is an unconscious impulse. The way I understand it, it can either be expressed as a defense mechanism defending one's own deep-down known faults, projecting the same motivations on others — "yes I do this, sure, but look, everybody does" — or maybe it's just because they think that way and so just assume everybody does: when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail.
The difference between these two ideas is pretty subtle and I may not have explained it well enough, but either way I'd argue this isn't what Russia is doing. There's nothing unconscious about it. It's a very conscious fabrication meant to change the subject away from criticism for having done something stupid..
Then again, maybe this does still fit the definition of projection, I don't know. You may be right. All I can say for sure is it's not an unconscious defense mechanism driving a neurosis but rather an intentional act meant to create a known false belief.
I can somewhat sympathize for the poor son-of-a-bitch who's so full of anger about being abused that he sees nothing in the world around him but hatred, in turn justifying his own anger. That hypothetical person may live in an awful hell, but is trapped.
