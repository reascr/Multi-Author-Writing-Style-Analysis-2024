I read Bolton’s book and watch his commentary a lot, he’s very anti-trump and takes every opportunity he can to explain that Trump is incompetent, a liar, and unfit for office. Why would he take votes from Trump?
nobody loves a Woman more than me! and I have much better words, Greater Words than Little Michael Bolton ok, I won a lot of Grammys and other Incredible Awards, but it was covered up by the Fake News Media because they don't want to admit that I'm good at so many things, believe me.
Loser John Bolton, a Complete Hack (& Psycho) wants to try and Run against my Winning Campaign, when he couldn't even win Local Dogcatcher a Two Time (& many more!) Loser just like Crooked Hillary & Sleepy Joe. TREASON???
No don't be so sure. A hard and heavy part of Trump's base is weird hawkish people who hate some foreign country. Foreign policy nationalism is pretty much Bolton's reason for existing.
It's wild people are laughing at this, because the people that "MAGA" dogwhistling is really meant to target know and love John Bolton. He's like their dream candidate.
