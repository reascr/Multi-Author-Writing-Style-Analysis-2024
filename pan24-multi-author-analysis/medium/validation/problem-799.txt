Its not conservatives, it is this new wave of "MAGA-Republicans". These are people who are less ideologically driven and more so do/believe whatever the orange Umpalumpa posts on Truth Social. Luckily the traditional Neo-Cons still have a hard on for the military industrial complex, so the weapons will keep being shipped.
You see the problem is they heard that this could be a good thing and ran miles and miles in the other direction because they couldn't have their good name tarnished by something as trivial as helping people.
Nothing that Trump supported policy wise was new for conservatives, they all want the same bullshit he did, they just prefer to be less open about how terrible they are rather than announce it to the world as matter of pride. His overall goals were no different from countless Republicans before him.
Edit: also they want him gone because he hurts their ability to win, not as a matter of principle. If principle had even the smallest part to play in the decision, they wouldn't have ever voted for him.
We call them fascists, and they step in line to whatever their dogmatic dictator demands. Dear Leader says screw putin? They hate him. Next day Dear Leader says putin's the best? All hail Russia.
