It’s broken at every level. The privates and corporals don’t have adequate training, their are no NCOs to lead them and the lowest ranking officers aren’t generally leading the assaults. The mid ranking officers are often 100km behind the lines and don’t really know what is going on on the ground meanwhile competent high ranking officials are considered a risk to Putin so the overall war is being managed by incompetent generals. Meanwhile at every step you have micro management and the pursuit of arbitrary political goals.
This is a classic Russian response to direct public anger towards lower ranking officials, and deflect it from the Tsar/General Secretary/President.
In this situation, the "Tsar" would be Putin and the "boyars" are the oligarchs. Here's another quote that explains Russian way of thinking:
It’s not a surprise when Russia has lost so much of its command units. They’ve lost so many colonels and officers they don’t really know how to fight anymore.
The Russian military structure is a mess but that said they have the shown the ability to put half a million men into the field, 5,000 tanks and pump tens of millions of shells at Ukrainian forces. Even an “incompetent” army of that scale can’t be beaten easily.
The “spoiled” and “decadent” view of the west also helps explain Putin’s logic when invading. He, wrongly, assumed that the west was overly materialistic, greedy and weak. He also believed western commitment to things like democracy, sovereignty and a rules based international order were just lies.
This line of thinking resulted in Putin concluding that the west would never apply serious sanctions to Russia and would easily choose cheap Russian fossil fuels over commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty.
