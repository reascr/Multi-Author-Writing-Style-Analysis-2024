I wonder if Lushenkos regime fell that would spark the Russians to seek democracy ending the war. Sometimes key to end is not obvious but I’ve no idea.
Not a politician here, but for now it may be beneficial to keep luka where he is until putin and his regime gets removed. Otherwise putin may 'annex' Belarus. This way putin has his clown there who is a moron but at the same appears to keep his distance from putin.
If Putin goes it's going to be the head of Wagner group or Chechnya that seize power. Russia and the world will be no better off. Many, many people need to be removed from influence and power in order for Russia to have an optimal path forward. Those people that should be in power aren't ruthless enough to seize it.
And considering the Kadyrovite “elite” units have proven to be as much a paper tiger as the Russian military as whole has. If you’re referring to the Chechen mafia which displaced the ethnic Russian mafia at home then I would also say that’s probably pretty unrealistic.
I don’t like that idea, as much as I’m a progressive I also believe that states need to be linguistically rather than racially or ethnically homogenous. Thus I would support the annexation of the remaining polish and/or Lithuanian speaking communities that are contiguous with their home countries. The rest of Belarus, the Belarusian and most likely Russian speaking areas as well smooth the sake of not making an unholy landmass of a country akin to Middle Francia.
