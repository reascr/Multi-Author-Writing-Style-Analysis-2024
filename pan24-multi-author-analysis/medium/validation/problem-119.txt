Am I missing something here, or does this post completely ignore the reality of just about every civil war or domestic genocide or ethnic cleansing ever?
We need to stop demonizing people who we have tensions with and trying to appeal to their more accommodating section of their population and let them lead the change. These people are willing to act as a shield. When the incidence of outrage reaches it's absolute point, it will reflect what kind of change they are willing to fight for. When young jews are ordered to shoot other jews in protest, how will the nationalists deny they haven't murdered their own. The schism is real there and obviously being on the correct side of history feels much more appealing. Let's stamp out all forms of organized fascist conspiracies.
Easy - they turn them in to "others" same way they always do. They're not Israelis - they're traitors that want to destroy the Jewish people and drive us from our homeland. There's nothing new about this playbook, and fascists necessarily don't have a strong relationship with reason or truth. I'm all for supporting local elements opposing fascism, but we need to recognise the steps that are taken to prime people for genocide. Look at the rhetoric of the Republican Party for examples of the spectrum of how this is done - targeting leftists, "sexual deviants", minorities, women, the poor, etc.
