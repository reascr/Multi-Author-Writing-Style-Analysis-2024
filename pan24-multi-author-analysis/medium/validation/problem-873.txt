Imports of Brazilian meat (i.e. exports of our meat) are one among the two biggest drivers in new deforestation, as we already have enough cattle and farmland to feed our entire population. Exported Brazilian beef reached sales of almost 10 billion USD in 2021. Soybeans are the second major culprit too, but it's basically only China that buys them at massive scale (70% of our soybean exports go to China, totaling 38 billion USD in 2021), and it's hard to spread awareness there.
Demand for Brazilian beef (and soybeans if at all possible) worldwide needs to go down. Buy beef from countries other than us.
On the other hand, Amazon forest is so huge that it will be no easy thing to do. Still, it might help if more resources are allocated in search and destroy mission of equipments and if possible arrest the miscreants. Make it expensive for the companies to continue illegal logging.
If Brazilian government is serious about protecting its natural resource they need to crack down on rogue companies clearing the forest illegally.
The more advanced technology and systems the world can throw at us (or help us implement) to help track the loggers, miners, and forest burners, the better.
Well, we welcome any serious help. (We are already hurting our traditional peoples enough; we definitely don't need companies pulling PR stunts and helping make things worse.).
I agree. The problem is too big for Brazil to handle it alone. I wish other countries would be more proactive to help solve this issue because in the end, if Amazon forest is destroyed everyone will suffer in the end.
