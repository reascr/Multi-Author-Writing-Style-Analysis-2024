Its not to hide that they got killed. It's simply to do exactly the same as the mafia saying "Real nice shop you have. It wold be a shame if something happened to it..".
They didn't say they killed him. But if you happen to be in a position where you consider bailing out on Putin. You know exactly what kind of accident you are going to face..
The problem is steering your life towards that career path in the first place. They likely have standard meetings on those floors. One day, the elevator opens to several KGB or whoever and you're hit with a stun gun or something.
Ironically, when I was last in Russia, the window at my accommodation (Soviet-era apartments) was so badly made that you could see many warps in the glass from manufacturing. Sub-standard glue wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. It's not what happened here (obvs.), but low quality products aren't uncommon.
This narative that they’re throwing their own higher ups out the window is funny at this point. Maybe NATO spies are doing this and they’re not getting any credit .
Because I'd someone like MSB invites you to a meeting on the roof, or wants to show you the beautyful view. You're going to accept.
They know that you know it wasn't no damn accident. They know that you know that it was MSB or whatever agency that did it.
The whole point to be so blatantly lying is that you know what's going to happen if you try to leave Putins side there.
