2. Russians are forcefully displacing people 2a) so Russian soldiers are free to steal washing machines, 2b) so locals don't help Ukrainian army, 2c) so locals don't tell about Russian war crimes, etc.
The fact that Putin himself is taking the responsibility of telling people to leave the city has me worried. It makes me think he might use a tactical nuke there, or is another commenter mentioned, he might blow the dam and flood that whole area.
As horrible as blowing that damn would be, I really don't want him to use the tactical nuke. That sends the whole world into uncharted territory, and I don't think I have enough canned food stored up to survive a nuclear winter.
Man, I've got a bad feeling about this. Normally these evacuations and retreats happen almost after the fact and Putin never talks about them.
I think blowing up a dam is also unlikely, but could happen should Ukrainian army fail to de-mine it and start crossing to the other side.
I think Russians will retreat to the other riverbank and that's probably going to be the end of Kherson offensive, unless Ukrainian army has a way to conduct sustainable operations across the river.
