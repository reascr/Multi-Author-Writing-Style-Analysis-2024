There are still more boomers out there as of today. Trump is the first person to hold the office who has made it clear he has not read The Constitution and the little he knows of it he finds repulsive. He's a boomer and holds sway over many boomers. The boomers are the first generation in American history to deliberately trash the legacy of their parents and attempt to destroy the future of their children. Once they destroy The Constitution, we are all fucked. Once it's gone, no one gets to keep anything. Nothing. Boomers were also known as the "me" generation, nothing matters to them at all. Not a damn thing.
