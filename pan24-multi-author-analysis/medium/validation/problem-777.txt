I say it again - this is to be expected a lot more now. Because this ultra far right govt will fuck shit up now and stir things up. Hardliners will now be emboldened more than ever. Things will be bad for next few years for the region, esp. for Palestinians. This, entering the mosque, and palestinian flag incidents are just a start.
Don't think this will be another war... at first I thought Israel was invading Jordan but it seems like they want to annex part of the West Bank thats called the Jordan Valley, not actual Jordan. From the bit of research I just did it seems like Israel already controls this eastern part of the West Bank with mostly jews living there with the exception of Jericho and Al-Auja. So pretty much they wanna turn their unofficial control into official control by claiming it as Israel proper. It'll be condemned by world leaders but I don't think it'll start a war since Palestinians don't have an army and Jordan isn't being invaded.
I think a lot of people, like me, assumed from the title that Israel wants to annex or invade part of Jordan. And given that most of this area is already controlled by Israeli forces and has a majority jewish population I don't see it causing a civil war either. Of course this is ignoring all the morality and ethics of the situation this is just a pragmatic view of it.
