The fact that we're even reading about it means that there was an attempt but it failed or was successfully contained. Nobody would publicly announce their failure. Like people say, somethings being hacked every day in the EU but it's mostly either insignificant or completely harmless to even report about and cause unnecessary panic. Most crucial systems in astablisments like refineries that could potentially be harmful are exclusively localized and far away from internet access. On-line sub systems are usually just used for monitoring and some things that can be remotely controlled are extremely controlled requiring multiple both digital and physical failsafes. My brothers friend works for a digital safety contractor for companies in the energy sector (not the top tier ones, but still) and he said that it's way the fuck easier to hack some Swiss bank (good luck with that) then anything to do with energy production/delivery and the most effective way would be to physically destroy it.
Whats worse, whenever thing like this happens, individuals carrying attack indicted and not the nations. Basicly Russia is doong cryminal activites online(cyber war!) but individual soldiers are blamed for it and not the state.
I hope this isn’t true and if it is true, Do something about this crap. Let these guys attack NATO online don’t mean anything?? Would be nice to cut off Russia internet. This shouldn’t happen really.
There are people that do try it. But its nation state hackers so they work without limit and without any consequences.
Which in my oponion is honestly fucked. It's like blaming soldiers for waging war against another nation.
