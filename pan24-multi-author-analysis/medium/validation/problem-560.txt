People who couldn't have given fewer fucks about the Apple walled garden model a week ago are now raving about the dangerous duopoly of the App Store and the Google Play store. Which, number one, welcome to the party pal People have been complaining about the lack of a third party app store on iPhones for a dog's age Second of all, there are so many other smartphones out there, and Google Play Store allows far more kinds of content than Apple, so if you really just want Twitter on your phone, go fucking buy one of the hundreds of phones that runs Android!
They just want to yell at trans people on the internet and they'll toss any alleged commitment to free markets or free association the moment that's at risk. They'll dutifully repeat Elon's claim that Apple's 30% cut is "secret" and credulously buy the idea that Apple colludes with Democrats to censor Republicans because they want to yell at trans people on the internet that badly.
What's maddening to me is none of Apple's policies are new. I used to have a 4chan app on my phone. Apple pulled it from the app store because of the terrible rhetoric and various kinds of smut on 4chan. Tumblr purged NSFW content in part because they worried it would get them pulled from the App Store. Parler was pulled because it allowed /pol/-style content and Apple simply doesn't want that kind of content in their app store.
It's a free market (so long as it hurts Democrats), the moment one of the people impacted by it is a right-winger, things like free speech or the free market go out the window!
