As we saw on Jan 6, capitol police mark their guns for the plane suit teams. Anyone not in uniform or with a marked gun who has a firearm in the building is at risk of being shot if they draw or brandish their weapon in any way in an emergency.
And no that doesnt mean legislators should be given marked guns. They likely do not have the emergency training and, frankly, given that some are calling for a "national divorce" its not unimaginable that a member of congress could be an attacker/shooter.
You dont get to bring your own gun into the white house. You dont get to bring your own gun into the supreme court. You shouldnt get to bring your own gun into congress.
