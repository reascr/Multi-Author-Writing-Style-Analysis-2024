Turns out that the back of the Iron Curtain was a one way mirror that never went down, and Putin has been watching himself in it ever since the Soviet Union fell.
Trump would’ve been a disaster. He was siding with Putin from way back, was anti NATO and had every appearance of literally being Putin’s stooge. He defended and praised him a year ago and again just recently stating he trusts Russian president Vladimir Putin more than the "lowlifes" who work in U.S. intelligence. He was a sellout to the USA and to Democracy itself.
Biden has done a solid job of handling this crisis, imo even from a nonpartisan standpoint. I think had they been elected that McCain or even Romney would have faired well also. Obama would have stood up for Ukraine also. Most previous POTUS from either party would’ve been similar.
Ok, so while i am vehemently against donald trump's presidency, almost as a whole, i do think there is more than meets the eye with regards to Trump/Putin relations. I don't think it was as cut and dry "trump is a putin puppet" as most folks as far left as my views tend to seem to think.
I dont believe there was direct collusion trump was aware of, but i do believe putin meddled without trump being totally knowledgable about it. Im sure he had inklings, but their relationship seems less to me like a direct collaboration, it seems like trump definitely did a bit to pacify him for a time without capitulting too much of ACTUAL consequence, aside from embarassing himself at press conferences.
Trump was kissing his ass, for sure, but he didnt pull a chamberlain and allow annexation of land, etc etc. He just simped like an E-boy on live television. Whether you view that as being on the same level is your call.
