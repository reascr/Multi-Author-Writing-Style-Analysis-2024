I find it interesting that very rural areas are exempt from the prohibition. Possibly a way to encourage rural growth or exempt some areas of cottage countries across Canada. It will complicate lawyers' lives to have to figure out which census category a property is in, though (in some cases anyways).
Are they gonna prevent intermediary canadian companies from buying the homes FOR foreigners? Because if the 6% foreign ownership statistic in the article is true, this won't change jack shit.
Yes, the law does block direct or indirect ownership of residential property owned by Non-Canadians either personally, through corporations, or through other types of agreements. Seems like they've thought that part out and tried to close any potential loophole that could exist by using a corporation.
The law itself is fairly short, only 7 sections, and the regulation isn't that long either. You can easily find the text for the Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act using google.
