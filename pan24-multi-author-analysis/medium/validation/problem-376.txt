You are correct. General Yamamoto wanted to eliminate the Pacific fleet. He knew the USA was a problem for their plans. So they knew if they eliminated the fleet, they would own the Pacific. And with all the signs pointing towards an attack, the Pacific fleet commander at the time(whose name escapes me) ignored it. That's why pearl harbor was so significant. Even though the Japanese thought it was a success, Yamamoto knew it was a failure that they only got a few battleships and none of the aircraft carriers. Then it came back to bite them in the ass when they tried to surprise the USA again with the battle of Midway, which the code was cracked and the USA led a counter attack. Even though it was almost a collosal fuck up. Luck and a Japanese fleet commander who was too by the book was what lost the Japanese the Pacific. China can't think that siding with Russia, who is blundering themselves in Ukraine, is a good move. If they think that the rest of the western world is weak, then they deserve the demise they will bring on themselves.
If I recall correctly the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour believing that the US (a spiritually/militarily inferior country) would cave, sign a peace treaty and leave them to their devices.
I wonder whether China has fallen into same delusion having observed US divisive/corrosive politics for many years e.g. Marjorie Greene (WTF) etc. I believe the recent balloon incident was a test of American resolve. "Hey, you're not so tough. I wonder what else we can get away with?".
