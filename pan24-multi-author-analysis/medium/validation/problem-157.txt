Ages for this sort of shit are set as much out of practicality as anything. Realistically 13 year olds and 17 year olds will often end up in the same social groups and teenagers are gonna do whatever the fuck they want.
Now, realistically, the impact is going to be limited, given that IIRC most or all prefectures have this set at 16 or 18 anyway, with japanese (federal? is that how you'd phrase it) law previously only stating it couldn't be lower than what it set).
It's wild the only reason I know about the Romeo and Juliet clause is because of a Transformers movie where a guys stops the entire movie to do a detailed explanation to Mark Wahlberg.
I assume its to justify mark being protective and angry about this older guy dating his precious little girl, but not being able to go to the police about it.
So it's really a question of how many teens you wanna jail for being teens and how authoritarian you want to be about sex because this is by far not the only area we'd also be trying to limit down if we draw that line.
Also, while the 17 year old is more likely to be the more experience one who is the initiator of things, don't underestimate 13 year olds.
Also, also seriously stop a second and think about people lying about their age. 17 and 15 is fine. 17 and 13 is not. Could YOU reliably tell the difference? I don't think you could to a 95% degree of accuracy. It's not like you even have driver's licenses at those ages.
