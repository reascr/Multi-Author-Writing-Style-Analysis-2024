As a former Christian, the Jesus version that I grew up with was like the non-judgemental, artsy kid at school that everyone liked and could traverse any social clique with a diplomatic immunity.
i mean, i don't believe in any imaginary sky faeries, but i'm told the christian god is supposed to be a kind and loving god. i doubt they would be happy with this person.
I miss the groovy, loving, hippy Jesus that called out wealthy hypocrites and hung out with the social outcasts.
It seems that today's Christian Jesus is fearful, armed, and hates anyone that isn't also fearful and armed.
The day I realized that you didn't actually have to be a Christian to be a good person was the day I realized that I was an Athiest.
