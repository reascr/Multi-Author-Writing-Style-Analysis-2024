The new government said that they'd "look into" undoing conversions if they werent done in an Orthodox manner. Like, literally telling Jewish people the weren't Jewish enough so it doesn't count.
Despite what the rhetoric says Israel has never been a full democracy, this is reflected unanimously the relevant indices available. And now the country is shifting even further towards authoritarianism.
What that will allow the government to do is double down on violating and occupying Palestinian territory, it will discriminate against gays, etc., despite Netanyahu saying that's not the case. (Members of his government will continue to push for anti-gay laws and policy.).
do you know how long netanyahu has been in power and how corrupt he has been? does that seem like a functional democracy to you? the philippines are a "democracy" as well only in practice they function similarly to this, as an authoritarian dictatorship. hell, the US is barely a democracy, it's much closer to an oligarchy due to the influence of moneyed interests in politics.
Israel is heading into a dark place and this tragically will harm the entire region. I hope these protesters are successful because they're the only hope this country has.
