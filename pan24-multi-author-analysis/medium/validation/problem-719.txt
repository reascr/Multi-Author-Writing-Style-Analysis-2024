The logic by the lower Court indicates that the police can be sued in the future since there is now (because of a different case, I assume) clear SCOTUS guidance that this is protected speech.
So the police have the right to arrest you if you criticize them and you can't do anything about it so long as they claim you're disrupting their operations. That's fucked up.
Edit: My reading of the article is off here. The facts in this case are a bit complicated, and no other case has been heard about this. It is a bad decision, but doesn't give carte blanche to arrest any parody maker. But it comes way too close to doing so.
I actually just heard it today. Qualified immunity means no suing the cops unless there is established law which specifically means a nearly exact case to the situation at hand that violated the constitution had to have been ruled on. So for new cases like social media that haven’t had a constitutional case heard and ruled on in court you can never sue a cop.
IANAL but I would think the first amendment allows you to criticize and satirize the police, even if it makes their jobs more difficult. But if the criteria is that a similar case has to have been heard before, and the supreme court declines to hear any similar cases, then it sounds like we no longer have the right to satirize the cops without fear of arrest.
Yea the lady on the radio said even if they violate your constitutional rights. The guest gave an example where they kneed a guy so hard he lost his spleen and he couldn’t get them for medical costs. It’s why people don’t like qualified immunity but the lady also said the Supreme Court has been strenhening qualified immunity over the years so it’s ever more settled law.
