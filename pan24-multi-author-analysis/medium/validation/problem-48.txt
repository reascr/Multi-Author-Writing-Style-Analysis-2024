First, the House will consider legislation to adopt the tentative deal between the rail companies and employees reached in September and brokered by the White House.
After rejecting an agreement brokered by the White House, railroad workers could walk off the job ahead of the busy holiday season.
"If you can't vote for this," said the independent Vermont senator, "don't tell anybody that you stand with working families.".
And make Rail workers take it on the chin. They could make Rail companies take the hit, but noooo, can't make the companies hurt, gotta be the little guys. Not only that, but take away the little guy's only leverage in negations. This is unforgiveable for the party that says its pro labor.

It's not just rail that would be affected.. its everything rail touches like shipping, semi-truck driving, warehouse, rotting goods, food for both humans and livestock, fuel.. it's everything that needs to move from point a to b.
A second, separate vote -- aimed at addressing progressive Democrats' concerns over protecting workers -- is set on a measure to add seven days of paid sick leave to the agreement\, which now allows for only one\.
Railway is critical infrastructure that could spiral the country from a recession, into a depression.. cost trillions and plumet families into bankruptcy due to lost employment.
And the President wants to avoid that by .... checking notes... asking the legislative branch to avoid the economic catastrophe and give Union Workers more PTO days.

And rejected by the majority of members. A majority of unions, but the majority of union members (the large unions) rejected that deal.
Which was done intentionally which allows the Senate to ignore it completely and/or vote it down. An insulting, token measure. If they were serious about it, those 7 days would be included in the main (and only) bill passed to the Senate, forcing them to pass it if a strike was that dire. Give these workers PTO. A single day is insulting.
