Loud obnoxious Americans crowing 'how cheap' everything is with zero clue about the average salary in the high taxation rate.
Now add in all of the obnoxious digital nomads taking up space in cafés for hours at a time blocking other local customers who do want to sit and enjoy coffee culture.
Most average Portuguese people can never eat in the restaurants where these loud tourists are eating and they think they got a great Portuguese experience when probably that restaurant was owned by a Nepalese guy who actually owns 50 restaurants in Portugal.
Then look at how tourism has driven prices sky high for real estate and look at all of the buildings doing airbnb while locals cannot find anywhere liveable and have to live at home well into their thirties and forties.
Now look at all the people selling drugs to foreigners and all the foreigners eagerly buying them which clogs up the streets and makes things feel less pleasant than in past.
Open your eyes, and you will see what overturism and particular one distinct market does to a place.
There is no more low season for tourism, and even early December was packed with people on the streets. This is a classic example of when so many things have gone wrong and the government has not managed things well. But sadly, a big part of it is the actual nature of the tourists that are coming to enjoy things with a giant rental cara thinking they will drive around Bairro Alto.
Which puts Portugal in a quagmire. Overtourism is fucking over a lot of people, and without tourism the country will lose about 20% of GDP.
I understand the complaints about overtourism but without tourism Portugal will just fade away even more...
Agree, but there is also the issue of extremely low wages, or working under the table, and high taxation.
Average salaries for managers in the tourism industry are 1/3 of what they are In other countries in Western Europe. That is not 1/3 last but 1/3 of the total on average.
Look at that new earthquake attraction in the high cost for a poor quality attraction but people are happily paying that.
And then you look at some of the prices hotel rates over €500 a night breakfast for 40 a night in a hotel and you understand how there is such a huge disparity between what the people are earning and the people who are staying.
Aging population, past their prime in productivity and Portugal hasn't really developed its economy, young productive people move to Luxembourg, Switzerland or any other more developed economy.
The income gap is getting wider and wider and more and more people are leaving in a country where historically people already have had to leave for decades it defined survival in a relatively decent environment.
There are no easy answers and a lot of change needs to come within but I also think that a lot of the people who so arrogantly talk about how cheap it is have no idea of the recent history of the country and have no idea what happened in 1974 in the impact on today.
the digital nomad sub I was told that my 78 year old mother in law simply planned poorly because she doesn't own a house in Lisbon, unlike the poster whose mother owns 3 houses in California. Because he's a privileged American, he just expects everybody to be on the same level, which is, of course, absurd.
It just makes that divide even. It's about when you have so many people speaking so loudly about how cheap everything is with little consideration for how that makes the local people feel.
