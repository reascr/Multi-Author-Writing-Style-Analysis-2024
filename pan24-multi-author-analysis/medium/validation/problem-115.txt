I hate to say this bc I'm very disappointed, disgusted, etc etc with Russia and cannot stand them, well the government. I wholeheartedly hate them with a passion. But it seems like people should just drop the "whole war crime thing" because evidently not one country will do anything about it outside of some gd sanctions. I get the whole gist that well if the US does something then ww3. I am at this point either do something about with force or quit complaining about war crimes bc at this point I'm just fed up. Obviously not at the same level of the poor Ukrainians who have to actually live throughout the hell day in and day out. I honestly believe its way past time that nato actually steps in bc the only the west is doing is letting this scumbag get away with some of the worst atrocities that the world has seen in a veeeerry long time... From mass kidnapping on a massive scale to bombing hospitals, schools, cancer wards, gunning down innocent civilians standing in line to buy bread and ice, bombing their apartment complexes, raping women and children, etc... I could go on and on for days. I just believe we are at the point its time for the leader of the free world to step up and put a stop to this horrible shit. I'm sorry for ranting like this but enough is enough... Bc i believe just like the whole holocaust ordeal that basically nobody will be punished for these war crimes. I do think Putler is only playing the card he has left and that is saying he'll use nukes. But it's just a bluff. If he was going to do it, he'd already have done it. From what I've read from their leaked reports if they nuke Ukraine then that is basically admitting defeat if they have to resort to such BS like nukes. I say either literally give Ukraine the best of the best equipment that can use with much further range or put nato boots on the ground in ukraine. I believe the only way Ukraine should attack into the Russian borders is to retaliate from where a long range missile was fired then they should have the green light to fire back at said bases inside Russia. It's time to actually put a stop to this sick sorry piece of shit.
Just imagine for one second, how many war crimes are in the occupied areas that can't be currently accessed. I can only imagine and it isnt good. In Izyum alone there were mass graves of 400-1000. Just one town. Id be surprised if the number of rapes was lower.
