DeSantis is going to be the Republican nominee because he’s got all the Trump fascism without any of the Trump baggage. And then, on the age difference alone, he’ll beat Biden in the general.
From what I understand DeSantis is pretty wooden on the campaign trail. History is littered with front runners that fizzle out after the early primaries.
Desantis is stale. Has zero personality and folds under cameras that he didn't personally invite. He wishes he had an ounce of whatever it is that his daddy Trump runs on.

To the point where literally I’m thinking about placing a $1k bet that he will be the next president. It’s roughly 2:1 odds in betting markets so if fascism wins, at least I profit $2k. And if he doesn’t, I’m out a G but at least we stave off fascism a little longer?
And yet the idiot conservatives re-elected him in a landslide. They don’t give a flying fuck about shit like that. They want him to implement fascist policies for their side and then for him to as snarkily and smugly as possible rub liberals noses in it.
I’ve seen way too many cocky quotes on this subreddit talking about how DeSantis doesn’t stand a chance that I’m now convinced that he is going to be the next president.
So… dreadful person basically describes any GOP presidential nominee, and he is one of the front runners for that. So yes, if he wins that primary, he absolutely has a shot. I’m not saying he’d definitely win, but in a 2 party system as polarized as it is today, should he be the nominee his chances would be 20% at absolute worst, and those are real, terrifying odds.
