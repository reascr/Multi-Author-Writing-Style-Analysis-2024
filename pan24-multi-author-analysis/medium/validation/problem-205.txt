You'd think that they would step back and take deep look at their party, but all they will do is toss their chips "all in" on the current path; they'll just leave Trump out to dry and continue what their doing. They'll continue looking for the "Hail Mary" that they can use to entrench themselves so deeply into power that it will take more than just a "Blue Wave" to wash them out; it'll take a "Blue Tsunami" to even win a house of Congress. The election system already requires the Democrats to receive 4%+ of the total votes in order to win the House, Senate, and White House. It's not going to get any better if the Republicans worm their way back into power in 2024.
