I watched livecams back in 2014. Ukraine had a suprising lot of webcams. There was also livestreams by Ukrainian news stations. I watched almost all of Maidan. I watched a peaceful pro-western rally in Odesa get attacked by provocateurs. They even shot into the crowd. I watched the crowd go mad with rage and chase them to the Trades Union building, where it became apparent the provocateurs had planned for violence. They were besieged by the protesters, then they themselves livestreamed from the inside where they had gasoline and bottles prepared and started making Molotov's. A lot of Molotov's. They ended up throwing molotovs's out at the protesters and ofc, because they're always fucking stupid managed to somehow torch themselves. A lot died in the fire.
