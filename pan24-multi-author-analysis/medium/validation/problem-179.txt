It is probably because they can exercise complete control over them. Something that you make dependent on you for their very survival is probably very appealing to them.
Probably wasn't even 'his' dog, I can't see him giving a fuck about another living thing. And I say that knowing full well Hitler had Blondie(poor girl).
He is known to be quite fond of dogs. This one was Konni, a big black lab he was often photographed with. It was gifted to him years ago by his current Minister of Defense.
It's true. The clinical term is Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD/ASPD) which you can look up in the ICD 10 or the DSM V. There are no entries in either for psychopathy or sociopathy as they are not clinically distinct conditions.
The ones that define them differently pretty much all state their definitions, because there is no distinction widely enough accepted for them to know what readers will think otherwise. A couple of common ones are: psychopaths are born that way, but sociopaths are made that way by their environment; psychopaths don't know right from wrong, sociopaths know but don't care; sociopaths are like Sherlock from the BBC adaptation and psychopaths are like Moriarty.
Edit: I'm not providing links because you can look up the DSM and ICD easily using the information in the post, while the rest isn't something I have a single direct summary of - the best I can recommend is that you search "psychopathy vs sociopathy" and see how many different definitions you can find in the first few pages.
