The same sort of thinking is needed on immigration. We will need a lot more workers to re-tool our economy to deal with climate change. But that's true everywhere. Places already experiencing climate crisis, like Central America, must have a path for survival that would employ their own people to save their homelands. That will take international funding so that they can get what they need from the rest of the world that they can't make for themselves. This is less about money than it is about planning and the will to invest in the future.
