It's great that they have the experience of investigating Trump's children's business dealings on his behalf during his time in the White House ...
A big waste of time as far as anything significant happening like jail time, yes absolutely 100% agree.
Now as far as a waste of time outside of that? No not really. Even though nothing came of shit like the Benghazi hearings, they got a lot of right wing traction and I believe most right wingers still hold onto it and point to it as something of substance. It's not about actually getting something out of the hearings it's about pushing a narrative of the dems do this, so they can then turn around and do it themselves and their base eating it up. "well the other side is doing it(they're not), so why can't our side do it!".
That just furthers the point, thank you. Nothing came out of it like jail time. The email bullshit was just that. But it put it into the republican ether that well she did it, so trump or republicans can as well.

What cost her the election was a few things, comey coming out and doing that certainly didn't help. But russian interference, hacking the dem and rep e-mails but only releasing the dem ones... and can't forget voter disenfranchisement. All of that played a roll.
