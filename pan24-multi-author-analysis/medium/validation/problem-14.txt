Ukraine stops about 80% of these or so so while they can keep doing it the payoff is small considering what they are losing in stopped missiles. It comes down to attrition, how mich can Russia resupply and how fast can Ukraine rebuild and how much material do they have.
These exist and are called mobile substations. They typically are used to take a substation out of service for maintenance. Getting 6 million people back on in 24 hours seems like transmission line repairs to me. Itâ€™s an insane amount of customers to get back on in that short of a timeframe.
Almost all of the times you are going to do scheduled maintenance on a substation you don't use the mobile substations. Those are reserved for emergencies. Usually you would simply reroute the power through connections and then disconnect the substations.
From experience i would guess that Ukraine probably got the majority of the people back on the grid by rerouting via connections, ehich id usually done quickly and with remotely operated devices. Then they probably had to patch up the holes in the grid in certain places to get the rest of the people back up.
