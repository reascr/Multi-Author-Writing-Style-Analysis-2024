Samsung still has official stores open. LG is not just present in Russia, but actually creates new products exclusively for the Russian market. Apple devices are available to buy from authorized (actually authorized, Apple website links to them) resellers. EGS is the only non-russian game store that accepts Russian payment methods (including MIR cards I think). Twitch accepts money from russian payment services. You can buy Nvidia and AMD GPUs from partners because they still officially work in Russia. Not sure how official CPU shipments are, but all of them are available for MSRP (or close to it). For that matter, pretty much everything is available.
Yep. Feel like the only way someone would think Dutch people actually like Heineken is if they'd only ever been to the red light district in Amsterdam. You guys have some fucking magnificent beer. Last time I was there I remember wandering through the Jordaan for hours and finding some epic little bars that had beer I'd never heard of that was amazing.
