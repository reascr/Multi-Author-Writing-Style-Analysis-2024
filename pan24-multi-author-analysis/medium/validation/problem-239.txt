EU has literally zero jurisdiction when it comes to price controls in Croatia, there's no EU "economic ministry" either. There's ECB (european central bank), but neither them nor Croatian central bank can really do anything about shops gouging their customers. Both institutions done their job when it comes to the "big picture" of switching currencies, like agreeing on exchange rate, making sure there's enough physical cash in circulation, preparing banks for the switch, making sure prices are displayed in dual currencies (HRK and Euro in this case) etc...
It's slightly a relief but still more frustrating to know it was such a widespread phenomenon, I remember it didn't pass over me despite being a kid because it impacted videogame prices too: from sixty thousands of our previous currency to 60â‚¬ (basically doubled), having learned by heart the exchange rate of the two since it was often on TV I couldn't help but thinking those game store owners were either very lacking math-wise or very greedy.
