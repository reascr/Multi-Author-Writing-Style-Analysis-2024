She's a center-left politician from the Socialist Party (social-democratic). The other person talking about the far-right who's mentioned in Forbes' article is Mathilde Panot, a MP from La France Insoumise, a left-wing party leaning towards ecosocialism & democratic socialism).
Denouncing the far-right is par for the course coming from them, but they've been contradicted by the first pieces of information at the hand of Paris' public prosecutor Laure Beccuau.
