Bernie gets to set the agenda and issue subpoenas. This is his shot to go after criminal acts within the health insurance and hospital industries. He can air out lots of dirty laundry for the american people to see and refer things to the DOJ. He obviously cannot pass bills in the general session as long as republicans can block all legislation, but now he can do the maximum amount possible without a new bill. He can uncover things that help dems win in the next election because people want them addressed.
