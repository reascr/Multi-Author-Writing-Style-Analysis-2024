Because the GOP is trying to turn the country into a religious dictatorship and they think, mistakenly in my opinion, that they will get to be part of the in-group.
The FBI is mostly populated by conservative white men. In fact, there's even a large number of Mormons there, because it's easier for them to pass the background checks (no drinking, drugs, gambling, etc).
I have a genuine honest question. I'm not from the US. If I was from the US, I would definitely support the Democrat party. With that being said, it doesn't make sense to me that there are claims that the FBI like Trump, when Trump was the one to fire like two leaders of the FBI.
Again, I'm not from the US, so I just want to understand the whole situation more because it seems confusing to me.
Oh okay that's quite interesting. This was during the 2016 election right? And I'm guessing Comey said Hillary was under investigation because of the whole email thing, but he didn't mention Trump's Russian collusion links?
There was that Comey guy and I think someone else? I'm not sure about the exact details, but it seems counter-intuitive to me. Surely there's some other reason at play here?
Can you expand on that? How did they show a liking or preference for Trump? How did they help him get elected?

Their press release was basically "It was 2 documents in a box of a thousand. And when we gave them to an intern to copy, she did not notice the markings, as she took pictures with her personal phone, and sent them to a laptop.".
I mean, it's all bullshit excuses. Like Trump can mentally un-classify all the docs. Except he obviously had no clue what he had even taken at the time.
