Well it's not WW2 anymore. There is no bank secret anymore, Swiss politicians worked during WW2 with the Nazis together, that's a fact but Switzerland worked with Jews/ Israel after WW2 together to pay back whatever it was, Switzerland wasn't neutral during the cold War, neither during the Balkan war or the annexion of Tibet, Crimea, etc.
This law has also led to the fact that Switzerland no longer sells weapons to Russia since the takeover of Crimea by Russia or that the supply of weapons to Saudi Arabia has been stopped.
Many here absolutely understand about the Gepard ammunition. But it is a law that would have to be adapted by the Swiss population. Normally, changes in the law here take several years.
The text of the law reads as follows: "No sale or transfer to a war zone..." It is a pity that no war in Europe was taken into account.
The time to start adapting those laws are 6 months ago, if you want to keep a semblance of humanity.
In some ways I wish Switzerland had the same experience with neutrality as we did in Norway. And that is that it lasts only until someone stronger than you decides to piss all over your neutrality.
In a situation like the one in Ukraine, where a larger stronger neighbor invades you, there is no moral neutral ground btw. By deeming yourself "neutral" you are in reality helping the attacker.
