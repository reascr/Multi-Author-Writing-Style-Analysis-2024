I think it becomes even more obvious when you look at right-wing media and hosts like Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity at Fox News or even to Infowars Alex Jones. They formed 'characters' to best appeal and build-up the bases they were making money off of and try to 'maintain' the appearance of really being that even when if you begin to look at their 'real life' you would see just how different they are, see their kids going to elite 'leftist' private schools, etc...
I've been reading up on the Dominion Brief and it's amazing how high Fox's legal risks are, and how it documents the kayfabe and their support of it. For many of them I think it gets very hazy where kayfabe and crazy cross over. It has a lot in common with “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”.
Edit: If you have the time a couple of days ago that's worth the watch. If there was ever a case that Fox could lose on 1st Amendement, this is it.
That goes even further back before they changed to WWE. VKM testified in 1989 that wrestling is a work so he could avoid paying taxes that were levied against athletic competitions in certain states.
Weirdly several states GOP embraced mail in voting, but now that they're seeing that it hurts them they are starting to roll it back. Same with Ranked Choice, they no longer support legislation for the public good, just to further their own control.

The one who may not be kayfabe is My Pillow Guy. I think that guy is seriously deranged and believes what he's putting out.
I'm not sure I completely agree with that framing. I think the GOP lost control of itself when it decided to not be reality based, things like trickle down economics etc and their voters got comfortable being outside a reality based world view. Fox just dialed that up to 11, but the Brief documents how even they know they only have the tiger (GOP voters) by the tail and risk losing viewer/money by trying to inject reality into their reporting.
Edit: Just to add a data point to about the crazy, there's conspiracy theory spinning right now that the whole Rus/Ukr war is fake because they aren't seeing any evidence when their media bubble is designed not to provide it.
It's hard to say what sets of their voters cognitive dissonance, considering this was such a big part of the Big Lie it might just be a mess with both their voters and state parties.
It still surprises me they leaned against mail voting so hard, it really doesn't hurt the regular chances, Trump and the GOP was just so heavily disliked in 2020 but not sure if the state GOP's will figure that out before rolling back the mail.
Truthfully a lot of this stuff isn't new but adding in Madison Ave psychology gimmicks make a better smoke screen to fool more people.
That's why I keep coming back to reaganomics as a turning point. Even Bush Sr called it "Voodoo Economics" because they did have many more reality based pols back then, what's changed is decades of pols who grew up drinking that koolaid and never allowing themselves to question it.
It's not so much that they all truly believe the bs, but that their In-group are punching back on their "enemy" ie the out-group known as everyone else.
One of the things that didn't keep me interested in wrestling while growing up was I never got the appeal of Heals, and that's what Fox and GOP specialize in. "Cheap Heat" is a good term for it.
