"Jackson’s system is the only one — out of more than 1,100 across the state — that’s unable to set and collect rates sufficient to cover its cost of operation, maintenance and debt services.".
The EPA seems to think there IS a way to prevent what's happening. So does the DOJ (who've filed 2 complaints and have now involved a third party) But hey, if you've tried nothing and are all out of ideas, I hope someone who gives a fuck is managing the $75 million for water infrastructure projects included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Biden signed in November 2021.

The state of Mississippi is beyond despicable for their laws that have caused this to happen.
