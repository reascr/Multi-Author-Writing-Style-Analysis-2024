Fact is Russian oil was irrelevant for Europe all the time. Oil is very easy to transport. What would really hurt Russia is a price cap and the ban of gas. In the contrary to oil, gas is much more difficult to transport it without pipelines.
Germany on Wednesday shrugged off Russia’s ban on oil sales to countries and companies that comply with a price cap agreed by Western allies, saying it has “no practical significance.”.
“I would not like to say that it’s irrelevant but it has no practical significance,” said an economy ministry spokeswoman, adding that Germany has been preparing since early summer to do without Russian oil.
In world politics, courts and investigations matter little. Russia is going to blame whoever they want, and the rest of the world is not going to care.
Yeah Russia overplayed their hand hard and too early. Well they didn't really have much. The West was much smarter rolling out the sanctions bits at a time, gradually increasing pressure. Russia has nothing left to squeeze.
