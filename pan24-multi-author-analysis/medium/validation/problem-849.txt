Especially since you can presumably get at least one by doing that thing that nobody expects where you kill someone in cold blood. You know, shooting them from behind because there’s no real reason to suspect anyone is going to just shoot you on the street apropos of nothing.

Small dick, incels, living with parents (in fucking Canada’s housing market no less), prison rape, genital mutilation, the list goes on.
not defending their actions but its a bit hypocritical of redditors to claim "there is nothing wrong with living at home", and then vote this as the top comment.
At the end of the day, Redditors are no better than anyone else and will do whatever it takes to win a debate and prove their point use whatever words necessary to tear another person down for unrelated reasons.
I think you missed the point of my comment and thus gave your bad faith disingenuous reply. It's very common for people to express one opinion out of virtue while believing in the opposite on some level which slips out from time to time, either explicitly or via mannerisms.
If your stance is that people who claim "virtuous opinions" are 100% genuine in those opinions, that is extremely naive and I wouldn't bank on that. For example, nearly everyone you run into now claims "being gay is ok and acceptable". How much do people get mocked for just exhibiting gay tendencies? Not even fucking close to zero.
The American side of me is pro-gun, but the Australian side is saying that we need some sort of change here.
Yeah just having a CCW, even if you don’t exercise the right, immediately lowers your chances of ever committing a violent crime. It’s a tragedy that having a CCW will also get you suspicious looks from family, friends, employers, and certain LEO departments when you’ve made yourself a statistically safer person to be around even if you don’t carry the weapon at all.
Yeah… If you ever end up having to shoot your weapon in self defense and end up shooting the lady next door instead, this comment is going to seal your fate.
The amount of hoops you have to go through in some states for it is exactly the amount of hoops that should be required to get your first firearm in the first place. Any additional firearm should be as easy to buy as it currently is, but not your first. If you don’t have the patience to turn in all the documentation and renew it periodically, then you shouldn’t be allowed to own a firearm at all. Of course, this is assuming SCOTUS and 3 letter agencies successfully force the states to actually process those applications in a timely manner and make the processes (including training) free, otherwise it’s just a 2A violation waiting to be struck down.
