I suspect the other potential or prospective nominees have this as part of their calculations, and if they lay back from the fight it may be a hint.
Trump got a lot of crazies to vote who previously didn't, and won't if Trump himself isn't on the ballot (we saw it in the midterms, the GA runoff, and here) and the most sycophantic of his devotees think the Democrats have full control over elections so it's not worth it to vote because "the fix is in". Desantis probably won't be able to rile up that far right contingent enough to vote or get out of their conspiracy theories.
Trump loyalists weren't party loyalists. Trump was on the ballot for people who hated him, but he wasn't on the ballot for people who loved only him. DeSantis is going to have to go on the offensive at some point or he will go the way of Trump's primary challengers in 2015. The party wanted any of those people and look what happened.

Sure, and that's a good thing. However, some fights are best not fought, and this one would turn out to be a waste of effort and resources if the DOJ redirects it.
