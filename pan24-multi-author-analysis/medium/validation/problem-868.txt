I’m registered as a Republican, because we have closed primaries and Republicans win 90% of the elections here, so it’s the only way to have influence over which R eventually makes it to the general election.
Yep, in MA the term we use is "unenrolled" and you can vote in either. The only thing registering with a political party actually does is restrict you to only being eligible for the primary of the party you're registered with, so registering with a political party is pretty much just a public statement of your values.
So ideologically I'm not aligned with either party so traditionally I have no affiliation. However, I live in Florida which has closed primaries meaning I can only vote in my party's primary. My status prevented me from voting in those elections. I recently changed my registration to remedy that and therein lies the answer to your question.
