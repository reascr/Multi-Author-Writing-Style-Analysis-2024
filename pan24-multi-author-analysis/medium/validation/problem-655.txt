Tucker Carlson's only ideal of America is a cult of self-proclaimed superiority in which a designated in-group, that he considers himself a part of, is in charge. He evidently does not see conventional American politics, whether lib or con, as advancing this ideal in the slightest. But he looks at someone like Putin as a person who advances that goal for his nation actively. Which is why he is a Putin sympathiser but cannot root for his own president regardless of faction.

Deep down, Tucker is a true blue, and exceedingly bland, neocon. He got tired of being fired from every 24 hour news channel for being an exceedingly bland neocon whose entire personality consisted of a bow tie, and knew FOX was his last chance. So, he gives his audience what he thinks they want, and he makes great money doing so, but he's still an exceedingly bland neocon.
Indeed, I would say that he's an exceedingly bland neocon. The Tucker Carlson you see on FOX today is a character being played so that the real Tucker doesn't have to sit on the sidelines scamming money from neolibs at the Lincoln Project with all of the other exceedingly bland neocons.
He couldn’t stop if he wanted to, and won’t stop because he’s rewarded and validated for being a hate preacher every day.
For one, Reagan was really hawkish when it came to Russia. For two, Tucker is portraying on TV what he thinks the MAGA base want to hear, not what he actually thinks.
As hosts? Not really. Bill O'Reilly was for sure. Megyn Kelly was. However, Glenn Beck was immensely entertaining. He was a lunatic, eventually certifiably so, but he wasn't bland. Hannity isn't really a neocon. He's a nationalist. Ingraham is too. Greta Van Susteren doesn't really believe in anything and never has. Many of their former cadre of analysts and contributors like George Will or Bill Krystal were very much exceedingly bland neocons, eventhough I admit I actually had a bit of a soft spot for Will.
Tucker Carlson is a fascist, which is why he talks like a fascist and sympathises with fascists. This is not a difficult guy to figure out. A neocon and a neolib have at least in common that they love spending money on American defense to advance American geopolitical interests.
