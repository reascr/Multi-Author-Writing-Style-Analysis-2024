It does make a mad kind of sense, he his running through devolvement at a rapid pace, clearly he has gotten help from Russia and China but that is only half the game, he needs to bring his missiles and his people up to a modern competitive standard, and there is zero way to avoid getting the experience by drilling. He is also doing it in a very provocative way but the people on all sides can see real advancement and a structured program. I will add to that Kim will be testing nuke warheads again soon, this may or may not be in conjunction with China or Russia, but let's say your Russia and you really need to test your nuke stockpile or new designs but how are you going to do that with the world watching?
What if Kim Jong Un is telling his people that they ARE hitting targets. For all we know the news in North Korea could be showing CGI of burning cities and equipment telling the NK people they are winning.
Can you imagine if they actually think they’re hitting targets. Like they have no clue how incapable their military technology is. After seeing what Russ’s rolled in to Ukraine with I wouldn’t doubt it.
More like just straight up stolen footage from Mars Attacks! of burning buildings and cows and a dead skull headed alien that is labelled "American" then Dear Leader smiles at the camera.
