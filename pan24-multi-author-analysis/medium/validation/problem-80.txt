A paper airplane powered by a nuclear powered ram jet and carrying several nuclear sub munitions. That was designed to fly super sonic at low altitude where the shock wave alone would have caused injury and damage to civilians and structures on the ground. The idea was to have it loiter after it deployed its sub munitions just spewing radioactive exhaust before it finally crashed. It was crazy, an absolutely insane weapon that only got axed because of the radar advancements you mentioned and the fact that ICBMs were cheaper and more reliable.
Do I get to mark "Turns out USA created Coronavirus in a lab" or only "Russia blames USA for Covid 19" ? I am learning toward the latter but I really need the former for a quick win.
So much this...we're just a bunch of idiots with money throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. We seriously researched a gay bomb. We built and tested the SLAM, a weapon so absolutely dooms day level insane it makes our current arsenal seem sedate. We're like Wylie Coyote over here.
