I think a 30% sales tax -- which would effectively be 40-45% after state and local taxes -- could actually tip the scales and lead to true riots.
Not that protest bullshit that Replications like to call riots -- but real ones, comprised of people violently targeting shipment trains and stores.
A 30% price hike on essential goods, which will include utilities, will shut the lights off on probably about a fifth of American households. That means the elderly and sick are going to freeze or cook in extreme weather, there will be no way for many of them to cook or bathe, and no food storage. I think that's where you're going to see the country fold in on itself.
