That has happened in the past in state legislatures. A few years back the NY legislature had a similar situation, deadlocked and didn’t have enough people for a quorum to vote, as republicans were staying out of the room because they didn’t want the Democratic majority to take control, but one Republican legislator walked into the chamber to get to the vending machine on the other end, and a Democrat quickly called for a floor vote and it passed, flipping the legislature blue again. The Republican insisted he shouldn’t count as present but it was too late.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
