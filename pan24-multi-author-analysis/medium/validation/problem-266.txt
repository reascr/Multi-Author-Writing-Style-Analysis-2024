Once they have the enriched uranium it is surprisingly easy to make a nuclear bomb. The hard part is the enrichment. They don’t need blueprints- it is pretty straightforward once they have the materials.
Its a combination of materials and secrets. Nuclear technology is very much at the top of the “tech tree”—you need to be able to source basically everything from inside your own country. Gas centrifuges used to enrich the uranium require very careful engineering or they will shake themselves apart. They also spin very very fast so they make them from a high tensile strenh steel called marraging steel. If you can’t make or acquire this steel then you don’t have centrifuges. This is just one example out of a million in the line from raw uranium to weapons grade.
I remember watching a video about Pakistan making their own and having to play a million games and creating fake companies to be able to buy materials and machines.
Found an interesting article about the topic based on this discussion from Institute for Science and International Security (don't misread to be that ISIS).
\ At present, Maraging Steel is being smuggled to Iran illegally from other countries. Grade 350 Maraging Steel is used for centrifuges, including the enrichment rotor rolls. The regime is also purchasing through smuggling from abroad a higher grade Maraging Steel to build the bomb casing and nuclear warheads.
\ The Defense Ministry imports Maraging Steel (which it is banned from purchasing in the open market) for its military and nuclear industry through the National Steel Company (NSC) and its Director General, Amir Harati. In the past two years, NSC has made several purchase requests from the Defense Ministry.
\ Malaysia is one country where Maraging Steel is obtained from. The shipments are first taken to the United Arab Emirates where the manifest is changed and sent to Iran.
The sabotage was part of the “keep them stable”. Yes it set them back for sure as they had no idea what was going on.
Can't you say that about Ukraine too. The world loves to act like it cares but the lives lost are Ukrainian lives. And all that aid is really just loans. And those weapons aren't unconditional, they are using Ukraine for real life testing without riskung they're own citizens' lives. My prediction is that repeating WW2. Sell weapons to the fighters, wait for them to weaken and attack eventually when they are beaten down. War is terrible.
I wish for the safety and prosperity of innocent civilian lives and the quickest ending to the bloodshed. I hope it gets better even though I don't believe it will.
The fewer the countries with nuclear weapons the better. I don’t know how anyone can rationally argue the opposite.
I don’t know if this is true but there are rumors that US has penetrated Iran to such an extent with cyberwarfare that if they need to attack they will “turn off” half their infrastructure like flicking a switch.
The more countries that have nukes the higher the likelihood they will be used which could result in a full on exchange of nuclear weapons between two countries and thus nuclear winter. There have already been several close calls between the US and USSR so adding more to the party only makes the entire world more dangerous. Totalitarian governments are also inherently more risky because your putting these weapons in the hands of one or a small number of people that can make these disastrous decisions. What if the dictator is paranoid, depressed, becomes mentally unstable? Clearly the world is full of irrational actors. There’s also the possibility of Iran selling nuclear weapons to allies or terrorist groups. And whose to stop them if the end result is nuclear exchange?
