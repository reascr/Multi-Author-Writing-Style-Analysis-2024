TSMC and Global Foundaries have advanced the art of process nodes to such a degree that it's almost impossible for countries to spend money and will that level of manufacturing performance into existence. The network of suppliers that support TSMC to create their 5 and 7 nm nodes is extensive and none of them would risk selling to China. However, even having all of the raw materials is only a small portion of the puzzle. Intel in the US is one of the most well-financed semiconductor manufacturers...yet despite their prodigious piggy bank, they have had significant problems getting to 10 nm process nodes with acceptable yeilds, nevermind more advanced 7 and 5 nm nodes. Realistically, Intel is 5+ years away from having a real, workable 7 nm process node and by that time TSMC will be at 3 or smaller.
Also.... "Random" fires that kill people at their labs - \- probably won't help them. It was a few years ago, but I would expect more of the same going forwards.
If China is serious about developing their own home-grown advanced fab processes, they are a solid 10 to 15 years out from being able to achieve what TSMC can do today. The amount of effort required to secure their own fab industry is sufficiently high that I really wonder if it woudl be less effort on their part to risk war with the West by trying to capture Taiwan.
