This is masterful trolling by Big Gretch to the state republicans who are in a deep deep quandary after the Nov elections here. They even lost all college boards, it was a full blue tsunami in Mi.
Its not a lifetime position in MI, but still good to have a person in their 30's. Bolden was also the 3rd most voted in the recent election in Mi-who elects their state supreme's in a supposed "non partisan" basis. What this does mean though, is that Bolden now gets a full term and then can run two more times after this term- where MI supreme's typically only have two terms.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
And she's only 34 years old. Great material to groom for SCOTUS job AYAP. In few years a circuit Court and in another few years, SCOTUS! She could be very well as young as Thomas when appointed, but still be at least 5 times more qualified.
More importantly, in future elections she will be able to run as an incumbent. I have nothing to back this up, but my gut says that the incumbency boost is even more valuable for non-partisan elections.
Traditionally, incumbents perform better in elections than challengers or candidates running for an open seat. So if a candidate runs for a seat they already have, they are generally favored in that election.
I would argue that this effect is stronger for non-partisan races, where party affiliation of a candidate might be unclear (the candidate cannot benefit from straight ticket partisan voters).
Basically, because Bolden is now on the Michigan Supreme Court, she is likely to stay on the Michigan Supreme Court when she runs for re-election.
But I already got an idea of grooming her to become SCOTUS Justice to replace Thomas. Something like an antidote of Thomas and Barrett put together. I hope that she becomes Circuit judge in few years to have the necessary experience. She could be younger than either Barrett or Thomas when nominated and still have more relevant experience than both put together!
