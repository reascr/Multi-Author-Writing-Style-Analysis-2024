Considering their atrocious record of facilitating Nazi theft from Jewish businesses and families, then keeping the ill-gotten goods themselves, no surprise here.
So basically, the article says that they’re still looking to do so and rather, just in a way that’s legal and they want to make sure that the global relations they make with other nations is consistent… and people are mad about this? Did y’all even read the article? It’s easy to get up in arms because you personally feel a certain way about the war(most of us do), but really, Switzerland is taking the exact same and safe approach to this that virtually any other country would in their position. There are standards, laws, and regulations that have to be adhered to. If you really think that international politics is as simple as “you broke you pay”, you’re dense.
The hate here is unjustified. Most people didn’t even read the article, and honestly the article wasn’t worth posting to begin with because this is just the same standard process virtually any nation is going to take. There’s nothing particularly notable here. They were just looking to use Russia/Ukraine for clicks.
And before some dumbass thinks I’m in support of Russia, no. But holy shit the comments here genuinely hurt my skull. How hard is it to understand that global politics usually aren’t gonna be one and done, regardless of how simple the situation might be perceived to be? I’m sure wartime/global politics is pretty easy to pick up given how many redditors here who are “experts” lmfao. Just because they didn’t reach an immediate conclusion doesn’t mean they won’t reach one.
