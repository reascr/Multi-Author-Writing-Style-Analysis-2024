The West then decides to sanction these nations. Which is just going to make them more angry. Because its justifying the idea that the war is about race rather than democracy. Because they ain't sanctioning people as hard over Ethiopia with 600,000 dead.
During Apartheid the US supported the White minority rule. While the USSR and China black revolutionaries.
There was a slight shift after the civil rights movement in the 1960s. But it only became a US talking point in the late 1980s early 1990s.
African, South American, South East Asian, India and China are all in similar situations. The European powers (EU) for the majority of the last 70 years have been the "enemy". Usually supported by the US as a counter to communism/ now China.
When the Ukraine war started they may have felt some basic sympathy for Ukraine. As they too suffered unjust foreign invasion and occupation. However the longer the war went the more absurd the situation became.
There are ongoing major conflicts in Lybia, Ethiopia and Congo. Which for the most part the west has ignored. At the same time you have Western nations ( the very same colonial powers) showing up and shouting "if you don't support Ukraine your arn't for human rights and democracy". At the same time documents are coming out that the Dutch and French assassinated beloved leaders like Lumumba because they could have actually developed their nations.
Putin then has his speech in which he directly references this and says "remember it was the USSR that helped you fight European colonialism". The Western response is "Putin is crazy (he is but not on this point) everything he says is shit. Hey South Africa you for freedom right?".
Even if war broke out in Europe, it's a European war not an African one. They still only support Russia to an extent. Then if shit hits the fan, the same way that we ignore Goma they will simply change the channel.
So TLDR is South Africa isn't going to support Ukraine not because they support Russia. They will do it because western hegemony has terrible foreign policy in the global south. Same for India, Brazil, Nigeria etc...
So a year after the war most of the world is either indifferent or assists Russia out of a sense of loyalty for their liberation struggles ( South Africa). The UN has a vote that has 141 but the remaining 52 countries account for more than 1/2 of the global population.
If the US had come to South Africa on a equal playing field and discussed the issue of Ukraine in a geopolitical context. Focused on better trade and military corporation with Mozambique ( ISIS) then maybe things would be different. They tried to use a moral justification while in South African history they are the problem.
I see that some countries keep mixing USSR and Russia. While there are similarities in that both have been ruthless authoritarian oppressive entities without rule of law, modern Russia is a nationalist imperial cleptocracy without any ideological foundation other than national supremacy, revanchism and imperialism.
