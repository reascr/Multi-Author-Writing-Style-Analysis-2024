Honestly, we're gonna get fucked either way now. Let's pray right decisions will be made, but this shit isn't going to be left unpunished. Russia is gonna get it somehow and they'll see it as provocation, or China will think it's too weak and fuck with Taiwan more. Either way, lose-lose.
Does nato have the tech to blow all Russian satellites out of the sky? That might be a good response, no obvious 2nd theater, China would think twice, win win win.
Article 4 is a nation (Poland) bringing this as a formal discussion with NATO. This will lead to either (likely) designating the missile incident as an accident, leaving it at that. Or, (unlikely) using it as an excuse to increase military readiness.
At the beginning of the Russian Invasion, all the Baltic states used article 4, article 4 is a convention of all the NATO members to determine a defense plan for the member who invoked the article 4, this doesnt mean war, it means that there is a defense concern and they want it on NATOs mind in a way.
