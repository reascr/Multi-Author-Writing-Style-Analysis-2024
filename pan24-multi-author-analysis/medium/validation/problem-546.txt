"He warned the Earth is more likely on a path to warming that amounts to “a death sentence” for countries vulnerable to that rise, including many small island nations.
In addition to threatened countries, Guterres said, “mega-cities on every continent will face serious effects, including Cairo, Lagos, Maputo, Bangkok, Dhaka, Jakarta, Mumbai, Shanghai, Copenhagen, London, Los Angeles, New York, Buenos Aires and Santiago.”.
There isn’t enough water in the ice caps to completely submerge all continents, a vast majority of the U.S. and other continents would still have plenty of land… however it would swallow up entire coastal cities and impact the densest areas of population on the planet. It would be an apocalyptic scenario for some regions having to relocate but not a water world. For instance the entire state of Florida would pretty much be swallowed up, but we aren’t looking at living on islands that used to be mountain ranges for most of humanity.
Now the weather patterns and heat issues… that’s a much bigger problem if it’s warm enough for all sea ice to permanently melt.
