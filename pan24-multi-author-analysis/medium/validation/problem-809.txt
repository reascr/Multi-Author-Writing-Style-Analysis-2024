$500 over four years is gentle compared to mine. I live in a rural area, and signed a lease for my apartment in November 2021 for $1100/month. In November 2022, when they were renewing leases they wanted $1500/month for the next year. Meanwhile my job gave us 2.3% cost of living raise to balance inflation lol. This apartment offered no amenitys other then some ran down basketball hoops. I said fuck that and found somewhere cheaper.
It’s frustrating when they’re buying up GPUs or Taylor Swift tickets, but at least in those situations I don’t need them in order to survive.
Housing scalpers are scum - it’s the biggest failing of govt that the problem hasn’t been addressed.
Yeah, right to buy really backfired when 40% of those bought have been rented out privately. Like, sure, get the benefit then rip of other people that could have really used the help you got.
It's a worldwide thing too - the increases some of my friends in Canada / us have seen is insane. (admittedly in Canada its not a high percentage increase, it was just stupid high to begin with).
