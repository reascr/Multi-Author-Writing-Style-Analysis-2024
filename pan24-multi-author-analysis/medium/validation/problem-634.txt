My Theory: The GOP shot their wad with Fox News and now they are paying the price. For the few folks on Reddit that don't know; Fox News was the brainchild of Roger Ailes who was in the Nixon White House during Watergate and felt Nixon could have survived if there was a right wing 'news' outlet that could get their narrative out, and (quote) 'do the viewer's thinking for them'..
It couldn't happen overnight, but Republicans play a great long game. Reagan eliminated the Fairness Doctrine, the craft was honed on talk radio, rag TV shows, etc.... but finally in 1996 he found his biggest benefactor in Rupert Murdoch. They spent the next 27 years spewing hate, disinformation, stupidity, and propaganda. And it worked! It helped get George W. Bush elected; it was a key mouthpiece for the Iraq war, it helped get Bush re-elected, it helped kneecap the Obama administration in 2010, it helped get Trump elected in 2016... life was good.
I want to pause for a second and explain how insanely toxic Fox News is to its viewers. This isn't "right leaning" the way MSNBC leans left. Almost every single detail is propagandized. The graphics, the color scheme, the music... all specifically chosen... when a white Christian conservative is on; the color scheme will literally change to calming whites and blues, with the US flag likely making an appearance. The sound is lower, the speech is slower and softer. When a leftist, Democrat, immigrant, minority, BLM etc. clip is playing the color scheme is red, black, the sound changes. Lastly, and most importantly, some portion of every single day is spent painting Democrats as dangerous lunatics bent on destroying the country. Random Tuesday in 1997 with absolutely nothing to report on? Let's find a 'wacko' college professor who is poisoning America's youth with communism. It has been 9628 days of nonstop rage. If you truly believed what you were watching...why WOULDN'T you hate Democrats and try to stop them no matter what it takes.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Now here's the problem. As passionate as the true believers are... they are no longer the majority. Not to say they can't do immense damage to the country. But 2022 midterm turnout was 111 million people, Fox News lead viewship on election night at 7 million. And remember Fox News is now the 'sane' right-wing option. Obviously millions more conservatives get their news and facts elsewhere... but those facts are even more deranged.
A new generation of GOP voters and, more importantly, an increasing number of elected officials, arrived that were raised on Fox News (and eventually right-wing internet). The viewers went from 'useful idiots' rowing the boat to the captains behind the wheel. The 'traditional Conservatives' that never quite believed this nonsense but were happy to accept the votes (the 'adults' in the room) aged out. The old guard of Dole, Kemp, Ford, Bush Sr., George Will, Cheney, McCain had lost control of the monster, replaced by MTG, Boebert, Gaetz, Rick Scott, Trump.
All of this leads to a problem that used to plague the Democrats... the core GOP message has fallen out of orbit with the rest of the country and is drifting into outer space. Again, they are still plenty dangerous. But the old "go right in the primary, tack to the center in the general" model has been incinerated. A generation raised on almost 30 years of propaganda demand candidates as crazy and furious as they are. And the center (myself included, former GOP) think it's fucking bonkers.
At the same time, behind those Boomers and Gen Xers are a new generation of voter that not only wanted nothing to do with Fox News; but were instead raised with the internet. 'Socialism' does not invoke images of Soviet bread lines in their mind; it invokes images of the 'Nordic model' of paved roads, free education, and universal healthcare (those countries aren't actually socialist, but still...). These youth also grew up with mass shooter drills in school. They saw their Fox News-watching parents get destroyed economically in 2008. Then they watched some of their parents and grandparents die from Covid because Fox News and Twitter told them the vaccine had microchips in it.
And most importantly, they vote. More so than any 'youth' voting bloc before them. Young voters are pissed and engaged. .
As mentioned the GOP is still very capable of harming the country. And any young Latino (in Florida in particular) will tell you that the right's new target for propaganda and misinformation is older Latinos. But if the GOP were a stock I would short it. They decided to hit up the ATM and go all-in, and for a while it was on a roll. But they're crapping out.
And Fox News helped to kill off nearly 600,000 (and counting) GOP voters to a now preventable death.
Terrific post, really helps contextualize where these extremists are coming from. I wonder if at some point FoxNews will have to go even harder right to maintain mindshare.
Great ratings and clicks do not equal votes. Fox News doing an offensive segment on women who don't want to have children; or Matt Gaetz tweeting about fat women might get eyes and rage points... but if you are trying to win elections it's poison. Childless overweight women just might still want low taxes; but when you wrap your party brand in hate you aren't winning any new voters.
My perspective is as an engaged political person. It's hard to break out of my own point of view to think about how normal non politically engaged people think about what they see online. I can totally see how people would start to see the right as batshit and then go vote for the first time in a long time.
Yes, it's the algorithms colliding isn't it? What drives clickbaity engagement is the wrong formula for getting people to back your candidate. And because all the tweets, audioclips, and soundbytes stick around they can't tack to center in the general like they used to.
Super sharp observation there (no sarcasm). I hadn't considered that engagement optimization for page views runs counter to motivating people to actually get off their asses and vote!
