I voted Republican my entire life. I even voted for Trump the first time. I had never voted for a democrat president until this recent election. Thanks to Trump and the GOP that allowed his treachery I can swear on my life I will never ever vote Republican again in my life. I lost two good friends one in Iraq shot by a sniper and another blown to bits in Afghanistan. The Capitol and the entire Washinon DC is a symbol of that sacrifice. Trump lead an insurrection on sacred ground and it took him hours to finally go on TV and call off his supporters. I try to tell my MAGA family if they support trump or the GOP they support the desecration of Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice. Jan 6th brought tears to my eyes especially considering these were my neighbors who had no problem shitting all over my friends sacrifices.
