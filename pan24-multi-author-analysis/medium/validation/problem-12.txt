Republicans should take a moment and realize, understand that you are the reason Biden is so appealing. Every time you guys boo him and detract from him we ask ourselves why? And when we do we see he's right way too often and think this guy isn't so bad after all. It's hard to complain about Biden when you haven't offered us anyone better. Trump is a trainwreck, an impulsive and short sighted pathological liar. DeSantis is arguably even worse. Try electing someone who doesn't openly despise and antagonise people who are different from them. It's a lot different than Democrats antagonizing Republicans for their beliefs because we choose what we believe. Republicans attack people for being trans, woke, gay, black or female. That's way worse because people don't choose those things.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
