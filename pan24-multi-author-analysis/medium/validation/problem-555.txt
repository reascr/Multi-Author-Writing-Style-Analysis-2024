If they’re concerned about trace amounts of the medication getting into the water supply, then they better be ready to try to treat ALL medications the same way, because it isn’t just trace amounts of abortion pills that end up in wastewater….
They do realize that there are a huge number of miscarriages unrelated to abortion pills resulting in tissue being flushed down the toilet every single day, right?
