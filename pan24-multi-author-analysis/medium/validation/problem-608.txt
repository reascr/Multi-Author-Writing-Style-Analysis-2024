Visited my dad a couple times, and his room had to be accessed through the ER, and 5 of the 6 days it looked like a world war 1 field hospital with people slumped over coughing, kids crying and all sorts of chaos.
The number of total cases has become meaningless what is relevant is vaccinated against unvacinated cases and how full we are on hospital beds those are the numbers we should be concerned about. At some point we have to go back to how it was. we have to let covid become endemic because what is the alternative? Lock downs forever? At some point the pandemic has to be over.
I mean its fairly pointless you don't need masks to visit restaurants and unlike in the west a lot of food is shared. There are so many holes in it at this point.
I mean at this point should we even worry? It is far more likly now that a huge part of those 50k are vaccinated and those vaccinated tend to spread the desease less and tend to not become as sick. At some point we have to end this we can no longer eradicate it so we should just let it take its natural cause.
Vaccines arenâ€™t as effective on elderly. Korea has a high elderly population. It also has high population density. Most elderly live with their children and even grandchildren.
