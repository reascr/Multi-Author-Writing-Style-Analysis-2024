Tax fraud in TX for sure, they are pretty clear about what "principle residence" means when you file the paperwork for a homestead exemption (it's a pretty standard thing there, but was new to us when we moved there and bought a house several years ago).
Arguably, you are not an inhabitant of a state at the time of your election if you claim principal residence in a different state at that time.
The text in the Constitution is vague enough that it requires judicial interpretation/caselaw to reach a conclusion. I’m not sure what the caselaw looks like, but that’s not the same thing as saying that he is definitively federally eligible to run for Senate.
The idea that this is the GOP's idea of a qualified Black man makes me sick. If I was a Black Republican I'd be pissed, but then again Black republicans ready live in an alternate universe so they may actually be proud of this moron.During 2020 election they were so proud that they elected one Lt. Give. They had be reminded that Dems had already elected several Black governor's and we just elected a Blasian VP.

Not that hard. We know when the election ends. Even with a runoff the election still ends in a year he is claiming tax benefits for primary residence in Texas.
If questioned, he could certainly claim to have moved his primary residence between Georgia and Texas multiple times in both 21 and 22, but we all know that would be at best a legal fiction. And since it would be a fiction, and since he has done a wide variety of things in both states and both years that require legal residency, it would be pretty easy for him to accidentally admit, while making excuses, to primary residency in the wrong state at the wrong time, or for an insufficient number of consecutive days for his actions to all be legal.
