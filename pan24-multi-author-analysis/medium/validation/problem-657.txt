There was this video game I played where every time I destroyed an enemy base, this propaganda radio would come on air and announce that it was a planned demolition, or that it was done to preserve the area's natural environment or something. Don't exactly remember what game though, Just Cause 3 maybe?
.... 30.2F isn't summer weather for a large part of the globe. Like seriously you can just Google the Temps in the arctic and realize that it's warmer than freezing during the summer, Antarctica is colder but it still averages above freezing.
worth noting as well, you're going to get an increase in accidents when you have an increase in activity. For example, you don't usually slip and fall when you're calmly going about your business. You slip and fall when you're rushing or are short on sleep. Same goes for equipment failure. If the equipment is just sitting unused, it's not going to break or cause an accident. Once you start mobilizing it, that's when it breaks. You can't drop a crate of explosives if they never move from storage. Only when you start moving/using them can you have an accident with them.
