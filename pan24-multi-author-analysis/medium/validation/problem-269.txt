The Afficionado Tendieso is a group I like. For the more refined gentlesir who knows the finest minds require the finest refreshments, this guild will help you pair your favorite tendies with the best Dew of choice. But beware: the guild master has an intellect that dwarfs even the most enlightened of gentlesirs. One poor kid tried to argue that Baja Blast was an inferior product and should never have been sold, and the intellectual trouncing he received was so savage the kid never fully recovered. Some say he still aimlessly wanders these lands today, a broken husk of a man with no purpose or destination.
Because that last line is largely bullshit that they want you to believe. The current party’s secretary is the de facto “paramount ruler”. At one point, he was both the party leader and the President, he’s the single most powerful man in Vietnam right now.
>Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four "pillars": the powerful party's secretary, the president, the prime minister and the chair of the parliament.
