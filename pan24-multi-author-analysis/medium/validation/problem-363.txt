The Biden administration is yet again extending the pause on federal student loan payments, a benefit that began in March 2020 to help people who were struggling financially due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a source familiar with the plan said.
The Department of Education will announce it is extending the freeze another six months with the first payments due two months after June 30, the source said, unless a Supreme Court decision on the presidentâ€™s student loan relief program comes first.
The administration had previously said the most recent extension would be the last, and payments were scheduled to restart in January.
