Imagine Trump suddenly without a stage or social media. Imagine if he could no longer broadcast all of his stupidity to the world. He would already be in jail, and nobody would ever know the lies he is trying to conjure up to seed his followers with anger. His goal is simple:keep the message clear, and somewhat consistent, to seed hate and garner support from his gullible, hateful base. Without that continuous feed of Trumpformation into their brains, they might find themselves listening to common sense, and snapping out of it. The world needs to mute Trump.
