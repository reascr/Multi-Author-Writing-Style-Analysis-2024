That’s not true. The German army was basically stripped to the bone. The German Air Force was prohibited from having planes and the German Navy was confiscated. Parts of western Germany were occupied by the French and British and war reparations levied as part of the Versailles Treaty were ruinous to the German economy. The Germans knew that they lost the war but the emerging far right in the 1920s and 30s blamed communists and Jews on the home front for stabbing the German Army in the back and losing the war. It was all bullshit because the German Army was crumbling during the Hundred-Days Offensive and would have completely collapsed had the war not ended on 11 Nov 1918.
How could anyone trust Russia to keep to its side of a negotiated settlement anyway. They've done nothing but lie. I can't help but think they'd use any ceasefire as an opportunity to re-arm and attack again.
Of course they are pathological liars, you’re dealing basically with a 90s mob who came to power and is thinking everyone’s intelligence is inferior to their own. Yet here they are losing everywhere and making these statements for the sake of statements. The talking mustache here is universally a meme here that goes: “I know nothing, please stop asking me your fucking questions”. Or making these dumb cringe claims.
