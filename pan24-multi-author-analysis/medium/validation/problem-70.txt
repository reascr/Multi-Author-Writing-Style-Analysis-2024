Had your chance for 20 years to defend their interests. Real doubtful you will defend their interests now. Should have picked up that gun when you had the chance.
I agree with your take one hundred percent. The shitty thing is the guys have power, cruelty, and many psychological tricks to get what they want. Look at Iranâ€™s women the past few generations.
They won't treat women equally, give afghan women programs to leave the country to get the opportunities they can't get at home. See how the taliban men do without women at all, rather than just having them for breeding/slave purposes.
I wish I (and even moreso, the world) had a better answer for these and other repressed groups not just in the middle east but everywhere.
yeah, maybe thats why women can still go to school and get an education in America, instead of just birthing babies and making sandwiches... Stupid Americans and their ability to flush dictators down the crapper. How dare they say that you should fight for your own right to exist and live! lol.
