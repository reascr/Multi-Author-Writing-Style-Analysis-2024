Bit of a rant here about my beloved country. Canada has opened the floodgates for anyone and everyone. 500,000 per year plus 250,000 international students and 125,000 temporary work permit employees in all industries. This is going to be more every year as per Justin Trudeau's policy. Rent for a one bedroom in Canada is averaging $2000. a month, if you can find one. Homelessness in the winter sucks. There will be many deaths this year in this country because there is no place people can afford to live. We have Ukrainians landing in Vancouver whom can't find a place and it has been on national news for awhile. This country will welcome you but don't expect a place to live unless you are renting a room for $1200 per month with a house full of people and one bathroom. There is absolutely a housing crises in this country, not to mention 24 hour waits in your local hospital to be seen and 3 day waits for a bed while you wait in the hallways with hundreds of other citizens.
Technically the Ukrainian refugees who come to Canada could eventually get citizenship. It's a bit of a long process as they start as temporary residents who can have a chance to become permanent residents who can then become citizens.And.
Just donated again last night, every little bit really helps. Their economy is gonna be in the ground for awhile after this so hopefully people keep supporting.
So it would take around 5 years or so of them living in Canada before they could get full citizenship.
