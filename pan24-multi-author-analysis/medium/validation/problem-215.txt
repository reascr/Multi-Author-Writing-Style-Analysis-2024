Not defending republicans on this because when it comes to immigration there are competing camps in the party who have different goals and so it’s generally just easier for them to agree on keeping the status quo.
BUT, at the same time I have yet to see a deal put forward by dems or the gop that would actually be considered a fair compromise.
This “deal”, what? Trades amnesty in exchange for increased BP wages and a one year extension on title 42? This is hardly what I would call a compromise.
I hear you but from my POV the Republicans have moved the goalpost on immigration compromise so many times, it's really sucked the trust out of everyone. Just 3-4 years ago, it was funding for the wall that was paramount. We had a shutdown over it. A deal was supposedly struck in the WH which included wall funding. Then the deal was pulled by the WH.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Also, Democrats are more than willing to compromise. Who do you see having press conferences jumpstarting conversations and urging the need to work on immigration compromise? Sen Durbin has been trying to do something for 20+ yrs. On the opposite end you have the GOP threatening to jail the DHS chief, instantly pour cold water over a bipartisan framework (i.e. John Cornyn), shutting the door on anything bipartisan, saying "my way or the highway." These two are just not the same.
As far as walls go, its all nonsense. Its an expensive attempt to give the appearance of security when in reality it does little to stop the problem. It was one mans dream (guess who) that was never an issue until he started beating his nationalist drum and making scapegoats of people who do jobs that you and I would never consider doing.
Any sort of amnesty needs to actually fix the asylum backlog without just waving everyone through or loosening the requirements to qualify for asylum, there needs to be mandatory e-verify and massive penalties for businesses that don’t comply, and we need to move towards a points based system for allocating visas.
Don’t even get me started on the whiney-ass farmers and their republican allies who want more easily exploitable and cheap slav- i mean “temporary worker visas with easier to comply with regulations”.
Anyway, I don’t disagree that Republicans should actually try to make a real deal with Democrats on immigration, it just seems like Republicans have so many competing interests that are at odds with eachother, while Democrats aren’t willing to include anything that fixing problems with the asylum system that doesn’t include making it less restrictive.
Because more and more people keep entering the country every year this way and they’re for the most part, not the high-skilled and highly educated immigrants that a large consensus agrees we need to be attracting, most people either want immigration levels to stay the same or lower (and I don’t believe that when those polls inform people of what the numbers are that they even include people entering to apply for asylum), most studies have found that higher immigration leads to less support for welfare programs and I personally am in favor of more robust welfare schemes than we currently have, the way asylum works keeps people in limbo for years allowing them to set down roots when in the end the vast majority do not qualify for asylum. Credible fear screening is a very low bar to meet, but the bar for asylum is specific because it was not meant as a catch-all for people who do not qualify by other means, to migrate.
Like I could go on and on and ramble about this, but basically even when you read the comment sections on extremely liberal leaning media websites- there’s only a small fraction of people that think asylum is already too restrictive.
About your specific points that need to be implemented, almost all of them (e verify, border security, etc) were in the 2013 gang of 8 bill. GOP controlled house did not take it up at all. There is fear of going big bc of that "amnesty" word no matter how good the border security piece may be. So you see there is a history of GOP not being genuine.
An ICE unit that puts human dignity first - not riding around on their high horses (literally) driving people back into the Rio Grande. An ICE unit that doesnt rely on cages and family separation, something we have never done to our European cousins. An administration that recognizes the difference between immigrants and refugees.
I am not in favor of open borders, and I think overpopulation is a strong environmental concern. Its a complex issue that unfortunately I cannot solve. ICE and this Republican governor need to clean up their act.
