Barely and it actually became part of the problem. Germany's economy was destroyed in the aftermath of WW1 and, when the Nazis took over, they did a lot of stuff to make it look like everything was going great and Germany was on the up and up, but in reality, it was all a sham, most notably the idea that Nazi Germany had an amazingly efficient war machine. In brief, a lot of what the Nazis did was create ways to get more people to do the same amount of work (i.e layers of bureaucracy, kicking Jewish people/other minorities out of jobs, encouraging women to stay at home, etc) and look pretty in front of the camera while doing it. While this can sort of work during peacetime, the Nazis ran into problems once WW2 started because they were never able to ramp up production for the war effort and couldn't really build up new factories and production lines because of layers of bureaucracy and petty infighting amongst the higher-ups. Pretty much, the more they controlled the more it strained their system.
