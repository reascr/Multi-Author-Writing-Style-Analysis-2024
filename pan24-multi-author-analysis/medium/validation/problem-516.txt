Lmfao. Same government that deflected faults of the Itaewon crisis while secluding selective media outlets because they reported some negative information that he said?
It's embarrassing to admit but better under this scenario than a more serious one. Given this and what we are seeing in Ukraine it's clear the value of drones on the battlefield is real and hard to counter. Likely we will be seeing the deployment of anti-drone....drones in the next few years. Launching helicopters, fighter jets, & missiles is just not cost-effective when it's against a drone that probably cost $10k or less.
When that good is a literal nothing, then it’s better to call that shit out. What have the administration done? It’s disaster after disaster.
Literal trainwreck after trainwreck disaster. But all he does is nothing but deflect blame rather than plan an actual counter measure that would have meaningful effect. I’d say that’s a setback rather than a start.
Edit 1. Dumbasses are downvoting who have 0 idea about Korean politics or the current assembly hearings about this. THEYRE BLAMING EACH OTHER RATHER THAN TAKING PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES FOR PREVENTING FUTURE INCIDENTS. They’ve been doing this for the past fucking 7 months. Idiots read one headline and go hivemind.
Not really. He was rambling about not having a dedicated drone unit when we literally have one and had one since 2018. Then he started going off on the fucking defense minister for “not being prepared” as if shooting 500+ rounds, crashing a fucking jet and following with helicopters weren’t enough.
Yoon didn’t even know we had dedicated drone force, when it was set up in 2018. How the fuck do you not know this during a security hearing.
