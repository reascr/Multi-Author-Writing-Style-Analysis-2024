Crimea is not currently a war zone, and the worst thing that can happen in this situation is a major bloodshed on the Crimean territory during the attempts to reclaim the "rightful clay" and restore the "historical justice".
Because that's what typically happens when territories and their recognition by states are put first, and zero fucks are given about the population.
We are already tired of this shit, a lot of Crimeans have left for Ukraine, someone has moved to Russia, the local population is disappearing and being replaced by Russians from Moscow who have a lot of money, which locals consider to be slaves. Why pay more? All these places are occupied by visiting Russians, housing is being built for wealthy Russians, and local people work for 20,000 rubles ($ 300 per month). Of course, many new "Crimeans" (Russians) will be against joining back to Ukraine, since there are already half of them here. They came to us under 1 million from Russia and they are afraid of losing their property that was bought cheap or taken away by force from locals.
Crimeans are very passive and it played a very cruel joke. We lived quietly, but the desire for "historical justice" of the neighboring country made our life very difficult. And yes, I'm talking about the one who started this war.
1. Crimea used to be controlled by Ukraine until 9 years ago. People born back then are literally fucking not out of elementary school. It's not, "historical justice", because that would imply they are trying trying to reclaim territory that they lost decades or centuries ago. It's a recent, ongoing conflict.
2. Crimea IS Ukrainian territory. It is widely recognized as such by almost every country in the world, and the Russian annexation of it breached the international law in multiple ways.
While I agree with all your other points, the Russian colonization of Crimea has been a very long process and most of the colonizers there were not just from the past decade. It has been going on for centuries at various times, and especially took off once Soviets took control and deported the Tatars to Siberia in 1944. Some Tatars even came back after the USSR collapsed, but not nearly as many were there originally.
