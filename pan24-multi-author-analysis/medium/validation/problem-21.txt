The probe centers on the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia but raises red flags about inadequate safeguards throughout the immigration detention system, a senior Senate official said in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg Government before the release of the findings.
"Immigrants in a US detention facility endured excessive, unnecessary gynecological procedures, often without consent, according to a bipartisan Senate investigation that offers the starkest details yet of alleged mistreatment.
The investigation builds on earlier scrutiny of the privately run Georgia facility following allegations from a whistleblower who said a doctor contracted by the detention center had performed gynecological procedures on detainees without their consent. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas halted US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s use of the facility last year.
Senate investigators reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of medical records and related documents, and determined immigrants at the Irwin County center were subjected to unnecessary transvaginal ultrasounds, contraceptive injections, and dilation and curettage procedures, the Senate official said. The report also highlights repeated failures by detention officials to obtain informed consent from detainees and a failure by ICE to vet medical providers and ensure detainees’ basic human rights, the official said.".
It's the same doctor. He basically figured out a cheat code to bill the government for extra services. The question is why the federal government continued to do business with him after that.
The same administration that argued that migrant children didn't need showers, soap, toothbrushes, proper bedding, adequate sleep, or hot meals in custody? Then petitioned to keep them indefinitely.
It's one doctor who has figures out how to bill the government for unnecessary procedures. Probably a lack of oversight and government accountants not wanting to step on the political landmine of questioning reproductive care.
