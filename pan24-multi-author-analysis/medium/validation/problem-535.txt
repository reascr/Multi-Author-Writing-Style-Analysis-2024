The funniest part to me is how Republicans would literally be tripping over themselves in a heartbeat to nominate this Dr. Dre as their presidential candidate if he came out as conservative in the middle of a string of incidents where he said some very offensive, politically incorrect things. They would become so obnoxious overnight about blasting his music from every diesel-guzzling vehicle in the country, shrieking about how he's a real doctor and Jill Biden is an imposter, etc. (Not that The Chronic wouldn't be a welcome improvement on its own over their current choices.).
Think about it, my good patriot homie: Death is the same number of letters as "white." And Row is the same number of letters as "hat." Thus, Dre and Snoop are clearly engaged in a noble, covert existential battle for the soul of the world against evil East Coast globalists. Or, like others suggest, was '90's hip hop even more malevolent than we thought: a false flag or psy-op in a Cold War between Patriots and the deep state?
They'd all sell their tacky MAGA shit to start trapping and making beats to get rich like their new god hero merely because a top 10 Q-Anon influencer was having a slow week and falling behind on rent, so she made a suggestive video wildly misinterpreting a Dre lyric about getting his dick sucked "liberally" or something, then highlighting his conservative bonafides like being a CEO of a huge company he created, a legacy of homophobic lyrics, and credible accusations of violence against women in public. There would be so many bad Republican thug life videos and memes for a while, many of which would inexplicably and mistakenly use pics of Ice Cube. Conspiracies would abound that Snoop was Q, Death Row was a front for white hat conservative lunatics, and that Eazy-E was going to be reincarnated as JFK Junior.
Interesting historical note: most of you are probably too young to remember this, but conservatives went through a similar phase briefly in the late 90s over a misunderstanding of something Silkk the Shocker said on stage. They were all suddenly sagging their pants and calling Bill Clinton wack.

So true. Conservatives are far too consumed enjoying the supposed irony of "whiny liberals who used to care about things and listen to Rage Against the Machine in the 90s" are now the ones wearing masks and getting vaccinated like over 99% of licensed physicians in the US, effectively transforming themselves into The Man whom they used to hate, according to the science-illiterate moron community.
