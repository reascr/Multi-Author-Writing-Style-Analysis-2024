SF already banned all gun stores so contacting the SFPD with WE WANT MORE GUNS BANNED is just going to get shrugs. Sacramento might do something but there's not much to do besides imposing a psych eval, which won't do much except ban most immigrants from getting legal guns as they're disproportionately impacted and cannot obtain healthcare as easily. Nevermind the fact that the handgun in the Half Moon Bay shooting was from San Mateo Co, who won't ever ban such sales because they make so much taxable money from it.
