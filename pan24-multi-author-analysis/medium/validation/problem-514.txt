“the dead are two lieutenant generals, eight major generals, 44 colonels, 98 lieutenant colonels, 193 majors, 279 captains, 471 senior lieutenants, 235 lieutenants and 72 soldiers of other ranks”.
They have artillery going for them because unlike the other professionals soldiers that died on the frontline, the artillery units are alive because they're safe at the back. For now. I bet Ukraine are targeting them next.
they destroyed a lot of artillery. The safe ones are deep in Russia/Belarus that are firing the long range ballistic missiles. But they are starting to run low on those.
That’s just not the case though, when you have no NCOs in your units that further ties your officers to NCO level tasks. They have to work down. I kinda get what you are saying, their seniority is amplified in a sense but it’s not reality. If you have a company of troops and you take away the corporals and sergeants then your lieutenants don’t become captains, your lieutenants end up having to act as corporals and sergeants, and then the captain ends up having to work steps down as well. Without NCOs you end up even increasing the threshold for what a “high ranking officer” is.
