Privatization is a dangerous scam. This is a lesson we should have learned in no uncertain terms after the past 4 decades of the neoliberalism era. If anything, we should be smashing privatization across many, many, many industries instead of finding new and horrific ways that it can seep into what little it hasn't already.
Medicare Advantage is a total rip off. Do NOT get suckered into it. Stay on Traditional Medicare Part A & B then purchase a Medigap Part G (Plan G or Plan N) but only from a long term reputable health insurance company like United Health Care. Also get a Part D Prescription Drug plan but check that meds you need are in the Tier you are purchasing. Frankly ask for Tier 3 coverage and pay $27.00/mo so that whatever your doctor prescribes is covered. Better to pay the premiums and have the medical coverage than to get fooled by $0 premiums and Give Back benefits advertised on TV by has been Sports and TV Stars when your copays will be 80% higher than traditional Medicare and your yearly maximums are less than 10% of what traditional Medicare covers. As you research know that Medicare has been forbidden since 2018 from commenting negatively about private for profit insurance companies and absolutely forbidden from telling you that Medicare Advantage is a total rip off of You and the Medicare Trust Fund.
