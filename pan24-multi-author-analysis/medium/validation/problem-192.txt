Twitter is still relevant to people like me because the communities we belong to (Art Twitter, Black Twitter, Gaming and FGC Twitter, Software Development Twitter, Photography Twitter, Electronics Hobbyist Twitter, Skateboard Twitter) are still active there and we're not going to just drop it overnight, and unfortunately, most of them will never migrate to Mastodon.
I almost feel like that moniker is used ironically in general now since those who complain about their free speech the most tend to have the most brittle glass houses while constantly itching for a rock fight.
Remember that Benzoaddict from Canada who cried about free speech while simultaneously suing anyone who dared to utter critique about his books?
It's very easy for people who didn't use Twitter to promote their business or was part of multiple communities that were very active on Twitter to say "They must love right wing tweets randomly showing up in their timeline even if they donâ€™t follow them!". Either you're exaggerating or somehow I've gotten lucky because my Twitter feed hasn't had right-wing nonsense bleed into it it for about two years now.
