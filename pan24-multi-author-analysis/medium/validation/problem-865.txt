The vice presidents schedule would always be marked as “classified” as you don’t want everyone knowing your every move for safety reasons. Their schedule may even be marked as “top secret” if they have a meeting, phone call, or unannounced visit with a foreign leader. These classification marking don’t just go away after the fact and the people conducting these searches don’t have a reason to read the contents. They see “classified” and hand them over to the people that need to know. Nearly any “classified” document is benign as they hand them out to 18 year olds like candy.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
