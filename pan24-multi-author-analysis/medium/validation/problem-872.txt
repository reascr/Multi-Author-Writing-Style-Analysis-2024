There’s other info on the page, you can see if you follow link. It mentions other POWs, that they’ve been fed, taken care of in a humanitarian manner. And there’s repeated info about Geneva. The Russians know that “Geneva conventions” means basically that are fed, get medical treatment, not tortured—they know because they’re told that Russia abides and Ukraine does not. The biggest hurdle is to get them to trust the unknown (Ukraine) when only have been presented picture that it’s evil. But when they’re pushed far enough (mistreated by commanders, freezing, etc), many are willing to take the gamble that maybe what they heard was untrue and surrender is a better option.
I'm always amazed and touched at the assistance being offered to Ukraine by countries that I would have assumed did not give a flying fuck about what is happening there.
It may not be much in the larger scheme of things, but they are giving what they've got, which is extensive experience with landmine removal.
[It's estimated there is 4 to 6 million landmines and other unexploded ordinance still spread all over Cambodia. ].
