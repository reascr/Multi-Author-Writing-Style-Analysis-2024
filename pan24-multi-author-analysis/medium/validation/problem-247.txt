China also has Pakistan. India is extremely close to Russia at the moment. Qatar is with Iran. South Africa seems to side with Russia. If Pakistan and India can endure each other, we are talking about countries with 3.4 billion+ in population are potentially in this modern axis.

And it, by elegant design, removes the censorship and control that all these Predictable Old men have over their people by removing the means.
