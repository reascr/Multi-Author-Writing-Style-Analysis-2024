The terminal at New York Airport had to close, but rather than divert to nearby New Jersey, they went all the way back to New Zealand. Clearly the New Jersey Board of Tourism has some work to do. /s.
I don't get it. You are at the halfway point, 8hrs into the flight why turn back when a diversion to a nearby airport would only cause logistical issues that the airline has plenty of time to coordinate..??
There is no reason it would be stuck. What they are saying of they may have been waiting with the aircraft to continue to NYC. But they could have rebooked the passengers on other airlines and returned to Auckland empty. That would have just cost more.
The article mentioned the plane would be stuck for several days if it diverted. They didn't explain why, but if it's not flying for several days, that's lost revenue. This sounds like a purely monitary decision. One defacto canceled flight is better than several.
They could deadhead a crew to HNL or LAX, airports they serve. All I know is be pissed if I spent 16 hours in a coach seat just to land back where I started and told I have to do 16 hrs more to get to where Iâ€™m going.
