Western policy towards Iran has been a huge miserable, nonsensical failure for 45 years… Israel is now chiming up to Russia because it fears a Russian victory in this war yet they are owe their existence to the west for its security yet the entire Western world, for Israel’s sake, keeping in mind Iran has never invaded another country or initiated a war itself, have heavily sanctioned, alienated and forced Iran into resorting to depending on the development of a homegrown and now formidable military arsenal that it has today that it would not have had if it didn’t have these harsh measures forced onto it, and now aligning itself with a country like Russia, who in reality is actually its historical rival and regional foe rather than a friend or allie … and still, still the west keep pushing in the wrong direction having not learnt a thing yet and leaving nothing to salvage in relations.
Considering that Iran does not have nuclear weapons at the moment… but doing its best to acquire them, been part of None Proliferation Treaty is more or less meaningless.
With the way Iran supports Russia these days, and the way it continues nuclear research… world may become much more receptive to pre-emotive strikes to prevent research to conclude into functional weapon.
