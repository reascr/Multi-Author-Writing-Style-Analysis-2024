Its wild this is not a bigger story. Countries around the world buying the same spyware and pretty much nothing on reddit of what they were doing with it.
It’s insane. I watched the 2 part Frontline doc on this and it’s so insane how Pegasus is an unregulated company. Their shit ass of a lawyer told reporters that they vet countries who buy the software yet when pressed about Hungary and why they were given the software when its KNOWN that Hungary is a sketchy place at best, he had no answer and kept repeating “we don’t talk about our current customers”.
the company is not called pegasus, but NSO Group and it is an Israeli cyber intelligence for profit org manned by ex-mosad members. Credit where credit is due please.
1) Pegasus can be installed on any phone, it doesn't require the user to click on a link. Many countries are using it. It allows complete access to all the information on the phone...location data, texts, photos, calls....and it can turn the phone into a remote listening device, flipping the mic on so that they can listen in on conversations.
2) Mueller said that he had incomplete data on the Trump Administration's connection to Russia as related to the 2016 election, because members of the Administration were using non-government phones to communicate.
