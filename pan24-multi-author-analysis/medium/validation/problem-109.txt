"Records don't help the other side from clearing their territory of these mines. Also in a warzone some records will be lost/ignored/ messed up, and even missed mine is a potentially blended civilian kid.".
but Finland for example did and it was one of the most stupid decision they could've made back then.
The Ottawa treaty was a beautiful idea, but once a country like Russia does not agree to it, none of the neighbouring countries should've not done it either.
Anti-personnel mines are, especially the ones the Russians are using which are just complete and utter war crimes, however anti-tank mines are very cool indeed when used appropriately. Stick 'em nice and visible on a road, now your enemy has 2 choices, use another road, or stay hours at that one cleaning them up, meanwhile your pre-ranged artillery can hit 'em hard.
They are ok, if the mines are actually mapped correctly. For example how to prevent the enemy from disarming AT mines? Place some god damn anti personnel mines around them.
