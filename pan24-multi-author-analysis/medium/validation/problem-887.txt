Thoughts on someone who’s a senior manager in public (regional firm vs big 4, but large companies are my thing (usually revenue 200mm+)), 10 years exp. How hard do you think it would be to get in the door if you’re familiar. Asking umm.. for a friend..
Go for it. USAJobs.gov, pretty sure there are plenty of revenue agent postings for LBI. They start at GS13, but there might be some 14s too. look up what that means in your city, then once you put in an application , if you get an interview and a tentative offer, use your current salary to negotiate for a higher step, if necessary. Applying for federal jobs is really confusing and the hiring process moves at an excruciatingly slow pace. Check out r/usajobs for guidance.
