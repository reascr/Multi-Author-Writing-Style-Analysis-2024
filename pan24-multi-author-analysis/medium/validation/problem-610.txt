I'm cautiously optimistic that voters, whether in Arizona or elsewhere, will start to reap what Biden has been sowing, or at least have a clear path to doing so, and of course, that Trump's standing in the public eye will only worsen in the next 20 months.
Also have concerns about how big of a factor Biden’s age will really play once campaigns start, we know that it’s going to be the main talking point for whoever their nominee is.
