He was actually sponsored by Swedens SD (far right with nazi roots) party according to Swedish media.
A deep investigation in most far right groups in EU would probably bring some facts and data about donations and whatnot. Looking at you France! Le pen lady eg.
Pretty much how it is. If your neighbor lets his dog shit on your lawn, you don't blame everyone in the neighborhood for it happening. Not every Swede lit the Qur'an on fire, its just some right-wing jackass being a right-wing jackass.
Actually SD has specifically said that they were not involved in sponsoring him. The person that sponsored his permit this last time is a media-person that works for both SD and SVT (state owned media) and it is said he did this on his own accord where he also claims he was not aware of Paludan's plans when he did the sponsoring.
Furthermore, it would be better to say that Paludan has ties to AFS since he is/was a member of that party. Which is an even more extreme right wing party. They stopped supporting him when the allegations of pedo stuff came out.
