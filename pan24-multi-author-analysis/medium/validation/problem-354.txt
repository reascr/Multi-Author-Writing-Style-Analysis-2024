Still something a museum would keep, just doesn't get displayed. Every museum has a shit ton of stuff that they don't think people would want to see.
In the last few years a lot of museums have been returning this stuff, problem is some museums just have so freaking much of it especially Native American artifacts.
Unless I am missing something, the basis of calling the coin authentic is the scratches that are consistent with having being worn in a purse? Because no fake coins were ever found in purses . I thought editorial standards were a bit higher at the beebs.
There's different kinds of fake. These were presumed to me be modern fakes trying to pass as ancient coins, not fake ancient coins trying to pass as real ancient coins. Basically this proves they're likely not a hoax, and that they were in use, however briefly, in ancient times. That use could have included faking a different ancient coin, but I'm not sure how widespread that practice was and whether it really disproves the existence of the guy whose face was on the coins. After all, finding a fake pound with the picture of the Queen on it doesnt disprove the existence of the Queen, quite the opposite.
I am interested in the coin as a means to prove the existence of hereto unknown Roman leader who presumably supervised the retreat of the legions around 270 ad. I didn’t come across his name until now - I’m not a specialist but take an interest in the Roman presence in that part of Europe.
