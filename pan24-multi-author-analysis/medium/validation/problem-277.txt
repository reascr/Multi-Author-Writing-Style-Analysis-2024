I just feel like deathsentence has a list of financial crimes, constitutional crimes and social justice crimes as long as the state of FL. There's so much he has done in plain sight and he's so belligerent. I want to know that somebody's got their eye on him, because, like tfg, his crap emboldens people.
Who objects? Not us, not those in power... it's these sort of absurdities that should be a warning that our nation is crumbling and on its last breath but we keep playing the game of "wait and see".
Have you asked the people in power? Nah but seriously, the government only exists via power we allow as citizens. The shit only runs because we let it. When enough people are fed up we can finally realize our collective strenh.

That's supposed to be the idea but when you take a step back and look at the big picture you'll see that we have 1 major political party that has turned into a fascist regime and our wealth distribution at its worst point in our entire history. If that's not enough, then what is? It was only the other day when our government's leader were feeding us disinformation in regards to a deadly disease that has now killed over 1M Americans ffs. What more could it take?
