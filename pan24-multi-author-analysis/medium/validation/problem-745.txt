I have thought from time to time that if I ever just wanted to get super rich and powerful, the easiest way would be to throw all of my morals and self respect out the window and join the GOP. I could just lie about anything and everything to a bunch of dumb hick rubes and take all their money while laughing all the way to the bank.

They are upset about things but they accuse innocent people while ignoring those who are actually doing the thing. None of them gave a shit about or knew about Balenciaga until Tucker Carlson did a fear mongering show about them, now they’re doing Qanon shit to circle things in pictures to back up their conspiracy theories. It’s pathetic and destructive.

Seems all voting fraud committed is by the despicable vile republicans. But wait now their orange leader wants to do away with the constitution Imagine that.
Well they’re the same ones who are pitching a fit about Balenciaga claiming that Baal enci aga means Baal is king in Latin……… like that’s not even remotely close.
They’re also the ones showing up to drag queen story time with guns while several Republican candidates got in trouble for actually SA kids, while also ignoring the thousands of indigenous children’s body’s that have been found at Catholic Church residential schools.
