It's funny how in the aftermath of every one of these ass crumpets, the same Right wing talking heads cheering it on while it was "hypothetical" suddenly hate their own narcissistic syncopates when the deed is done.
They always claim their own people are too gay, trans, brown, were too leftist ten years ago to be Republican now, ect ect.
I wonder if these people ever feel betrayed by their talking heads. I'd love to read a interview where they complain about their side "abandoning" them. Just for the sweet irony.
Doesn’t matter who you are. If you inflict violence against democrats, you’re a hero to Republicans.
