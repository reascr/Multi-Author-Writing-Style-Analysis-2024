Perry only generally wins in my estimation due to the same mistakes that always seems to be the issue with stereotypical old school Democratic party. They spend almost no money in general on this race dispite it being a winnable district. They put up bad candidates or candidates with no name recognition, spend no money on TV/internet/advertisement. I actually know quite a few of the folks living in the district who always try to convince the state and national party of this for it to fall on deaf ears. Basically, from my understanding the the old school Dems running the party in the area ignore them.

Something else Scott Perry has that Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz don't? A winnable district.
Perry represents the Harrisburg area in south-central Pennsylvania, which has flown to the left in recent years. In 2022, Perry's opponent got very little national attention or money, and didn't have a big-time campaign. Perry only won by 7.8 points - close enough that a better-supported challenger could take him out. This district also would have voted for Trump by just 4 points. While I don't have the numbers in front of me, I believe Democrat Josh Shapiro won it in his race for Governor. It's completely winnable.
But the way to win starts now. It means getting the word out about Perry and what he stands for - especially if you live in south-central PA. Don't wait for the Democrats to do it - take to social media and make a post. Talk to people you know. Start the momentum now.
And when election season kicks up, donate to Perry's challenger, or the PA Dems. Volunteer for whoever takes him on - you can do this from anywhere in the country. r/VoteDEM will have resources on how to do this (they're worth joining now to be aware of election happening right now, too!).
I was really rooting for Shamaine Daniels, I encouraged others to donate to her campaign. I wish their district race had been given more attention, especially considering he was in Trump's coup circle. But you are absolutely right, the area has increased in population and has been increasingly democrat.
As someone who grew up in his district when I was younger came here to say a version of this. This district is winnable and actually contains some of the most liberal areas of the state. (Harrisburg City, York City, and to a lesser extent the resort town of Hershey.) Dauphin county is the only full country in his district has voted blue in basically every race for like 20 years or more. As a matter of fact It is the only county in the center of the Pennsylvania that votes blue consistently in basically every election for the last 20 years. It is gerrymandered, but there is no way to overly gerrymander it, due to the surrounding area in general. But for some reason it seems to be an abandoned district by the Democrats much like other rural areas I have spent time in. Only it isn't very rural it is actually mid sized population center on the east coast. So it is a winnable district and should be considered a swing district and one that Democrats should actually be focusing/spending on.
I liked Daniels. It's a shame she didn't get more attention. Not sure if she'll run again or Dems will turn to someone else, but either way this is a race that should be prioritized. PA will need lots of attention in 2024 anyway.
Not sure anyone is yet, and even if there is, things can change a lot in the year leading up to the primary.
Some of my family still lives in the district and told me they literally saw zero ads for Daniels the entire race but did see some for Perry. (By contrast at least one every commercial break for the Senate and Governors race.) It would make a world of difference if people from the broader Democratic party put more pressure on the state party to focus on this race and put the spotlight on how terrible Perry actually is.
Also, just for those unaware Perry is objectively terrible. He is a fascist, a criminal, he hates the EPA, his families business is responsible for poisoning his own constituents, he was directly involved in the insurrection and openly advocates for using the military to overthrow the US government. Among other terrible positions. Add to that the fact he is a retired general with real influence on the military just like Flynn and you can see why some of us have been concerned and advocating against this guy for the last 25 years. I honestly think if Perry got even a quarter the attention from the media and party they put into pointless other races Perry would have been gone years ago.
Right now, donating to PA Dems or to county Dem parties in the district would be the best bet. Help them register voters and build up a war chest to support Perry's challenger.
It is the same reason you have yet to see charges for Trump or other corrupt politicians. Basically, you don't win elections especially at the federal level generally, unless you have some skeletons in your closet doesn't matter the side. Sure there are likely some exceptions to this people like AOC but for the most part this is true. Holding these people accountable even when it is a particularly erroneous example opens them all up for accountability. So they have decided collectively to protect each other.
Add to that this specific case involves a cell phone which nearly everyone (I am sure that holds true of people in Congress) uses these days as a primary device. So if they search his phone as a member of Congress (dispite him deserving it and it needing to be done given the situation) this opens them all up to having their devices searched. Which in today's digital age is the absolute last thing most of them want to have happen to themselves, so again they are collectively protecting him.
