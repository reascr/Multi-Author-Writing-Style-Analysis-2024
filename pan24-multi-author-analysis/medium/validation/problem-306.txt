Yes. Just didn’t go into the specifics. It’d be nice if they could have two different alerts at least rather than the alarm and then telling us later it’s not an important one. Like one for a threat and one for an actual attack.
This isn’t news. They give us alarms when planes take off. It doesn’t always mean anything is happening. Just that it could be a plane with missiles. They usually end rather quickly. It’s very normal in all countries for aircraft to take off and land.
In the apps it would be easy enough to have one that says “planes took off” and then upgrade it if there’s an actual missile launch. Obviously the outdoor sirens shouldn’t change.
Yep exactly. Show us proof then. I wanna see that he’s been in Hollywood the whole time. Show me the lies, I really wanna know. He is a professional actor so your making a lot of sense. Or just admit you’re middle aged in Florida and make another totally epic boomer troll post. Also your post history had me and the boys rolling on the floor, it’s like a insane asylum’s community diary.
