If you want to get depressed, go look at Google maps/earth of the Amazon. So many miles upon miles of it gone. I got to walk through the Amazon and it was one the most surreal thing ever. The sounds, smell, amazing.
I'm old enough to remember the hype about Chavez. Do you remember him? He was so awesome, but then, one day, he wasn't...
I would love to sit here and point out the nearly infinite number of holes in your joke of an argument, but it would be wasted on you. I will say that the reasons people turned on Chavez were completely legitimate and at no time has Lula EVER come close to the absurd shenanigans that Chavez pulled. I will also say that had Chavez gone around raiding and locking up the greedy degenerate short-sighted assholes burning down the rainforest I would STILL support his decision to do that.
Lula will probably earn the Reddit seal of approval over this and will henceforth become a symbol of western ideals and any post mentioning his name will garner many upvotes.
I'd bet 99% of those upvotes are coming from people who have no clue about the politics of South America or Brazil.
