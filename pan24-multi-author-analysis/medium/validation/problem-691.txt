It's finally Friday! That means it's time to sit back, drink some lukewarm cocoa, argue about the best Christmas movie (the memes this week have informed me that Die Hard was originally a pagan movie so it can't be that one), and talk about whatever your heart desires.

We started a Christmas tradition a few years ago - we bring 'presents' to the local animal shelter.
Dogs get treats, toys, bones. Try to take them all for a walk so they can get outside for a little bit.
Don't think my Humane Society would allow us to do this, though. They've been doing only scheduled visitations since covid started and they're real picky about it.
The sunflowers I didn't even plant are now 5'6" tall and are sporting yellow flowers, despite a straight week of freezing mornings. I have wrapped a Build-Yer-Own Skateboard kit for one of my nephews, and have also included wrist guards in case his dad raises an eyebrow. Soon I will get some applewood chips rolling in the smoker so I can start prepping an elk roast and some duck wings/legs/hearts for tomorrow's supper.
So many folk on the horizon... my wife and I each have five siblings, and they have 10 children between them, one of which has three of her own. I think I've spent more on gifts than on rent this month, and I hope to retain my Best Uncle Ever title for the 22nd straight year.
I shoot one elk a year up in Oregon. I hunt duck for 100 days in the winter, I take one hog, I take two or three turkeys, I fish as many salmon and halibut as I can in their seasons. Sometimes I buy chicken just for a change of pace, but it's genuinely been about four years since I had to support what I consider to be a largely inhumane and unclean meat industry.
