America: That's not what they told me, they said it was over so fast they couldn't even tell if you were in their country.
If this is such a smart ploy by the US, can Russia not outsmart them by pulling back all the troops and stop the war? No-one else wants this war other than Russia.
At least, it's irrelevant when it comes to defining the term. The obvious relevance of where the propaganda comes from is who you need to target as a country in order to stop it. Something that has been seemingly neglected by our intelligence agencies as of late.
Opportunity presented itself to sell weapons, a major industry in the USA especially, to a righteous cause. While simultaneously demonstrating the ineffectiveness of a competitor's product (Russia). Barring the use of WMDs and internationally-agreed-upon illegal activity, Russia is a military failure. Their kit is a joke, their troops are a joke, and they need to be stepped on internationally, publicly, and decisively.
Those same joke fucks are working to undermine US domestic security (power grid attacks by "domestic" terrorists), international relations (shoveling fossil fuels to China and India), and Democratic stability at a global level. Just to steal some land they willingly relinquished any right to DECADES ago in a treaty. The Russian government is a joke that can't reliably provide stability for its people, who they control by a frayed thread via state sponsored media. A travesty of modern governance on par with the failures of North Korea.
It is so obvious by now I don't know why these articles gets printed. In the beginning they were like Lavrov is serious etc. Come on this is just bullshit.
I agree but he's also pretty powerful, still. In a decade we'll look back at this guy and laugh like he's Abid Mahmud. But while he is the voice of the Russian government, all acting like a bunch of terrorists, he kinda needs to be acknowledged.
I think that it's important to recognize the influence of targeted propaganda in mobilizing alleged "patriots" to actively betray their own country. And to rationalize that betrayal based on lies and stretch truths versus the reality evidenced through their own senses.
Self-identifying 'patriots' drinking the Kool-Aid and betraying their country for some imagined political end goal is pretty much the definition of domestic terrorism. Whether they get the ideas in their heads through foreign powers pushing propaganda or through local conspiracy theorists is irrelevant.
Edit: Or at least every time save the end of the article for previous times he has super obviously lied.
Agree, but he is only powerful as long as we let him be. He lies 100% of the time or close enough so there is no reason to report on him.
There is no real proof that Lockheed Martin is profiting of this war, or even encouraging it at all. And if it were true Russia could still end the war very quickly. I don't think the sanctions would come of now while Crimea is still in Russia's control, but the arms to Ukraine probably would if Russia just went back to the 2020 borders.
I agree, although I would say it differently: Hoping this war shows China that we are serious and willing so they will not take another conflict to the edge to change the current status (read: Taiwan).
I also think (I know this sounds like a conspiracy theory and might be one) that the majority of people in power in the west are in favor of creating a worldwide recession to crash the economies of primarily Russia but also China. As mainly consumers the west will face hardship but not a existential threat. As an energy producing country Russia will have their entire economy wrecked, and for China as they have not managed to grow any local domestic consumption compared to the west they will also meet much more serious economic hardship at a time when they already have economic issues.
So, give em to Ukraine, let them beat some serious ass, and then start cycling new gear across a buffer zone of nations that stand to lose their autonomy should this pointlessly imperialist modern-day Russia decide, on a whim, to exert control over their neighbors.
This is a real tired and old talking point arguing both sides when there really isn't both sides here. In addition just super low effort literally saying "Lockheed Martin lol" with no evidence at all.
Get more or less gifted some of the most modern weapons systems available because they all joined NATO and are considered trusted allies in exchange for dumping some ancient gear and reinforce the position of the "fuck you Russia" bloc. Wins for everyone but Russia. Fuck Russia. The Russian military is a failure that can't win without resorting to terrorism and scorched earth policies. Garbage.
1. Russia, not a real party anymore, have made themselves North Korean level of travesty, intentionally.
