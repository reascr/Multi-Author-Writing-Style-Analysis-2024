What I don’t understand is the media coverage. CNN has a gif of her getting off the plane and they’re doing real time updates. No one cares this much.
They are building her up to be some sort of hero....a feel good story for the holidays. They will probably have a press conference with her and Biden and she will dunk on him.
Trump will take a shot, but it will be blocked by Griner and then she’ll alley-oop to Biden and he’ll jump off Kamala Harris’ back and dunk it. And everyone will cheer and be super happy and proud.
I have yet to find a dem who’s excited in any way about her release lol. Like who are they even pandering to with this?
Y0u MusT b A TrUmPer. Yeah, everyone should be pissed. It’s ludicrous. She had better have the best speech ever when she addresses the public. Tears, stories of mistreatment by the Russians, stories about her past that make us feel sorry for her, stories about how much she’s addicted to drugs and going to seek treatment ...well maybe not that since there are so many Democrats voters that only vote that way because they’re addicted to marijuana and think it will get legalized by Dems.
The president literally just traded an arms dealer to get her out of prison. I wouldn't feel too bad for her, if that's not privilege I don't know what is.
