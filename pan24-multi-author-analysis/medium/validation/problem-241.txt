> U.S. District Judge James Donato on Friday ruled that five former Twitter employees pursuing a proposed class action accusing the company of failing to give adequate notice before laying them off after its acquisition by Elon Musk must pursue their claims in private arbitration.
Mediation is indeed, "a preliminary tool to avoid prolonged and unnecessary litigation." Mediation is simply a formalized negotiation process that's guided by a neutral mediator, typically an attorney who's acceptable to both parties. The mediator encourages but cannot compel agreement, and has no authority to make any judgment. If the contending parties can agree during mediation, costly litigation or arbitration are avoided.
Arbitration is not a preliminary to avoid litigation; it is a legal alternative to litigation. Both are costly. Both produce a legally enforceable judgment.
In almost all instances, the findings of the arbitrator(s) are "final and binding", i.e., non-appealable. You cannot ask a court to modify or reverse an arbitration finding; the court wouldn't hear the case. The only action most courts will take re: an arbitration finding is to enforce it if a party is failing or refusing to adhere.
I don't know what you mean by calling arbitration an "aberration". Most employment contracts and many commercial contracts stipulate arbitration as the mechanism for resolving a dispute. A common practice is not aberrant in the usual sense of that word.
The fact that it's common practice is not exactly an excuse for such an absurdly unethical practice. I understand that this is a hyperbolic comparison, but would you have argued that slavery was "not aberrant" because it was common practice in earlier centuries?
Aberrant does not mean unethical, it means departing from a recognized standard. Until 1865, slavery was a recognized standard supported by the Constitution and multiple laws.
Whether a standard is ethical or unethical is a different question entirely. Slavery was simultaneously both unethical and commonplace (ie, NOT aberrant).
If you meant to say, "arbitration is unethical", you should have written that. Words matter, particularly in written communications.
