So is voting for a third party. It doesn’t matter if a two-party system is good or bad. It’s just what we HAVE so deal with it and vote for the lesser of two evils. I couldn’t believe the Bernie Sander supporters that didn’t vote for Hillary. In what world was Trump a better choice? Be practical, not idealistic. My daughter will have less civil rights than me because of a Puritan Supreme Court, a scary future with a powerless EPA and ridiculous amount of student debt. The conservatives won’t go down without a fight. There is no compromise for them. I wish liberals and moderates would stop bickering and put them back under the racist hateful greedy rocks that they slithered out from.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Democracy versus fascism sure is a fun game when for decades have decided to empower fascism through replacing the value of a vote with a corporatocracy funding policy directives.
