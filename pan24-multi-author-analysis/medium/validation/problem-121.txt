"Trolling" by installing a literal crazy person in a position that presides over one of our primary lawmaking bodies. Don't overreact everyone; they're just being silly. It's not like congress actually needs to accomplish anything for our lives not to go to complete shit.

I question whether or not the reactions are massive enough, honestly. The very best case scenario for this is they are trolling some 3D chess move into a news cycle and treating the legislature like a circus. Worst case scenario is that they don't think she's insane.
So you're saying "both sides are the same"? Both sides are equally bad? Gotta disagree buddy. The party putting on the circus instead of governing is not the same as the party calling out the circus.
