Yeah, this is genuinely confusing. They may actually have found one of the few foreign policy points where US interference might actually lead to a lower chance of war.
This isn't to say the US is or should be meddling with the LAC, just not sure how their involvement would make the situation worse.
This seems like the kind of thing the CIA and every US government thinks before inserting themselves into a geopolitical mess halfway around the world and messing it up further lol.
Jokes aside, even India has been very insistent over the years that their dealings with China should be kept purely bilateral. Neither of them want anyone else (especially America) coming in because both are wary of foreign interference. Seems India might be slightly shifting their stance a bit since quad is a thing, but from what I understand India is still one of the least active members.
China wants to fight India like so bad...from the Chinese point of view it's a pretty safe fight China gets to flex it military at a long standing enemy.
One who busy snapping up China market share in a few industry's and is also becoming an economic power house.
I strongly think China would get it's teeth kicked In by an Angry India but from China's point view this is absolutely someone they want to scrap with.
Edit: so to address the point they dont want the US to advise India they need India to fuck things up so they have execuse to fight.
Interesting - however, IIRC it was China that ultimately backed off in the 2017 confrontation when India showed it was ready to go to war even if it meant losing. China thought India would just cave. A potential alliance between India and other countries (something India has typically rejected since independence due to its non-alignment and desire to be unencumbered in foreign policy) would really threaten China. That’s why the Quad (US + Japan + Aus + Hopefully India) is so important, and should be the US priority in the region.
They just want to consolidate their hold on that border and think that being aggressive with India is the best way of achieving that cos apparently the current guys in charge are brutes who think that burning bridges somehow isn't going to hurt them further down the line. Whether it's because they think too little of India or because they've somehow got a functioning strategy, o really can't tell. I think they're dumb as rocks personally, but hey, I'm not the one running that country.
Currently their world standing is sinking fast. They know they can't take on NATO and Russia is getting it's teeth kicked in evaporating it's soft power.
Don't forget the Chinese government thinks their the hottest thing on the street and their Angry noone else thinks that or is giving them the respect they deserve.
Maybe, but the Galwan valley incident happened in 2020, way before the current Ukraine conflict and Russia's reduced standing. I'm pretty sure they're aware of how hard a Himalayan conflict would be as well, and honestly I still don't even know what the result of the earlier skirmish at Galwan was. According to India they killed more Chinese soldiers while according to the Chinese side they killed more Indians. I'm slightly more inclined to believe India, but it's not as though India's government isn't also pretty nationalist - but at the very least they gave us numbers, unlike the Chinese government refusing to even do that. If what India says is true, I would think the Chinese wouldn't be dumb enough to make an even bigger push on that front now.
I honestly don't know what the Chinese government thinks anymore. I can agree that what you're saying is generally the vibe I get from them, and it's also true that fascist governments do typically think and behave irrationally, but I don't know just how much of a break Xi Jinping is from previous administrations. You would hardly have expected this kind of thing from Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao, and the idea that a weird fascist authoritarian whose only conception of foreign policy is grandstanding could climb his way up a bureaucracy like the CCP is kinda mindblowing to me.
The nationalists in the party are proving to be a significant headache for him these people think they can on the world and win and the reason it's not happening is because of XI.
On the other side you have the pro money side who demand China effectively take over local geographic area and build a mini empire usa style so they can rince it like they feel the USA and eroupe does, they are currently upset XI effectively blew up the enconmy.
And finally we have minor independent blocks who are generally pissed all the time about anything and everything.
So XI currently has party who all pissed off but whom he can please two thirds of by looking tough and making moves that makes them all some money.
So that's why a limited war from XI point of view helps him it basically makes the idiots in his party happy until he can fix the economic and COVID issues.
Because if he doesn't fix the problem the nationalist wing might start making moves to fix the problem.
I had to rush this post so i can't explain my points more distinctly but i encourage you read up on CCP party faction's and politics its pretty interesting stuff its basically if a country was run by interest groups...
A Limited border conflict is very likely as India also has nukes both sides know they can't use them meaning a conventional fight is more likely not less.
On 1962, also note that China’s 1962 invasion took India completely by surprise. The CCP (in a move right out of Hitler’s playbook) had signed a peace treaty and mutual non-aggression pact with India in 1954. India’s govt. — being colossally stupid and naive IMO — actually thought China would never attack it, given the countries’ shared professions of Sino-Indian friendship and distaste of colonial rule. Indian soldiers were completely unprepared and basically sitting ducks for the invading Chinese. I doubt India would make that mistake with China again.
Bruh. We then occupied a defeated Japan and (successfully) molded it in an image that was acceptable to us. That went a long way in the “close alliance” today.
Bro what? That makes no sense, they don't want to fight India. The last thing they want is a war on their already-unstable western border. They're already super anxious about India hosting the Dalai lama.
IIRC, that’s always consistently been India’s stance, though. It doesn’t want internationalization of any of its disputes and sticks to the “bilateral” route. But I think China’s constant provocations and territory grabs (it has territorial disputes with EIGHTEEN countries, for crying out land) have made at least a superficial cozying up to Japan/Aus/the U.S. tactically desirable for India. The U.S should (subtly and in private) push that advantage.
Yes, but China also claims international waters as its territory. The fact is that when you have specious and completely arbitrary territorial “claims” on 18 other countries’ legal domains, you are the problem. China’s alleged territorial disputes with India and Bhutan are complete hogwash, and simply a cover for the CCP’s broader hegemonic designs and unwarranted aggression.
