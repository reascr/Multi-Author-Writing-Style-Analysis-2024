The international headline was that Kabul fell in one day without a bullet fired. It's very misleading not to take into account all the events that led to it in the months prior to it. Unless you were closely following the war, you wouldn't know of the lenhy battles fought in the provinces and border crossings.
It is high time (well past time, actually) for the entire world to wash its hands of Afghanistan entirely. All previous efforts at aid and assistance should be re-directed to assisting the escape and re-settlement of all individuals who wish to escape that irredeemable hellhole.
There are some good examples of mass refugee relocation though. Vietnamese were virtually nonexistent in the US until the post-war refugee surge, and they have since settled and integrated quite well. Median household income for Vietnamese Americans is now , which is well above the average, and even above the $66k for White Americans.
Obviously income is not the end all be all number for how well it was all handled, but I think it's a pretty decent proxy.
