Textbook vexatious litigant, using the legal system to harass and gain attention from the victim and/or society at large. They don’t care if the suit is hopeless (they most likely know it is, if they aren’t completely bonkers), they just want to put their victim through the wringer having to respond to them.
Unfortunately, in most places I know about, it is a long and expensive journey for the victim to get free of this, despite the best efforts of the court system to deal with it. In Ontario, there is a rule that allows for reasonably summary dismissal of actions on the basis that they are “on their face” frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process; also, one could being a motion to declare a certain person a “vexatious litigant” - meaning they would require leave of the court to file further proceedings. Both orders would seem appropriate here, assuming Singapore has similar laws. Unfortunately, while this is as easy as the courts can make it, there are still procedures that must be gone through, excruciating for the victim as that is.
Given he's in SG, he'll be lucky if he doesn't end up in jail for abusing the court system or something.
