I get you. My mood is dark too. Because of we know how Moore will go no American has the right to vote anymore our voices have been silenced, and as a woman that upsets me. I am not allowed to seek abortion if I need it, if I vote my voice means nothing, and next in the SCOTUS checklist of how to ruin people’s lives more, I am calling it in 2024, if Republicans win and goes into 2026 it is bye bye to my rights to own/rent my own property, have bank accounts and my own credit cards without men co signing, drive because they will find a way to rule that women aren’t stable enough to drive because they will do anything to imprison women to the kitchen again, which I am more likely to be because when they take away birth control and make it illegal, I have debilitating cramps that make it impossible for me to things on my period, and work, they will start kicking out women when they get pregnant, or even take it a step further and deem women of reproductive age unable to work because we will be seen as pre pregnant no matter what, my life as a woman is over in this country.
Conservative lawmakers also intentionally create unconstitutional or marginal laws in order to decide an issue. That's how we ended up with Roe being overturned.
