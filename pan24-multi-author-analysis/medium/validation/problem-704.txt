They hate immigrants but maintaining the status quo of migrant workers taking the jobs no one else wants is supported by the current immigration system. Make it really hard to get here, make them afraid to speak up, all so they can exploit them. I remember one restaurant owner would "hire" migrants for several weeks to be bus boys and when they asked to be paid he would say he can't until their paperwork went through and he was still waiting for it. He would string people along for weeks or months and never pay, then just do it again to the next one. No one ever filed against him because they were afraid of getting deported.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
