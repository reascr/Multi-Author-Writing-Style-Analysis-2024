Footage was taken down only after the New Zealand government alerted Twitter, which had failed to pick up the content as harmful.
Twitter has removed freshly uploaded footage of the Christchurch terror attack that was circulating on the platform but only after the New Zealand government alerted the company, which had failed to recognize the content as harmful.
The video clips, filmed by the Australian white supremacist who murdered 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch in 2019, were uploaded by some Twitter users on Saturday, according to the office of the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.
A spokesperson for the prime minister said Twitter’s automated reporting function didn’t pick up the content as harmful.
Other users reported the videos and the government separately raised it with Twitter, the office said. “Twitter advised us overnight that the clips have been taken down and said they would do a sweep for other instances.”.
I know the video is terrible, but there are a lot of other videos on Twitter that are posted daily. I just recently seen a video of Russian soldiers raping each other. Other videos of gore and war crimes. Just wondering what crosses the line in the NZ video and not the other videos..?
