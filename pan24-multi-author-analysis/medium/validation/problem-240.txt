That's not how rights work. I don't give a shit about arms but no rights work that way. There was a whole important body of law, for example, about what restrictions were allowed on abortions and access when abortions were a right. That body of law grew absurdly inflated because anti abortion states tried every fucking imaginable thing they could to restrict access to abortions. By your interpretation of rights, abortions and almost any other right could be undermined easily. E.g. puting the only voting station in a state in one town that is extremely red or blue.
If you want to put yourself on this piece of shits level, then that’s up to you. “ALL REPUBLICANS” aren’t advocating for shit. Extreme idiots (yourself included) are advocating for punishing people for their political beliefs. Get a grip on reality.
Shut the fuck up. This is the type of shit people say that gets circulated on far right websites that will make old white men say “liberals think want to put all republicans in Jail!” And then they buy more guns and talk about how the left wants civil war.
