All that ass kissing. If the judge had it in their mind to let the guy off they could at least do it quietly instead this spectacle of ass kissing. If this judge is on the ballot next election cycle and you vote for this clown then you are just as responsible for this crap as the judge and the cop.
Realistically though, how many people are actually going to remember her name or what she did when they see it on the ballot? Probably not enough to matter. I still want to try but it's depressing that this corruption is so blatant and hardly anyone seems to care.
What the ever-loving fuck is wrong with the people in Maricopa County? Seems like every awful thing in the state moved there and settled in like an infectious disease.
That is SO the opposite of accepting responsibility. You didn't try to do your best, you acted like an absolute piece of shit of the highest order. You were a monster preying on the innocent public, the type of criminal that should be locked away forever for our protection.
