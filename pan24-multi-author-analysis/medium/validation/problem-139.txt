It's massively important that one of the liberal justice candidates wins, but it will still come down to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of independent state legislature theory it could allow the Republican majority state legislature in Wisconsin to not be able to be stopped by the Governor or state Supreme Court (if it is flipped to Liberal majority) and give them sole authority on drawing maps and potentially how elections are carried out (and electoral college is decided).
The GOP Senate Majority Leader in my State House got busted about two years ago driving drunk in the middle of the night the wrong way down an interstate at excessive speeds. He even tried to outrun the police. When he was finally pulled over he was extremely belligerent and verbally abused the arresting officer, but was released almost immediately on his own recognizance upon being taken into jail.
