"a controversial call to reduce "commuting miles" through "an increase in remote work and virtual engagements," including in education.".
Work from home is a win win. Workers get to avoid spending as much on commute. Businesses don't need to spend as much on rent/facilities since they can downsize a lot there. It doesn't really hurt anyone except for those with a hardcore loyalty for tradition for the sake of tradition.
Which isn't a bad idea, the problem is convincing corporate America that its OK to allow your employees to work remotely. Actually, its convincing the 60+ year old CEOs who are mostly funding the GOP that its OK.
Roads have to be paid for somehow, and automobiles have negative externalities, it makes sense to have roads at least somewhat paid for by people who actually use them.
