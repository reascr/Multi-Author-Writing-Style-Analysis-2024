It's totally true, and their accusations tell us so much about what their values are, about what they think is right and wrong. Defund the IRS, are you fucking kidding me? They are so brazen and revealing, it's weird to see right through your political enemy. There's no nuance or strategy, just brute force there. They are masterful at keeping their voting base's brains mush to keep them in line. It's such a fascinating and such a distinctly American breed of fascism. The books written 20 years from now about this era are going to be absolutely wild. I mean, I learned all about the Know-Nothing party back in school, but shit, that was in the 1840's. They're nothing compared to the modern Republican party's voters. To have literally all the world's knowledge at one's fingertips at any time, and to still be as willfully ignorant as the right is, is truly astounding.
