In a sane country, there would be an overwhelming bipartisan consensus to expel Gosar for openly violating his oath of office. Instead I imagine he'll be rewarded with a senior role in some committee in January.

Why would they do that? There's no indication that the Republican party without trump is any less fascist. DeSantis has all the same authoritarian tendencies, without the obviously alarming, and alienating.
If the Republicans learned anything from the recent election, I hope it's that idiots like Gosar can be primaried by a quality candidate instead of a MAGA bat-shit-crazy candidate, and they might actually win the general election.
