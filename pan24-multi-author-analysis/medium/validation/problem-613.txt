If protesting is the same of terrorism, you just greenlit actual terrorism. So, yeah, nothing at all will go wrong if this passes. Zero unintended side effects. This is not at all predictable (it is).

EDIT: just it be clear the police have lost the trust of the community here and view them as enemies. Civil unrest is not terrorism.
