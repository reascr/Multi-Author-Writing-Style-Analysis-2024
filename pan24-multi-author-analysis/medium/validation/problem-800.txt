I mean with the amount of bullshit flying around here about us, what do you expect? Even most people that aren't from germany have by now gotten the hint that the narrative "Merkel singlehandedly caused Putin to invade and now Germany does nothing because theyre all secretly on russias side" is utter bullshit, so the occasional troll gets downvoted.
That being said, regarding the topic: yeah, most people here are against the world cup, with a lot of people not watching it (example: me), because of the human rights situation, FIFA's greed and for the largest part (personal opinion) because of the insanity to play a football worldcup in a desert country that has no proper attachement to the sport.
A multinational corporation securing a very small share of germanys gas needs from quatar has literally nothing to do with what the average german thinks about that country.
I understand what you're saying about the whole Germany might as well just join Russia hyperbole that has somehow been reached at times. However I personally believe a balance is needed. We can recognize that Germany has some weird questionable priorities and is a bureaucratic mess which moves far too slowly. And still admit that it's one of the best Nations in Europe and does lots of things right.
I mean i'm absolutely fine for being critizised for the points you mentioned (i actually agree to some degree), and i definitely dont think we're one of the best countries in europe - way too many problems around here.
Its just the objectively wrong stuff that gets me pissed off, like the Hamburg-Port-Sale-Bullshit, or the whole Germany-Secretly-Wants-Ukraine-To-Loose-Conspiracy, because its such an obvious attempt by some of the more populist people in Europe to shift blame and rally their voters with a common enemy.
Basically everytime something goes wrong somewhere in Europe, some people suddenly remember how we owe them a bazillion gazillion euros in reparations and how, whatever went wrong, is in no way their fault, but obviously Merkels/Scholz's/Hitlers, and its just tiring by now.
But its not just us, recently France and before that GB also got a lot of shit too for some reason. I guess its to some degree just being a big country.
Most enriched uranium comes from Russia; building a nuclear power plant isn't the same as supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
There's a slight difference between giving money to sportswash an oppressive regime, and purchasing needed heating supplies to prevent grandma from freezing to death.
LNG burns a lot cleaner than coal, but it takes a lot of energy to liquify gas to liquid form. Even worse, at all stages LNG tends to leak methane which is horrible for the environment. How much methane is leaked or flared is up for debate, but recent literature suggests it's significant enough to be a legitimate concern that expanding coal plants may actually be a more environmentally friendly solution to shipping LNG long distances.
