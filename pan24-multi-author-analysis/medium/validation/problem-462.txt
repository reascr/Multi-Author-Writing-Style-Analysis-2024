Which is ironic as, judging by the archive footage I could find of his time as a sports presenter, he was utterly straight-down-the-line as a presenter, verging on bland with no strong personality.
Granted, you could possibly that down to professionalism or the style that was expected from the type of shows he was doing at the time.
But it probably explains why I don't remember anything in particular about him before the infamous "Wogan" appearance et al. I wasn't into sports as a kid in the 80s, so I wouldn't have been watching that sort of stuff anyway, but I do remember other sports presenters (e.g. Des Lynam, Dickie Davis, etc.) being more "personalities" whereas Icke was someone whose name and face I'd have recognised, but that was about it.
The only thing I can remember about him before Wogan is something with horses, maybe on kids' TV. Icke is in a cart, and the guy that knows about horses is asking him politely, then impatiently, to stop rolling about laughing like a maniac because balance, physics, etc. Then the cart tips over and they fall out.
In 1990 I believe he had a nervous breakdown and thought he was the son of "the godhead" that should only wear turquoise. He went on the UK's biggest talkshow at the time and told everyone his theories and the audience just ridiculed and laughed at him for being crazy (you would hope today that the producers would cut the interview short as his was clearly having mental health issues).
Rather than getting help he doubled down and realised that there was a large enough following of other people having mental health problems who would buy his books/merchandise so why would he get help? He is a finicially a lot richer for not getting treatment, and I think I am right in saying that at least one of his children has followed him into the "family business" but again why wouldn't he? Make claims that can never be proven or disproven and a certain element of society will give you all their money.
In the late 1980s - he actually started out as a football (soccer) goalkeeper and then became a sports broadcaster.
He did jump on the Jimmy Savile bashing bandwagon quite early on, but you know what they say about broken clocks...
Terry Wogan, the host and probably the most mild-mannered and inoffensive person on the planet, actually sounds quite serious when he says "they're laughing at you, not with you". Icke gave an interview on RTE about the same time:
