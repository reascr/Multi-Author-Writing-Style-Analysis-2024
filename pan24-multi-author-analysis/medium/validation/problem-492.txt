Really is not comparable. This isn't like taking away a person's right to be on a jury or even to vote. This takes away rights to due process and safety, and ability to travel internationally. Not for an actual crime, but for expressing opinions -- literally nothing more. Felony disenfranchisement has a history in some of the same principles, but permanent disenfranchisement for felons has gone down substantially. Most states in the US today only prohibit voting and jury service while you are actively under parole/probation supervision and re-enfranchise you once you're done. The number of disenfranchised felons actually dropped more than 25% since 2016 due to additional reforms.
