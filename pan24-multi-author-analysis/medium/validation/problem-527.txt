I believe in gun rights but the 2nd Amendment was not meant to cover this type of situation. It was meant so every member of the town or whatever it was, could defend their community from Indian attacks. So everybody in the community I believe, was considered a part of the military. Now, less then 10% of the US population are enlisted in the military right now, a stark change in circumstances from the 1700s. Back then,, it was like 100%. The circumstances that existed during the 2nd Amendment do not exist anymore. It makes little sense to use the 2nd Amendmenr and would rather see it repealed and replaced .
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
