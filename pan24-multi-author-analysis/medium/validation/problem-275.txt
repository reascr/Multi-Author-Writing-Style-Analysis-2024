The story with fur coats is not over. Fur coats turned out to be stolen from a clothing store in Kherson.
The owner of the store recognized her goods in the hands of Russians . The girl wrote that she went abroad on February 25, 2022, and the store was robbed.
“During this year, we will get rid of gas supplies from russia. Starting next year, we will be able to supply gas to other countries ourselves.”.
⚡️In 2023, Italy plans to completely stop supplying gas from russia, — Minister of Economic Development Adolfo Urso said.
“Also will soon become the gas hub of Europe thanks to doubling the volume of supplies through the Trans-Adriatic gas pipeline from Azerbaijan,” — the minister said.
It's mostly their own gas but they don't have \that\ much. Russia supplied 150bcm to Europe. Azerbaijan produces about 50bcm, but 30bcm of that already went to Europe.
He is the one that during every "feint" said they were in fact 5D chess moves to trap ZSU. And of course proven wrong over and over again, but Russians have the memory span of goldfishes.
Kadyrov's deputy, Major General & Commander of Chechen Akhmat special forces, war criminal Apti Alaudinov has been poisoned through a letter soaked in toxin. He is hospitalized in Moscow along with two others from his entourage.
Yeah I read that—they make a point that he was poisoned in Russia, and I’m wondering what’s going on beneath the surface there. Bc it’s trying to point out that not by military (ie, not by GRU in Crimea), and not when on leave back in Chechnya (ie, not by rival at home).
Either they’re faking bc they want to find a random fall guy, it is true, or more likely, it’s by his inner circle and trying to point away so don’t look weak. (Letter shields him from looking incompetent, like saying poisoned from unknown source would seem.) However, given that 99% of poisonings are done by the FSB, they could’ve released that detail because they want investigation/revenge/turf war. (Also, typically, they poison multiple items, then send sweepers to collect/clean, so might’ve already caught someone.).
Look, this is all about money. There’s only so much, multiple entities want to invalidate/smear their opponents so they get more money for their own dept, then in turn can grow and assume primacy over other entities.
1/ Only 10% of Russians are firm ideological supporters of the war in Ukraine, according to a new political analysis. While more than half of Russians support Putin, their support is conditional and likely to fall as Russia's economy weakens amidst the continuing fighting. ⬇️.
^1 There’s Norwegian medics, working w Reed. A new team drives up, including an Estonian medic volunteer.
Failed Russian assault with tanks in the Svatovo area. Use of mines, Ukrainians on the defensive there.
However, there are schedules of hourly blackouts, due to the damaged network infrastructure in Odesa.
⚡️​ Energy consumption is gradually increasing compared to the weekend, which is the traditional way to start the working week. So far there is no shortage of power in the power system, reports Ukrenerho.
Wow, a damning piece by Prigozhyn's mouthpiece Grey Zone channel, suggests (confidently) that the Vuhledar assault was an attempt by the Rus. MoD to take away some of Wagner's fame after Soledar. A serious attack on MoD with Wagner promising to "protect its prey".
1/ Despite promises by Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin that his convict fighters will be treated as heros and given all honours, ordinary Russians are not so keen on making heroes out of convicted murderers, as an incident in Transbaikalia has shown. ⬇️.
See, Russians have very little goodness in them. No altruism. They can’t process that a human would ever ever willingly go do anything whatsoever “simply to help.” That it MUST be a cover, so therefore, must target it.
It almost seems that Prigozhyn is dead serious on taking over certain authority (not power (yet)) among the Russian army and the MoD is facing a major challenger in the face of Wagner, especially after catastrophes like in Vuhledar.
It’s a delicate dance bc the various factions (GRU, MOD, Airbourne Forces, FSB, Rosgvardia, Internal Affairs, etc.) have got to on the one hand say they need more money in order to complete whatever mission, while at the same time say Putin handing over more money doesn’t show that they’ve been incompetent up till that point. Since it’s difficult to balance that message, all the agencies actively sabotage the others. In order for others to appear more incompetent, or to say we can come in and do a better job.
The article strangely uploaded the wrong footage, but screenshots showing the very visible missile, at eye level, .
'It was a trap', says the medic^1 that recorded the 1-sec video which shows American volunteer killed by guided missile in a 'deliberate' Russian attack. :
Yeah, it’s weird. He says they launched normal drones, then also two balloons, and the balloons had ... I’m not quite sure... monitors, deactivating equipment? Someone who knows technical jargon will need to translate that part ( I’m not sure of technical vocabulary).
Knowing Russians and their cynical mentality, I wouldn’t put it like you do. Yes, maybe in Syria (I have limited knowledge of that)—but anything you ever ever do to a Russian to attempt to show your pure intentions/innocence/nonpartisanship has the polar opposite effect. Always. They’re suspicious, paranoid, cynical. They think that if a car attempts to look humanitarian, then it MUST DEFINITELY not be that.
This wickedness will not end until Russia top leadership is decimated and the nation experiences collective guilt.
The other thing to consider regarding this is that in order to withdraw from Kherson, it had to be run up the chain of command—Surovikin to the General Staff, General Staff to Gerasimov, Gerasimov to Shoigu, and ultimately to Putin who apparently consulted back with the General Staff. He gave permission after was convinced that they could start regaining territory, if and only if withdrew from Kherson. They now have to deliver—they got to show a win, that the withdrawal was worth it, by having victories somewhere—anywhere—even if it’s stealing credit from Wagner.
> We will remind you that during the storming of Mariupol, the Russians demolished the residential quarters with everyone who was in them—the bodies of at least 50,000 Mariupol residents were left under the rubble.
Local media, citing the Russian Emergencies Ministry for the region, write that a gas pipeline is on fire in the Myshkinsky district.
Also, they’re zero impartial parties in Russia. Humanitarian aid itself is part of military. They can’t imagine anything different.
For me this looks like a major offensive and it appears that AFU is denying them any strategic success.
So if I summarize all Russian activities of the last 4 weeks I come to the following numbers of conquered villages in the following areas from north to south.
⚡️Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni confirmed the "firm" support of Ukraine by her government after former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi made critical statements against the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, — Ansa reports.
Meloni's office said on Sunday that the Italian government "firmly and confidently" supports Ukraine.
The soldiers claim that they were trained as part of the commandant battalion in Nizhnyaya Pavlovka, but they ended up in the 278th separate motorized rifle battalion. During the first combat mission,...two mobilized were killed, more than four were injured, the military say.
These are 9 separate Russian attacks, overall tens of thousands of troops, thousands of armored vehicles, artillery, support vehicles, short.. everything.
I believe that Russia is most concerned by the Western weapon's deliveries and tries to get as much as possible now and then dig in as good as they can for the upcoming Ukrainian storm. But the results are terrible for them. Wouldn't be surprised when they offer soon a ceasefire.
⚡️Starlink satellite communication system continues to work on the front line in Ukraine, — SpaceX founder Elon Musk.
Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov confirmed that Starlink systems continue to work.
The deputy head of Ministry of Internal Affairs for fight against extremism Vladimir Makarov, Pro-Kremlin accounts and the law enforcement agencies report the Major General committed suicide by shooting himself.
I don't believe Russians have duplicated their C2 because their organization is very hierarchical and rigid... that's probably copium.
In Russia anti-extremism means anti-Putin. This piece of shit wasn't fighting against racists, KKK, Nazis, but actually against pro-democracy, anti-corruption, pro-freedom activists.
— another video from mobilized from the Orenburg region. In the appeal, the soldiers complained that they had been transferred under the command of the “DPR”.
“From the first day we were in the camp for training, we were misled. We were told at first that we would be a territorial defense. Upon arrival at the territory of the “DPR”, we were told that we would be the assault force. We were not staffed properly. No first aid kits, no normal bulletproof vests, nothing was provided, ”the soldiers say in the video.
LDNR were the original shtrafbattalion and sent to the meat grinder. The tactic gained Russia Popasna and culminated in Severodonetsk. It is believed that they lost almost 50% of their men, so now the LDNR are being mixed with mobiks to set up the new wave of Zerg rushes. The problem is when mobiks realize that they are the ones to be sacrificed for the Botox Bunker Dwarf, they turn back, and beg their families, which then reaches local administrators.
That was not a probing mission, you don't send entire brigades of VDV and marines to probe. It was their offensive, which ended in catastrophe for themselves much like everything they do in this war.
