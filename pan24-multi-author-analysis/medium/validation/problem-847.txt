There's no solution to climate change under capitalism. That's their problem. Corporations need to make increased profit each year to satisfy their obligations to their shareholders, so long term investments into things that aren't a source of constant profit just isn't viable. Renewable energy is for the most part better for the general public, but not great for making money.
that, and my understanding is that a lot of developing countries were planning on trying to get an agenda item talking about what are essentially climate reparations. like "you rich fucks have been polluting for so long and now my beachfront is 10 miles inland, how about you pay for some of this damage".
If it were that simple to rebalance wealth, stop squabbles over land and resources, settle "who's god is right" and simply do the right fucking thing for our children then I'll throw all my stuff on the pile too.
I would take a huge hit to my standard of living if it meant ecological repair and balanced quality of life for everyone.
At the end of the day us as individuals won’t do much but if we had to have less technology to reduce electricity consumption I’m fine with that.
Unfortunately our leaders want to pull one over on eachother instead of helping. They’re all so obsessed with winning we’ll lose everything to make sure no one else takes a dime from our respective “societies”.
But at the end of the day inconveniences to us as individuals are not the answer. Jeff Bezos’s yacht probably produces my carbon footprint in less than a year, let alone his private jets, or Drakes private jet.
If you said I can’t travel on a plane, sure. No driving, I work remote so I’ll move to a place I want to be.
I mean I can’t afford a house. I probably can barely afford to heat my rental basement suite. I have already cut back my meat consumption about 75% 90% now is chicken while the other 10 is locally sourced from a small scale ranch I have connection to. I work from home, I cook my own food, don’t consume much processed food, recycle, compost etc.
You’re doing your part, but you’re right, it’s really just virtue signalling. It gives me a sense of control however so I’ll just keep signaling and voting with my values until the people who can make a difference decide it matters to them too.
my personal opinion is that the work he should have done with the elections needed to be done a month+ a go, and needn't occur today just because it won't do much.
