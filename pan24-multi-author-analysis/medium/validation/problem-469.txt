After Obama produced his birth certificate and people continued to insist it was fake and that he wasn't American, then the trump fiascoes, it's extremely hard listening to anyone call people in the democratic party racist. "Jewish space lasers" seems way more inflammatory than anything Omar said.
Why are you bringing up something that has absolutely no correlation to Illhan? So tired with tit for tat politics. The only people that get hurt hurt are us the commoners, the everyday citizens.
Says Republican that voted in favor of removal. It doesnâ€™t matter if some republicans are closeted normal/rational people, if all they do is vote for stupid things.

Get them the fuck out and put people who actually have beliefs that they stand by into congress. God fucking rest John McCain, the gop needed more conservatives like him, that can genuinely compromise without capitulating to pressure, but they stuffed their board with election deniers and QAnon lovers so, they can sleep in the bed they made until they disintegrate from within.
Because when the republicans literally call the sitting president not American for four years and say his legal documents are fabricated, and then remove Omar for "being insensitive and making inflammatory remarks", it's a slap to the face of decent people, it's utter horseshit behavior, removing Omar was utter horseshit, it was purely political muscle flexing to get back at her and the liberals for some perceived slight from her politics and all the democratic wins in elections.
I don't fucking forget and ignore the shitty behavior of the GOP because that was 2 years of legal gridlock and obstinace at every opportunity that made anything we as Americans tried getting done in Congress an exercise in hot air. They are the biggest fan of locking everything down to get their way, and that's anything except serving the interests of the American people.
It's the republicans using every tactic available in bad faith to win political ground, not operating on the basis of improving American lives, that makes them shithole politicians I can't trust to represent anyone but themselves, and I don't want making legal decisions for the country in which I reside.
They put together that stupid new committee that they themselves drew together, announced that the minority party would only have 9 seats, and at least a majority need to vote on committee issues. By their own definitions, the minority party is just a spectator because the GOP can do whatever they want with their 12 member portion of the committee, and the dems will by design never have enough votes to stop them or impact any decisions. Does that sound like the practice of a party interested in genuine compromise, or like they want to lock out the other side from decisions?
