Hell, if I remember correctly there was another investigation or study very similar after 2016 trying to prove Trump won the popular vote and that one disappeared into thin air as well. A lot of hype in the beginning to get his base all worked up and it went nowhere because they couldn’t prove anything. But when it comes to his base facts aren’t ever the point and never really required.
I think there are many reasons why things like this get overlooked or forgotten. But for one thing cable news is more about making money than it was during the old broadcast news days when they were required to get a license from the government. Back thenBroadcast News was looked on and treated as a public service. It cost them money to report the news, and they actually lost money doing so. Back then they paid for investigative field reporters, now you see talking heads doing no more than sitting at the desk. Most investigative reporting occurs from other sources and they just serve as commentators.
