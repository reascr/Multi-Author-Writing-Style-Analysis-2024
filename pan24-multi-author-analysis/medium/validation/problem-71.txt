However, there is an ongoing tendency. 60-80% of russian ‘citizens’ are politically passive - they indeed do not care much of the war or anything else outside of their bubble, including such dystopian policies. They go about their usual life even in the midst of all this barbarianism. The rest fall into two categories - the opposition and the hardline patriots, each of these groups is neither homogenous nor large enough to cause any real political turmoil for the kremlin. The thing is, this sort of system was maintained by a social contract of sorts. I wont go into all the details, but the deal between the regime and the people is now starting to fall apart due to many reasons. This causes a very slow process through which the politically inactive majority starts drifting into either the opposition or turbopatriot minority groups. The resulting political stress might cause major shifts in the balance of power in russia in the near future. One can only hope that the masses do not become further fascisized, although that is a real possibility.
Advanced weaponry superseded survival of the fittest in war a long time ago. Should be obvious at least after a team of dudes usually sitting in an office built the first nukes.
