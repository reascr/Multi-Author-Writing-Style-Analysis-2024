The United States has been semi-hostile towards Asian minorities ever since the gold rush of 1848 (not that this excuses the horrific attitudes displayed towards such groups during COVID whatsoever).
They've also said nothing about Washinon representative, David Eastman, saying it saves the government money when abused children are murdered.
FDR didnâ€™t help things either when he literally labeled every single Japanese American a traitor during World War II.
You're jumping to step 2 without considering step 1, which is, what does it mean to say that a "majority of Republicans" are "working for Russia." Regardless, I'll play along with your charade.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Did you read the above link? The Republicans that were "spending the 4th of July in Russia" involved a congressional delegation that went to Moscow's US embassy to warn Russia against meddling in US elections. You made it sound like they were vacationing over the holiday break.
At that time, why would anyone have been against this trip? Are you saying that you're against election integrity? Why are you annoyed that Republicans are trying to stop Russia from meddling in our elections? Democrats don't even like the 4th of July, yet when Republicans spend that particular day in a foreign nation, they develop fake outrage. Why?
And? Senator Schumer and other Democrats have received donations from foreign nations, including Russia.
If that is what you call "evidence" in that standing members of Congress from a major political party are somehow "working" for a foreign nation, then all I can do is laugh.
