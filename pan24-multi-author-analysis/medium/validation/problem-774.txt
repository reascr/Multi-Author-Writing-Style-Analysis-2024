I work at a delivery service that has been around for 300 years or so? We have people who've put in 10 years plus who are either leaving or going medical-8. I know people who have already made double their salary in overtime and penalty time because we have been that short staffed with "peak season volume" all goddamn year since covid. We have zero holiday help. We are going into the third year of the worst peak season ever ( I keep hearing the word "unprecedented") and yet not a fucking peep from up top.
I have had total meltdowns in the back of my vehicle with my boss on the phone. I cry when I drive home from work because my body physically hurts everywhere and I'm getting home after my kids have fallen asleep. I fucking love the holidays but my career choice is slowly burning that away.
I have no idea what kind of rabbit they are going to pull out of their hats to fix this, but there isn't enough right now to keep anyone worth a damn because who wants to work 15 hours days? "OH and hey, when you're done doing this here, you're going to have to go across town and work till 10 pm because they had 8 sick calls.".
I loved this job before covid. My station manager has basically tanked his own career because he has told his bosses to piss off and leave our station alone. (We are the only station that isn't under water right now.) I hope for the sake of this wonderful service that has been serving the public that they pull their heads out of their asses, but my hope is dwindling. Please, be patient with your delivery services. It's not just my company. It's all of us. Amazon can't even handle their volume and yet they expect us to do the impossible. God speed, everyone.
This is being used against them unfortunately which in turn, hurts everyone. It's partly why wages have stagnated incredibly.
Yep, and another tough reality to hear is that immigrants are their own enemy. They are much too compliant to stick up for themselves for fear of going against any sort of "authority" figure.
It's time for Indians and Chinese to start talking to their relatives back home and either tell them to not be pylons and get walked all over, or simply just don't come at all because they will not have an easier time here.
If you live in Canada the plan is clearly to import hordes of third world immigrants, “temporary foreign workers”, and “international students”, pay them bare survival wages, house them 4 to a bedroom, and exploit them to death with the threat of deportation to keep them powerless.
It sucks because I'm a son of 2 immigrant parents and they have some remnants of that type of attitude, luckily they immigrated during a time where Canada didn't take advantage of them as they do now and it was an actual country of opportunity.
Can you isolate if there is more mental illness, or if people now are more comfortable mentioning that mental illness is the cause of their sick leave? People rarely if ever used to specify that they were suffering from a mental illness. They would use the reason of a more socially acceptable, non-stigmatized illness for their sick leave.
