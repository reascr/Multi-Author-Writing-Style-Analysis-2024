People on the right always think this, but publicly traded corporations don't have any kind of politics or morals, they just exist to make money and will proceed in whichever manner best achieves that. This is because those companies have boards that answer to the shareholders, so if whatever decisions the CEO and board make cause the share price to go down, they'll get fired and replaced with people who will make the prices go back up.
and I've done more for Hospitals, probably even more for Elevators, than even Thomas Edison, he came up with the Light Bulb, not a lot of people know that, and we're talking the good kind, not like what they have now. we had it so much better under Trump, but now Sleepy Joe is heading us into Major Disaster. it's very sad for our Country.
In short, it's not corporations that are progressive, it's the public that is. I guess right wingers find it easier to just blame corporations because admitting the obvious truth would be rather than that corporations are.

Again, these are just financial decisions being made by corporations, nothing more. Even if it's just a vocal minority, they're apparently very effective at organizing boycotts. These companies wouldn't cave to making diversity based decisions unless it was proving to be financially harmful to not do so.
Corporations make decisions about moderating certain kinds of content, or producing certain kinds of content, or even just vaguely supporting certain positions, because they get pressured by consumers. Companies that rely on advertising get pressured by their advertisers, who get pressured by their consumers. Boycotts and pressure campaigns have real world impacts, and shape the political direction that companies go in, not because of any political position of the people on those boards, but because of profits.
So when a company like Disney says they oppose Florida's Don't Say Gay law, it's not because they actually care, it's because their consumers are pressuring them into saying that. Same for when they make the decision to cast a Black woman as The Little Mermaid. Right wingers see these things and think Disney is too "woke", but they're just reacting to the general public. Disney used to make incredibly racist stuff when that's what the public wanted.
Twitter, by contrast, is not a publicly traded company, but rather is owned by one person who doesn't answer to anyone, so he can do whatever he wants with it. It may end up costing him billions of dollars personally to run it the way he is, as advertisers flee under pressure from the general public, but nobody can fire him for costing the company all that money cause it's his money.
If the vast majority of people were opposed to diversity, then companies would get far more financial pressure to avoid it. I don't know what to tell you, this is free market capitalism in action. There's a reason all these conservative alternatives to these companies and services are not anywhere near as successful (if they're successful at all). It's because that is what most people are opposed to.
He’s the one who said Twitter needs to be politically neutral for it to be trusted, not us. Since he bought it he’s made it more political than ever. The point is he’s a virtue signaling hypocrite.
I say we send Elon to Mars right now. Let's not bother with providing him any kind of living supplies or conditions on his flight there, or with figuring out how to safely land the rocket once it gets there. Just pack him in an interplanetary missle and shoot it directly at Mars.
