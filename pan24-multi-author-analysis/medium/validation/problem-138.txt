No, they've been sending lost of their own fairly-limited equipment stocks to Ukraine, as well. Poland sent virtually all of their T-72 tanks at the start of the war, several NATO members have severely drained their stocks of SPGs to equip Ukraine, all kinda of tech, maintenance, intel support has been provided by virtually every western ally, and not even mentioning all the consumable materials sent by basically everyone, MREs, water, basic infantry equipment, plenty of small arms, probably almost every kind of missile launcher ever made in some quantity or another, and all that's just off the top of my head.
Attack, no, but an emboldened Russia with a significantly increased influence sphere, with Ukraine's population, heavy industry, farmland and heavy industry can do to fuck shit up for the rest of us here in the region in myriad ways. They don't have start launching missiles to terrorise its smaller neighbours, and given the history of our countries, the way Westerners poke fun of how Russia can't bake a cookie without it being somehow defective, guess what. Mismanagement and sabotage are devastating, too.
