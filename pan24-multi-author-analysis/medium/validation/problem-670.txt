Russia already sabotaged Nord Stream 1 once before the explosion took place, blaming technical difficulties.
Gazprom started reducing the flow of gas to Europe after sanctions were implemented for the Russia-Ukraine war. They shutdown their pipeline to Poland in April. Then they reduced NordStream 1 flow to 40% capacity in June. They said it wasn't their fault, citing a faulty part from German company Siemens. Then they reduced it to 20%. By August it wasn't delivering any gas at all, while they claimed they needed a turbine sourced in Canada that presumably couldn't be released due to sanctions. No one actually believed that the technical problems warranted shutting the pipeline completely down. Yet Gazprom offered to start running Nord Stream 2 under a new contract instead (which would only be able to deliver at about 50% capacity). Germany balked at the offer and procured the turbine needed for repairs. Russia refused to have it delivered.
The important point here imo is the "new contract" part, since they want to force payment in rubles to prop up the exchange rate.
It is out of the question that it was in Russia's interest to sabotage NS1. The question remains, did they do it?
Rubles versus dollars is a factor. I think the lenh of assured sales/revenue is a factor, plus the rate of course. Pipeline contracts are made in at least 5-year increments. For a previously unused pipeline, a contract for 30 years wouldn't be unusual.
Putin says NS2 can start at 50% capacity: There's a TASS article from August 3, I'm not going to link to it but there's some commentary.
Oh look a random redditor has more access to investigate from his sofa without any intel more than his Twitter and tick-tock, literally why pay thousands of dollars for those people work if this guy solve it for free.
