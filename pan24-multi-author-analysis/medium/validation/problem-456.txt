This is not what US officials are saying at all, people need to stop posting just for headlines and actually read. All the US is saying is they want Zelenskiy to drop his stance of not negotiating with Russia while Putin is alive. That’s it. This is the dem letter all over again.
I’m not sure anyone in Europe is tired of watching Russia flounder and degrade in Ukraine. Most of those politicians and many citizens lived with realities like the iron curtain and the Fulda Gap, knowing NATO forces in Europe could not stop a Russian armored invasion.
I think that the article precise that the US fear that (while they still want to help Ukraine) others countrys might get tired of the war because of the impact it have for them (like in Europe, South America and Africa).
If the world is “fatigued” by some modern hitler starting his very inept campaign and wats to just let him because they “have enough” then this world deserves it, and everything that will come out of this kind of signal we send by this in the future from different fucking bastard individuals and autocratic regimes in the world. Because some privileged, spoilt part of the world is “fatigued”. We deserve to die.
This is exactly what I’m talking about though. The headline makes it seem that the US is officially pushing Ukraine towards negotiations, which is not the case at all. Here’s another quote from the article that directly contradicts what the headline is implying:
Countries in the third world are not in question here and they mostly are “neutrally” pro-Russian or in fact indifferent (which is more than undestandable. They are also completely unimportant in world matter but specifically - completely unimportant in regards to their attitude towards tgat war, supporting Ukraine with weapons or other resources.
This was about Western world that is actually involved in this war and its attitude is consequential for this conflict. Of course jount world pressure on Russia would be wellcome, of course these countries that trump called “shitholes” are possible fascilitators for subverting sanctions, of course western pressure on Russia would be more effective if third world would be onboard with the west against Russia. But even if they would formally be with us in practice these mostly corrupt and semi- or weak democracies wouldn’t be reliable partners, it an effort lost in advance to get the third world onboard.
It would be important if Europe held on with this war effort that Ukraine is sacrificially fighting for our interest, but particulary that our on-duty saviour, daughter-turned-parent: the USA holds this line and that trumpist republicans do not turn the policy around. Any outcome that would give Putin’s Russia any territory is a reward for the regime, a prolongation of the threat from Russia to the West - European Union, immediate russian neughbourhood that has aspirations to join the democratic world. This failure (in cost of life and resources) has radicalised Russian public even more and any victory they could take out of this would only worsen their mentality towards dangerous in future. The only way is defeating them so they realise they were fcuked by their leader. Their mentality will remain problematic but theere will be a possibility of self-reflection and preocupation with problems within the federation that would have to be resolved would kerp Russia out of our hair. Like the US led strategy (after complete EU, then ECC, failure to address balkan wars) did with Serbian regime.
I get that the conflict impact other countrys but come on, they were attacked in the beginning, it's the second times it happens, they still have a foreign force occupying their country and Russia demends are unacceptable, what should they do ?
“US officials have requested that Kyiv signal its openness to negotiate not to push Ukraine towards the negotiating table immediately, but to maintain the support of concerned allies, according to the Post.”.
