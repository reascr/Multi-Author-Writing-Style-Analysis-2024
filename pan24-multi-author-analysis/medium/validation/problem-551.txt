My mother died in 2019 of COPD. She smoked for 20 plus years and it really sucks because my grandpa smoked his entire life and lived till 88 so what the f. She was very active and in the air force walked miles a day. Soo I don't think him smoking really matters. My dumbass also smoked in my twenties and ran a 5K it was doable but it was a lot easier a year later when I quit smoking.

"We won't pretend that smoking isn't bad for your lungs, but just imagine the feeling of superiority you'll feel when you beat those clean eating "natural" athletes while taking a drag of the smoothest cigarette ever made - Marlboro 5K. Your competition needs all the help they can get".
