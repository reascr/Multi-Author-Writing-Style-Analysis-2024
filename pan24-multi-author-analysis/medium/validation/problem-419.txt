When the IRS audits a taxpayer, they mail an official notice to the taxpayer stating that they are under audit.
trump never showed any of those official notices from the IRS that would have proved he was under audit. The only reason not to show one would be that he didn't have one.
Correct. The Dems, not being idiots, knew that the IRS is requires by their own regs to conduct a mandatory audit of POTUS’s taxes, so once Trump had completed his first year they asked Treasury: “Hey, are you actually auditing Trump’s taxes like you are required to do?” and when they didn’t get a response, they used that as the basis for their lawsuit and it turns out that was the reason why they got access to his taxes. Another own goal by Trump.

You mean his claim he made in 2015/2016 when running for President that the IRS publicly explained wouldn’t keep him from disclosing his tax returns?
They didn’t do them for the first two fucking years and didn’t start doing them until a Democrat took over the House Ways and Means Committee and asked where they were.
