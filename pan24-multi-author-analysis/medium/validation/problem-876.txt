I know it's cool revisionism to say that the allies fought Germany because of the genocide but the reality is - nobody gave a fuck. They fought the war, because they were declared war upon.
Even after the war was won by the allies they recruited a lot of old Nazis to their ranks or put them in positions of power inside of Germany.
There was quite a bit of denial for some time in the German population about what happened and it could easily have gone the way of Japan or other countries that deny their atrocities. But it didn't.
In fact, most countries didn’t even believe the holocaust was actually happening. During WW1, accusations of killing ethnic groups was thrown at every other nation as a propaganda tool. When reports of the Nazi regime committing genocide against the Jewish, Romani, etc, everyone just thought ‘oh it’s just wartime propaganda again.’ It wasn’t until American and Soviet forces liberated concentration camps that the truth of the situation was revealed.
Also completely fucked is the fact US and Soviet forces would make gay men and women stay behind in the camps, so the lingering Nazi’s could come and kill them while they went off attacking other bases.
