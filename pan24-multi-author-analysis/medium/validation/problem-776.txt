Our apex court has become a joke.. They make all the right noises, but when judgement time comes they quietly roll over and assume the position for the Govt.
The most random comments that have no reason I can see get downvoted. I can only assume that I pissed off someone bad enough to get my username on a list. Like I get it when I say something that might piss people off, but this is stuff like “I saw that show, it was great”.
Rofl our courts right now are a joke.. And you're an enabler.. They release rapists and mass murderers and don't blink an eyelid, even when said monsters were committing sexual harassment when out on bail..
Tbf the last judge who "summoned" the no 2 guy of this Govt to court, "mysteriously" died earlier... So maybe that has something to do with it.
Bro I don't even remember a tenth of the failures of the courts under Modi..but I do know even judges are embaressed by the courts right now. Yet being the spineless greedy men/women they are they go along with it for personal gain/safety.
