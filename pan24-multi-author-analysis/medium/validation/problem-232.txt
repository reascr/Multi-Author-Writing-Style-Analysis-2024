Surprisingly, less of an issue than you might suspect. If you are willing to accept a longer commute, you can just stay outside of Tokyo and work there using the shinkansen (high speed train). They may not be quite as everywhere as, say, Swiss trains, but they are a fine train system.
Heck, I could see some families to other locations on the network for this if they can find a place in the new city that is closer to a station even if they still work in Tokyo.
Well with two kids that could mean $15k additional income per year that’s $1.2k/month. Nothing to sniff at. With remote working added this could mean a better lifestyle (not that there’s any with two kids!) and bring back a much needed younger age group in some remote areas too.
The government was already offering 300,000 yen per child for families relocating to other parts of the country.
The Japanese government will give families up to 1 million yen ($7,670) per child if they opt to move out of Tokyo, according to multiple media reports.
The move comes as authorities attempt to disperse the dense populations in Japan’s metropolitan areas, improve declining birth rates and diversify aging populations in more rural areas.
According to the Statistics Bureau of Japan, in 2021, 28.9% of Japan’s total population was at least 65 years old, marking a record high for the country. There were 14.78 million 0-14-year-olds in the same year, accounting for 11.8% of the total population, the lowest level ever recorded in Japan.
People living in 23 regions across Tokyo and local commuter hotspots will be eligible for the relocation money, according to a press release from the Kyodo news agency. The financial support is expected to be in place during the financial year of 2023.
Recipients of the money must live in their new region for at least five years while being employed and anybody breaching those rules would be asked to return the money.
Japan’s Cabinet Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported measure when contacted by CNBC.
