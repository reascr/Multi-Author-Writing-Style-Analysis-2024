Oh man, I have a small anecdote about someone presumably with this condition- I work in medical and we were supposed to do a procedure on someone allergic to "all chemicals" (even though literally everything is a chemical but sure). She flipped out when across the room I used the hand sanitizer from our foam dispenser, coughing and hacking and she took a benadryl and said she felt better after about 5 mins. Idk how long it takes to start working but that seems rather fast. I then proceed to put on ultrasound gel.. which is a chemical. And used an ultrasound probe which, you guessed it, had been cleaned with a rather strong disinfectant as we do between every patient which she had no reaction to. Then when we begin the procedure she has another coughing fit when we sterilize her skin, and this reaction I believe - it was a breast biopsy so obviously putting an antiseptic that close to her face definitely seems more plausible. She took another Benadryl and Xanax and tolerated the rest of the procedure fine. She even let us put bandages over the biopsy site, and adhesives are a fairly common material to be allergic to so you think someone that's allergic to quote "chemicals" would have reacted to that. After her biopsy she went to get a mammogram and, again, the machine had been previously cleaned which she didn't react to. One of our mammo gals asked if she would like her to apply some bactracin antibiotic appointment and her response was "only if you want me to die." Also there was the whole debacle about which numbing agent we were supposed to use before the procedure. She had to reschedule more than once because she believed she was allergic to every one of them. We called a surgeon of hers and found out which one he had previously used - he told us to call it by X name otherwise she would say she was allergic to it.
A friend (NB) of mine in Vancouver has an autoimmune disease, is allergic to just about everything, and has chronic pain. Several DOCTORS have told them to just look into MAID. Basically "save yourself and the system the trouble of dealing with you and go off yourself".
