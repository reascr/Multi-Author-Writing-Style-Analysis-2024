We destroy the Iranian military industrial complex, and dox the IRGC, revealing their names, addresses etc to the protesters.
We're not doing that because there's likely going to be an all-at-once style attack coming this winter, by Ukraine on the occupied territories, and by allies on Iran and it's military support of Ruzzia. Overwhelm their ability to support each other by pressing both at the same time.
I want the west to fuck the regime up you knoe but...Biden and CO want to wait for Ukraine maybe to win somehow and yeah wait wait wait.
One thing is sure ,not next year, maybe not next next year but trust me sadly we are only trying to save time for ww3 beginning.
I love my country Romania and other people and it hurst me to think that USA doesn't do more for the people because they are afraid of a global war.
People nowadays say that life during Gadafi was better and blame the US and NATO for what they have done.
Gadaffi was executed and his regime has fallen but life wasn't so good afterwards. Life in Libya has worsen, the country has cracked and militas rule the country.
Perhaps the people their take responsibility and the opportunity to make their country better now that the dictator died? Nope. Got to blame everyone else for their problems since they want to keep things the old ways.
We have to be careful what we do because action can have great consequences even if their intention was positive.
Right now, we're waiting for the right moment to strike. We need to hit like 10 birds with one stone. But the time is coming pretty soon. We all know Europe won't be able to endure the 2023-2024 winter without access to gas and oil, so we're going to need to end this before then.
If Ukraine doesn't win, Ruzzia and China will control the semiconductor supply chain. Not only that, but we've given Ruzzia enough time to divert much of it's fossil fuel sales to other countries, allowing it to prop itself up while cutting off Western supplies. If we lose Ukraine, the entire global power balance will collapse.
The semiconductor supply chain is what will shift the power balance if Ukraine loses. From what I can find, Ukraine is about 50% of the worlds supply of neon as of 2022.
Yes, they're selling it at a discount right now, but it clearly is enough for them to get by on for now, and their sales are ramping up with all of the new deals they've been making with other countries. They're already negotiating to turn Turkey into their new gas hub.
Europe was filling their reserves this year while still connected to pipelines and getting supplemental LNG. And LNG terminals take a while to bring online, especially on that kind of scale, not a single year. This is a continental level we're talking about, not just national. There will need to be a massive amount of infrastructure created to convert all of Europe to survive off of LNG shipments.
Ukraine is one of the only major sources of neon pure enough for use in high quality semiconductor and chip manufacturing.
Neon gas is a critical input for the semiconductor industry due to its use in lasers. One of the largest sources of neon is the steel industry, where it is a byproduct of liquid oxygen generation. As of 2022, Ukraine supplies an estimated 50 percent of neon worldwide, which is largely attributable to the legacy of the Soviet steel industry. The U.S. semiconductor industry is dependent on this portion of the global value chain, as Ukraine produces nearly all of the ultra-high-purity semiconductor-grade neon imported by the United States. This executive briefing explains neon capture, its chief downstream application (i.e., lasers), and Ukraineâ€™s importance in the neon supply chain.".
That's why both of these issues have been popping off at the same time. It's a big powerplay by both Ruzzia and China.
If Ruzzia and China controlled both, it would severely impact the global power balance. But right now, just losing Ukraine to Ruzzia will have about the same effect due to also losing access to their petroleum and gas for Europe, who likely will not be able to endure the 2023-2024 winter due to being cut off.
Ukraine is one of the worlds largest suppliers of neon used in chip and semiconductor manufacturing. Taiwan is one of (if not the) worlds largest suppliers of said manufacturing. Both of them are Western allies.
Edit: Wut? Your comment wasn't very cohesive to begin with, but your edit turned it into word-salad.
Wtf does this even mean? What are you talking about? How is it related to the rest of our discussion?
Stock of what? Chips? Because no, they haven't. They were interrupted for a while due to the pandemic, that's it.
