Thank you for proving my point, you bring up a shooting from 2016 as if it's anything close to the most recent mass shooting by a minority. It isn't but you can't name one without Google.
FUCKING NOT AGAIN! My heart breaks for every one of these people, and everyone else who is touched by this epidemic before our leaders decide to do something about it.
Hateful speeches + mental illness + easy access to guns = murder spree. Remove one of the three (by extension all three) and you get less of these murder sprees imo.

It is a fact that this shooting will not receive the same news coverage if the shooter is not a white guy. Which is still technically an if but I am highly doubtful he is since there is no mention of the race. If that fact bothers you then your anger should be with the media cooperations who make it so, not my comment on reddit pointing it out.
