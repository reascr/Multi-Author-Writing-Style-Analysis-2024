Badger: Parked all inconspicuous. It's a cop van. Another one right over there. "Duke City Flowers?” Come on! Can't you at least be original?
Badger: A flower van. You know what you should do is a garbage truck. Seriously. And I don't mean to disrespect. But if you put a bunch of cops in the back of a garbage truck, there's no way, I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck. It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it. Think about it, boys!
Badger: Come on. I was joking. Come on. Don't walk away angry. Sit down. Come on. I mean, what are you complaining about? You got abs, man. Kinda.
Cop: Whatever, dude. I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore. I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Cop: I know. It's simple. If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you. It's in the Constitution.
Cop: Thanks, man. Albuquerque Police You're under arrest Get on the ground Get on your stomach now On your stomach, get on the ground Hold it, don't move Stay down!
I believe (though am not an expert) even then it's not entrapment. You are still making a free choice to sell the coke. If th police said "we will kill your family if you don't" it would be entrapment.
No. Entrapment would be where a people wouldn’t have the means or possibly the thought to commit the crime, but law enforcement provides the tools/idea for it.
Though I might be horribly wrong but there are a lot of myths about entrapment. Partly spread by the police themselves to trick people.
That would not be entrapment either. The state will successfully argue that you were willing to sell drugs just fine. A law abiding citizen would decline. The police can give you the opportunity and even the tools to commit a crime without a problem. Entrapment is concerned with the state corrupting you to commit a crime you wouldn't otherwise have commited.
The fun part about state law though, is it matters what state you're in. This could be entrapment in certain states as long as specific criteria are met.
Even if the police were to provide the contact to get the meth from original I believe it would be hard to claim entrapment.
From the look of it, the police were going to confiscate $70k but when they got round to it it was gone. So instead they would find him that much abd the lawyer argued that it is cruel and unusual punishment because he can't pay it and will go to jail.
