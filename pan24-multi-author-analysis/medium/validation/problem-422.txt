Short answer: no, neither in the short nor long term. Not unless, by some miracle, the owner country agrees to it (and even then).
EU already admitted they can't just seize the state-owned assets and use them as they see fit, because even by the current, ahem, flexible legal standards, it would be stealing. The only thing they did cook up so far is forcibly investing the money in question, give the interest rate to Ukraine and return the rest.
With private assets, it's slightly easier to do, but here another problem arises. The moment USA/EU state out loud they can seize anything belonging to a citizen of nation they don't like, no sane person from South America, Asia and Africa (from anywhere, really) will ever store all of their fortune in a NATO country again, and over time, neither will their countries. Simply because a precedent has been set.
I feel like the US has definitely seized state owned assets before. I mean what about Afghanistan? They straight up woke give back their money and yet people from around the world continue to invest their money there.
Countries invest in the U.S./Europe for stability, not how they play hide the taco in how nationalization of assets happens EVERYWHERE in the world.
In other words, seizing and selling it all is possible, and you can't imagine a greater Christmas gift for China, which will then become a very, very attractive alternative with the slogan "at least WE will not confiscate everything from you illegally".
This is one of the reasons it's so attractive for Chinese citizens to get their money out of China and into international real estate. Away from the grubby CCp hands.
IIRC getting money out of anywhere is a challenge. At least it was the last time I asked; the more shady your income is, which is not uncommon, the harder it will be to take it out of whatever country you choose. Nobody likes losing investments.
Personally I don’t think it will come to that, specifically because it’s impossible to assess the risk and it’s likely not worth the losses.
Reparations are, by definition, agreed on by two sides, and paid after the fighting stops, by the side that agreed to do so (usually losing one).
No points for guessing if there will be a special paragraph of refusal of any reparations and compensations in any peace agreement other than unconditional surrender.
Even the logic of “but China can confiscate assets too!” is not guaranteed to work, because the answer to that will be “and if everyone does it now, why not try to accept these new conditions?”. As many have noted, the other side doing something does not mean a free pass on doing the same.
Maybe part of it will be (only one way to find out). Problem is, Ukraine already has more debts than it can realistically pay back in foreseeable future. And “hey, we loaned your money to someone else” is not really a legally valid excuse for EU to not pay them back.
Maybe, it is very hard to predict the results of something this unusual. It’s called a black swan: easy to explain retroactively, but impossible to foresee.
Trick is, the way of thought of countries that do not align with the West is MUCH different from what the media portrays. Of 8 billion people, only about 1.2 billion total participate in trying to punish Russia at all costs (and even there, it’s hard to say how many are doing it against their will, even if one puts aside Hungary and eastern Germany). In the eyes of others, seizing these assets will be a far bigger thing than it seems, and will not be justified. It’s unlikely to collapse the entirety of the financial habits overnight, but it will inevitably prompt a lot of investors to diversify, and that’s where Asia will come out. It will be terminally stupid for them not to offer something of opportunity.
What is much more likely (and some say already attempted) is trying to file lawsuits against Russia, and use these frozen assets as compensation for damages the lawful way. But that’s not something that can be done quickly, and very likely will not happen before the conflict is resolved (one way or the other). And by the time that happens... Who’s to say what the situation will be like.
