Evangelicals froth at the mouth over the thought of children learning that trans/gay/non-binary people exist; saying it is an attempt to indoctrinate children by exposing them to it early.
That’s why Christians go to work on people EARLY. If they can convince you that you were born an evil, worthless sack of shit right from the beginning they got you for LIFE. I am a former Christian and from a family of Christians and I can promise you that’s the absolute truth. It’s hard to believe this nonsense is still going on.
