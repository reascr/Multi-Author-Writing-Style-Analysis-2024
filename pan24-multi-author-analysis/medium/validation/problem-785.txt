We really have. Our education system has been bleed by capitalism and muzzled by the freedom fascists. Our social programs offered up to the lowest bid by private business. Employee protections long stripped away and a government that is too busy fighting itself to actually fight a problem.
Edit: Since some people have this going over their head, it's important to realize that when I say the gun wasn't the problem, I don't mean that if it didn't exist it wouldn't have happened. That's obviously true. The point I'm making is that there's 10 other things that went wrong that caused this to happen.
Most Americans have never left the USA. They have little clue about foreign societies. They also think that America is superior to everywhere else. This is a big part of why American leads the world in gun violence.
The gun wasn't the problem. The gun laws weren't the problem. This is a prime example of why people say "gun free zone" signs do nothing. Because in this case it did nothing. Adding more laws wouldn't have fixed this. Enforcing the already present ones would have.
Numerous laws were broken which allowed this minor to even get a hold of this firearm, so adding more laws wouldn't help. Numerous laws were broken which allowed this minor to take this firearm into a place that firearms are not allowed, so more laws wouldn't help. Numerous laws that could be created for this incident could also be circumvented just as easily. The only one that would "work" would be to ban all guns, but as we all know, thats a pipe dream so it's not a good argument.
TLDR: Tons of laws were broken here. All these laws were easily circumvented and are hardly enforced. We should be enforcing them more, rather than adding more laws that are also easily circumvented. That's the solution I'm discussing. Not banning all guns. Not ridiculous sarcastic and villainous comments about shooting a 6 year old.
You're putting it as "No gun = nobody gets shot" vs me, taking it as "No parents = child brought a gun to school.".
People putting up a sign saying that it's a gun free zone didn't stop this literal child from obtaining a gun. A law in VA that makes it illegal to hold a firearm in a way a child could take possession of it didn't stop this. Child endangerment laws didn't stop this child from getting their hands on a firearm.
Since this is clearly going over your head, my statement was about how the law clearly didn't stop someone from being shot, even accidentally. Someone broke the law. The parents broke the law. We should enforce the laws on the parents and make an example out of them.
Yes, clearly "ban all guns" would solve this from ever happening again, but there is no way to actually get there, so it's a non-starter of a discussion.
Didn't Congress pass a law a few months back about this? Where if you don't reasonably secure your weapon, you are on the hook if your kid gets ahold of it and does something like this?
Most people absolutely do support laws that punish irresponsible gun owners. The thing is, they already exist, just are either hard to or are never actually enforced.
Yep, and you just got a slew of down votes for stating the blindingly obvious: There is absolutely no fucking way that America could transition to a zero gun society overnight.
Gun control needs to be brought in gradually enough that it isn't rejected by gun proponents. Even laws that the majority of people should support have trouble. Witness Obama's no guns for mentally ill people getting cancelled by Trump. WTAF?
