When I was in Korea, I walked into an establishment and everyone stopped what they were doing and stared at me. The lady at the door pushed me back out the door and said no Americans I understand there are some businesses like this they just don’t want foreigners in their businesses. That’s fine it could have been for their or my safety that I was not allowed there. I don’t really care if I as a white guy am not allowed somewhere no need to get my feathers ruffled I just pretend that the place does not exist and go about my life. Why get upset because a business doesn’t want us there.
Wow, this hits home. I lived in Taichung for 4 years about a decade ago. I've actually been to this bar a few times, but never had issues there. There is definitely a weird vibe in Taichung bars, for some reason. I always heard stories about gangsters taking offence that some white guy had tried to dance with one of their girlfriends and beating the hell out of every foreigner in the bar as a result. "White guys cause problems" might be the other side of the story, though. I doubt the bar will be able to get away with this for long.
