They've also found cases in animals ranging from seals in the Caspian Sea, minks in Spain, and grizzly bears in America.
So far, the cases have come from animals eating wild birds carrying the virus, and there isn't evidence of spread between mammal populations at the moment.
In the case of Spanish minks reports are fuzzy and inconclusive. Some sources talk of four cages being 'hotspots', with disease radiating outwards from these to nearby cages, implying minks capable of spreading disease. Equally, it's said minks were fed raw fish and poultry by-products, the latter of which may've been contaminated.
There was an ill pigeon in my garden and I called the vets for advice, also mentioning my concern about bird flu. I was told to bring the bird in, which surprised me So I caught it (wearing gloves) and took it over. Obviously the vet put it to sleep and I asked if it could be bird flu- his answer was 'yes, it could be. Why, are you worried?' I was like, well, it's bird flu.
"Prof Ian Brown, APHA's director of scientific services, said: "A sick or a dead wild bird contains an awful lot of virus. So scavenging mammals that will be opportunistic and predate on dead or sick birds will be exposed to very large quantities of virus. That gives a possibility for the virus to enter a host population that it doesn't normally maintain in.".
