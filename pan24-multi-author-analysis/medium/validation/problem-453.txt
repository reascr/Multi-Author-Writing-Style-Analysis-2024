People give Nancy Pelosi a lot of shit, but she does a massive amount for her home district. Just a month or so ago she had her people set up an hour long phone-in meeting with San Franciscans concerned about the monkey pox. She started the meeting, then she turned it over to a bunch of experts from UCSF and SF Zuckerberg General Hospital, and had them talk to us about the risks of transmission, where we could get vaccines, availability of second doses, etc. There was time at the end for question and answers. I really appreciate everything she does for San Francisco residents.
