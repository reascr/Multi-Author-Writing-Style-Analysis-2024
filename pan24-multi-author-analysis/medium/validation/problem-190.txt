In this election season, John Gibbs and Ann Coulter are both doing speeches saying that women shouldn't have the right to vote. Abortion and using birth control are being taken away from women. Who's to say what's next. Banning women from working, from driving? From dressing in a way that might cause a man to rape them? (Shifting the blame to the woman). All are real possibilities now in the wonderful toxic USA that desperately wants the 1950s back.
My personal impression is that 99.9% of the people in Iran would like to exit the Middle Ages as soon as possible. The other 0.1 % is enriching themselves through government jobs.
Same, also same way most Americans want to save the planet and have healthcare but the minority doesn't..
And voting doesn't really help. You have a two party system that has totally locked up any decision making.
I live in the Netherlands, in the most recent election I had something like 35 parties to choose from, and nothing changed. Still the same old smarmy faces making decisions about my tax Euros.
