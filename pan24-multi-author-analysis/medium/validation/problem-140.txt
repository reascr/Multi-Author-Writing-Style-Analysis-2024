Remember when the WHO determined that stress from fear of radiation caused more adverse health effects than radiation from the plant? Same thing here. It's fear of the scary word "radiation" that threatens the fishing industry.
I used to be a carer for a guy who worked in Libya does system stress testing stuff. His colleague was instructed to go into a reactor or something of the sort to do some tests. He had a geiger counter and it started reading really really high levels of radiation, indicating a radiation leak.
He was in an area which was supposed to be shielded so was not wearing radiation protection, so he evacuated the area. Extensive investigations took place and it was determined the geiger counter itself was faulty.
However, although the man was not exposed to any radiation, he lost his hair and developed a multitude of benign tumours around his body.
Edit:half life of 12.3 years, slow enough to not be dangerous, fast enough to not be measurable in a centuryish.
The plant is on the seashore. Dumping it inland would require an enormous amount of energy to pump it uphill, not to mention the pumps and system of pipes that would need to be installed. And it would just run downhill into the ocean, anyway.
