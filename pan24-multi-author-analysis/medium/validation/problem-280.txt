>At least seven different federal courts dismissed this theory until it landed in the 5th Circuit, the nation’s Trumpiest appeals court. In May 2022, Judge Edith Jones—a Ronald Reagan appointee and hard-right bomb-thrower—wrote a 39-page concurrence asserting that the CFPB is funded unconstitutionally. Four other judges joined her. Then, in October, a three-judge panel formally declared that the CFPB’s independent budget mechanism renders the entire agency unconstitutional. Judge Cory Wilson, writing for the panel, revoked the CFPB’s ability to issue or enforce any regulations. (All three members of the panel were appointed by Donald Trump.) Thus, under the current law of the 5th Circuit, the CFPB effectively does not exist.

Yup. And democrats need to stop acting like we have a perfect system with impartial judges, accept the reality we live in, and come up with a plan to address it.
That could mean expanding the courts, term limits for justices, increased accountability/oversight and/or any number of other policy changes.
Mmmm take a gander at what is proposing, they want to make a state sanctioned camps to concentrate the homeless and mental health involuntary commitment. The time to act is quickly leaving us.
