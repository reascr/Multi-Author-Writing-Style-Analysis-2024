If you travel more than like once a year, you should look into a travel card with lounge access or consider joining Priority Pass. You get free food and drinks, or in some cases you get a credit to spend at restaurants. It's such a value proposition, it's so easy to spend $100 in an airport bar with 2 drinks and a meal.

Grab and go airport food is the worst. Not only does it cost twice as much as it should, it's terrible quality. $15 for a "salad" with processed chicken and bagged lettuce. Bleh.
Oh yeah I'm with ya. I try to take a protein bar and some baby carrots to the airport with me, but when that's not an option, airport food it is. At least some places will have like Greek yogurt cups and fruit. For $10. ðŸ˜‚.
