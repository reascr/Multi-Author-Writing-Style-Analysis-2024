I mean, they use the word ‘revive’ here, but viruses aren’t technically alive. It’s a strand of RNA inside a protein capsule that can’t move, can’t eat, can’t breathe, can’t excrete, and only can bind to a cell and trick it into incorporating it’s genetic material into its host, where it instructs the cell to replicate copies of itself.
Viruses need to evolve alongside its hosts so as to keep being able to infect them through the long cycles of natural change and selection. We have a 50000 years a head start on these specific little beasties, so we’ll be fine. This is why new and contemporary viruses like COVID-19 are far more of a threat to us, by the way. They are the kinds that have mutated in ways that can afflict modern humanity and not our stone age hunter-gathering ancestors or our neanderthal cousins.
50000 years ago humanity was in it’s infancy. We’ve had 50000 years to evolve and change and develop. We aren’t the same creatures we once were that made us susceptible to such ancient viruses. It might not even be able to bind to our cell membranes anymore, or it’s genome might no longer be compatible with ours, or it may be extremely vulnerable to our current immune system, or so on.
Honestly I’m just drawing on my fascination and out of school interest in history with my three years of high school biology. I’m not an expert by any means, but I know the very basics as to how viruses work.
They are like a mousetrap floating in a pool of water. As long as it remains intact, it doesn’t really matter how long it is frozen for.
But it is like digging up an ancient roman coin. Or a fossil that is really well preserved because it has been buried in sediment for 20000 years. It’s interesting and certainly a historical treasure. But we don’t go around calling it a “supernatural voodoo coin” or “magical zombie fossil” now do we?
What would call opening a tomb of an Egyptian king? It’s a historical treasure that strangely becomes the subject of movies filled with supernatural voodoo… but voodoo is a specific type of dark magic from a specific area on the globe, particularly vile, but not a catch all of evil magic.
Could you maybe come to my house every night and explain various world issues to me in a soothing, knowledgeable, and optimistic manner before I go to sleep?
You probably don’t have anything to worry about. Viruses are only designed to attack a specific cell or group of cells. And even if this one against all odds evolved to attack or was able to attack one of our cells, it might not be able to anymore.
Maybe everything I learned is a complete lie, or maybe I’m misremembering. I’m trying to confirm my facts online before I post and everything seems to go along with what I know, but just advising you to take me with your usual cube of sodium chloride.
Take some college biology though. And then do the math on the random possibility of hemoglobin. You may find that at least some of what you were taught in high school is a lie. History class was full of them.
