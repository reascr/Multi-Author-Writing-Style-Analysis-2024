As an American, I think UK politics are more fun. If there were easily available English translations of other European Parliaments, I'd watch the fuck out of them.
As a Slovene, I can say the same. Our dumb prime minister said a while ago that the Western Balkans are on Russia's side. Our dumb foreign minister said there can be no peace or stability in Europe without Russia. We're still waiting for comments from our dumb Karen of a president. It's a shitshow, led by sympathizers of the old communist regime.
If it suits them and is a 'good' thing (for them, wether it's true or not), they will talk about it.
Dont worry, its only fucked up if you are a disappointed right-winger, letting off steam in a reddit comment section.
Actually, we are considerably less fucked-up than we were under the right wing government. At least we are not turning into the next Hungary, heh. Progress?
I see. Could Croatia confiscate the yachts belonging to those sanctioned individuals at least? And then sell them to the highest bidder and give the money to Ukraine, or something.
