I don't think any person needs a religious book in order to improve their personality. There are other methods without the danger to get the urge to kill people that are different, because they inferred it from a religious book.
Religions are the result of stupidity, you guys think that stories from fantasy books are real and go nuts, meanwhile often combined with distrust in science.
It's cool if a person is able to accept a death with it, but it's not cool if this person starts to work against longevity hacks of other people.
Religious people tend to be happier, that's a value, but there are a lot of negative aspects that I experienced in such people, probably mostly because they don't think analytically.
I have heard somewhere that Ignorance is bliss.... perhaps that explains happy religious people. Although, I think they are a bit of Fairweather happy... never personally seen a happy one when things aren't going according to their scriptures. They tend to get all doom and gloom or fighty when that happens.
