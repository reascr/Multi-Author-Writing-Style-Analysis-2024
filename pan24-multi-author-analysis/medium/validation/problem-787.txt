The GOP are children who are throwing a fit and don't want to pay unless the democrats give into their crazy demands, in hopes that they can somehow make the democrats look bad by not giving into their demands.
Debt ceiling shouldn't exist and is unconstitutional anyway (IANAL). Other countries don't have a similar concept. The money has been spent. Yes, it was spent via borrowing. Don't like that? Shouldn't have authorized it in the first place if you didn't want to pay the bill now that its due.
Furthermore, debt of a government is not akin to debt of a family household. So long as GDP is growing faster than the debt, debt is a good thing. You're growing faster because money is being spent. If you didn't spend that money, you'd be hurting economic growth and holding the country back. Again, so long as the growth outpaces the debt, then there's no issue with massive debt. Again, IF the economy is growing faster than the debt (and it almost always does). This is why America has a great credit rating. We're able to pay our debts -- until we choose not too. Not because we can't, but because we just decide not to pay. Something the United States has never done. Since George Washinon, the United States has made every single debt payment in its history. Republicans are going down the road we've never actually gone to the end of. Its beyond reckless.
