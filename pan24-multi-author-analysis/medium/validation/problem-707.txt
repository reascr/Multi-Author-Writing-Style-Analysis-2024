I wish someone would encourage these folks to google some trans men, like Chaz Bono, and ask themselves why they are desperate for him to be sharing a bathroom with their daughters.
It seems like many bathrooms in France are like that at least at larger venues. I have been in bathrooms where the toilets were in individual stalls and the sinks for hand washing were shared. Men and women could use the sinks together.
If safety at school was such a genuine concern they would be trying to protect the kids from being shot, not from their transgender friends and classmates.
