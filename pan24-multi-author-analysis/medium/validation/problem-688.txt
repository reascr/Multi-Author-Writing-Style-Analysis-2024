For the people who didn't read the article. He's telling Russians in Russia that the Russian government is going to close the border in a week for a 2nd wave of mobilisation. He's effectively telling them to leave Russia before they get sent to the front lines.
This farce of a war with a nuclear “superpower” and its much smaller neighbor needs to end asap. Mad Vlad and his Generals have no idea how to fix this quagmire meanwhile real people are dying. Putin trying to pull Belarus into the war while Belarus seems to be avoiding any direct intervention again. Their army will do nothing more than make this a two front war again which didn’t work well the first time. Belarus’s army is weak and under equipped as well and that puppet of a leader knows he’s walking a tightrope.
Mad Vlad must if these numbers aren’t enough for him to pack up and head home. He’s depleted his land army of its stockpiles and an estimated 100k Russians have died in a failed invasion. If that shit happened anywhere else the government would have been overthrown. It’s a good thing the Russian population are sheep because they’re going to the slaughter.
"Russia has lost over 100,000 soldiers in its war against Ukraine, according to the latest figures by the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces.".
If only there were some resource that might answer the very question you have. Huh. Maybe someone will post an article with the details related to this headline.
