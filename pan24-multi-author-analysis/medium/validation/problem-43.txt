And the 24hr news cycle just keeps changing the subject. And what events that should outrage the everyday American into getting real change just moves and shifts into something social/subjective. If tomorrow there were a vote to give some big industry the ability to capitalize off the American voter they would take that vote at the end of the day and by morning there will just be some new email that comes out about someone’s son/daughter about some risqué subject matter. There’s nothing that’s going to change what’s gonna happen, the democrats get the benefit of fighting the good fight to help the millions of Americans with federal student loans but without any teeth to actually get the job done. And the republicans get to fight the democrats for the benefit of showing their supporters that somehow giving the everyday American a break is different than bailing out companies and industries that over inflate their product/service or stock price and when their economic schemes don’t pan out they dip their hands into our pockets. If the scheme does work, they keep the revenue and get to set the price point as high as they want on their products or stocks. But when it doesn’t work, despite being called out for shady business tactics, they still get their puppets to vote for a bail out. But don’t worry, you can’t get your student loans busted down by a fraction because that’s socialism and this country was built on “pulling yourself up by the bootstraps” and yada yada yada. I’m guessing they’ll propose some instrument they will force feed the people as some “healthier alternative” that is better fit for themselves and not anyone looking for help. It’s like where Trump gave everyone $100 extra each month with his tax cuts and nobody showing the real benefit went to the ones that already have more than they’ll ever need. There’s a reason more billionaires have been created in the past two decades and the American middle class still can’t afford a home. Don’t worry why would you want to have more buying power and a possible goal of retiring instead of complete reliance on the countless representatives of a government that just wants you to hate your neighbor and fight over the next hot topic with no impact on what’s in your leased apartment/home.
