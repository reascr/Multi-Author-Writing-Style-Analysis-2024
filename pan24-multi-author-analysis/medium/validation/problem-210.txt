It's a legitimate argument that the GQP uses. Connecticut is one of four states that does not offer early voting, so this year it's on the ballot for the people to decide whether they want it or not. Republicans opposed it because they said it unfairly gives Democrats an advantage.
They are trying to say that due to only blue counties having voting on Saturday is an unfair advantage, instead of opening up red voting they want to squash blue votes.
The nonstop Republican onslaught against voting isn’t about fighting fraud, it’s about making voting as inconvenient and inaccessible as possible. That’s all it is. They don’t have popular messages or ideas that resonate with the public, and in an increasingly polarized environment where more elections are won on the margins their game has shifted to throwing sand in the gears rather than reflecting on their unpopular platform or candidates.
