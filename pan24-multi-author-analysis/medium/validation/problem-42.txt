One of Ukraine's strategies this whole conflict has been to make Russia pay for every bit of ground taken. Attacking traditionally spends many more resources than defending. Last I saw, Bakhmut was pretty much leveled, so I doubt Ukraine is holding it just to hold it. This is what the north looked like right before Ukraine's main counter-offensive took back a huge chunk of land.
I don't know, but i'm sure Ukraine must have some kind of plan because this battle has been almost as costly for them as it has the Russians in terms of men lost.
I called it a strategy because it doesn't happen this way in all conflicts by a long shot. It was a simple statement, but there is more behind it. It isn't just that they are making them pay, they are slowly conceding ground while Russia pushes forward into their defensive lines.
It is a zero sum game, every soldier lost is a win for the other side. So it seems likely that one side is coming out on top, by God's metric one side is doing the smart thing by continuing fighting.
Am I wrong, or isn't it also the case that there's little actual strategic value to Bakhmut for either side? They're just fighting over kilometers basically...
