Kinda. But Poland has been moving hard away from Germany for awhile now. Designed their own rifle (only ar18 derivative that can operate conventional and bullpup formats, it's interesting to say the least) and buying vast quantities of artillery such as HIMARS from the US (400 or so), so I really think Poland does not really care about getting on Germany naughty list like the rest of Europe. Whether that's a good idea or not is another debate, but their actions speak "we don't care about stepping on toes, we find other suppliers".
that is a very good point. hopefully they solved any diplomatic issues beforehand. there were rumors of this for like the last week or so. they just signed a agreement for abrams, afaik like 1200 and i think they just got a shipment of k2 tanks for korea. so, things are lining up for them to give ukr tanks.
Did you forget when Poland announced it would send migs to Ukraine, but then instead wanted to bring them to Rammstein, and then make the US bring them to Ukraine instead?
But there are so many spare parts for older models and Poland has been moving away from German tanks to American and south Korean models that they might not care if they lose support for their older models and are willing to risk it to get the ball moving twords europe supplying more heavy armor for their neighbor.
