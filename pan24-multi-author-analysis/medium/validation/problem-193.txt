As pointed out. People strike en mass because there are issues beyond pay rise. Please look up stories and more written by real employees.
Like people ask for more pay to survive, yet are asked what EXTRA work they do "for free" to justify the extra pay? (Whem already understaffed).
Often it just isn't. It's already been acknowledged that would have cost less than the money lost to strikes. That Â£200m lost by Royal Mail could have gone towards meeting a pay increase, and that amount doesn't include the loss of future business caused by RM customers finding alternative delivery services.
UK and more are promoting fedualist, aka thoes in charge do whatever they want and the "poor" need to stfu or there will be sever consequences. Aka like how people hate cheap quality brands, thoes "in charge" see the working class as such brand, even filth level.
To many are not in charge to help manage an institute but to ensure everyone stfu and don't bother the rich.
There is money, a lot of money, however it's there so the rich can play real life monopoly, and the managers and more are there to ensure the game stays quite and don't disturbs the "players" from thir monopoly session.
