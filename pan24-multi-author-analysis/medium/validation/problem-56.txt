Context: Ghana is a major gold exporter but the government is a mess. They're in the middle of a major economic crisis and trying to negotiate an IMF bailout.
In this weird niche situation, it makes sense for Ghana to buy things with gold instead of dollars because the government is such a bad risk, they're almost cut off from international finance, and their foreign currency reserves are low.
I’m sure the IMF is giving Ghana, a desperate underdeveloped nation, a good loan with no outlandish stipulations. Extracting the country’s gold, well that’s just an extra neat little perk.
it's not like Ghana has a dollar printer. Only the US can use that one. and technically Europe too because the ECB has an unlimited credit line to the Fed.
I remember learning about the IMF and World Bank from a grade 12 textbook, and I was shocked at how accurate what you just said is.
They have been raping underdeveloped nations for several decades. Africa was first, and then they moved on to South America. Basically enormous, incredibly shady banks...
