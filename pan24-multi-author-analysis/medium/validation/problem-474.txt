yeah it's probably super common (in the case that people find documents that should have been returned and immediately return them) and wouldn't at all be newsworthy if it wasn't for Trump's scandal.
This is so comically absurd in the sense that…you really had to give disingenuous right-wing assholes ammunition to use against you?
Yep but also the fact that Trump hasn’t been charged in his case despite literally obstructing and lying about it is what makes this even worse. Obvious crimes were committed in Trump case but the lack of charges allows the right to essentially ignore it. Biden situation should have an investigation but in both cases they need to be very transparent and inform the public what they find and if they do find crimes in either case charge them. The public trust in the DOJ is at an all time low because we are onto their shit and realize they don’t have any interest in holding the ruling class accountable.
This irks me in so many ways and the failure to hold Trump accountable for his much different situation is what is going to cause a ton of chaos around Biden’s. The Biden situation absolutely needs to be probed but in both cases we need way more transparency and public education on what/if was criminal in either case. Trump has obviously engaged in criminal conduct in how he obstructed the probe trying to get them back and also lying about it. He has to be held accountable yesterday, but the failure by feckless Garland is allowing the right to “both side” the shit out of this. Further eroding the public trust in the DOJ.
Short attention span? Maybe. But look at how many non-issues these people hold onto, that they will be frothing at the mouth about when an asshole right-wing commentator reminds them about it? Benghazi, Afghanistan exit, inflation. People will remember this in 2024.
