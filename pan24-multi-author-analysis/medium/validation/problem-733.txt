Now many people dont have land lines, pollsters can use cellphones but then people might not answer a number that they do not recognize (especially younger people), and let it go to voice mail (now this is also the case for landlines). There is an overall trend in avoiding long phone conversations, so some people just hang up after understating that it is a survey or not respond to the follow up surveys at a later date (which is a big issue because pollster ideally want to see how the opinions of the same people are changing). Online surveys avoid some of these issues, but then it becomes very difficult to really know who you are really surveying, for example you could accidently survey a non-citizen or a 15 year old. Landlines, cell phones and online also reach to different demographics, which skew the sample.
