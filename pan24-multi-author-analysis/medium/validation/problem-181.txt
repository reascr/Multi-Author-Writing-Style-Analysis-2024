And yet outlets like NYT focused hard on the Boudin recall, insisting it meant that reforms are not what people want, but when reformers win, NYT simply ignores them as if they don't exist. Their agenda is obvious.

For all the scare mongering over crime. The voters, save for San Francisco, seem to be on board with a more wholistic approach to criminal prosecution.
The super weird run of literally random broad daylight violent crime against Asians in SF that lead to him losing the recall freaked me out.
I know it was (somewhat) during a period where crime against AAPI communities was up, largely because of Trump.
And they seemed to be getting out of jail instantly even when they did get caught, with the SFPD blaming all of it on Chesa.
I just don’t understand why a guy arrested for armed robbery 10 miles south of the city would drive up to China town to beat up an old Asian person on the street at random and not even steal anything. And I don’t understand why that happened lots of times. And I don’t understand why it was happening constantly right before the election and literally hasn’t happened since then.
But this wasn’t that. It wasn’t timed the same, and it wasn’t perpetrated by Trump type folks. It was overwhelmingly being committed, seemingly at random, by guys who had previously been arrested by the SFPD for violent crimes.
