Also, most of the money is just being redistributed between various royals Quatari royals who own all the companies being paid, its not like they paid 200B to outsiders or to the workers who built everything. Sure, the foreign engineers made bank, but the vast majority of the budget is just redistribution of wealth between branches of the royal family.

Only 4 b was dedicated to WC and its utilities. Those stadiums ? Can be disassembled and sold. I don’t think they’re pieces of shit for telling the west to shove their values up their asses.
Hes a complete and total piece of shit human being. Just before this comment he replied with a homophobic slur, as well as a slew of other toxic edgelord nonsense.
