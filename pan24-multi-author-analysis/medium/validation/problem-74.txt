This was reported like the Torah burning was banned by Swedish authorities. That false information was further used to accuse Sweden of bias and hypocrisy.
As the article says, it was dialogue between the man who planned to burn the Torah and other Muslims what made the man change his mind. Authorities didn't stop him and he would've gotten a permission for his demonstration.
Yeah, that was quite irresponsible from Israeli authorities. I understand why they wanted it to be perceived as them having more clout with the Swedish government than Erdogan and also they wanted to get all the praise for preventing that event from taking place, but those statements from Israeli Foreign Ministry and ambassador painted a completely wrong picture of how it went down.
The only way the Swedish government was involved is that the Swedish Prime Minister apparently got into direct contact with the organizer and asked him to rethink his plan, but it ultimately was the organizer's own decision.
> The 34-year-old explained to DN that he is “tired of his tax money going towards protecting right-wing extremist Rasmus Paludan's repeated Quran burnings,” most recently outside the Turkish embassy. His actions are intended to claim that Swedish law is hypocritical.
Just to add, the translation says "call", not as in phone call, but as in call to action. Most likely referring to a press conference from the day (or so) before were the the P.M asked to be respectful. Jpost also got it wrong.
This would go against the Ministerial rule - the P.M would basically be gone from his post by the time the phone call ended.
