And that still harms Russia. Before sanctions, people exported goods to Russia at a modest profit, which was called "business", instead of profiteering. Now they pay a premium. It would be better if Turkey got with the fucking program so that China could screw them a little harder, but they're still paying a premium, while their energy revenue is cut.
Turkey is having economic problems, and war profiteering is probably the main thing keeping them afloat- selling Bayraktars to Ukraine and microchips to Russia is good business. But we need to acknowledge that Turkey was the first to share complicated weapons systems, and the Bayraktars were critical in the chaotic first days of the invasion. They played a big role in sinking the Moskva.
It hurts them and we need to keep it up, but we also need to be more sober on Russia's own capabilities. I've argued about all this before, and people are always so eager to jump to "We've done it We've defeated Russia No way they get around this Our victory is at hand" but in reality, Russia isn't going to take any of this sitting down, they will search for ways around everything we do, to trick us into believing the opposite of what is happening, and we need to think ahead, instead of coping for a quick win.
