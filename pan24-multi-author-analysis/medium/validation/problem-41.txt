"Aryeh Shechopek, a 16-year-old Canadian yeshiva student who lived in the Har Nof neighborhood in Jerusalem, was killed in the first attack.".
I truly believe Jenin is where the third intifada will come from. Its not really even controlled by the PA and has had ISIS, Hamas, and PIJ fighters die there.
"Israeli police said that the bombs at both sites were activated remotely by cellphone. It said that the explosives were placed in bags and contained nails and pieces of metals to maximize the impact.".
Edit: Thanks for the upvotes. Arab propaganda and Iranian propaganda infects Reddit and Western media. Do not fall victim We are your allies We will never bend to terror and always push for an equal Jewish-Arab state!
"The bombings are a departure from the lower tech, more lone wolf-style attacks with which Israel has grappled in more recent years. Since last spring, a string of Palestinian stabbings, shootings and car rammings have put Israel on high alert. In response, the Israeli military has conducted near-nightly raids, especially around the West Bank city of Jenin, from where a number of assailants have originated.".
Thank you. I hope that goodwill and decency will prevail on both sides, and that Israelis can take the most sensible self-defense measures to keep their people safe, too.
The Druze are incredibly pissed by this, there is videos of tjem chanting and protesting in the streets threatening to go into Jenin to return the body.
Im holding off, i think they are going to try and defuse the situation to get his body back, because if the Druze go in its going to be a massive problem for the palestinian druze relations.
Threads like this give me further hope tho that the diplomatic situation of Israel isn't so one-sided, and people are aware that Israel needs and wants a humanitarian solution to this, not a violent one, but will defend itself if needed.
Palestinian terrorist organizations that do terrorist attacks while governing Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority that encourages and funds terrorists would have tremendous power to stop the conflict and similar attacks. Regardless of military/economic power differential, Israel can't unilaterally create peace.
