For example, let's say that your birth name was Hitler Adolph Brown. You hate the name for obvious reasons and have asked to be called Tim instead. Freedom of speech says that people can call you whatever they way right? So all day long people are calling out your name purposefully. Let's say you go the extra step of legally changing your name to Tim Brown. But someone at work finds out that your birth name was Hitler and they think it's hilarious to use it whenever they see you. "Oh hey Hitler. How's it going?", "what's up Adolph", "Doing any painting or anything fun this weekend Hitler?" I mean it's just free speech right? They're just words right?
