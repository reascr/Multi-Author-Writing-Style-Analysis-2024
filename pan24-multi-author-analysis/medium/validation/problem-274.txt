Long Island guy here and after 4 days in a row of 70+ weather and listening to my friends say things like "Global warming isn't all bad", I realize too many people will never get it. I'm like "Did you guys read what the warm water temperatures are doing to shellfish and algae, etc.?" Of course, they do not.
