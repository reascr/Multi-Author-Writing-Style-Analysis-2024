Imagine thinking that Iran could mount any type of significant defense against the United States _because they have drones_. The occupation of Iraq was an effort to nation build for two decades. As a military effort, the Iraq War concluded within days. While Iran could likely fend off an invasion for a little longer, it’d be mostly a cake walk for our military. Don’t get us confused with Russia.
Edit: alright I get it. They do have the means to kill 15,000 people - it doesn’t have to be done humanely like I naively believed they would want to do this. However it still sounds a bit like a desperate measure to me.
They’re not gonna execute 15,000 people. They simply don’t have the means to do so, nor would the population and other countries just tolerate it. They’re using this as a justification to mass execute the more vocal protesters/leaders and to let other protesters know that they could be next if they don’t step back.
These are desperate measures though and desperation usually equals weakness, and I hope protesters understand how close to victory they really might be.
