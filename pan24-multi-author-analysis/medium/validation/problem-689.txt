Winter has come to the steppes. The earth is frozen hard as bone, and the only movement is steam rising from the nostrils of men and horses. Only the promise of battle brings warmth.
It’s the same here in most of New England, I’m in VT and it’s far warmer than it should be. The average low temp for the next 10 days is still over 20°F/-7°C and a lot of the daily highs are above freezing. Now that might sound cold to people in warm climates by it is a naturally warm for this time of year, January is supposed to be the coldest month. This years average low and high temperatures for December and January have been 10°F or more higher than they should be. It’s concerning because while it’s cutting count on our heating bills nature evolves to a climate over a period of millions of years and the flora and fauna are confused and damaged by unpredictable weather. My fruit trees didn’t drop their leaves for at least a month past when they did the last few years and it got so warm in late November into December that some of them started trying to regrow leaves which is definitely not good for them.
