__A court in Appenzell has dismissed a racism case against a yodeler who painted his face black and pretended to be African, reports the SonntagsZeitung.__.
The case relates to a carnival performance by a yodel choir in November 2022, in which choir head Markus Nef caused controversy by stepping onto the stage with a black painted face, frizzy wig, drum and grass skirt. Nef, a local farmer, denied allegations of racism, saying he had no time for that in a place where people “work and don’t look for trouble”. He said he had never heard the term “blackfacing” before.
However, the Federal Commission against Racism called the performance "clearly tasteless and racist”. The performance and disguise reproduced racist colonial stereotypes where “black people are belittled for general amusement", it said, calling for judicial authorities to investigate a possible criminal offence.
The public prosecutor's office in the northeastern canton Appenzell Outer-Rhodes opened criminal proceedings. However, judges have now ruled that while the performance used "typical elements of blackfacing", the performer did not make racist or derogatory remarks about Africans. They concluded that in the context of the carnival this did not qualify as racism.
Markus Nef doesn’t have to accept it and he’s lucky he lives in one of the whitest places in the world to be able to get away with it and with an excuse like “where people work and don’t go looking for trouble.” But he’s a racist. That’s textbook racism. When people in his country pretend it’s not it just makes them look racist.

_"Markus Nef, president of the yodelling club Walzenhausen, sees it differently. He emphasises to the "St.Galler Tagblatt": "Our goal was to unite different cultures and to show that __everyone is welcome to sing with us, no matter what culture they have__."_.
