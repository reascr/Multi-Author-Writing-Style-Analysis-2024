Clearly you dont know shit and talking out of your ass. This is TTP Taliban and they are different from the one in Afghanistan. Regardless, The Taliban in Afghanistan changed their plan, they realized attacking US wont let them win the war, so they accepted a deal with Trump and didnt attack US soldiers. Even when Biden came to power and attacked the Taliban, they remained patient because they know it was only matter of time. Taliban is not ISIS or Al Qaeda, their goal doesn't stretch passed Afghanistan. US doesn't care for Taliban as long as they dont host AL Queda and Taliban is a threat for US for US to start another war. US will take the L and move on from Taliban chapter and Taliban isn't stupid to attack US and bring them back to Afghanistan.
Extremists usually call for cease fire when they lose men and equipment. Once they have reorganized their forces they break cease fire and continue this cycle until they are all either killed or they have won.
Not just extremists, every single forces that has ever walked across done that. Also read the article next time ? They ended ceasefire because their commanders started getting killed.
