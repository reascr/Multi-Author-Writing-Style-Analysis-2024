We could be, but the chance we will is now tiny. It’s important that people understand how important climate change is and that we still need to do a whole lot more to make things better. That being said it’s also important that people realize that the changes we’ve made so far and the progress seem to point to things getting better. If people think that we’ve accomplished nothing despite huge strives being made in almost every category to curbing climate change than they might think it’s better to give up. Emphasize the importance but you have to show people that there is hope.
Edit: I was wrong about the time frame. 6 years, average HSBC loan lenh, but they really don’t give a fuck.
That's missing the point though. A corporation is just a machine for making money. It will do so in the most effective way it can find, within the limits of what's allowed by the government.
It's the government's job to set the limits that make pollution unprofitable, and they've delayed doing so for decades.
