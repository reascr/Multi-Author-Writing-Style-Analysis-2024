Really. Like when they wouldn’t vote on a Supreme Court nominee and held of long enough to pack the court. As far as I’m concerned both sides right now have extremist that tend to b all they talk about in the news and I think the vast majority of people are in the middle. Sick of both parties at this point. Finger pointing and division is killing us. Love thy neighbor. This is not a red or blue problem. Can’t agree on anything. Red. Drill more oil. Blue. Climate catastrophe. We are going to die if things don’t change. Red. No immigration. Blue. Let them come legal or not. Not once have I heard a proposal about a Ellis island type of thing like we used to have for immigration. If you can’t stop it then control it at the least or debate it until it’s resolved. Everyone in this country is getting taken for a ride on both side of it and it benefits the parties and politicians by drawing lines. Enough is enough. I was raised very liberal and I now work construction and it’s very conservative mind set on job sites. When it comes to problems at work we have no problem working through the issues to find resolve. As soon as it comes to politics everything changes all of a sudden. Pick a team and stick with it to the end right or wrong. Political parties need to be dissolved so issues that arise are dealt with by addressing the problems and not along party loyalty ☹️.
