My concern is that the Revolutionary Guard are deeply integrated into the political/economic/military system of Iran. It's akin to designating the military of another nation as terrorists.
This is likely to cause further unrest to an already volatile set of circumstances in the Middle East, and I think is a step backwards to settling things diplomatically.
The problem is we can't solve things diplomatically. We've had nearly 45 years of trying to do it that way and if anything it's gotten even worse.
We're pushing to designate the IRGC as terrorists and calling for countries to recall their ambassadors so that the regime are completely cut off from the rest of the world. Sanctions are already heavily effecting the economy but proscribing them would reduce any trade left to essentially nothing which would put even more pressure on the government. And it would also mean that members of IRCG can't escape to other countries.
Now if we could do something about the regime's children living it up in the West on dirty money that would be great too.
