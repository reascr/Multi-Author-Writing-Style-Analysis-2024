While I know Russia typically has lower income in December, that's still startlingly close to "Russia is going to run out of money in 3-4 months".
And their energy revenues are still dropping as more sanctions kick in, so that may accelerate even further.
It's even more interesting since Putin can't just devalue the ruble to settle the budget like before. Hydrocarbon exports are down, gas sales have dwindled and the Ural is being sold at 40% the Brent. OTOH imports of sanctioned or self-sanctioned goods are already overpriced. Plus all the hoops to get trade flowing, evading sanctions and whatnot.
Moscow will very soon turn on the printing press, and once it starts it won't be able to shut off again. And then, the ruble will finally turn into rubble again.
Well, during all the 2022 liquidity part of the fund decreased from 10% GDP to 7,8% GDP. And that is still more then in all the years before 2020. At the same rate, it will take like 4-5 years to spend it all. Also, it's spending was an emergency measure related, among other things, to the freezing of Russian assets, mobilisations, etc.
Of course, if the energy market conditions are unfavorable and war continues, this could lead to further deficits of the budget. But the government is already taking measures to compensate that, for example, increases the resource extraction tax.
Overall, the proposal to decrease mandatory liquidity part from 10% to 7%, described by article, is kinda strange. Taking into account that it is already almost at 7%.
Even if the deficit only went negative at the end of the year, they're going to start 2023 with that same direction.
For me it looks as if he wants to spend newcoming money to the internal investments instead of buying foreign currency as reserves until it reaches 10% one more time. But if so, he has a very optimistic view about future fund earnings, in my opinion.
No I'm saying because of their budget deficit that the money they took out is to help prop up the ruble and government spending for most of the year.
Things were pretty much normal for Jan/Feb, then prices shot up after the invasion leading to huge energy revenues on the same volumes, then both prices and volumes began to decrease towards the end of the year as sanctions kicked in. So by December they'd blown all of the excess revenue from the entirety of 2022, and were in heavy deficit.
Yes, but if they had to pull that money out in December it means that they'd blown their entire once-off surplus for the year and were in deficit.
So I don't see any reasonable expectation that the drawdown in December was intended to cover the rest of 2023.
