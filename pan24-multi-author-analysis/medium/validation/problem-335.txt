I have a hunch that Wagner doesn't take "no" for an answer when recruiting prisoners. Also, it's prison and they were promised freedom so they wouldn't hear from their previous fellow inmates anyway.
I can't guarantee it's the case of Russia. But I've had friends go to prison in very secure countries.
True. But also their relatives get to see the same propaganda about how Igor The Child Eater came back as a free, reformed man and is now a war hero, so I'm not entirely sure what they know or "know".
And have you not seen all the news about Cheng Lei's family begging for her children to be allowed to send her letters?
They get no exposure to the outside world the whole time they're inside. Very few are allowed to get letters and visits are forbidden.
apparently a lot of well connected personnel are clogging up the navy and other foreign deployments like syria to avoid ukraine.
If Russian prisoners are anything like American prisoners they have more information than many people on the outside do. All they do is talk and listen in prison, and massive amounts of info from the outside comes through the doors everyday.
Your hunch is right, they have no choice. If you keep your mouth shut you might get a chance to escape. Create problems? Then you get.
