Closing it would open a can of worms. Then everyone would do the same. Turkey wont allow anyone through to the black sea but turkey vessels. Japan would not allow anyone go in between their two biggest islands. Etc. Etc.
Also i think thats also one reason why we wanted greenland. Would hold a lot of leverage over that passage then. Also congrats on having a border with technically Denmark.
Edit also if China is harsher on Canada that means they are basically admitting that they are afraid of the US.
Any attack on Canada would be met with the exact same force as an attack on US soil. There's no country on earth that the US would defend before Canada. No countries are as close & intertwined like US/Canada are.
It’s actually funny to think of Canadians and Americans having any sort of playful dispute when you consider that they’re probably the closest allies in the history of geopolitics.
My gut tells me it's China and that they're being so forthright because like, if they didn't, they'd look weak, but doesn't this seem... different than a balloon?
What if China had actual self-propelled drones in our airspace this whole time? Like, the Chinese equivalent of fucking predator drones.
How do we know that some of this isn't Russia? If a Russian craft came into our airspace it'd be through the same channels right?
