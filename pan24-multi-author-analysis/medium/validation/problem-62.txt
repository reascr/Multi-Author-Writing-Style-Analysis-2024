I have seen comment after comment in multiple threads and even CNN that can't help but compare these deaths to the US and take jabs at the Americans.
I do not think the families of these victims care what the US gun deaths are. I do not think the people who lost their mothers, fathers, daughters, sons care that the US has more murder than Canada, because their family member will not be at Christmas this year due to a Canadian.
Statistically, mass suicide also works, because nobody is alive to shoot at eachother once the coolaid is gone. There's a difference between things that can work and things that are worth doing.
There are so many guns being smuggled in illegally from the USA. An unfortunate side effect of being on the border with the gun violence capital of the world.
But the majority of measures are dishonest. And people are under the misconception that it’ll simply end gun violence for people that don’t have to worry about it.
Throughout the world, countries with strict guns laws have greatly reduced gun violence. The problem in this case is handguns (which are illegal in Canada) being smuggled into Canada. These and other guns can be purchased at open markets in some states without registering. There is more gun violence in the USA in a day than in a year in Canada so yes, gun laws do work. Will it stop all gun violence. Of course not, but watching children being slaughtered in the USA almost daily is sickening and the only ones winning are the NRA and the gun manufacturers who line the pockets of cowardly politicians.
