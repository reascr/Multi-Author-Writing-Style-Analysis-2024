Look at Iran today. Rioting in the streets, currency tanking, officials transferring wealth out of the country and standing on the verge of regime change,... The punishment may be closer than we think. At least we can hope this is the case.
r/NewIran is emerging into a real thing. I donâ€™t think Iran will ever be the same again. Too many people have become incredibly hostile towards the Mullahs.
The corrupt religious authorities have much to fear. They are surrounded by potential enemies wherever they go. Hopefully the youth - and broader population - can succeed in their efforts where others have failed.
I want to believe it can happen here. Iran once knew a far gentler reality, unlike some of those other dictatorial nations, and I want to believe there is a buried-but-living memory of those times.
Yeah, the modern dictatorships are too savvy now and too technologically adept. The new era of techno fascism is scariest shit. Monitoring tracking surveillance plus slick high level propaganda and control of the media will allow a near inescapable iron grip. We're heading for that inflection point China's probably already there.
