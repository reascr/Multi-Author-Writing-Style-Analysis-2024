>"Yep, the caucus that lost their minds over the suggestion that they should wear masks during a pandemic to respect the safety of others is now spending its time focusing on the fine details of what women have to wear (specifically how to cover their arms) to show respect here," tweeted Democratic Rep. Peter Merideth.
On one hand, many women are forced into it by a repressive society/governments, and it often feels like a symbol of that repression. There are, however, some who do feel like it is part of their culture. So to utilize it as a political stunt like that would be fairly insensitive to those who, for whatever reason they have, opt to wear it and don't feel oppressed in doing so.
I despise anyone being forced to conform like that, but I obviously would not judge someone who chose to wear it when they were not forced to do so through law or threat of violence.
It absolutely would make the GOP lose it, but they're disgusting hypocritical snakes and they would call out it being insensitive. Despite, you know, being bigoted as fuck to that region and its people/culture out the other side of their mouth.
Actually it’s the notion that I’m going alone. I hear all this shit like friends and family surrounded so and so and I’m like fuck! Goddamn I’m dying nobody’s coming with me. I’m just going to be happy until the inconvenience of death happens upon me. There’s nothing I cando.
