You don't sit down at the table as equals with delusional, violent conspiracy nuts and let them spew out their delusions like they are one side of a legitimate debate with sound arguments and good faith.
Election denial is a weaponized conspiracy to degrade democracy so that far right authoritarian movements can seize power and never give it up.
Many people and political leaders and propaganda media know its BS but still use it and push it as end game strategy of dismantling democracy in America.
"Election deniers" hold their asinine beliefs in spite of ALL evidence. The GOP tried to overthrow the election, not just via a coup attempt at the Capitol, but with a series of 60+ frivolous law suits, ALL of which were rejected by courts across the country due to total lack of merit. Trump's latest suit against HRC and dems was likewise dismissed and accompanied by a heavy bench slapping and the imposition of substantial financial penalties against Trump's lawyers for wasting the courts' time with their sham.
Reason does not work with these fascist morons, and they disdain and slander all sources of information other than corrupt, habitual liar GOP politicians and faux "news" outlets like Fox, Infowars, etc.
The ONLY appropriate response to the willful idiots on the right is disdain. They are trying to destroy American democracy via both fraudulent and violent means, and refuse to pull their heads out of the sand, as it were, despite numerous and ongoing attempts to explain why their "beliefs" are not only false, but incredibly dangerous and harmful.
