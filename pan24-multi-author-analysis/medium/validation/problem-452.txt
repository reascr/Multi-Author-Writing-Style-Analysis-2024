Horse shit. CEO s are not doing a 400% better job "increasing shareprice" than they were in the 90s, yet that's about how much their pay has increased. In fact, their pay doesn't fluctuate with their performance at all, illustrating the utter nonsense that your comment is. Their pay is clearly kickbacks to buddies, the board members pal around with the CEOs, and they will take as much as they can get away with. This can be regulated, as other countries do, by making and enforcing laws that prevent a CEO from making X times more than the lowest paid employees. Your twisted, disgusting, and thoroughly innacurate take is what prevents that from happening in America. Fuck that ignorant shit.
