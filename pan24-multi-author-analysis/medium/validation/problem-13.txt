Well, there's something to learn when relations start to deteriorate like this. (Aside from the motive, just to focus on the sanction itself. Maybe after this Brazil will rethink their dependency regarding the supplychain for key items(the context is unpleasant, but the opportunity to learn is still here). Everybody gotta be as self-sufficient as they can. Also, I don't understand the reasoning for that move by Germany. I think I understand what it is meant to signal, but not the reasoning itself. But it is what it is. Seems like they aren't gonna do business as usual to countries that don't send weapons to Ukraine. Rather harsh(especially form Brazil's perspective), but hey, at least it further motivates much needed discussions inside Brazil. So far I focused on the impact to brazilian industry(just a topic that interests me for a handful of years already), but some discussions are also being held regarding Brazil's position in the war up until now.
Didn't Dire Straits once approach a police officer and ask for help stating "we're in dire straits", but the police officer hadn't heard of them and thought they were actually in some sort of emergency?
