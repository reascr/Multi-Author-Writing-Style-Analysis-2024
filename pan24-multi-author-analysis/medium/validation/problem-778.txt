The US is perfectly capable of dealing with two fronts at once, as seen in WW2. The response to Russia is in many ways also a message to China, as well as a way to rally major industrialized democratic countries in its favor, not just against Russia, but against China. Of the three (US, China and Russia), the US has by far the best demographic dividends, and has the most advantages overall. Furthermore, Chinese foreign policy has not made a friend in India, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and even the Phillipines, hence of great benefit to the US. The US has the Chinese coast largely surrounded: the Chinese have only real long term security as of now in the interior of Eurasia. Even the Indian OCean is much less secure (via Myanmar and Pakistan), because the US is the dominant naval global power and India is right there in the region. The Chinese need Russia to control Central Asia, and China needs both to control the Eurasian interior. Turkey is also of great importance for this reason.
Xi literally promised Ukraine a nuclear umbrella, among a wide range of other security guarantees. Xi should have been sending weapons to Zelensky a year ago, if he had any honor.
