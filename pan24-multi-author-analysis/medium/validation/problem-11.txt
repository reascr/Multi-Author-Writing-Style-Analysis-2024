Nah, we just realized there are other things more important than top speed in a fighter. The F-22 can do 2.25, the F-35 can only do 1.6, the F/A-18 can do 1.8, the F-15 can do 2.5, but all of them would demolish Russian planes in actual combat.
That having been said, the F-15, F-16, and F-22 can all still do it, so it's not like it's a rare thing these days either. It's just not really a handicap in terms of actual combat effectiveness either that the F-35 and F/A-18 can't.
Mostly because we realized it's kinda pointless. It takes a lot of fuel and a long time to get to that speed, and in actual war, it's rarely useful. Nearly every fighter and interceptor in Vietnam was capable of Mach 2, and almost none of them ever spent much time even just over Mach 1.5.
I’m aware, but to say Mach 2 is kinda pathetic as if there are planes going faster just simply isn’t accurate.
I agree that bragging about the mig 31 isn’t that bug of a flex but there is people in here who clearly arnt aware that planes arnt just flying around at Mach 2.5 easily.
