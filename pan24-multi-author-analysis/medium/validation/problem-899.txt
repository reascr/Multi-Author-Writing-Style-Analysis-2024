I mean it sincerely because what I am seeing from other higher ranking Russian officials is that they believe Putin is too soft and Ukraine should be covered in nuclear blasts. Not that there shouldn't be a war.
If it was just "one person's delusion" then regardless of their perceived power there would be no war. It takes hundreds of thousand soldiers, millions people involved and a silent majority agreement to make it happen. Otherwise hundreds of different factors would block that attempt altogether.
Among normal population however and polls conducted we are still seeing a fairly high approval rates for this war (used to be higher but then mogilization has started). And these are fairly accurate polls (because yes, it is possible to get accurate results by asking the right questions even in oligarchies). Russians loved 2014 Crimea's invasion, it boosted Putin's popularity for years to come for instance.
Let's not deceive ourselves - this was approved by entire upper echelons of Russian government and had a huge support from the general populace. It's becoming a problem to some Russians now because instead of a quick victory it has turned into an uncertain conflict. But there were very few voices opposing it from the start.
“As long as it takes.” Just not what the Ukrainians need to push the moscovites out of their country.
