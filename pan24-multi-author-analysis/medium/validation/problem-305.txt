They’re kinda like a pilotless kamikazee plane with an explosive payload. They crash into stuff and explode rather than firing off missiles and returning to base to refuel and rearm.
Yeah that seems to be the TTP used in Ukraine. Israel has lots of technical knowledge in downing these Iranian drones in particular and they shared it with Ukraine. They also blew up an Iranian drone factory (I think it was in Syria but I’m not 100% sure). There are definitely some interesting fuck fuck games being played right now.
Expect to see more and more cheap piston or battery powered drones being used as short range cruise missiles in the future.
Really cheap cruise missile, basically. The main distinction between drones and cruise missiles is drones carry the payload, cruise missiles are the payload. Missiles and rockets are similar, but have their own distinctions.
I guess they won’t say kamakaze because it’s offensive or too Japanese? Instead, some editor failed to understand that the drone is not alive, therefore it cannot commit suicide, and that killing someone else is not called “suicide”.
