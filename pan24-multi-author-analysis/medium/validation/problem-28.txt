No. They were there to fight terrorists. But the dictatorship there is so far up Russias ass that itâ€™s kicking out western troops that were keeping the islamists down and replacing them with Wagner scum (who have done their share of atrocities there alongside the Mali army).
The withdrawal of the French had a destabilizing effect, but the situation on the ground won't change at all with a German and British retreat.
I think all the civilians that were protected by both German troops and the German airforce would disagree. Germany was there for peacekeeping not to wage an all out war.
They died in a helicopter crash. The only NATO contingent that was there to actually fight a war were the French, the rest went to great pains to keep their troops out of harms way. Saying they were on vacation is a bit crude, but I wouldn't actually call this a combat deployment for them.
And now Al Qaeda and ISIS are probably going to topple the government. So you can tell the guys running the military dictatorship there are just complete geniuses.
