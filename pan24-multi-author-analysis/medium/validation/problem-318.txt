Well it’s a waste of time because even the ‘good’ Americans just throw piles of excuses at each of these but here goes:
Please, in detail, with due consideration to all of the political and societal realities that granted, the US has brought upon herself - tell us how to fix this? Also, please tell us why all US Citizens should be tarred with the same brush?
7. Stop glorifying gangs and “freedoms” as if they aren’t the same thing - selfish actors that result in nothing but harm to those around them.
Realistically, it’s easy for you guys to say “we’re too far gone” - that’s been your argument since like the 1900s. Other countries have your legality on firearms but they have a disciplined population who don’t need to be treat like children to avoid mass shootings.
I’m not aiming this at you specifically, but damn, the amount of times I’ve had talks with Americans post-school shooting and it’s the same shit everytime.
If you want FREEDOM, start acting like it actually comes with a price and maybe your children won’t be the acceptable cost of rednecks shooting beer bottles.
