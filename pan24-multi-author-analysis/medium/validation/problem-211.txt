Consider this, somebody has to build the shit in the gulf region, clearly the citizens aren’t going to do it because they are all rich as fuck. Yes the country is extremely unbearably hot, but what are they going to do to control that, it’s the climate of the area. The deaths reported are not all correlated to building the stadiums, they are the overall deaths of migrants in the country. It isn’t slavery, the people choose to go to Qatar and make a significant amount more than they would back home to send money to their families. The west closes borders to these people and doesn’t allow them to live there. The west also cannot act like everything we own and use on a regular basis was not created from extremely cheap labour in some of the very same countries that the migrants in the gulf are from. Qatar is also objectively better than most western countries in a lot of ways. It is immeasurably safer, extremely lower divorce rates, the streets are clean and the population is wealthy, on top of that they have zero taxes imposed on anyone making money in their country. It’s also hypocritical to say that Qatar has to respect our western liberal culture but we won’t respect their Islamic culture, which plays a big part in the prosperity of the country. The west really does not have moral superiority of Qatar, and once again that is ethnocentrism at its best, to judge a country based on our worldviews and not respect their own worldviews.
