The EPA has released a draft of its annual inventory, which found that US greenhouse gas emissions rose 5.5 percent in 2021 from the previous year, an all-time year-over-year spike, though they were still below 2019 levels. The report found that the increase was largely driven by increased auto emissions as driving rebounded in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fossil fuel combustion-related emissions increased 7 percent relative to the year before, while emissions from coal consumption rose 14.6 percent. In 2021, methane emissions comprised 11.5 percent of emissions, and have declined 16.3 percent since 1990. Electric power demand also increased 2.1 percent from 2020 to 2021, for an overall emissions increase of 7.1 percent.
