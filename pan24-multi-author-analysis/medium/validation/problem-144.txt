Poachers in the sanctuary are clearly heavily armed dangerous people. They do need to be dealt with as such. However, the problem of poaching is not going to resolve by killing them. It will reduce rhino deaths, but also escalates violence and puts even more people at risk, because ultimately the poachers aren't doing it because they want to kill rhinos or because they don't fear the consequences, they're doing it because it is extremely lucrative in a place where making that kind of money can be otherwise impossible. The problem of poaching will only be resolved by not making people so desperate that they feel like the risks of poaching (or the risk of joining gangs that will fund themselves with poaching, which is ultimately a similar problem) are worth the rewards.
I don't know the situation but from the same article, locals living near the park are getting caught in the effort. I would imagine not everyone is aware of the defined borders of the park and people may be getting shot for simply being in the wrong area.
