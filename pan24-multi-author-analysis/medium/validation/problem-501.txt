I think this is news because we didn’t use a spinning death blade drone to kill them and instead caught them alive? Weird how it doesn’t specify if they were high ranking or of some importance value vs “regular” militants.
Obviously it was primarily the fight against ISIS. ISIS started making huge gains and in Iraq and Syria and was engaged in massacres. Massacring yazidis, shia, Christians any non Sunni, not to mention enslaving women and children.
A coalition of dozens of nations were providing military aid and support in Syria and direct attacks on ISIS. Not just the US but the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, Bahrain, Jordan,Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and numerous other nations.
There was and is ongoing the Syrian civil war so many of these countries were also supporting rebel Syrian Democratic forces and Kurdish forces against the Assad regime and ISIS.
So that is why the US and many nations were and are there: to fight ISIS and support the Syrian rebels.
I don't know if you just forgot that or don't pay attention but it was a widely supported intervention.
Lazy comment. Have you been paying attention the last decade plus? Or you could go to Wikipedia and read a history of what has happened in Syria.
I'm well aware of the history thanks. I've never stopped calling out the need for US to be there. I do understand that it's not really so much about ISIS but to prevent the sphere of Iranian influence in the region. It's well documented.
When all Asad used International Prohibited weapons, where were the US and the rest of the world? I can tell you. They were searching for oil. When we almost took down the Alasad regime and then Russia started having direct involvement in the war, where was the savor US? I can tell you, they were searching for oil.
I guess my point wasn't clear enough. They are searching to fish in the muddy swamp called Syria. Oil here is just a reference to the benefits each side is seeking.
Syria had a very small oil industry and it's controlled by the Syrian (Assad regime) government. How the hell was fighting ISIS in Syria an oil defense mission?
I get it but seriously, what if any other country tried to pull that. Like Russia going into a foreign country to protect the oil reserves.
That said most Americans have no comprehension how much suffering their troops have caused around the world. No justifiable reason for the Iraq invasion. Barely any justification for Afghanistan.
But people that go there and kill the innocent become war heroes. Just wondering why America gets away with literal murder and Americans in general don't have critical reasoning skills to work out it's not good and sometimes their the baddies.
Sorry, I got a little heated up but I really can't stand people painting a positive view towards those political monsters that left hundreds of thousands of innocent people to die just like that for their political agendas. Especially when I myself, lost some people I know.
As far as I know these countries don't have US Embassies: Afghanistan, Bhutan, Iran, Maldives, Syria and Yemen.
