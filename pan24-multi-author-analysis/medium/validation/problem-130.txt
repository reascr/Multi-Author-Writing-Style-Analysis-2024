EDIT: That’s all the time we have for today We’ll continue to scan this thread periodically for more questions to answer when we’re available. Thanks again to the sub and its mods for joining us for another fun session. Till next time - Angel (Washinon Post Reddit guy).
From Rhonda: We'll be on starting at 7pm, Dec. 6 to watch the election results come in. You can find our show streaming on , The Washinon Post's YouTube channel and Twitch.
Hi r/politics! I’m Washinon Post Senior Politics Correspondent Rhonda Colvin. I’m here to recap what happened on Election Day, break down the important takeaways from this year’s midterms, and look ahead to Georgia’s Dec. 6th Senate runoff.
My reporting focus is on Congress and you’ll often find me reporting on-air from the hill for our live shows. During the midterms, I followed most of the key congressional races throughout this cycle and specifically reported on the impact nonpartisan voters are having on our electorate. More about my work:
I live in Georgia and feel the runoffs are gonna be closer than they should be. How do you reach Republican voters that are voting for Walker despite all of his issues? I know several people that are voting for Walker simply because he’s a Republican, even though they can’t stand him. They think Warnock is automatically worse than Walker simply because he’s a Democrat.
Also, given that this race could give Democrats an edge in the Senate, GOP Georgia voters may be more energized about making sure that doesn’t happen and that’s a big driver too.
Nice to hear from a Georgia resident! Yes, this is shaping up to be a SO close - if current polling is accurate. I don’t have any suggestions on how to message to voters, but midterm races usually draw voters who are party loyalists. Those are the folks who turnout. That could be part of the reason why republican voters are supporting a candidate who is not traditional.
Yes, but you've told us that what you hear directly from voters is far more informative than "current polling"!
What is the back-back-back story of Walker getting into the race? He is so obviously inappropriate for the position, yet he has had enough support to give him a real possibility of getting into the Senate? How can voters equate a football star with the intellectual acuity necessary for a position in Congress? What does it say about Georgia voters in general that someone so inadequate can be elected?
Nice question, the quick answer is you go into the interview with your facts ready as much as possible! This has always been an issue for most reporters covering all sorts of topics. The best way I’ve learned to combat it is to re-ask questions, point out the facts and sometimes ask them to share where the info that doesn’t seem quite right is coming from. I think most political reporters (especially those of us on-air) are aware that spin almost always happens, so be ready.
Honestly, the polling in this midterm cycle fascinated me months ago. There were trends in places like Washinon state and Iowa where senators deemed “safe” were seeing mixed polling of being far ahead and then being down significantly.
One thing that I kept thinking about on election night when the red wave didn’t happen, is a conversation I had with a political scientist who pointed out that polling might be off and continue to be off, simply because some polls haven’t caught up to the reality of how we live. Many people don’t answer landlines, making the pool of respondents far smaller and less diverse, so you might not get a good gauge of voter sentiment. On top of that, there is also a phenomenon some have mused that you may have people say they will vote for Candidate XYZ when asked over the phone by a stranger, but that may not be the reality when they actually get to the ballot box.
The bottom line for me as a journalist has always been that polls can be a tool to keep in the back of your mind, but go talk to voters and listen to what they are telling you.
So anecdotal "evidence" trumps carefully engineered polling? That's a dodgy preference, and you should do a little reflection on that. . "The bottom line for me as a journalist has always been that polls can be a tool to keep in the back of your mind, but go talk to voters and listen to what they are telling you.".
Unfortunately, yes, I’d say we are all more aware of this type of violence than when I started my career. It’s something you do keep in your mind when on certain assignments. It’s also really important these days for many reporters to seek training on how to handle it.
It appears he has property in Georgia and Texas, that’s what we know. We also know he has said he lives in Texas publicly, in speeches and campaign events. I’m interested in hearing what Georgia voters tell us about how much of a concern this is. For instance, we saw in the PA senate race that some voters there said they were troubled that Dr. Oz Mehmet who had a house in NJ, wasn’t a real resident. Historically, other candidates have had to answer for similar multi-residency issues. I’ll also point out an interesting constitutional tidbit- you must live in the state you are representing at the time of your election. Not necessarily while running for senate election. So I’m not sure his TX homeownership disqualifies him, but this is a story I’m following.
On one hand, some Georgia GOP voters have said they like Walker because they know him from his football days, they think he’d be a fresh face in the Senate. People often like political outsiders who don't have conventional experience. But - there is indication that republicans in Georgia don’t want to see another seat go to dems and that is likely a significant part of his support base too.
Georgia voters keep showing they aren’t tired yet! The latest numbers from the first days of early voting over the weekend broke state records for turnout.
Great q. I do think there has been a proven purple trend in Georgia because we’ve seen it for a few cycles now and doesn’t appear like a fluke. A big part of the trend is that Georgia has experienced a population growth of younger and more diverse groups, due to metro areas like Atlanta being attractive places to live.
More diversity and youth in your pool of voters makes things more competitive during election time. Younger people are also less inclined to be party loyalists. I point out this trend in a recent story a few weeks ago.
This isn’t to say the purple will last forever in Georgia, but it is a phenomenoon has kept us on our toes over the last few years.
I think this might be a particular race where we don’t see the election denialism narrative as much. Walker has said he’d accept the results of the election and he doesn’t seem to be running on re-litigating 2020 like others have.
I think with many of the more vocal election deniers losing their races earlier this month, republicans might not want to make that a central theme in this runoff. But, of course, that narrative is still out there.
From Rhonda: That’s a whole other department But I understand your frustration, but it might be above my pay grade.
From Angel (Reddit social editor for The Post): I can totally understand the frustration. Feel free to DM us about this - I'm always interested in ways to improve reader experience, especially on this platform, which is my full-time job (yes, really!).
