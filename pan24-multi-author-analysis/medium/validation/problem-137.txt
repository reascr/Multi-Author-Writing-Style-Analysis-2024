More than 100 human rights groups support the resolution and Sanders has vowed to bring the resolution to a vote again as soon as possible.

Biden doesn't write legislation but he sure influences what goes on that floor and how people vote for it and don't you forget it.
On Tuesday night, Senator Bernie Sanders withdrew a measure to end U.S. support for the Yemen-Saudi Arabia conflict. President Biden stepped in, reportedly vowing to veto the measure if it passed.

Never trust when someone gives you that lame line about Biden's inability to influence legislation or policy because it's absolute bunk.
