When authoritarian politicians use the religious extremists to gain power and further their goals, your country is not really a democracy anymore. Netanyahu has ensured that the future of Israel is not as a global leader in justice, equal rights, or democracy.
The problem with religious ideologies is they judge the success of an action on results in the next life, not the real world. So arguments like "your policies will sink the economy" or "your policy will get as all killed" don't impact religious fanatics in the same way they do secular politicians.
The far-right religious extemists in Israel have different motivations that are based on the here and now (even if they're wrong).
Kasher wrote that “the image of the Jewish people — familiar to us from our childhood, from the education we received, from the life we ​​knew, from the stories we heard, is not the current image. Before us are two mutations of the Jewish people.
A Jewish people with “this face” is “not my Jewish people,” wrote Kasher, and “not the Jewish people among which I wish to be counted as a son.”.
“The ultra-Orthodox mutation is a transition from the exiled way of life of the minority that has lived its own life, maintained its way of life and doesn’t provoke foreign rulers, to the new way of life of the minority that lives at the expense of others, an economic parasite, a draft dodger, absolves itself of civilian responsibility and has no real respect for the democratic regime and its principles,” said Kasher, who is a professor emeritus at Tel Aviv University and a recipient of the Israel Prize.
“The nationalist mutation is a transition from the religious way of life where there is adherence to the principles of justice and fairness, honesty and compassion; [a life] that reveres God but with humane conduct, to an unruly, wicked way of life that [primarily] sanctifies the land and controls its inhabitants with violence, using methods that have no justice, no compassion, no morals and, has more than anything else, a idol-like worship of the land, the nation and its corrupt leadership.”.
