It's actually a grill - I was there in 2008; the place was uh, in need of maintenance, and the construction was cheap, with nice materials being used in the places that are most visible, but the rest is 3rd rate at best. BTW, I paid $60 for 2 turkey sandwiches (on plain white bread), 2 bags of potato chips, 2 cups of Coke, and 2 cups of a single scoop of ice cream each - and it was all so horrible we threw it away. The turkey was old and already bad (like, you'd be on the toilet all night long if you are it), the chips were old and stale (even the oil on them was rancid), the Coke was completely flat (very little carbonation), and the ice cream was old and freezer- burned (it tasted like a dirty freezer). I wanted to bring it all back for a refund, but the person I was with thought it would make a scene, so we left and got lunch at a diner nearby. It was perfectly clear to us then that Trump was a big bullshitter and grifter; we were pretty angry about the building and experience itself as it turned out to be a complete waste of time and money.
The Chinese language press has long reported this is the account he used to accept bribe and extortion money from Chinese firm he threatened with the "Hwawei Treatment".
