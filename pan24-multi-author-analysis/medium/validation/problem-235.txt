I’m not denying that he or Republicans still have a chance in 2024, but the deck is stacked against them. Voters need to show up, but the math does not favor them right now. Still a lot of time between now and the general, don’t get me wrong. But I think we need to at least stop the “DeSantis is gonna wipe the floor with Democrats” bullshit, because it’s straight up bullshit. Republicans were supposed to obliterate Democrats in the 2022 midterms, and look where we’re at now.
