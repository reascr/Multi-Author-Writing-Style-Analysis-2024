For those that didn't read the article: Poland is accusing Putin of spreading specific lie. A lie that Poland wants to annex part of Ukraine so Poland can be once again from Baltic sea to Black sea.
Russia is full of lies and propaganda. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. Issue is that Russia is trying to put a wedge between Poland and Ukraine by presenting Poland as land grabbing warmongering nation.
If no one ever calls him out on it, his disinformation becomes the de facto information. That's essentially how propaganda works. Since propaganda can now be easily disseminated on a global scale, it's helpful for as many countries as possible to fight back against it.
For some reason, that reminded me of China; they spread disinformation all day every day because they use trade deals as hostages so every country had to shut up, never calling them out.
God at least it’s not another article of “Russia says…” even if it is about what Russia said lol. Russia needs to stop talking unless it’s about surrender.
