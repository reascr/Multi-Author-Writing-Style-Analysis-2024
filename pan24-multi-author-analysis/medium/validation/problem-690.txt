Vietnamese here, his family was in extreme poverty and he weighed supposedly only 22kg at 10 years old. He was collecting scrap metal to pay for his martial arts class when he fell down inside a 25cm concrete pillar.
I suspect the boy died very early on because its a 35 meter fall and it would only took about a few minute to suffocate.
not really sure from what op and below article says but my 2 cents on the fact that when you breathe out, chest decompress, might slip further down -> even harder to breathe in because not enough space for chest expansion -> suffocation. Maybe even panic can speed it up.
I don’t know if it’s better or worse it took so long to get to him before he died. A lot of the inflammatory events could have been adverted had the area been cleared of gawkers and idiots could work together instead of trying to proclaim they were going to be the genius to free him. I just feel so awful for his brother and friend desperately trying to get him out while rescue workers played strategist from a safe distance. The absolute disrespect his body was treated with afterwards is appalling as well.
