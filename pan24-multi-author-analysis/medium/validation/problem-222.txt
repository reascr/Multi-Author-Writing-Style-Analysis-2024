Regarding Pearl Harbor, I'm personally a fan of how Bill Wurtz puts it in History of Japan. "Japan spits on the US and declares war, the United States accepts \[....\], but they're curious to see how it works, so they drop it on Japan \boooom\ they actually drop 2 \boooom\.....\[respectful/horrific silence\]..... \white flag\". I think that any nation should reserve the right to honor the good in their past, and mourn the unprovoked or nation-protecting fallen. But definitely holy fuck do the Japanese have way more right to mourn the outcome of the nukes than the US has the right to mourn the mostly unprovoked Pearl Harbor attack's casualties. Really is comparing a molehill (albeit \less\ provoked) to a mountain (that was redundant and unnecessary). Both were unnecessary. I think it's fair for both to be mourned. I think history is something that we should learn from, and respect it as a teacher and as the origin of what we can be thankful for in our current lives, but that we need to move on from it.
For every person that read 1984 and said “ that can’t ever because of X” there was another who said “the only real problem I’d need to get over is X”.
Some really saw that book as a guideline instead of a warning. So much so, the world appears to try relentless to become some real world satire version of itself.
