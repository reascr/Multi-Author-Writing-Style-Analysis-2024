Hope people are okay. Turkey, Syria, Japan, now Papua New Guinea. Hearing about all of these earthquakes is quite worrisome being here in Vancouver and waiting for the big one..
Edit-and of course fuckall in this state is actually built to withstand earthquakes like they do out in Cali or something.
It wasn't the worst. By magnitude, the top 8 are all up in Alaska. Two of those, plus two more in California that were close in magnitude, had higher death tolls than the New Madrid ones. That said, another Missouri EQ of similar strenh could absolutely become the deadliest if it hit the right place - and regardless of fatalities the devastation would be tremendous. Scary shit considering you guys are nowhere near a fault line!
I am in Missouri. not a lot of people know we actually had the worst earthquake in recorded American history right here. and we are overdue.
Wait isn't it still the most powerful in the continuous united states? that could be what im thinking about?
Uh no? we're paying (more) attention to turkey and Syria because they were devastated. Fear sells and all that but this isnt pure amygdala. They legitimately needed massive outside support.
