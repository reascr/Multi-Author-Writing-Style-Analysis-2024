Four police officers were initially shot at while visiting the property at Wieambilla, about 300km west of Brisbane [Australia], in relation to a reported missing person on Monday afternoon.
Two of the officers, aged in their 20s, died at the scene and a third person, believed to be an innocent neighbour, was also killed.
A third male officer suffered a bullet graze and was taken to hospital, and a fourth female officer, who joined the police force only nine weeks ago, managed to escape.
Police confirmed about 2am local time that a further two men and a woman had later been killed in a confrontation with more officers shortly after 10.30pm.
The initial scene that confronted the four police officers was likened to an ambush, sources told the Brisbane Times, with some reports suggesting the offenders were heavily armed and possibly wearing camouflage.
Queensland Police Union president Ian Leavers said the two officers killed had been "executed" and it was "a miracle" the other two had survived.".
I wanna know why no one seems to be asking why? What was the motive ? How did they know police were coming ? What possesses 3 people to commit such an act? Australia is no America this kind of doesnâ€™t happen here.
I agree with you there .... but what we don't really know is that all three people were actively the police killers. Equally possible that only one person was a nut case and had the other two hostage ... and I am pretty sure we will never know.
