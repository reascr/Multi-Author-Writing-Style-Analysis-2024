It's harsh, but he's not wrong. Russian athletes, whether willingly or not, propogate russian culture globally. Banning their athletes serves only to increase pressure on the russian leadership and bring home the consequences of its military action in Ukraine.
He had Russian teammates in the past. Who he won championships with. I dont think he means to offend.... but like you said...more pressure is needed.
Also Russian hockey players in the NHL... pretty much all of them have remained tight lipped. Instead of speaking out/calling out against Russian aggression/Putin.
What about the Russian protestors who are trying to stop the aggression? Or hundreds of innocent of Ukraine people and/or Russian soldiers who didnt sign up for war and are suffering or dead?
Also we dont know if these players actually have any immediate family left behind. Most have homes or 2nd homes in North America/Europe. I doubt they will go back to Russia anytime soon. If they have relatives, like a cousin living in Russia... I doubt they will be touched/due to a protestor from overseas.
There are consequences for them talking out. It's not like I want them put in a dangerous spot or anything. But Russia should not have normalised international relations after invading Ukraine. They should be isolated.
