Carlin's point with this story was that, if you force your men to do horrific things to the enemy and local populace, they will hate you forever, and will do the same to you if not worse if you were ever overcome by them. While I think it's definitely a scare tactic to perpetrate these horrific acts against the Iranian people, it might also be that the regime is trying to force their own enforcers into a situation where they must fight to maintain power to the bitter end. That way, those in charge either keep power, or can at least buy themselves enough time to escape.
I'm so on the fence about it. I loved CK3 and love strategy games, but everything before CK3 was a little too much; and trust me, I tried to learn CK2, HOI4, Vic2, Stellaris.
None of my friends play Vic3 and I don't trust steam reviews anymore. Would you be willing to give me your thoughts?
Its so crazy to me that their government/leaders/police are so willing to just murder. Hopefully they are able to make change but id imagine it wont happen any time soon and with more bloodshed. Sad world we live in.
