I work in hazardous spill clean up. I am the foreman and have to make sure my guys dont poison the fuck out of themself. We have a few smokers. Now I knew that benzene was in cigs butt how much I dont know.
Benzene is very bad if its too much. Cancer loving product. We have the rule not more than 0,2 ppm benzene in the air is the safe line. Better know for every million air particles. Only 0,2 of them are allowed to be benzene.
We had a gig where the guys were concerned about the high amount of benzene in the ground 1.2 at the absolutle source.
Durinf the break they went on a smoke and I was curious so I got our detector and held it above the cig. 4.4 in 3 seconds. If they inhaled a smoke and exhaled also a nice number.
As a smoker, what I care most about is the effect on my mood and my effect on other people. I've accepted long-term health concerns. I'd rather have thirty years as a chill guy than seventy as a stressed out arsehole.
The presence of lead throws this right out the window. Numerous studies link elevated bone or blood lead levels with aggression, destructive and delinquent behavior, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and criminal behavior [Wright et al. 2008; Braun et al. 2006; Needleman et al. 2004; Needleman et al. 2002; Nevin 2000; Bellinger et al. 1994].
