The first instance of this proved to be Kremlin-orchestrated. To irritate Turkey (which it did) in order to influence Erdogan on Sweden's acceptance into NATO (which it did).
I think it's very unlikely that Chang Frick paid Paludan's permit it to further a Russian agenda, and I'm saying this as a person who very much dislikes him, his politics and pretty much everything he does. He's just anti-Muslim and anti-Turkey, and possibly racist.
Chang Frick has indeed had ties with Russia and been pro-Russia in the past, but he has been critical of Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and he's is currently supporting Ukraine, at least publicly.
Does Reddit upvote anything and everything that claims "Anything bad in the West is a 4D Chess Move orchestrated by Russia"? Dozens of people upvoted this, wtf.
Afaik, Chang suggested that Paludan burned a Turkish flag, not a quran. The quran was Paludan's idea, and that's what he's been doing for years. At least from all I've heard from him when he was active here in Denmark, I'm pretty sure he would've done what he did at some point either way. At most, Chang nudged him to protest it at the right place and time.
This dude has been vocal and actively against Muslims since 2016. He and his "Stram Kurs" folks have done this for years, have travelled around Europe doing the same crap everywhere but it somehow magically didnâ€™t happen(???) because, according to op, the "first instance" had something to do with Sweden wanting to join NATO and and Putin not wanting that.
I think the person claiming something about the first instance of this having anything to do with Sweden getting into NATO is completely out of their mind simply because the first instance of this was years before there was any talk at all about this.
Although Erdogan absolutely knows what this is; he's just gambling on bringing pressure to bear on Sweden in order to get them to extradite Kurdish separatists who were given asylum.
