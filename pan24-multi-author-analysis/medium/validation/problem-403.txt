Let me help out this 'newspaperadditional' person, all of Chinese tech from their tanks to their fighter aircraft came from training PLA engineers to copy and replicate the Russian military tech. The nuclear warheads China has developed and built were designed and taught by Russian-z nuclear engineers. The first carrier ship that china has was a repurposed old Russian naval carrier given the PLA for them to retrofit. When both the Russia-z empire and the Chinese CCP led their PRC when it came to famine and food destabilization both shared and traded hard resources in oil, coal, and fuel, for food supplies to help Chinese citizens survive famines over the past 60 years. in the past 30 years, the Russian-z empire and China in 2006, in 2020, 2016 and now 2020, about 3 years back and even the past 20 years have conducted joint ground military operations together to simulate larger warfare joint military maneuvers for eventual warfare..... the CCP lead PRC has their PLA naval forces run joint naval exercises. They are and have been close allies for the past 60+ years .............
The ANC is corrupt as fuck and canâ€™t get less corrupt due to everybody in the power structure needing to put their hands in the cookie jar.
