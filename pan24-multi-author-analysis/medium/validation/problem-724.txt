Ofc he isn't. He isn't Europe's last dictator for nothing. Well... Hungary but yeah... but if you go back 20y ago, Luka was playing both sides MUCH more. He was very wishy washy between the EU and Russia. Its just, he's running out of bargaining chips and he's chosen his side for good now - not that the EU would have accepted his election results anyway...
Well he’s savvy enough to remain in power this long. It’s easy to dismiss these autocrats as being pantomime bad guys who needn’t be taken seriously, like Gaddafi for example, but if you look at how well they were able to read a room politically in order to get power it’s impressive. Like, at the end of the day, _they ARE running nations_. I don’t know about Lukashenko, but he would have had to know who were his rivals and enemies, what they wanted, how he could buy their support, and how to maintain leadership for decades. You’d have to be able to do that and know how to continually monitor the politics of your political rivals and society otherwise you’d never get a decent nights sleep for fear of being assassinated.
The protests in 2020 weren't "shut down" with "support", they were systematically exterminated with dozens if not hundreds of key leaders "disappearing" through russian death-squads. There's a reason one protest-leader was found "suicided" by hanging in a fucking German public park.
Maybe its a language issue but support makes sense here, and does not propose a dichotomy or anything. If I want to kick a puppy and I ask a renowned puppy kicker to help, they supported my puppy kicking.
