â€¢ Drive outrage and crocodile tears on social media to grow support for Palestinian cause <--- You are here.
If you went and built a 'school' in the US on public land without permission, wouldn't it get torn down?
But doesn't every sovereign nation has rules and regulations concerning building, zoning, and demolition of structures?
Sure, it is extremely difficult to get permits, but it is everywhere so. You need to own the land. You need to be able to prove ownership. You need to pay taxes on it. You even need to conform to some rules (sometimes, the structure color is defined for you, sometimes even the vegetation in your garden is regulated!), submit plans, wait, resubmit etc etc...
Why does a village in Palestine need permission from Israel, a different country, to build stuff. and why is Israel enforcing its permits in a foreign country?
Imagine building a town in Texas, Mexico says it did not allow for it, then demolishes it, and the international response is, well, did you ask Mexico?
I'm honestly okay with things that help with Israeli security, but this is a situation where it would be helpful to speak out of both sides of our collective mouths.
I honestly think pushing BDS will help Israeli long-term security much faster than our current modus operandi.
