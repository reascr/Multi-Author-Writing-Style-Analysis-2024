Ms. Petri is writing this as though she's a member of the Republican party, talking to Republican voters. Her satire has caught me more than once getting angry before realizing what she was really poking fun at.
>Honestly, we are a little confused you are taking this so poorly. This is like electing a bunch of clowns to office and being disappointed when they put on a magnificent clown show for you. Here is precisely the clown show you ordered! You shouldn’t be ashamed. You should be applauding. It is like ordering a decorative salad made entirely from Legos and being mad that you can’t eat it. It is like voting for Lauren Boebert and then becoming upset that a legislature that contains her is not productively working for the American people.
This seems like one of the better outcomes of a GOP majority. What’s the hurry to get a speaker in place? WTF is a GOP speaker going to even do?? They may as well just embarrass themselves for as long as possible while nothing gets done because the alternative is endless Hunter-Ghazi hearings and also nothing getting done.
Literally no other nation in the world has the meaningful capability to attack the USA in a way that matters. It is not a thing you need to worry about.
Either way nothing gets done. Fuck em. Let them vote for another 2 years. I like hearing Al Greene from Texas be a weirdo.
