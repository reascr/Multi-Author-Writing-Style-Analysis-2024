Unfortunately, due to us not being like the CCP, we can't go kicking in doors and shoving people into unmarked vans whenever we feel like it, need to build a case and pass it to the courts for a warrent and what not. That being said, they can make life difficult for them via these disruptions while they build said case so that it inhibits their operations, kinda the best we got until all is ready to go.
Nearly everything about them is hearsay and rumour, which doesn't stand up well in court. Without clear cases of them breaking Canadian law, there isn't really much that can be done right now other than revoking visas and applying diplomatic pressure to China, and making it difficult to operate.
Yes you can if they are unregistered foreign agents on your soil. You can kill them if you wanted to if they have no diplomatic cover. Spy’s have no protection outside of diplomatic cover. They aren’t uniformed military personnel neither so no Geneva convention protections. Issue is they will arrest and kill random Canadians in China claiming they were non cover agents too.
The main issue is the media has painted it as a clear picture though oversimplification and hearsay, but from a legal and diplomatic standpoint it's actually not very clear at all, which is why we can't just march in and shut them down.
