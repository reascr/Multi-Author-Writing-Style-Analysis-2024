I think the issue is that most of the migrant workers know the conditions (or ability to even find work) in their home country is the same/worse than staying in Qatar. That is why the moved to Qatar in the first place.
The problem with Qatar is that it is a rich country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world and wanted to host the World Cup to show the rest of the world that it has achieved equality with all the industrialized nations. But at the same time, it’s labor laws/regulations are about 50-100 years behind those countries it wants to be equals with.
It's not about that. There is huge financial and familial pressure in South Asia to provide for your family. People will die rather than humiliate themselves by not being able to care for family.
idk, just look at the US or Canada they also treat migrant workers like shit. the US uses illegal Mexican labour which is basically slave wages.
it's a double standard where people overlook their own countries human rights abuses while shining a light onto others.
I mean just look at drugs and how it's treated like a criminal issue and how people are forced into treatment. it's really no different than persecuting lgbtq peoples just for existing yet people in the west will downplay their discrimination because "reasons".
As for drugs, it is the same issue but we can at least vote to change our policies at the local and national level and change is happening right now because any individual can be a catalyst for real change in America, even if it doesn’t happen right away. Meanwhile, in Qatar even just possessing drugs will put you in jail for a long time while in US only selling drugs will put you in jail for most time. As for sending people to rehab, that is better than jail and a system Qatar also doesn’t have.
No question the US has issues. However, we have come a long way thanks to the activism of people like Cesar Chavez and also have actual institutions like the National Labor Relations Board, the National Labor Relations Act, OSHA, and an independent judicial system where even illegal immigrants can sue employers which Qatar and other gulf counties don’t have yet.
