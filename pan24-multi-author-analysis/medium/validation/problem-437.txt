Lol first was Transnistria (1992), then South Ossetia and Abkhazia (2008), then Crimea (2014) tbh. Russia has been in violation of that for years before Ukraine.
They are in violation of the UN Charter which they signed in 1991. It specifically requires ALL nations to never seize and annex territory by force of arms. First Crimea and now the Eastern Provinces of Ukraine, meanwhile bombing clearly civilian targets in Central and Western Ukraine. The UN General Assembly should expell Russia completely, not just from the Security Council, after all the USSR was one of the permanent members not Russia. Russia wasn't even a separate entity of the UN until 1991, whereas Ukraine SSR was a founding charter member of the UN and merely changed its name to Ukraine without the SSR moniker.
Russia is clearly the external aggressor seizing territory and annexing it permanently from Ukraine which is clearly forbidden by the UN Charter.
I don't think they should be expelled because what other mechanism exists to exert pressure on Russia?
Sanctions do fuck all and diplomacy is barely effective. Put them in the back of the UN and make them watch being dunked on or something.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
What are you smoking to transport you to the land where Cuba folded and where north Korea collapsed? Where have they worked? They just fuck up poor people. Not change governments.
Actually in removal of Russia from the Security Council Russia doesn't get a veto vote in the UNSC. If Russia keeps threatening first use of Nuclear weapons, even tactical weapons, they will be removed from the UNSC.
