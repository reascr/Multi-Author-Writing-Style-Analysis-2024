Plus he's always been a gaffe machine on two legs. I mean, he's not the only one on the Olympic Committee who made boneheaded statements and was sacked for it, but still, his idiocy was pretty memorable.
Dudes not wrong, i don't support what russia is doing.. But there's no version of this where russia decides to lose.
What else is there to say apart from point to the prideful maniac in charge of the russians and wait for ppl to make the observation that I've already pointed out.
Putin remembers all too well the consequences of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, which demonstrated that the Soviet machine was not invincible even when trying to subjugate a country next to then. Within years, the Soviet Union fell. Granted, there were other factors, but the Russian people do not reward the leaders who fail them.
Or Nikita Khrushchev and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Only 2 years later, after a very public embarrassment and US victory, was he forced to step down.
What is likely to happen is that Russian losses will become so bad and embarrassing that Putin will find a scapegoat and declare it was some other thing that caused them to fail. Traitors, incompetent generals, western spies.
I believe at the very end, even if Russia uses nuclear weapons, they will have to admit having weak, incompetent and corrupt government and military. In that case, they will be occupied by some power to ensure they behave.
He will find some way to gracefully bow out, maybe due to health concerns, and retreat to his ultra-mansion and run the show from behind the scenes.
Or Putin can continue the war which has only had the effect of strenhening NATO, bolstering US power on the world stage, and evaporating their already meager operational military. To say nothing about achieving zero military goals in Ukraine after nearly a year.
I know Japan is ruled by people who should've retired decades ago - hence most of its problems - but in his case it's especially ridiculous he has any sort of influence still.
I do not understand why anyone's still giving him the time of day... he's 85 He was barely coherent 20 years ago Just oust the fucker!
