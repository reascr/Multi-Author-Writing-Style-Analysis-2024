Russia cheats on a national, countrywide level. The Russian gov't helps the athletes cheat and they still get to play.
100% agree. I'm also boycotting the Olympics. The rest of the world shouldn't be participating in the billionaire's wank party anyways.
Meanwhile Russia is so fundamentally ingrained into the filth of the IOC that they still get to compete EVEN when they're banned for doping. "Well you guys can play, you just can't wear your country colours".
Yeah. I get the point of coming together, you're right to bring it up, but I can't get over how unjust it would be given the ongoing genocide. Ignoring national politics is itself a policy, there's no escaping politics. Maybe try something different than Munich?
Yes, the person made a point. I don't want to dismiss it completely but imagine we never make changes because things were not as good in the past. We'd never make progress. Eventually we improve by saying allowing China was bad, and we're going to ban them in the future if the UN GA or HRC makes a resolution that they ignore, for example. The way UN GA made a resolution that Russia should de-occupy Ukraine, as another practical example I'm aware of.
You're right that it shouldn't fall on the IOC to make judgement calls but they could subscribe to organizations who are well equipped to make judgements like UN GA and HRC...
