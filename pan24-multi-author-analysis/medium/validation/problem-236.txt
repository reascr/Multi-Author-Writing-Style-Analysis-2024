It's like the US bitching and protesting the Soviets for shooting down Francis Gary Powers over the heart of Central Russia. We don't have to like it, but who the fuck are we to bitch about their doing it? (And we didn't. We got caught, we sucked it up.).
You could probably collect useful weather data with a 4ft balloon. Having one 200ft would probably tell you what barometric pressure the inside of your asshole was.
Think of it as a spy mission. It's to make people think it's just a weather Balloon but it's really just for the Chinese to spy on people and gather info on military bases.
I wonder how China's 'civilian research' balloons always get drifted towards countries hostile to China and especially above areas that are of interest to the CCP....
Where in the name of all of fuck do the Chinese get the unmitigated gall to protest a damn thing here? And where the hell are any Western leaders standing up to call them out on their bullshit? I swear, their post shoot-down whining pisses me off five times more than sending the thing to start with. Not to mention our pathetically craven response from day one.
