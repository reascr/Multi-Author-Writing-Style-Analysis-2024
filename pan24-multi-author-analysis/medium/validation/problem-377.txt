Good thing the have been building artificial islands around it for years packed full of ASM’s and SAM’s. They are unlikely to make the same mistakes the Russians did in Ukraine.
They have been anticipating our response. There is a reason it’s an admiral saying this. He knows Taiwan will be invaded and the Chinese have been building artificial islands around it for quite a while now to ensure that they have plenty of SAM’s and and anti ship missiles. They already have their defensive measures in place for when they seize Taiwan.
1) Russia is not losing, retreating to save military personnel is not losing unless you do it on your own ground (you don't treat annexed territories as Russian territories, do you?), or suffer heavy casualties. It is a stalemate situation for now, neither side is winning by now. (Germany wasn't really losing WW2 until 1943, when they suffered a major defeat in the battle of Kursk, though USSR was counterattacking since the beginning of 1942. Cities changed hands up to 6 times in that counteroffensive. So what is happening now is nothing but a swing of a pendulum of war, and considering the slowdown of Ukranian forces, the pendulum is about to swing in the other direction).
USA is heading towards a recession, only thing to do is invade other countries on the premise of "freedumb" and start ramping up the military industrial complex money printer.
2) this warmup forced Europe to give much of it's arsenals to Ukraine, which means there are not that many weapons will be available when the real show starts, if it starts at all.
3) considering weapons, it was proven not all the weapons sent to Ukraine get there. Part of it (up to 70% by some reports, but even if it is 25%) are lost in the eastern Europe, and some of them were already tracked in Poland, Germany and Finland. So in case of total war Europe can flip into a land of men not willing to be drafted, facing economical difficulties due to energy crisis (buying gas for triple the previous price does not overcome the problem of energy prices) and armed. That's not a place I would like to be, so I suppose the all-out war is not to be looked forward to.
