So, Putin couldn't do it with his career/professional forces in Feb of 2022 (they lost a lot of them since then), with a bunch of heavy weaponry (that they lost since then), with a lot more ammo and rockets than he has now, with an element of surprise (Ukriane is definitely prepared now, at the very least mentally and motivationally), and before all the heavy weaponry aid received by Ukraine.
Hmmm... and now some drafted plumbers and electricians with a few months of training and rusty machine guns are supposed to take over an entire country. Something doesn't add up...
This is not the same plan. Then their plan was distance, so they sped past defenses and left themselves thin and flanked. Now the target is the defense troops themselves. They might fail, they might underestimate Ukraine, but itâ€™s not the same plan. And it could still bleed the fuck out of Ukraine. Putin can afford to hemorrhage. Ukraine cannot. I feel for their troops.
Not saying this is great news for Ukraine, and it will cost more lives, absolutely. It's just moronic at this point, Putin already lost, no matter what he does. Yes, he will succeed in getting more people on both sides killed, that's about it.
