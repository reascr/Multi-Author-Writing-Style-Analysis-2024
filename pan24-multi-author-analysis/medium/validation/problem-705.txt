Religion is a practice in insanity. Mixing it with power is a macabre nightmare. And we live on a planet where people never stop doing it.
Don't come at with us with that "it's not religion" bullshit. Religion has been the reason for millions and millions of horrific murders and countless more oppression to billions.
So yeah, sometimes, we sane people need to look around at each other and fucking empathize with each other about the nightmare that is living in a cult planet. If you don't like that, tough shit. We at least deserve to relate to one another while living through this horrible chapter of history. I can only hope humanity somehow moves past the dark ages where such ridiculous nonsense causes such heinous trouble.
Um, it actually does, mate. It represents the barbarian pedophile Muhammad's vision for an Arab Abrahamic Revelation quite accurately.
I could go on and on and on, but the truth is that Muslims who don't act this barbaric way are the ones Muhammad would have killed.
سوء الحظ أن الإسلام سوف يسيطر على العالم. الحمد لله. لطالما تعرض العالم الإسلامي للتهديد من قبل المتوحشين.
When the oil runs out, so will the modern world's need to placate the savages, barbarian kings, and theocrazies of Islam. They can then go back to just killing themselves as they have for over 1,400 years...for no reason at all.
