Everyone complaining even though Bill Gates's humanitarian work has saved more than 50 million people. These are some of the world's poorest suffering form diseases the developed world had eradicated almost a century ago. You guys can complain all you want about how "mean" Microsoft was as a company in the 90s, if there is a utilitarian heaven, Bill is going there.
He's thrown a lot of weight behind a lot of great alternative energy research necessary for the future and the development of least industrialized countries. Hoping he decides to jump in on hybrids of kelp next, as it's a food/energy source and sequesters carbon/acidifcation.
No one seems to remember how much of a shitlord he was amassing that fortune including all the anti-competitive cutthroat actions he took to create a monopoly.
You probably wouldnâ€™t have such fond memories of the fortune if he was just taxed and regulated correctly in the first place.
Care to provide some specific examples? I'll argue in Microsoft's favor for the sake of humoring it. Given that security & user learning curves were huge issues in early operating systems, I'd argue that it was appropriate to treat a user friendly backbone OS like a utility company vs. viewing it as a nefarious anti-competitive practice. A secure, user-friendly, and developer friendly is an absolutely massive untaking with the benefits from such a tech leap being absolutely massive. So finishing it ASAP should have been priority and the normal rules of capitalism don't really allow for decisions that just 'make sense'.
Even if I argue with 20/20 hindsight that it probably could have been done as quick/effectively via contracted collaboration, you have the debate of collusion because certain contractors would be left out PLUS the bigger issue of security.
In addition, at the end of the day, Microsoft was still developer friendly enough to allow the development of virtual machine framework for integration of code from other operating systems. So I'd argue they were not trying to cut out third-party developers and, in fact, made their OS so third-party friendly that competitors in the industry were able to secure specialization in many other markets. They get knocked for things like forcing internet explorer to be installed, but whether it's an excuse or not - from my understanding they had not properly compartmentalized some of the network functions of IE (the OS required IE to work).
