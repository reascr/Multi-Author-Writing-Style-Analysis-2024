"These drones were tested in somewhat different climatic conditions of Iran. Our climate is different and, among other things, they were most concerned about aerodynamics, the possibility of icing in case of temperature changes, which could affect flight ability,".
Their general soldiery may be knuckledraggers, but I have seen some of the artifacts of Russian ingenuity.
A long time ago I used to fly RC airplanes. Big 5' wingspan scratch built planes. I came across a Russian guy visiting to compete in a control line plane competition (pre RC plane flying). He had this really gorgeous plane that was beautifully crafted with nearly none of the luxuries I had to make my comparably badly built planes.
His materials were far more difficult to work with, but they were fashioned with so much care and his planes were so well aligned.
I had cyanoacrylate adhesive which set in seconds and he used this shitty resin with a long set time. My planes were covered in heat shrinkable mylar film that pulled taut and his were this doped super fine fabric that was so carefully trimmed.
I bought a couple diesel engines for dirt cheap from him, because he wanted dollars to buy some cases of CA glue to take back home. Those engines were incredible. The castings looked like shit: rough flashing edges and a dull finish, but when I took them apart their cylinders and pistons were perfectly honed. The bearings were excellent. They ran really nice and they cold started well.
I do not doubt that they would think of using exhaust heat to warm an airframe to shed ice and keep a battery warm.
Their model airplane community was extremely good at cleverly making excellent planes with far worse resources. I have seen examples of Russian made hand built radio control systems that worked pretty good. I was spoiled by really nice Japanese engines and RC gear, but I sure admired the homebrew Russian stuff I saw.
It sounds like a top secret kind of idea to a glib Redditor, but they have not seen how talented Russians can be at kludging. All it takes is for one of those experienced hobby guys to figured out how much exhaust to bypass into the airframe to keep it warm, but not overheat the skin, and those instructions could be spammed over all of their inventory by meatheads who cut silicone tube and punch holes in it.
He's pushing 70 by now and either he's dead (Russian males have a life expectancy of only 71yrs), or he could have been conscripted I guess.
He wasn't the only smart guy from Russia. He had pictures of his club which showed dozens of guys proudly holding up their planes. I don't imagine that all Russians are blithering idiots. It's simplistic to assume that they can't solve problems. I think that their culture presents some really bad fundamental problems, but dealing with deicing is a fairly minor technical issue compared to the crushing problems of cultural corruption.
Individuals can get really freaking ingenious when they want to kill someone else and RC plane hobbyiests can be pretty ingenious.
The engine exhaust seems to come out of a tube bolted to the cylinder heads. All you do is bolt on a tuned pipe which is a very classic way to improve engine performance, and one that Russia is quite capable of making. The tuned pipe will give you a high pressure region from which you can side tap some exhaust gas to pipe back into the airframe with a flexible silicone tube. It is not uncommon to use silicone tubing to divert engine exhaust away from a RC plane to keep engine goo off of the sides. It is also common practice to side tap gas from an exhaust system to pressurize liquid fuel from a fuel tank into an engine.
You pipe this bypass gas into your airframe which will be hollow (because it has to be light) to keep it warm. You might even run that tube into a perforated towards the leading edge of the wings to heat them the most where ice building is generally the most problematic.
As I see it, combustion powered drones will continue to operate into the winter, much better than fully electric drones. It's much more difficult to route heat from efficient brushless motors into the props which will ice like mad. One could swaddle a Lipo with a hand warmer and some insulation to keep it warm, but rotor icing will still be a problem in the mid soggy cold winter. Maybe a combustion engine can heat an aluminum propeller just enough to shed ice.
Or it could not and it's really easy too. It is dangerous to just conjecture on hope. One needs to think about how things actually work.
None of this is high tech. All sorts of airplanes have deicing features powered by engine heat. I doubt they will have a carburetor icing problem because it's bolted to a small hot engine.
Nearly all of the crap I have described has been common practice in one form or another in either RC planes and small passenger planes since the '80's. None of it is high tech and all of it is obvious if one is skilled in the art of making flying things that fly in winter.
