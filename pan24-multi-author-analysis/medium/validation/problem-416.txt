Translation-Your ability to scam Trumphumpers, regressives and everyone in between is beneficial to the “party”. Combine that with the fact that you are a proud disciple of the GQP holy trinity- Power, greed and twitter troll fame, plus you know where all the bodies are buried. Besides it would take time we don’t have to train another useful idiot, sorry Mike Pillow.
GOP: Lose popular vote twice, lose senate, lose house, lose presidency, barely regain house when it should have been a drubbing...
You think DeSantis is a non-starter for voters? Trump is for sure, and the primaries will be a bruising affair for any other GOP Presidential hopefuls, but I wouldn't count out suburban white women swinging a vote for DeSantis. I think GOP leadership is trying to thread the needle between keeping the crazy fringe on board, while trying to reclaim the "kitchen table" crime, economy, family knows best contingency of suburban voters... and all it takes is low Dem turnout to have them go from the cliffs edge to the seat of power. Makes me nervous, but maybe I'm being pessimistic.
Crazy part is, it'll work. The senate map is likely to really hurt Dems in '24, and if someone like DeSantis can emerge from primaries I have serious doubts the American people will realize how dangerous he is. They all get to keep positions despite being terrible at their jobs and not even putting a party platform together in '20 or '22, but the combination of American mouth-breathers, and our fetish for minority rule will be our undoing.
According to Indiana Rep. Jim Banks "All of the statistics and polling coming out of the 2020 election show that Donald Trump did better with those voters across the board than any Republican has in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan,"... now Banks could be full of shit, I don't intend to dig into those "statistics" but I do see the non-union "working class" vote being a largely GOP monolith. Since the Tea Party, the GOP voting block of "White - Male - Non College" has grown more than any other.
Again, I may be pessimistic, but I think any shift in the "White - Female - College degree" vote to the right, and a less than spectacular Dem turnout... say if people have a hard time getting jazzed about an 82yr old running... puts someone like DeSantis in the oval.
