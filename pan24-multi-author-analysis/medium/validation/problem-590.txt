I have very seldom heard much politics at all in a mass, and have gone for years. Very occasionally you hear about abortion, but that has been it, and most times it was mentioned, no party or candidate was attached to it. I'm pretty liberal and would notice if it was common. Bishops, however, can get pretty annoying if you start to read their comments....
