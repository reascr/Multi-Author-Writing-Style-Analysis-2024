It's not new. My mom taught ESL to adult immigrants for decades and we had a couple waves of Afghan refugees who had never held a pencil, in the 90's. It's a pretty different situation to Iran, for example.
And ESL courses, whether in schools or in the community, are being cut and underfunded. There is a knee-jerk response to tell non-Americans (in the US) "learn English," while at the same time removing the resources that allowed them to do so. Math is a great example because it makes you scrutinize what you're asking of students: if they can't understand the problem, is it because you've turned the math question into a language comprehension question?
My math teacher even used to joke. "It's not a math problem, it's an English problem." We were all bilingual, although with varying degrees of proficiency at English.
Sadly many kids think ESL kids are dumb or something. I know in my school people were under that impression. It is quite the opposite and was very obvious with math, a subject that that isn't dependent on what language you speak.
