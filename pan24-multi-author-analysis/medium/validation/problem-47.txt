Media was so desperate to show that there were some reasonable republicans who would choose country over party, that they clung to Sasse because he made mild criticisms of Trump. He backed that criticism up with absolutely no action whatsoever.

I donâ€™t understand the voting critique. Most never Trump Republicans are quick to concede that he delivered a lot of the legislative wins they were hoping for.
According to 538 he voted with Trump , though that number is thrown off a bit since it includes Sasse voting against objecting to electors and against a few government funding measures, so in terms of substance it's a lot closer than that.
Even if I disliked someone personally, that would not change my view or support towards policy that I agreed with. Ona substance basis, Trump governed like a republican dream president. Sasse seemed to disagree with him primarily on style.
