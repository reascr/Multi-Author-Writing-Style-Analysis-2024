I don't know what comment you refer to but are you certain you want to so easily dismiss the idea of space lasers? We have laser we have satellites. Israel is more militarized than the US, it not outlandish at all to think they may have lasers in space.
What an incredible silly take. Illhan had legitimate critique of Israel. Can’t be having that. But they are just fine with outlandish space laser conspiracies. No on takes the latter seriously.
I think the point was missed. I’m not taking a position of the technical feasibility of weaponized lasers. The point is, that racism is not the explanation for why Illhan, with her criticism of Israel, is shown the door whilst MTG is allowed to spread her claims about Jewish space lasers. The explanation is simply that the former is taken seriously whilst the latter is not. Those claiming it is based on racism are gaslighting and very likely serving the same masters as the republicans who showed Illhan the door. Note the author of the linked article is a member of the Israeli tribe.
Remember the "star wars" defense conspiracy that is now general knowledge. The government tracking/ monitoring electronic communication conspiracy that is now public knowledge.

That’s why she has like 8 Democrat friends and zero Republican ones: impartial is good governance imo bad for making buddies.
