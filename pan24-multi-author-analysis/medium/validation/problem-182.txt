Prices are limited by what the market will pay, with considerations for cost of inputs and overhead. Income taxes are calculated after-the-fact based on net profits and have no bearing on how prices are determined.
Also just a reminder that the corporate income tax rate was nearly double what it is now back in the 50s and 60s.
I could see this happening in the long term, especially if the workers have a high level of bargaining power (e.g. in a union or a profession with barriers to entry). The only reason it seems like this doesn't happen today is that worker's rights have been seriously eroded in most parts of the U.S.
what if however,there is no competition because they are a monopoly. Or, the companys collectivley collude with each other to keep prices high.
What if The product they sell is a must have utility, to the point people would have to reduce other expenses such as food to maintain it.
What If the world ran on how much ever work u/Average_N_Mediocre put in each day? And what if he didn't want to work 24 hours a day? But what if his work was necessary to keep children from dying, all over the world? What if he has ALREADY MONOPOLIZED THE ENTIRE WORLD OUTPUT OF u/Average_N_OK?? What then?? We cant be asked to live our lives without his saccupping, can we? That dirty monopolist.
Is this....supposed to be some type of cogent statement, or purely a rhetorical device? Is there actually a "thing that frustrates you about" logic which says that different people value things differently, or is that whole thing just a setup for your dime store Daily Show knockoff bit (which nails the tone almost precisely: it says absolutely nothing meaningful or in any way related to reality, but is very proud of itself for being sooo witty)?
