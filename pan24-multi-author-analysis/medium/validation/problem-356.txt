Yeah I've started quietly doing this again as well. It's not really out of fear of catching the virus, more that I absolutely have not forgotten how my fellow citizens behaved at the beginning of covid with regards to panic buying. I'm planning on having maybe a month or two's worth of stuff to weather the initial storm. Had a very bad feeling twice in the past 5 years - one in December 2019 when I saw whisperings online about some sort of virus in China, and one in December 2021 when I saw videos of Russian APCs with parachutes attached being mobilised in Belgorod. I've got that same feeling again reading current developments around bird flu.
Yeah, I made a video on the bird flu a few months back when the vast majority of shorebirds on the West coast of Northern Europe died from this. It took forever for the news to report on it in sidenotes. Then it vanished again completely. Now, there are trickles of news here online but just trickles. Here in Germany, the only sign of the bird flu is a literal sign near my house that announces a bird flu observation corridor.
