Up until now China was fine closing everyone off from visiting China but now all of a sudden when other countries ask for precautions be taken (not fully ban mind you, just precautions) it’s not cool? Bunch of hypocrites.
Just writing something similar about the Chinese police in a Chinese message board would’ve taught you why your lame attempt at whataboutism is pathetic lol.
It’s kind of silly to require Chinese travelers to America to have a negative test, but have that be literally the only mitigation tactic they will experience in their entire stay.
I mean its the fat rich aunt coming back from her trip to China under the same quarantine guidelines? or does she gets to skip all of them because she is an US citizen?
You are aware that is what fucked us up in Jan-Feb 2020, not the extremely few Chinese citizens coming to the US for vacation/business during Chinese new years.
Forget people coming from China, cases in the Americas were mainly coming from Europe, since we shut people coming from Asia really quickly but didn't do nearly as well at stopping people from Europe, i wonder why...
