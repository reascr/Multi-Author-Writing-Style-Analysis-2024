Basic civil and political rights including freedom of expression, association, and peaceful public assembly are severely restricted. Independent media is not allowed as the government controls TV, radio, newspapers, and other publications. Vietnam prohibits the formation of independent labor unions, political associations, and human rights organizations. Police frequently use excessive force to disperse peaceful public protests that criticize the government.
Isn't it also a crime in the UK to post transphobic comments? I remember reading about a guy who got charged in the UK for training his dog to do the nazi salute.
Kazakhstan does this a lot. You can get up to 17 years for suggesting to overthrow the government. A post promoting acts of terrorism will land you up to 12 years. Other stuff like instigating ethnic conflicts or if you offend someone's religious beliefs - that's up to 7 years. Publicly criticising government officials is up to 5 years. Offending, slandering, calling names... up to 2 years...
