Much of the $53.7 billion that the United States plans to give Ukraine will be stolen in corruption schemes orchestrated by Ukraine’s military, oligarchs, and government officials. On a side note, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s net worth is about $30 million. He and his inner circle also have their own network of offshore companies. These have in the past been used to buy expensive properties in London. The documents also show that just before he was elected, he gifted his stake in a key offshore company, the British Virgin Islands-registered Maltex Multicapital Corp., to his business partner, who would go on to be appointed as Zelenksy’s top presidential aide. According to the Panama Papers, despite giving up his shares, an arrangement was soon made that would allow the offshore company to keep paying dividends to a company that now belongs to Zelensky’s wife. Convenient, right?
(Also, as wasteful as its military spending can be.... it turns out it is actually quite efficient comparatively speaking.).
