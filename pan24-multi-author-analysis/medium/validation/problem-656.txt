So the biggest thing I would say is that misogyny is the clearest indicator of a potential shooter and that needs to be talked about more. Misogyny is one of the biggest recruiting tools the far right uses to suck in angry, young, entitled, cishet white men. Racism, antisemitism, and queer phobia are also huge, but the misogyny often comes first. The far right actively targets imcels and others who hate women and basically throw gasoline on the fires in these hateful menâ€™s brains.
