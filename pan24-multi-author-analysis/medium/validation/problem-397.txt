>This survey of 1,352 adults was conducted February 13th through February 16th, 2023 by the Marist Poll sponsored in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour. Adults 18 years of age and older residing in the United States were contacted through a multi-mode design: By phone using live interviewers, by text, or online. The sampling frames include RDD plus listed landline, RDD cell phone sample plus cell phone sample based on billing address to account for inward and outward mobility, and aggregated online research panels. Survey questions were available in English or Spanish. Phone and online samples were selected to ensure that each region was represented in proportion to its adult population. The samples were then combined and balanced to reflect the 2020 American Community Survey 5-year estimates for age, gender, income, race, and region. Results are statistically significant within ±3.3 percentage points. There are 1,210 registered voters. The results for this subset are statistically significant within ±3.5 percentage points. There are 570 Democrats and Democratic leaning independents and 461 Republicans and Republican leaning independents. The results for these subsets are statistically significant within ±5.1 percentage points and ±5.7 percentage points, respectively. Tables include results for subgroups to only display crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error. It should be noted that although you may not see results listed for a certain group, it does not mean interviews were not completed with those individuals. It simply means the sample size is too small to report. The error margin was adjusted for sample weights and increases for cross-tabulations.
Ummm not sure you know how this works, but as far as polls go, that is actually is a great sample size .Anything with a 3+- margin of error is very accurate of the popular opinion.
Pros: actually done a competent job in IL including his handling of the pandemic. Pro labor, pro women’s healthcare, and pro weed with actual laws and amendments passed to back those positions up. He also helped IL take steps towards fiscal solvency with improved credit ratings and reduced deficits.
