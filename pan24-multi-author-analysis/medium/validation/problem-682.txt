Crazy cause when I paid a tax company to do my taxes one year and they forgot to file a paper the irs came at me with a $500 or $600 charge and when I called the company the irs they said it’s on you not the company. I called that company and had paid for the protections (mind you I worked one job and prob bare minimum return paperwork) they said we’ll come see us. I had since moved an hour and a half away and this was before where were now with everything online. I said fax me the form I’ll sign and fax it back. Cool done deal. Nope they fucked up again. IRS said we’ll still on you buddy. Go back to the company and they finally send the right form. Fuck this system and paying for protections means nothing in my experience. Just send me a damn bill if I owe something and make this system dummy proof to do by yourself. Since then I’ve never used and actual tax service. I will do online free tax USA. Not free but cheap.
