I think a lot of the people calling for direct NATO intervention (and a no-fly zone would be exactly that) underestimate the death toll and increase in risk towards nuclear war.
As horrible as this war is, and as much as we all want it to end - as long as Russia doesn't attack NATO directly and deliberatly, it would be a horrible mistake to intervene. A no-fly zone would be the brink of World War 3.
I think a lot of people have swallowed too much kool-aid and think Russia is itching to launch nukes. I do not think it a realistic possibility at all that Russia would commit suicide by going there. They have absolutely nothing to gain by doing so, and would lose absolutely everything if they did. And they know it. It's why they keep bringing it up; to scare the world into allowing their genocide of Ukraine to continue.
As it stands, Russian nukes are working much better than Nato nukes. Because their deterrent factor is allowing this whole horrific ordeal to continue. Meanwhile, Nato nukes do not seem to worry Russia in the slightest. For exactly the same reason; they know that they are not going to be used.
The only reasonable and humane solution here would be to force Russia to halt its war via full Nato intervention. Russia knows they got no chance against Nato, but as long as Nato pussyfoots around, Russia gets to destroy all the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine, leaving, eventually, 40 million people without electricity, heat or water as winter approaches. I do not find this a palatable eventuality.
Its not about wanting it, its about accidentally happening. See Able Archer, Cuba, Berlin crisis etc. In none of these cases anybody wanted to nuke each other, but they thought the other one would do it. Simulations have shown again and again that nuclear war is a possibility.
Do you expect Nato to go first-strike then? No? That leaves Russia. Will they use nukes first, fully knowing that it is a self-destruct button? No. Despite the apparent idiocy of this whole affair, Russia has not displayed characteristics of an irrational actor. They just overplayed their hand. They aren't going to burn their own house down just to spite the west.
What they are going to do, if Nato continues to allow it, is destroy the ability of Ukraine to remain warm and fed into the winter. Then, blackmail Ukraine into relinquishing the annexed territories or risk the entire civilian population perishing from "natural causes" as temperatures drop and power stations continue to be bombarded.
