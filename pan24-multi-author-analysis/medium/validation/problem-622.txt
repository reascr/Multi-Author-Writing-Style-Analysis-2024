In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;.
Yeah… and we know that the first item has already been committed in occupied territories. The only one I haven’t seen explicitly done is imposing measures on births, but idk how you’d even do that unless you have full control over the region.
You know how every few months there’s a new report about some 80-90 year old German getting jail time for Nazi war crimes tied to the holocaust/WWII? That.
Exactly this. The best case is Ukraine is able to capture a few higher ranking individuals for some public trials. But this isn’t world war 2. Nobody is going to invade Russia and capture those based in Moscow.
Everyone on Reddit is talking about all these war crimes Russia’s committed. Realistically what’s going to happen? I’m very doubtful they’ll be able to get Putin out of Russia and hold any trials.
For the rest of these Russian soldier’s, officer’s, and politician’s lives, they will be hunted down and punished for their war crimes. When Ukraine wins this war, these people will never be able to leave Russia without the risk of getting arrested and extradited to Ukraine to stand trial for their atrocities. If there is ever a regime change in Russia like we saw in Germany at the end of WWII, they will be at risk at home as well.
I just hope they are able to force Russia to return the children they kidnapped but I realize that’s also highly unlikely.
