Very similar experience here. Although learning about the ways other people live definitely helped me leave religion. Meeting and befriending lgbt folk in particular. Religion purposely creates a bubble of soothing simplicity that masks the vast and complicated realities of human existence.
I blame megachurches and nondenominational pseudo Christianity. Demagogue pastors are basically assuming the role of tribal warlords in rural America and enforcing a paranoid and primitive social structure. And unfortunately our capitalist overlords have found benefit in allowing their anti- intellectual, anti-government movement to flourish.
I’ve noticed that the degree to which conservatives hate an institution relates directly to how intensively that institution corrects error. Say what you will about the media, but most working stiffs at a newspaper would get in trouble for being wrong, and fired for lying. Scientists, their whole business is error correction. Snopes, it’s basically their mission statement. Academia, some professors are full of shit, but by and large they exist to seek knowledge. Therefore conservatives hate them all.
