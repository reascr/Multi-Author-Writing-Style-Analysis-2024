Lmao Xi doesn't give a damn about China or he would have stick to his predecessors' policy of befriending, not antagonizing, the West, which led to the country's most prosperous two decades in the last 300 years.
The nine dash line was created in the 1940s, but not in contention until in 2013 when China started creating islands.
The Hong Kong friction has been an ongoing issue with the mainland, but incidents started occurring in 2012 according to Wikipedia.
Lol always the same bullshit that the left in South America is in Russias pocket. Ignoring the real good leftidt that have voted against Russia in the UN or called out the war, they just call all wars out.

Lol that foro de Sao Paulo. It doesn't say who signed it besides I'm talking about what you said about all the left in South America supports Russia which is bullshit. Yeah Lula was wrong in some statements but that doesn't affect me. You keep the classic far-right retoric that all leftist governments are pro-russian when it isn't. And why would they support the U.S when we all know the history of them internvining in the continent to place dictators and affecting democracy.
