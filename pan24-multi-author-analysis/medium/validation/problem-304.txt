I mean, I somewhat doubt that the state-employed and regime-friendly people that the morality police was made up of are abolished as well. One wonders which other position would be found for them.
Lmfao. Top of world news post vs the post 3 hours later about them burning the house of the climber who participated w.o a hijab vs this post a few hrs after that.
Iran used to be a secular country, a very specific big oil multinational is 100 percent responsible for the current shit show their people have to live with.
if religiousness is but the means to the end of being in power, you might as well replace it with something that works better with the current generation. So fire the morality police and hire them back as your regular old goon squad armed with clubs. Certainly works for the Chinese, doesn't it?
Call yourself religious, call yourself communist, heck, even call yourself democratic. As long as you are only in power because of your ability to violently suppress the population, you are the same wolf in different sheep's clothing.
