Do you know for sure whether those sensors would be on sanctions lists? This was something I was wondering about a while back, because I used to work in manufacturing, and without the controllers that have computer chips in them, the equipment I used to run, wouldn't even work. I had to replace them somewhat regularly. Same with the sensors.
I used to work for a company that made safety instrumentation for oil and gas, ie pressure, temperature, flow, and level sensors. Most of which are used around the world in refineries and transportation systems like pipelines and terminals. Most of these refineries are automated so having working sensors is extremely important in the safety feedback loop.
We were shown a video at work of a refinery exploding in Mexico that killed 12 or so people because they had defective sensors that didn't alert the control crew of a problem.
Also the refining process is especially volatile, using insane pressures and pretty nasty chemicals that are both caustic and explosive if they mix in or or subject to different atmospheres.
