hopefully people from some other countries take note, they either start shit or theyre slowly being sent to their deaths.
These protests are going to have to change power on their own and lots of Iranian people are probably going to lose their lives going against their corrupt and backwards government. I don't want to see another Arab spring intervention which cripples Iran as a country and drives it into civil war, I just want to see their damn regime replaced and 50% of their population finally be seen as equals.
Please let these protests succeed and help finally recognise women as equals, actually let Iranians voice their opinions and engage with the world again. It's crazy looking at old videos and photos from the dictatorship days and seeing an Iran that looks more modern and free than it does today.
Thank you to the Iranians who are standing up against their repressive theocratic mafia government. It comes at an incredible cost and hopefully sooner than later that evil regime will be tossed into the dustbin of history.
I think anyone brave, honourable and intelligent in Russia has already been killed, locked up or has fled the country to look for a future life where you aren't under a corrupt and brutal dictatorship.
People just don't see what benefit getting out with no results or even publicity will do, when your and your family's livelihood and/or life are at stake. So maybe they're slightly less brave than the Iranians, but to conclude that means there's overwhelming support for Putin is a huge leap. Belarusians did huge protests in 2020, but haven't been seen doing that lately. Does that mean they now suddenly love Lukashenko? Of course not.
That's a myth. A lot of Russians still like Putin, but many of those only grudgingly so. The percent of fervent supporters is below 50%. There were significant protests at the start of the war (and periodically since 2011), which were harshly repressed by Putin's well-funded thugs. The last vestiges of independent media were also destroyed for good back then, which inhibits the protests' reporting to an extent rivalling Iran. That's also effective at making people feel isolated and alone, that their viewpoints "aren't shared by the majority".
Also, last I checked, Russia's overall standard of living is a bit higher than Iran's, which is definitely a factor in both why so many Russians are apathetic and why they aren't exactly rushing in to die for Putin and his yachts, palaces and oligarchs. They have to be forced to do it instead. Apathy, not support, is the dominant feeling in Russia.
A lot of the Western misconceptions about Russia like the one you mentioned are exactly what fuel Putin's murderous and illegitimate regime.
I lived in Russia for around 5 years in late 1990s-early 2000s (excluding holidays abroad), right at the end of Russia's full democratic experiment, and when Putin's authoritarian (now totalitarian) regime was starting to chip down at civil liberties and democracy. I also read both government and anti-government Russian media, so the guy who responded to you is wrong.
Uh, that's also a myth, Navalny and his associates have defended Ukraine's right to Crimea and Donbass, for example, and want good relations with the West, but tried for years to not run afoul of Russia's laws that question its "territorial integrity", including of Russia's annexed territories. Russia would naturally acquire a stronger natural "sphere of influence" around itself akin to the one US has with Canada and Mexico solely because of its size and economic growth, but its worst impulses would always be constrained through the presence of democratic checks and balances, and would be of a very different nature to the relations current Putin's Russia has.
Putin's 20+ years of brainwashing have definitely taken a toll, including outside of Russia, but as the memories of the 2000s economic boom recede (with declining real incomes for almost a decade now) and Russia's worldwide influence and situation become worse, Putin's leverage and prestige among the population has been falling. However, so far he's been careful to keep a relatively good life in Moscow and St. Petersburg (where a threat to his power would be most apparent) by sucking ever more resources from the countryside to those centers, to compensate for the lack of economic development as a whole in the country.
If Russia becomes democratic, it'd naturally integrate itself with Western countries, for one, and they'll likely adopt a carrot-and-stick relationship. With democracy and economic growth, imperialist temptations would slowly fade from public discourse, or at the very least become more akin to those of the United States. If you unlock those keys together for the first time ever with Russia, great things will happen. But for now, as we're living through these tumultuous times, there isn't even a guarantee Putin will leave the Kremlin before he dies, or of what'll happen after him.
That was a prediction of a status quo, not an approval of the fact. In the same speech, he called for a new, "proper" referendum, and said "Crimea is part of Russia de facto", but "was seized in blatant violation of all international norms".
Further, he said Crimea wasn't even on the Russian political agenda prior to 2014, not mentioned even by nationalists.
He said in the following years (after the interview to Ekho Moskva, but before this latest expanded war) that a new democratic Russia would try to resolve the question in a legitimate way.
So maybe not in the exact way Ukraine would like it, but he's definitely not claiming it to be part of Russia forever. If he wants a democratic Russia, he'd have to build relations with the West, and they won't stand for a repeat of the 2014 "referendum", so he likely means a UN or internationally-observed vote of some kind. He also, again, made those claims while living in 2010s Russia, where laws and repression were already advanced and becoming worse every new year. Boris Nemtsov was killed outside the Kremlin after condemning the takeover of Crimea and conducting pro-Ukraine rallies, for f sake.
You also ignored how Navalny condemned the fact it was annexed at all, something which nobody in today's Kremlin would dare to say out loud, and was and is considered a crime of calling for separatism. Navalny is absolutely not fine with it simply "belonging" to Russia. If he wanted it to just remain part of Russia, he'd say it belongs to Russia or not even mention the issue, rather than "risking" losing it.
Also, last I checked, people, including Ukrainians, didn't leave Crimea en masse, since it was occupied peacefully, albeit illegally (AFAIK there was even claimed a large economic growth after that, to bribe the locals, as it was simply pumped away from other Russian regions). You must be thinking of Donbass, where all the major Russian crimes were committed. Suffice to say, the history of Crimea is complex, but the general feeling was that Russians, who were in majority there even before 2014 (keep that in mind) hated Ukraine, but somehow didn't mind at all being within it, as Crimea had a large measure of autonomy, and Ukraine itself was more like a 2nd Russia before 2014.
