Maybe you missed where I said that I agree rules are rules? I'm not saying don't go after tax evasion rich or poor but considering the IRS has proven time and time again that they are far more interested in going after the poor rather than the rich and given that they lowered the threshold to report from 20k to 600 says once again their interests are in people with lower incomes. Just google "irs disproportionately audits poor" and then search for "wealthy taking advantage of tax loopholes". They go after small fish because the big fish are too much work.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
