Why is it we only see the best in humanity when we have the worst disasters. Even Greece has offered unlimited help to their old adversary, surely we can find a way to have unity on a permanent basis.
There's still articles and select redditors writing about Pakistan having sent nothing to their "religiously dear brother" when cargo planes have been landing with rescue teams and supplies.
>“Our aircraft don’t fly over Pakistan as this is our standard operating procedure. Our planes take a longer route by flying from the Gujarat side to avoid Pakistani air space while going towards Europe or West Asia,” an IAF official said.
A civilian airliner traveling from New York to Singapore has a travel route pre-submitted for approval from each country it's travelling over.
If a plane fails to submit a route it's not up to interpretation by the author. Unless you're assuming Pakistan is supposed to know of the end point of each plane leaving anywhere in the world and send out a WhatsApp message to the pilot giving them authorization.
Unfortunately I read this on Reddit, also there are a number of other articles that claim the same thing. Whether they routinely take an alternative route as a matter of policy or because they’re denied permission, is a matter of interpretation by the author.
It's just Indians going around posting it, easier to just use the Indian media now and Pakistani media tomorrow when the country's foreign ministry wakes up and has a press conference.
