Unless she works in the plaza with the Target or at the one across the street with the Chase bank I doubt it. No access at all is permitted from about Cantrill to L -- not even bicycles. Maybe the robotics place still has power, and some of the little offices along the east run of 2nd might be online, but it's a mess down there. Dog park is now a dog pond.
Trees down all over. Half the power poles along 2nd are down, if not straight snapped in half. Four massive trees down right behind my own house. The debris is considerable, but the city's been doing a great job sawing it up and pushing it out of the way.
Weirdly, Davis is relative high ground for the area, so flooding is unlikely. Getting in and out of town from any direction but west is a little tricky this morning.
