Tomorrow's tweet from Elon, "turns out I fired all the people in charge of unbanning people and I don't have the keys to their offices, so Trump is remain banned for the foreseeable future.".
It's frankly impressive how much of a shithead he is. That idiot was even saying that the poll was being attacked by leftist bots at some point.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Our media is so gullible. And so is the population. We fall for every single publicity stunt, even when they are obvious. Who cares if he put out a poll? Who cares if he reinstated trump’s account? He is doing nothing but trying to draw headlines.
I’m saying Elon Musk is trying to draw clicks to twitter. You are clearly falling for these weak media attempts.
If you want to Trump to have less power on twitter….stop using twitter. Otherwise, you are part of the problem.
