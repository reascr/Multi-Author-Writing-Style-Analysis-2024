It's so fucking stupid though that this exists. That in the 21st century we have a democratic country that has a military occupation and allows it's civilians to oust the population that lives there.
There is so much talk that Israel has a right to it's security but all this shit is happening outside of Israel.
This is just factually not true. When Israel completely evacuated all settlements from the Gaza strip it got tens of thousands of rockets in return, not peace.
Israel moved all of its settlers from Gaza and into the West Bank. The year they moved out of Gaza, there was a net increase in settlers:
Your own chart shows you are wrong. It shows that Israel did in fact evacuate the Gaza strip and between 2004-2007 there were actually less settlers coming to the WB then the years before. Because it's not related.
Imagine what would happen if the evacuation resulted in more peace instead of violence. Imagine the huge support that would have been even from within Israelis to remove settlers from the WB as well. Even now millions of us (Like me) support it, but many stopped caring because it's factually not helping at all.
Israel doesn't "Move" people to the WB, they do that themselves because of ideological and many times monetary reasons (Cheap living there).
When Israel evacuated the Gaza strip completely (Again, as your own source shows), the Palestinians have only answered with extreme violence, as they do.
And calling Israel "Colonial" is extremely ignorant and dishonest. It is a fact that our country has given up more land mass than it's entire size in favor of peace. It is also a fact that this area was offered to the Palestinians 5 different times already. All refused in favor of violence.
I did not say the settlements will bring peace, that is you putting words in my mouth. Maybe try building a strawman and direct your arguments Infront of it instead of me.
The colonial forces were Islam and their people, who moved by the thousands to Israel, the Jewish homeland, during the Ottoman and British rule.
There were even talks about giving the Golan heights for years but there is no real partner for peace in Syria so today you will not find many Israelis who support that.
I have said that removing of them will not bring peace, which is factual. Watch that word carefully, FACT, not OPINION.
It's absolutely atrocious that they exist. This occupied territory is sheer madness, just properly annex and incorporate the land or leave, there is no halfway solution.
Israel has already removed settlements from Gaza, we only got the rise of Hamas and tens of thousands of rockets.
All that said, I am still against the settlements, as millions of other Israelis. Simply because if some future Palestinian leader will ever be brave and smart enough to actually attempt peace, they would make drawing the borders pretty hard.
Do you know what their declared and public goal is? Let me tell you because you obviously don't. It's not to free the WB, but the destruction of Israel. It is literally the first item in their covenant. Go Google it if you don't believe me.
Yeah, I guess. Ignore the West Bank and 2005-2015 Israel isnâ€™t bad at all for the great majority of Jews, many if not most Druze and Christians, and even some Palestinian Muslim citizens of Israel.
I'm not defending the rocket attacks but if Israel makes the West Bank like Gaza in terms of domination of borders then there won't be peace either.
