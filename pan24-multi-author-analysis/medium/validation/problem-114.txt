Also there are multiple jurisdictions, different investigations and both state and federal charges..
How about we let the investigations finish. We just learned today that Mark Meadows was burning documents. I don't understand why people think they know enough about what's going on. Do you want him arrested, or do you want him prosecuted and found guilty?

That is not how it works. Every charge is separate. You don't have to wait for everything to be complete, you can charge him with what is know now and charge him with the rest later.
Except...... tick-tock, you know? The longer they stand around with their thumbs up their asses, the bolder the wolves become. They have to charge him or democracy is over....and they have do it now. And they have to go after all the government officials who were involved. Very soon it will be too late. The Nazis are practicing blowing up power stations for fucks sake.
I never said that. I said we should let the investigations finish. If they were to bring charges they would. I was trying to explain that we are actually in no position to know what they're investigating, let alone whether or not they're ready to file any charges.
They will bring charges when they have a case that can win. None of us know what's going on or what information and evidence they have.
