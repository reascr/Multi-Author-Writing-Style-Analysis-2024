Every day in this country is torture! We have corrupt idots making decisions, we all disagree with. Yet, we always end up paying for whatever uneducated choices they concoct. It is a communistic government pretending to be a democracy.
As someone that was raised to idolise Mandela, the ANC and the rainbow nation that South Africa was meant to be become after Apartheid, I feel incredibly saddened at what it has become.
Every day I see the massive brain drain of talented White, Black and Asian South Africans here in the UK making a better life for themselves. It truly makes me sad to see what this nation that was so talked up for me in my youth has become.
I wish I could be in the UK honestly there's too much wrong in this country. Someone said it well "Majority rule doesn't work in a mental institution" So I highly doubt the ANC will be out of power anytime soon plus corruption is basically advertised everywhere you go, Its too deep in the roots so cutting a few branches won't help anything. The people are easily manipulative especially the youth (my youth) as long as they get free money and beer than they will basically do anything. I get it every country has its problems but these are worse cause there was and is so much potential in this country but people only care about themselves not about the future of themselves or our country as a whole. And don't get me started on the crime rate and safety.
