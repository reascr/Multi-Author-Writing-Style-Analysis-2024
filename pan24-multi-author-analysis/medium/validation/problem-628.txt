yeah, everyone walking around strapped, power grid on the verge of collapse, your AG under indictment. yeah, things are great in the lone star state, as long as you're white with some money.
i'm not sure, Texas Dems seem to actually try, not as hard as I'd like them to, but it looks from a distance like they almost have their shit together. it looks like the party has completely given up in FL.
DeSantis ran a racist bigoted campaign in 2018 and won by only 0.4%, and he ran a racist bigoted campaign in 2022 and won by 20 points. Seems to me the difference is that Charlie Crist is an absolute dogshit candidate that for some reason Florida Democrats just cannot stop running despite his record of getting wrecking in election after election. Every single time it's the same argument "He's a former Republican, so the Republicans will vote for him!", and every single time it's proven wrong again. What happens is Democrats don't want to vote for a former Republican, and Republicans don't want to vote for a Democrat. I just can't with these self proclaimed political strategy grandmasters.
what's the point then if all you have is rep and rep lite. the democrats already act as if they're ashamed of their positions. the real difference is the GQP has decided to revive the anti-LGBTQ bullshit and the left is letting it happen unchallenged.
the fact that DeSantis won by almost 20 points while running a campaign rich in bigotry and full of promises that he will work to make sure the right people die(trans kids, PoC, the unvaxxed) should be a horrific wake up call. The state is more or less a 50/50 purple state according to polling, the Democratic party might want to try to craft a policy message that actually lands with the the average voters in FL. as crazy as that sounds it just might work.
