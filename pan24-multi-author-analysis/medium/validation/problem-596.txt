you made the most intelligent comment in this entire thread so succinctly! i'm gay and i live and work in Yemen. my national colleagues talk añl the time about how the Saudis are pushing extreme versions of Islam incessantly across Yemen (and much of the Middle East and North Africa) and they lament how just a few decades ago women dressed colorfully and could walk around in long skirts. The average Yemeni is not hyper-religious and the current civil war really has nothing to do with religion, and is more of a power/land grab by the Houthis, Saudis, UAE, Qatar and Iran to control major shipping routes and some oil deposits. I'm not super out at work, but some of my colleagues certainly know, and i work with one gay national guy who the women will take their hijabs off around when they are in private (technically a big no-no, but shows they accept him for what he is and dont see him as a threat). Of course there is a ton of sexism and homophobia, but I don't think Yemen would be anywhere like it is now without Saudi Arabia's relentless influence.
