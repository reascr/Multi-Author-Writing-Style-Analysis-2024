While I can appreciate Xi wanting to trade in this own currency, the yuan is just too fishy. No way they’ll take money that is adjusted not by market forces, but by fiat.
It's probably more about if petrol dollar isn't a thing they can induce inflation of USD and hurt US. Also easier to avoid sanctions if you aren't using USD.
Also a good point (not inducing inflation in an economy that buys Chinese goods). It seems a bit too altruistic to me to do that though. The second part, avoiding sanctions, sounds more realistic to me.
The question if China is a strategic mastermind or just stumbling around is an interesting topic. Some think belt and road is an world dominating plan and other just a employment program for Chinese workers.
To underestimate China is to do so at one’s peril. BRI, in my limited understanding, is absolutely a way to cement control over infrastructure and commerce and primarily benefit China, while also strenhening emerging economies and relationships in Africa and the Middle East. Established economies benefit China less, but having a strong presence in those first-world countries is important for technology “acquisition” and competitive intelligence.
