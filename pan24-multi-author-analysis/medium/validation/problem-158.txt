Why are you confident Trump would lose in the general election? He garnered the second most votes in history last time. With the Supreme Court's dismantling of the voting rights act, states like Georgia, that Biden won, could very easily wind up going for the Republican nominee just because of how many black would-be voters are unable to cast their ballots. And historically, the Presidential election has usually been a referendum on the state of the economy, if the economy is doing much below average or much above average; I certainly don't feel confident that the average American is going to think the economy is doing well in 21 months (heck, I'm not even sure if it's going to be debatable-- there is a non-trivial chance that the economy will be in a dark place by then).
I dont think they're afraid beyond they know if Trump isn't the republican nominee, he'll run as an independant and since they haven't been able to win the popular vote in a while without being at war, it'll guarantee their loss. Kind of like the house is at the whims of MGT l, Santos, and the ilk, they know their control is so tenuous they ended every last vote no matter how insane the voter is.
