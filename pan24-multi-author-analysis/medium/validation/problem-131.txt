The likeliest outcome is Dems lose the senate, but a 50/50 split would not be out of the question and honestly more likely than maintaining a 51/49 majority given the map.
I donâ€™t think there has been a single poll where Sinema gets more than 20% of the vote. Schumer and the DNC need to stop caring about that traitors feelings and back Gallego. There damn near no pick up opportunities in 2024 and a lot of opportunities to lose, I get that. But Sinema is clearly not popular in Arizona as she is receiving less of the vote than Kari Lake in hypothetical 3-way races.

In a 50/50 split, I guarantee it will be less of a headache to have Gallego in that seat than Sinema.
