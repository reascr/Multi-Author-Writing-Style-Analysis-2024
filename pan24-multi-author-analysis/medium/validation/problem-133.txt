It's not that people don't give a shit. It's that they don't believe there is a legitimate way to get rid of the criminal organization that has hijacked the sport globally. Boycotts don't work with the mafia.
in all honesty. if people would see the effect or their doings, like boycotting the world cup mayn more would do. many jsut dont do it because they always think their boycott would not change anything and thats why they jut dont do it. its the same with environmental pollution or just throwing some garbage onto the street. very shotsighted but thats how majority of people are.
The article uses a lot of insider lingo that doesn't clearly explain the situation to the masses. I'd love for someone who understands FIFA's regulations better to comment on this.
My quick read: the current Ukranian Football association president got busted misusing funds. Rationally the Ukraine Football organization is discussing his dismissal and replacement.
This displeases FIFA, who for unknown reasons has decided this routine administrative action is grounds for Ukraineâ€™s football association being banned.
