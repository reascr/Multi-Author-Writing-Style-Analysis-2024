This finding is fascinating. It's long been an open debate among archaeologists whether burnt animal parts near early human/humanoid tools were signs of cooking or just a wildfire that passed through the area. It's been almost impossible to rule out accidental wildfires.
> "This suggested that the fish had been cooked at a controlled temperature rather than just burned," study co-author Irit Zohar from Tel Aviv University, Israel, told DW. "Until now, no one could prove that Homo erectus cooked food. This is the first evidence that erectus had the cognitive ability to control fire and cook food.".
This finding may have resolved that dilemma. First it's evidence Homo erectus went fishing. But more even more important: wildfires typically burn at temperatures of 800 C/1470 F. The chemical structure of these fish teeth remains is evidence of a lower temperature burn, under 500 C. The chemistry probably can't pinpoint the temperatures closer than that, yet it's good enough to rule out natural causes and place this in the range of cooking temperatures. And it's near what seems to be something like a fireplace or a fire pit.
One of the few technologies that all human societies have in common is cooking. Food safety might be one reason. Another is cooking makes nutrition more bioavailable.
If you look back a few centuries, most of Europe believed that eating raw vegetables was incredibly unhealthy. So they'd boil everything within an inch of existence.
