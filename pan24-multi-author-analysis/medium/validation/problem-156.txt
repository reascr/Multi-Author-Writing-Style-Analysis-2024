I lived in Vietnam for 6 years and was pretty good at only drinking in places that served real booze (avoid the tourist bars that offer insanely cheap drinks, basically), but I got unlucky one time at a foreigner-owned bar that had been sold some counterfeit liquor. My friend and I had four cocktails and were so drunk that neither of us could walk. Our wives were so fucking mad at us for getting as shitfaced as we had at 9:00 p.m. before we got in touch and realized what had happened. Scary shit because I think if we had stayed any longer we might have been in for a trip to the hospital. Right when I arrived in Vietnam there were three separate instances of foreigners dying from drinking counterfeit booze.
>There was no immediate word on how the girl was infected but the agriculture ministry said all animals at her home – 22 chickens and 3 ducks – had recently died. There has also been an unusual number of deaths among wild birds.
Also 'dig', which is the Irish for to understand or to get (thuig). The Irish were in the same socioeconomic strata as Black people in the US, and language swapped around.
