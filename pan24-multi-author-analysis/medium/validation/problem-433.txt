Where he is wrong is saying "there is no Ukraine "winning" the war". That is blatantly false. Ukraine can regain full control of its resources and land, and that is definitely winning. Selling gas at a discount to the countries that helped that happen isn't losing. Bear in mind, the only reason Ukraine has access to these resources is due to NATO aligned countries helping them in the first place, this is actually a key reason for the conflict. If the west had helped Ukraine bring its natural resources to the market, Russia's position as the sole petro nation in Europe would have been usurped. Since Russia is so dependent on this for their economy, it could have shattered them. But rather than try a carrot to win Ukraine's favor, Russia chose underhanded tactics and then a stick.
This happened to the gf of a friend a few years back, she tried to fart to make fun of guy humour. Mistakes were made and the group got a funny story out of it. Thankfully she was a good sport about it... after a year or so..
