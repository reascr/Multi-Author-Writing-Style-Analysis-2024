In April, Abbott began chartering busses to drop migrants off in other parts of the country, like Washinon, DC, and Chicago, without giving those cities any notice â€” a program that Texas has spent millions of dollars on.
Texas had spent $12 million on the efforts as of August, the Texas Tribune reported at the time. By November, the amount spent busing migrants out of state had risen to $20 million, according to local outlet WFAA.
If you looked at the numbers, the amount paid and how many asylum seekers they trafficked, they could have sent these folks to the Blue States on airplanes in business class.
If you pried the lid off of this scam, I bet you discover a bus company owner who's a close personal friend to Abbott.
