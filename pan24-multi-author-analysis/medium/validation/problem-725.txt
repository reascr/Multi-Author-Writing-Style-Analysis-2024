Imagine the stupidity, lobbing munitions imprecise enough that it locks onto and strikes a neutral flag's vessel.
What else in the Turkish defense industry/inventory would Ukraine like to purchase on the cheap? F-16s, maybe...
As a bit of a gun nut, it would be hilarious if Ankara commissioned a metric fuckton of janky bullpup shotguns offset by sweet Caniks to throw at the Ukrainians.
Turkey does have skin in the game as a Black Sea power, and they've been supplying Ukraine since BEFORE the invasion as passive support. At this point, the only way Russia sees reason is if/when they get kicked back to pre-2014 borders.
I honestly do think the Russians are trying their best with what they have, and are woefully failing to meet their propaganda as well as their truly expected standards.
This is what happens when the leadership becomes enarmored with their own bullshit. They become distanced from reality and believe that their goals are effective.
And hitting civilian ships, even Turkish-owned ones, serves Russia: it informs that Ukranian ports are not safe. And because Ukraine won't (and can't) do the same with Russian ports, it creates a situation where Russian ports are safer.
Endrogan wants to play both sides and has set himself up as a diplomatic mastermind because he is in the position. Putin does not mind that Turkish ships are hit because he knows that Endrogan will not raise issue with that.
Expensive, hard to produce hardware. Being expended for no military gain, and doubtful political value (as in hardening, not eroding civilian morale).
So as far as Putin is concerned, this is winning because wasting military hardwa like this, even though e can barely or not at all able to replace it, is his only hope of scavenging any sort of victory here. He has very little hope of gaining a military victory as long as Ukraine is supported.
