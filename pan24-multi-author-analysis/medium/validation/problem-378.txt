Schoolteachers can barely afford to rent a house in Tennessee, and now they are going to be in classes of over 40 kids thanks to trying to rescind class limits. Now, teachers are going to have to carry guns in school. Nothing bad could happen, like a kid getting a hold of a gun in school, right?/s.
We are not sending a good message to children when school staff is armed and conducting active shooter drills. We're telling them schools are dangerous places to be, places they may die, and more kids are going to be struggling with school phobia/PSTD.
We'll outside of schools we have police and soldiers that are armed performing active shooter drills, preparing for war, etc. Schools are places people die just as people die outside of schools.
I get what you're trying to say, but maybe the impression that schools are incapable of violence and safe havens is the wrong approach.
Anything that prevents school shootings (not sure what that may be) would improve overall safety everywhere.
I mean, SROs don't make school any safer. Why do Republicans think arming teachers would do any better?
They want teachers to be yelled at for all of society's woes, but then they also want to have teachers fend off mass shooters?
But nothing prevents this from happening now right? I'm assuming a teacher could go all day without having their purse checked for a gun or waist if they have it concealed in person.
While arming teachers maybe wont reduce shooters at school, I think believing it will contribute to more violence doesn't really add up either.
