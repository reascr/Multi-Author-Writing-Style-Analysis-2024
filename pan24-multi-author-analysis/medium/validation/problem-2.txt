In Sweden you can look up anyone’s crime record and income with the click of a button, it’s good for checking out potential tinder dates (the crime record part, not the income) but it’s also kinda creepy that pretty much your entire life is public and you can’t block access to your info.
Yup, you can either contact our tax agency for free or pay a symbolic sum to one of the companies that provide this information, I think in some cases the person will be informed that you’ve made the request though.
That cant be true for the most common simple phone scams where its about getting a one time payment out of the victim. Actually it makes for a nice target list together with age.
Sweden's kind of big on transparency. You can also google where pretty much anyone lives and what their phone number is. If you google my name and surname you'll get the precise address I live at, what year I was born, when my birthday is etc. Eniro.se and many similar sites function as modern day phonebooks.
Just last week I found someone's ID at one of those 24/7 unmanned convenience stores. I looked the name up on Eniro to see where he lived so I could go put it in his mailbox.
Look at it from another viewpoint. Since Sweden has operated like this, security and identification protocols already account for this info being easily accessible. Therefore, this could actually lead to being more resilient to scams.
Identity theft might be harder if good mechanisms are in place. But thats rarer than just a stupid it support scam call.
I’ve never heard of anyone using income as a criteria for dating, I’m not saying it doesn’t happen but it’s not really a thing for the people I know. Many of my friends tend to go for handymen though.
