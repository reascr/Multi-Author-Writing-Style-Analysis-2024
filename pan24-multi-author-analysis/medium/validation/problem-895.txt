Unfortunately the amount of people I see driving large SUVs and pickup trucks in my area has me believing this article mostly. No way they are making much money with expenses per mile way above average.
I drive mostly full time for 5 different gig apps. I run my business pretty efficiently. My exact cost per mile has been 22 cents including all maintenance, depreciation and business use insurance. I drive a 2015 Honda fit with 106k miles. I'm also putting aside about 8 cents a mile for major repairs.
I’m working a similar amount of hours in this market and making several times over what’s stated in the article. Are they negating out what the customers pay us in tips or are they going strictly off the base fare from Uber in an hour?
