Dude no one gives half a shit about Andrew Tate come on. This is normal procedure when you are after a criminal ring. They have other people under surveillance and they are after more evidence that need time to gather. Subpoenas etc take time.
I can’t reply objectively or constructively to that. Right Off the bat you’re already loaded with bias and arrogant undertones. It’ll just turn into insult fest like it always does with these kinda threads. It’s so silly.
Sure whatever yes you are right he was a threat to the cabal. The establishment. The woke tribes that rule the planet. He wasn’t just a pimp. Oh no. He was the incel god.
I saw a video a little while back, it was his lawyer being interviewed about this. And he said the prosecutors still haven’t provided any evidence.
But if the judge has decided to increase the detention time so that the investigation can continue, does that mean there is definitely evidence?
It could be something like they know there is evidence however they can't find it. So the judge is extending the detention to give more time to prosecutors to find stuff.
This guy was accused of something as large as human trafficking but still came on the internet regularly. I am sure he has a huge cartel and gangs backing him up and hiding evidence.
“Judge, we know there’s evidence, we just can’t find it. But extend the stay because he’s definitely guilty ok?”.
I don’t understand how it would be defamation. Maybe a wrongful arrest, but how would it be defamation? The prosecutors aren’t on Twitter saying “lol guys this prick is so guilty”.
Is part of the conspiracy. You know a fourth tier minor celebrity would “expose the matrix” and “start the revolution” and shit.
