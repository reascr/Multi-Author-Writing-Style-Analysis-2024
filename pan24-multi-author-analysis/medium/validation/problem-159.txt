Its more like "enforce existing rules on the cake eaters, then if that doesn't work, we can look at passing more rules.".
Came to mention this, you beat me. Money in elections is a major reason for the standstill. Taking money away from the recalcitrant might have the same power. It might also cause a stiffening of political opposition and a new victimhood claim. Still, ya use the tools you have.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
There will be a claim of victimhood. Theres always a claim, it was never them that did anything wrong. Theyre like children covered in chocolate insisting it was the cat that took the cake.
Enforcing current laws costs money so govt doesnt do it. Politicians pass even more because they get kudos and re-elected, even if nothing changes.
I can see some holding that position, even if I disagree. The Mueller report was evicerated by a partisan DOJ, that effectively denigrated it in front of a right wing congress, that wouldn't convict a ham sandwich. Two impeachment proceedings that were actively ignored by sitting republicans. The jan6 committee forward its results to a new DOJ that has appointed a special prosecutor. At the outset that committe was by its own rules, to investigate irregulatities and make it less susceptical to quasi machinations like the fake electors scheme. Time will tell, democracy is messy, but still the best form of government that we have.
Middle of the road Dems are also the most likely to already own and/or use guns. 30% of Dems owned a decade ago and that's only been increasing since.
Gun control really only appeals to people in high-crime areas and the rich who can pay for their own armed security.
The tax stamp might be $200, but its a year long ATF colonoscopy and the cheapest shitty automatics start at 10K, and a good one is 30K++.
Dems also love shooting themselves in the foot because it keeps the donations flowing from Bloomberg and other anti-gun groups.
They know its political suicide, and also impossible, but talk is cheap and donations are profitable.
Lots of DAs have been dropping gun possession charges lately. If laws arent even enforced on known criminals, how will they enforce them on anyone else?
