The only question that matters is "is he guilty of committing seditious acts against the US to overthrow an election on January 6th 2022?".
Who. Cares. if it will help or hurt him. This is a bad faith question meant to change the conversation away from what Trump is guilty of - Sedition Conspiracy for his attempts to overthrow a democratic election and install himself as an unelected dictator.
Even if he's indicted a former pres is never going to serve in a prison, just due to the national security concerns. At most he'll serve home confinement.
Still think he should be indicted and convicted, but it's unlikely this ends with him actually in prison.
