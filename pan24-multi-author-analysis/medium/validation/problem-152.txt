You know with this discussion a part of me thought for a second that beyond the overt reasoning for his visit…. Because if we’ve learned anything about Russians and Ukrainians over the last few years it’s that these guys play a different level of chess… albeit some with awful criminal motives and others like zelensky with much more benevolence… but if I were him I’d have valued the opportunity to see who’s sitting and I’d have taken quite a bit of careful notice to the numbers and to the individuals themselves. I think he and his citizens are incredibly intelligent and will use a lot of things from this trip, it is in effect intelligence gathering on your ally. Who could fault him of course. Not that any diplomat or whatever visitor wouldn’t do the same, just that in this case especially and given trumps call to him a few years ago… that kind of observational OSINT carries a bit more weight. Above the money and the equipment even… he needs to get a first hand feel for who he’s working with here, all of them. It was the right thing to do on all levels. Risky but right.
