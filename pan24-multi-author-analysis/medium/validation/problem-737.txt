They have a 4 trillion economy. For a 1.5 million army, they have 2.6 million in economic activity to support each service member. Numbers are puchasing power parity, what is what you actually get for your money.
I know there's a meme about it being smaller than Italy, but that's at exchange rate conversions. A bit of common sense, world's largest country and has 140 million people and industrialised in the first half of the 20th century should make you really pause when you read that statement.
But we know some countries are cheaper than others. $10 hamburger in new york is different to a $10 hamburger in Yekaterinburg. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) accounts for those differences and say those two hamburgers are materially the same and thus both worth $10 for our PPP purposes.
In PPP adjusted terms, Russia has a per capita GDP (not a national GDP) comparable to Kazakhstan or Venezuela. And that was before the Ukranian war and all its devastation. Probably also before oligarchs siphon off most of the money. I doubt they can even change the bulbs in the streetlights. Putin is probably talking out his ass like all the other times.
I know its hard to go against dictatorship with so many armed force. Its just sad that Russian people who suffers through this has to go through this pain too. I am sure many just want to live in peace.
