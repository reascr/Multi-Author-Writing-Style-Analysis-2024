I'll never understand how the democrats so often "High Road" by not calling out actual things republicans are flat out lying about, blatently and openly. Meanwhile watching themselves get taken down by blatent fabricated lies...
This will be the first time since 1984 that Democrats will control the state legislature in Michigan! And it’s important to note that this only happened because in 2018, voters in Michigan approved a citizen-initiated ballot referendum that transferred the power to draw voting maps from the state legislature to an independent redistricting commission.
As a result, Republicans were no longer able to draw egregiously gerrymandered maps that guaranteed their victories. The commission instead drew a map that was fair to both parties. As a result, Democrats were able to win control of the legislature for the first time in four decades!
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Missouri passed it by referendum about 4-6 years ago, I think? Then at the next election Repubs put a very confusing ballot measure to get rid of it. They promoted it as “getting rid of money in politics” by lowering the amount state legislators could take in gifts from lobbyists. What they didn’t say was that it only lowered the amount by $5. ( And by the way, it moves redistricting back to the state legislature. But that was never mentioned in any ads about it).
All the campaign ads were about how this amendment would lower lobbyist gifts and campaign contributions. They never mentioned how little it would actually be lowered. They never mentioned it would change redistricting. You found out about that in the voting booth if you read it carefully.
The commission is made up of Michigan citizens and has to have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and then it also needs a certain number of independents. And I believe that maps can only be approved with a certain amount of support by all three groups. Someone with more knowledge about the specifics of the commission could probably better answer your question than me.
Michigan has an independent redistricting commission that draws maps, thanks to a 2018 ballot referendum. As a result, the current maps in Michigan are not gerrymandered, and they probably won’t be in the future unless the commission really fucks up.
- eliminate the nonpartisan state demographer and use a bipartisan commission appointed by the governor again for legislative redistricting.
