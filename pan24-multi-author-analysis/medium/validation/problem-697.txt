>In December, the Department of Defense established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office to identify "unidentified anomalous phenomena" — in space, in the air, on land, or in the sea — that may threaten national security. The term UAP replaces the traditional "unidentified flying object" or UFO designation, as officials expect to evaluate anomalies "across all domains.".
Would it be a UAP..? I thought for it to be classified as a UFO, they had to be manned by someone..? I could be wrong. Would have been cooler if it was a UFO, tbh.
