Utah has a long long way to go but lawmakers in a state that deep red opening a dialogue with the LGBTQ community and trying to find workable solutions that do less harm is a rare, though admittedly small, positive step.
It was never about dialogue with the LGBTQ. And it is patently absurd to paint them as anything other then duplicitous, evil fuckers.

I wonder how many will be attributed to the real cause. I don't see anything being done right in Utah. Right down to their conversion therapy law. I'm a victim. It is torture. I've had several surgeries to repair the damage and I've got a lot of scars.
That's bullshit, though. They've done irrevocable harm to trans kids by preventing them from receiving the medical care they need. If they gave a fuck about a dialogue with the LGBTQ community, they would have consulted them first before ever embarking on legislation like that.
