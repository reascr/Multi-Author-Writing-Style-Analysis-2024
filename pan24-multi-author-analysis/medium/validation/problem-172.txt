I don't disagree that CNN has a heavy lean often these days and I dislike biased media coverage, but that video is itself HILARIOUSLY biased and full of lean and misinformation. For starters, the viewership stat is completely cherry picked (the same day on the calender can have completely different levels of news depending on the year) CNN viewership has declined massively, but not by 90%. Nor are they at 50k\ viewers, they're at about 639k viewers during prime time hours (again, still massively down, but not to the level he's pretending). The worst part is the segment on Trump, he talks about Trump being anti big business and I just couldnt help but break out fucking laughing. Trump IS big business and one of his only actual notable policy changes while in charge was corporate tax cuts, seriously what sort of ridiculously biased video are you linking?
Just like how "literally" began to be used almost like 'figurately' and became accepted in the past 10-15 years, I unfortunately see the same outcome for 'slams'.
'slams" is such a childish use of words and I can't believe Reuters used it. It feels like something gossip news sites would use. Unfortunately, many or most reputable news agencies are also increasingly using it.
