The perception by the west and the world in general was of this powerful military machine ranked 2nd or 3rd as one if the most powerful and more disciplined militaries in the world. Large grand military parades showing off hundreds of tanks and missiles etc. It would be safe to say how shocked many off us are at how incompetent and very ordinary the Russian army and airforce are. That they failed miserably in their invasion attempt and have only just after 7 months had to resort to a desperate national mobilisation to support a laughable "special military operation" that is collapsing at the edges daily. It's shows that the Russians are no match for a motivated and western trained Ukraine with mostly Soviet weapons ( with western appliances as well but still predominantly Soviet era) let alone ever becoming a threat to a western army.
Ukraine has a crazy WW2 history too. They have the 3rd highest casualty rate of any group within the combined Soviet Red Army. The only groups with higher rates was Belarus. Followed by Soviet Jews.
The reason Soviet Jews top the list is because they as often had to fight off the Soviets in addition to the Nazis. So many chose to blend in with their local nationalities.
Their main fallback, which they seem to acknowledge is that they are no match for Nato at all and have had to resort to nuclear threats ... and so quickly.
If Ukraine can stomp out a Russian invasion just imagine how Russia would actually fare against the combined might of the West. If they didn't have Nukes they'd have nothing.
