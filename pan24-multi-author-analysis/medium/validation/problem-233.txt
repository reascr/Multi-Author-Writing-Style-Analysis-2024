I just hope that as we get better data we can converge a little more on what works and what doesn't rather than retreating to pure ideological or identity based reasoning. Reality is complicated and messy. Simple, elegant solutions never work no matter how much I, personally, wish that we could fix everything by simply converting to a Negative Income Tax and roll capital gains into this new income tax while putting in place a nationwide Land Value Tax to further punish absentee landowners. I recognize that such a plan would solve one set of problems while creating a completely separate set.
It's clear in hindsight that Reagan's policies were poorly designed. There just wasn't enough reliable data to call it in advance. A lot of people did call it, but there just wasn't enough real data to say for certain. I think that something like what Reagan did would have been a good idea given the problems face at the time, but not specifically what he did.
A couple in Florida showed up at Bank of America with deputies and a moving van to seize the bank's property when their phone calls and letters were ignored. I hope Australians can do something similar.
