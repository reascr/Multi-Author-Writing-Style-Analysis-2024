Hunter's people asked that the interview concentrate on his art, his recovery as an addict and how his art is helping him. They didn't want this to be political at all.
One user jumped in and asked him about Sam Bankman-Fried's donations to Democrats, which I presume Hunter has no clue about. The host removed the person asking the idiotic question and Hunter continued to speak. Then Hunter's connection went out or a glitch with Twitter Spaces likely kicked him out. It's possible he left, but likely not the case.
