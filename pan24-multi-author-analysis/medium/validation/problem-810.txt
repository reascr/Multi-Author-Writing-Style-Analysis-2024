"De Facto" literally means not in accordance to law, but effectively the same. Nearly every single NATO member is providing military assistance to Ukraine. The effective difference between the aid they are retrieving and full NATO membership could be debatable since NATO doesn't require member nations to send ground forces or control airspace or even declare war with the invading nation.
If article 5 is invoked all of the members of NATO will come to the attacked country’s defense with such action that they deem necessary. That have to contribute in one way or another but they are not all required to or expected to fully mobilize their militaries and send them to war because there are NATO members whose militaries are irrelevant. Like… if NATO went to war with Russia a country like Croatia really has nothing meaningful to contribute militarily so they would find other ways to contribute.
If somehow the U.S. congress and president justified to themselves that 'thoughts and prayers' were deemed 'necessary', then maybe. Article 5 does say that member nations should act in sufficient capacity as if they were themselves attacked.
In a capacity as if my own country were attacked would mean boots on the ground and planes in the sky. I can't imagine it would be much different for any nation.
Nothing other than undermining the entire alliance and making the sitting leadership look weak or pro-Russian. NATO membership is a stepping stone to hosting troops in an allied nation though, which would mean that an aggressive nation would have to attack NATO troops in order to invade them. Which would almost certainly bring the US into a war. US troops are deployed in the Baltic States, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania so Russia can't attack those countries without attacking the US.
I think the real military actions in case of an article 5 would be far more robust in reality than what is currently being done for Ukraine. However, in a situation where all the members of NATO wanted to avoid direct confrontation but still abide by the terms, the situation in Ukraine would be comparable.
Ukraine is not an anything member of NATO and the fact that the Russian soldiers in Ukraine are still alive makes that obvious. Your application for NATO was rejected years ago, we are being nice and helping but don’t confuse this for something that it’s not. Not being a dick but we’re not friends with Ukraine we just really don’t like Russia.
