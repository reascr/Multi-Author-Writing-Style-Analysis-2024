I feel like teachers should all be treating this like a health and safety issue, and taking a stance that this isn't their responsibility or purview: if the state wants to classroom, go ahead, but they shouldn't be risking a felony over failure to remove a book in a building filled with books. Florida schools should be closed until the government's done burning books.
It blows my mind that a book that was required reading for me also in my (non-Florida) high school is now legitimately a felony for a teacher to teach about in Florida. What a weird fucking world we live in.
