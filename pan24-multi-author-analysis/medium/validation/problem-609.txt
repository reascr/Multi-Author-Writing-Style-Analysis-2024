Indeed. I’m factoring that into my hope that a jury will see all that nonsense as willful ignorance and convict anyway. Manafort got his trial moved out of DC to a somewhat friendlier area, and had one (maybe two) MAGA-hat-wearing jurors who did not want to convict Trump’s friend and believed Mueller was on a Russia-hoax-witch-hunt. But those prosecutors hammered the documentary evidence all day, every day, and got the conviction despite that prejudice. One of those jurors even asked Trump on national television not to undo their verdict with a pardon. Trump himself on trial is another matter, but I still have hope. ).
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
