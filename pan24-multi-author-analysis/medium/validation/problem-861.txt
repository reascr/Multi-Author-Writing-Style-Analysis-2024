All he has to do with the Jan 6th prosecution is relax. The DOJ took over 2 years to do anything. A special counsel takes another couple of years on average, which given the number of charges, the huge amount of phone data and testimony sounds about right. Then if they decide to indict it's another year to come to trial. The trial itself will take months and Trump's lawyers will delay at every turn. Then of course he will appeal and appeal and appeal. So he hasn't got much to worry about because he will probably be dead by the time it comes to anything.
