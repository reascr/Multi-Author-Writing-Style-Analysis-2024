The MIGOP decided that the Trump-endorsed person who lost by 9 points statewide wasn't crazy enough, so they went with the person who lost by 14 points statewide and is a literal psychopath. Brilliant.
It will be some Qtip bark at the moon lunatic for sure! Dems will landslide their candidate into office regardless of who it is.

I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, the fair redistricting laws have been a godsend for this state. I hope all the other states get something similar soon.
Michigan's governorship tends to swap back and forth between R and D whenever the incumbent runs into term limits and can't run any more. That will most likely happen again, unless the R stays on their batshit insane course.
I mean the choice will be between an election denier fascist nutcase or an actual human being in touch with reality on planet earth!
Yep, the Michigan GOP coasted by thanks entirely to gerrymandering thanks to luckily being in power during restricting the past 3 times before the independent redistricting commission. Now that they actually have to run competitive races, coupled with their lurch even further to the right, finally broke their disastrous reign in this state.
