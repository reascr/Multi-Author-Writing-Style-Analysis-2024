When I was in high school, we had a young republican's club, and they were all well groomed kids from upper-middle to upper class families who were all conservative leaning. They weren't bad kids or anything(this was in the 90's), and at the time, there wasn't this hyper-racist sentiment running through the republican ranks like we see today. Of the ones that I have heard about since then, the ones that went to college mostly turned liberal sometime in the early 2000's. I don't know of any from that club that didn't go to college.
Wouldn't surprise me. Around the time of the Roe overturn we watched the movie Citizen Ruth from back in the 90s. Burt Reynolds swarmy Christian leader character definitely was grooming his "adopted" son. Some shit never changes.
