I agree with the other poster who hasn’t lost their dismay toward the perps and would allow them to apologize to the country, ask for forgiveness or risk losing citizenship.
I think they see it and that they don’t care. Republicans have doubled down on authoritarianism, racism, and bigotry at every single turn. It’s not a mistake or lack of recognition they know they are the bad guys and they don’t care. They only care about enforcing their narrow and bigoted worldview on everyone else. We have to fight back against this shit in every single way possible.
