You really think that NATO would sit idly in a war if Turkey is conquered and occupied if they loose a war of aggression?
The article does a good job of Sweden acquiescing to Turkey's demands, including handing over a 'terrorist' and dropping its arms export ban to Turkey, even as Turkey continues to make humiliating demands: firing a minister who attended a PKK rally ten years ago; demanding the names of rally attendees who criticized Erdogan; demanding the extradition of people who were granted asylum decades ago.
Not exactly, the difference between Turkey and Russia is Turkey can invade/oppress/kill foreign countries under the shield of NATO retaliation if it goes badly.
If an alliance that the country that is being invaded calls their allies to war and they declare war on Turkey do you think that will trigger Article 5?
Headline quotes an opinion piece columnist. Maybe it's my US politics exposure clouding this, but pundits spouting BS about opposition party politics doesn't seem terribly novel.
>In September Sweden lifted the arms export ban to Turkey, and in August it agreed to hand over a man whose name featured on Turkey’s “terrorist” list. The Swedish government insisted, however, that the handover was in line with regular legal proceedings, and that the decision to extradite the man had not been influenced by Sweden’s aspirations to join NATO.
