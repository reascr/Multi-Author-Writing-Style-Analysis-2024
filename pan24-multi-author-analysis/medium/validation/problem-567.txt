No. Robbers want quick, easy and no trouble. Think about it. You think people actually break in to homes where people are asleep anymore? Oh hell no. And with the amount of doorbell cameras, wifi cameras, fucking cameras the look like the head of a screw, there simply isn't as much crime as the used to be. You don't have anything to be scared of. Not really. The odds are so low bookies would laugh at you. Plus, most robberies these days happen during the day, while you're at work. then they can steal your gun too!
What these gun nuts so scared of? I don't own a gun and I'm not scared to be in my house at night. Crimes rates are going down, everywhere. Stop being such wimps. Fight intruders hand to hand like an adult.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
