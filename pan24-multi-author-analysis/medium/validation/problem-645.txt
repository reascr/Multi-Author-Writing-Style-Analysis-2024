Part of a renewed effort to strenhen British-Japanese relations. Another big part being the Japanese and British defence industries merging their respective sixth-gen fighter projects into a single platform. That will provide a huge boost to its viability and affordability.
No problem. I believe it is meant to play into the 2021 British Integrated Defence Review’s plan for an “Indo-Pacific tilt” due to the region’s growing importance to the world both geopolitically and economically.
Another aspect of this is the permanent basing of two Royal Navy patrol vessels in the Pacific. They have conducted myriad visits and exercises to invigorate British influence and soft power.
Always found it quite amusing how both the Mongol invasion of Japan and the Spanish Armada's invasion of England where ultimately defeated by storms in the end.
The defence review is currently being redrafted in the wake of the Ukraine invasion but I think it would be extremely foolish to pull back from “East of Suez” once again and have all that effort be for nothing. Either way, post-Brexit, there is a strong impetus to forge stronger alliances with nations in the region. This has come in the form of Japanese and Australian Free Trade Agreements, AUKUS and the Tempest project but also the UK’s application to join the CPTPP Pacific trading bloc. Interesting times ahead for sure.
