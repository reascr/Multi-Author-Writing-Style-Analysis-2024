Barrett is bad for the court because she's an under qualified puppet that was just picked by Trump getting blindfolded in a room full of Republicans and spinning around while pointing.

He strikes me as a guy who I can have disagreements with but still respect. I personally don’t think originalism is the proper interpretive method for the Constitution, but I understand why Gorsuch does and I don’t think he’s inherently bad for the country the way Thomas and Alito and Barrett are.
