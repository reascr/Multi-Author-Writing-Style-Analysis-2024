If we're speaking about the Israeli government ignoring/disregarding a "two state solution", that's been going on since they were founded. They took a lot of land that the 1947 UN Resolution 181 had set aside for a "future" Palestinian state during the 1947-1948 Palestinian Civil War.
The Camp David Accords during the Carter administration achieved a peace with Egypt, but left the Palestinians still in limbo.
And before anyone goes "But the Arabs refused to sign the agreement", of course they did! There were no representatives from the Palestinians brought to the table. The Israeli's had people sitting at the table representing their interest. They had lobbyist groups fighting hard to push for the creation of Israel. And at the end, they got like 90% of what they wanted, where as the Palestinians got nothing other then being told they had to leave their land that in some cases their family had lived on for hundreds of years.
As for the Camp David Accords, peace with Egypt was inevitable. Egypt wrecked Israel in the 1973 Yom Kipper War, and as much as Israel likes to claim they were winning at the end, they were burning themselves thin. Their southern forces were practically wiped out, where as the Egyptians still had plenty of forces, albeit separated and fighting independently from one another, still making plenty of headway by the time a truce was called.
Because the Oslo Accords provided almost nothing in terms of concrete defensible borders of a Palestinian state. Israel gave a wink and a nod to the Palestinian National Authority then steamrolled - literally - through the West Bank and Gaza anyway.
