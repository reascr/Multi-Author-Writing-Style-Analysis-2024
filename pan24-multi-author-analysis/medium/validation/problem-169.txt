It should be obvious at this point. It's estimated that the Saudi Royals are worth over $1 Trillion. US politicians are completely bought out at this point, they bend over backwards for that dirty oil money.
I still don’t understand why the oil companies and military industrial complex allow them to exist. It’s not like they do anything for the world except sit on oil, and the USA has completely toppled governments for far less.
SA would be gone in less than a week and their entire royal family captured and sitting in Guantanamo Bay, then Exxon would have exclusive right or whatever they bribed congress into giving them.
> That unease was not only due to the prince’s involvement in Khashoggi’s murder, the judge wrote, but also the timing of his appointment as prime minister of Saudi Arabia. Bin Salman, known as MBS, was only made prime minister – and therefore the technical head of the government – in late September in what observers saw as a ploy to secure head of government immunity in the lawsuit brought by Hatice Cengiz and Khashoggi’s advocacy group DAWN.
