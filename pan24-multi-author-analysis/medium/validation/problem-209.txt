I know the article seems obvious but it’s important to have such hard evidence before placing blame. Chemical analysis of the spent explosives might also indicate where it was made or which countries have devices using it.
What I don’t get is why they don’t just look at satelite images what vessels were there and then trace back what port they came from.
My first instinct was always Russia did it, but I have to admit I’m starting get doubts now. Starting to smell like a cover up to me.
Do they take photos way out in the ocean from satellites? I mean they could, but if it's not standard and they didn't have a reason to be doing so, there might not be any. But I have no idea, that's just a guess. I feel like if they had imagines of the culprit this would have gone way differently.
There has already been news that there are satellite pictures that show these vessels. A private firm came out saying they had some, and I’d say you can bet the spy satellites have them too then. No further news or any mention of it since then.
