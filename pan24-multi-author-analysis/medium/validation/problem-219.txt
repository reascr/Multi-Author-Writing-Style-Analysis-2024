Water is a massive barrier to military operations. Neither Napoleon or Hitler could cross the twenty odd miles of the English Channel to Britain. Cost both of them. Russia has put some of their best troops on the right bank of the Dnieper with only two real bridges to supply them - the Ukrainians have targeted both of those with lots of artillery making them basically unusable. An army requires a massive amount of material - Russia can’t deliver enough so their troops are gradually being strangled. Their best option is to pull back to the left bank to improve their supply lines and also put the river between them and the AFU. Hitler made a similar mistake in WWII, he refused to retreat and tried to make a stand west of the Rhine - the Allies beat the snot out of the Wehrmacht. One of the great strategic blunders of all time. Putin has been fighting this war on political priorities and assumptions, retreating from Kherson is a sound military strategy, but politically very very unpalatable. That’s what part of the struggle has been the last couple of months, the Russian military has been hamstrung on several occasions by political priorities. Now, they’re colossally incompetent in multiple areas, but having a desk jockey trying to fight a war is a universally bad idea.
Man, Bosnia still had exploding land mines at least 16 years after the war. Rogue, callous disregard for innocents is poison. I hope clearing goes quickly.
