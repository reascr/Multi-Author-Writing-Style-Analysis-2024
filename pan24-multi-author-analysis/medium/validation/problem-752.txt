Hopefully enough Russians who don't want a nuclear war will remain behind because I'd hate to think of what might happen if those responsible for manning their nuclear arsenal get replaced with fanatics.
In RuZZia's perspective as , the word Nazi means anyone that is against Russia. Hence why Putin and his band of shitty people that should be hanged from the nearest street lamp can accuse the Jews of being Nazis. You're not dealing with logical actors, you're dealing with crazy idiots that may as well be an incontinent cow after weeks of eating Taco Bell in regard to all the shit that comes out of them.
I mean, if they were all fanatics there wouldn't be so many deserters, defectors, saboteurs or people who used to protest Putin until they felt they couldn't win against him anymore.
Bruh when Ukraine hit Engels Airbase the staff there wrote "destroy Nazis" on the tarmac. These aren't rational people, Russians have never been rational or proactive people in general.
There was a Russian Christmas propaganda video circling about recently, and it immediately reminded me of that song. You can see right through their facade.
Oh definitely many were. My point was that not every single Russian is a fanatic, and as long as enough of those along the chain of command that would be used to launch their nuclear arsenal don't want to die it could potentially prevent a nuclear holocaust. If every single person on that chain is fanatically loyal to Putin it's far more likely that a nuclear exchange might happen if Putin ordered it.
It hasn't but it's not like they wont know if you defect or run away, there is nothing to lose by saying "I left Russia for X reason" or whatever.
In reality these claims along with those espousing Putin having cancer rely almost entirely on conjecture perpetrated by less than reliable news sources(tabloids).
Yeah they are so scared of being poisoned they flee the country and give sensitive information to foreign governments, makes sense.
But think about it like this, if things like this were happening in the Russian top brass on a large scale then what excuse would Russians have not to protest? If his claims are true then Russians are fully culpable for what is happening and are not oppressed whatsoever.
Depends on if Russians accept the prolonged sanctions or not, so far the reaction has been moderate to apathetic.
