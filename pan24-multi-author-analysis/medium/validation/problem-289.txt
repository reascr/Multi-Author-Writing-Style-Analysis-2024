See, when I first heard about this I assumed it was all federal programs, that is, all stuff that is obviously part of every year's budget. Hence Medicare, Social Security, the navy (wtf? Now there is a specific exclusion for the navy? Guess that's the only branch of the armed forces he cares about?) but actual laws that are enforced by agencies wouldn't be part of this nonsense. So, like, tax breaks? Yeah. Legal requirements to file taxes and the ability for the IRS to audit (only the poor)? Nope, that's safe.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

With the GOP's proven legislative efficiency I'm sure they'll have no trouble keeping up with 3, maybe 4 sunsetted laws per year.
