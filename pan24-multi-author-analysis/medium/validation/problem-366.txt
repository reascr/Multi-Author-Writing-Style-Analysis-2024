We experienced an elderly family member who chose to pass on their own terms via the MAID program. There are many misconceptions about how it works. It took multiple months of interviews and assessments with physicians, counselors, and nurses before approval. Canadians are not going to just walk into a MAID clinic, fill out some paperwork and die. Depending on circumstances it can be the most beautiful, dignified way a loved one can pass.
If ever I decide I truly need to find my own way out, this would not be it. I wouldn't be able to tolerate the first two appointments, let alone all the rest.
So you're saying you want people to be able to kill themselves without seeking any help? You just reinforced the reason why we mandate tests before allowing people to proceed.
Agree. Witnessing my family member jump through all the hoops was an emotional roller coaster. He qualified - then didn’t - then did - then tried suicide -didn’t work - then when just days from a natural death, the MAID team approved and his suffering was over.
