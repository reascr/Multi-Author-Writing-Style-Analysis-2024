I know people who worked in the ministries of Indigenous Affairs (both provincial and federal). The tribes that manage it well, do it REALLY well. The ones that don't...they tend to be the ones on the news a lot.
That's why whenever the gov't just throws money at the problem, I roll my eyes and shrug. It won't help as much as people think. And when it's even suggested that those problems need to be tackled, the ones at risk of being exposed will often be the loudest to cry out about the injustices and use the past as a shield.
Sadly, they are not immune from the problems of governance: corruption, greed, nepotism, and prefferential treatment.
It makes me sad when I think about it because there is no easy solution nor is there a solution that everyone will be happy with.
Agreed, however that is their affair to handle. They do not want government support or projects (for often good reasons) so the govt is now tryi g to deal with each nation as it's own nation. This makes projecta very slow but does build trust in our institutions and helps our relationships with these nations. I hope it all gets invested wisely but as you said people are people.
Insofar as it's their affairs to handle; there are MANY situations where the gov't provided funding for a project that their leadership wanted to handle. They then went "no more money, need more" but somehow, their leadership became considerably more well off.
The government is actually contractually restrained from doing a lot of the things that would help because of NAFTA or whatever the new abberation is called. Basically, our military has the engineering knowledge and ability but that would put the gov't in a position of competing in "possibly lucrative" projects. It's quite messed up as far as that goes.
There are no easy answer, like I said above. I don't know if just throwing money at them and letting them keep screwing over their own people really is the answer though. There's real suffering going on while rich people do rich people things. Like I said, there are large examples across canada of nations really doing it right. But there are some that break my heart when I hear what's happening because it's not for lack of resources, I assure you.
Oh I agree, however corruption is a human problem and it is not the govt of Canada's role to manage the 600ish first nations territories eithin the larger borders. They want autonomy and so they somewhat have it. Its up to them to change for themselves. Investing in community services and local businesses could help a lot of people.
One community I worked with had communal businesses including a gas station and a fishing boat (I do mean a modern boat with hydrolics and whatnot) as long as it is reinvested into the community so they can grow its a good thing.
Typically when communities have investment they tend to grow. Some corruption is inevitable but thays a human problem in general.
I agree. It does become the govt's problem when they turn around and put out public blasts saying they're not being helped though. It's a situation of them wanting their cake and to eat it too. But that is hardly unique to this situation, when you look at the world as a whole.
The money for that stuff is already budgeted. Government spends over $20 billion a year on that stuff.
The programs of the ladt decade have been very successful. A lot of the ear marked money for housing and education is never actually given out to anyone and just sits ther ebeing earmarked.
The one positive thing this MIGHT do is help build some degree of trust between the federal government and indigenous communities, because that's probably the biggest hindrance to good governance.
Now it's about building strong working relationships between government agencies and indigenous communities. They've been mistreated for so long it's understandable they are hesitant, but the feds just throwing dump trucks of money at them and covering their eyes is no solution.
I think there is a mixed approach method being used for the water filtration plants and other projects. Its very slow going and im not sure all the funds have been spent. Its now funded by the fed but deals with the first nations on their terms.
Money does make a difference. As soon as Edenburgh starting investing in Ireland people could get the money they needed and the potato famine ended and people began starting small businesses and expanding productivity again. The wealth of nations was a popular book at the time and was used to justify the ruining of that state, when more investments happened the peasants began to have money to invest and improve their lot.
Fundamentally though, the government is still committing cultural genocide to this day. Sure, kids aren't being taken to TB-infested boarding schools, but their education remains completely Western-style (not to mention nearly all post-secondary institutions retain white colonialist structures, methods, and knowledge). Kids no longer need to cut their hair, but they're still largely trained to think and act like good European subjects, which is arguably the more important aspect of culture (rather than aesthetics).
