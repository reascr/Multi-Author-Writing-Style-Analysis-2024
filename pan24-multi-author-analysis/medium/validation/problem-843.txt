Idaho, Iowa, Missouri have bills to criminalize librarianship for providing books that offer views of equality. Idaho's bill failed in the state Senate. Even in places like New Jersey and New York, libarians have been attacked by right-wing extremists. Trump and the Republican party unleashed this and DOJ is not doing much to stop it. As a retired librarian, I have seen attempts at censorship before in my career, but nothing like this. This is organized hate.
