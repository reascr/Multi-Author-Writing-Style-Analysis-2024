And it's going to get a LOT tougher still in a few weeks when the expected massive offense is going to start.
Russians don't seem too bothered taking all those losses, I wonder how much longer the Ukranians can keep it up.
Tge losses are tough to follow because each side has its own inflated numbers of the other and reduced numbers for themselves. Russia has 3 times the population though. That said, invaders always lose more. It's a fkn mess.
Honestly this is very serious. A war of attrition favours Russia due to population size. This has happened basically like I thought it would.... Russia rush in but don't achieve decapitation strike western help and intel allows a counterstrike, but Russia digs in and galvanises its resources. They're talking 500k troops. If we use history as our guide then we know when Russia is at war they will not cave in due to troop losses, no way. My belief is this will get extremely serious. We are sending Serious weapons intel and money, and Ukraine are hyper invested and focused. Russia is also fully invested and about to have another push. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the Ukrainian line cracks soon. That said, Russia may not be able to capitalise on a breakthrough because of the weapons, supply, tactics and intel we send.
