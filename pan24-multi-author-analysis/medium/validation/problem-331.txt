Also, currently the UK's government has a lot of positions that are basically just legacy positions from the days of monarchy. While maintaining these positions is likely pointless at best, and a drain on public resources at worst, they are nonetheless representative of some sort of cultural continuity with the UK of the past.
So I guess I'd be curious to hear from Brits how much cultural continuity they would like to keep. Could the royals and all of the nobility be removed and lowered to the same as the rest of the citizenry? Should the class of nobles and royals become even more symbolic by, for example, electing a representative and simply calling them King or Queen and pretending? Or should a singular family, by mere quirk of parentage, be propped up as a national symbol to be argued over in perpetuity?
They can propose amendments if they want, they don't have to be accepted though. The House of Commons has all of the power, the HoL can delay certain legislation, but really that's all it can do.
