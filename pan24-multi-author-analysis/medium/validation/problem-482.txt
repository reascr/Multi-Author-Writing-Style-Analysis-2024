No, see, public service is a compulsion to continue serving the public and trying to run for office endlessly despite the public not wanting you there. Itâ€™s what a hero does.
I actually said exactly that to my mom last night. We both agreed he's probably going to want a woman, because that's what Biden did. The problem with Marjorie and Kari Lake is just that they're as loud and nuts as he is, so they'll be in the news stealing some of his spotlight constantly, which he definitely couldn't handle. Pence was perfect for that because he's so boring that no one outside of Indiana ever even remotely cared about his existence, but that ship has sailed so now he has to find someone else that's an enabler willing to put up with his shit, while still being lowkey enough to not overshadow him.
