I wish every reporter would press each GOP politician who criticized Biden over this and ask them if they think the President should’ve gone against the advice of our top military and intelligence officials last week. But of course a lot these people did all this from their safe zones (Fox News, Newsmax, tweets, truth social) so they wouldn’t have to answer to that.
It’s really fucking stupid that Republicans were/are bashing Biden over that whole thing. Biden obviously listens and respects what the top military and intelligence officials were telling him him after it was spotted, and he was going to take their recommendations and advice on it, which is what he did.
I’m not a fan of Biden at all, but from what I gather he waited for his briefing by intelligence agencies and then took recommended action.
