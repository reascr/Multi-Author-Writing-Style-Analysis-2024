I'm beginning to form the opinion that the American people done deserve things like Healthcare, a living wage and a fair tax structure, etc if they won't even vote in a way that's obvious to facilitate these things. I don't want to feel that way but I'm starting to. Anyone with half a brain and the most rudimentary of googling skills can debunk nearly all republican lies and propaganda and yet election cycle after cycle more and more average people (not your typical republican zealots) allow themselves to be duped. I grow ever increasingly tired of it. I grow tired of advocating for the benefit of the poor and working class that seemingly can't be bothered to educate themselves on a basic level to do it themselves. I'M on the pathway to success (nearly a 6 figure income in my 20s). I WILL NOT be needing social security and Medicare when I retire. I'M gonna be more than fine. It's THEM who needs these programs and yet these same people in the working class continue to vote republican and corporate shill democrats thereby fucking themselves over and then wondering why their lives remain shit.
