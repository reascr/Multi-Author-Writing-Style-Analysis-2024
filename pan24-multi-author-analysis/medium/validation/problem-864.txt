Ehh honestly this won’t be a popular opinion but largely with roads and schools I think the biggest issue isn’t funding, it’s refusal to fire bad employees. Throughout my schooling we had some absolutely amazing teachers, and some teachers that couldn’t teach a damn thing. We had teachers that were clearly checking out underage students, flirting, and grooming and nothing was ever done about it, and I only heard of one teacher getting fired. What did she do? Come in on drugs for years, talk about her abuse at the hands of her bf with middle schoolers (get the help you need but for the love of god don’t tell children), and what actually got her fired was they found out her teaching degree was fake, and she didn’t know Spanish very well after teaching Spanish for years.
The problem with that line of argument is that those same conservatives that point to those problems as why we shouldn’t help Ukraine, will then turn around and vote against doing anything to address any of those problems.
Very small amount of conservatives like Putin, most just don’t think Ukraine is our problem or responsibility to deal with. We have a failing school system, crumbling roads and other forms of infrastructure, and enough problems here that a. Lot of conservatives don’t think we should waste money on other countries.
