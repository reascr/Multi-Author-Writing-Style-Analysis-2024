It's a no-brainer that these people are using them, simply because of the utility, GPS(!), and communication, plus they provide entertainment for people who could be out there doing literally nothing for hours. I do wonder if they'll suffer the same side effects of GPS tech that we do, though, where a lot of people have lost the ability to navigate and stopped learning streets/routes due to reliance on GPS, which isn't a bad thing for us but is a bit sad in the context of people that have been there in those lands for ages.
Because everywhere else conservatives are actual conservatives who wanted gradual progress and not just rebranded fascists that want to undermine democracy. The actual conservatives in the US is the Democratic Party.
And they don't identify themselves as conservatives. That's the problem with you Americans. You guys think every right-wing parties as fascists and every left-wing parties as commies. You guys think the others as extremists so you go the other way even harder. It's just self-fulfilling prophecies at this point.
