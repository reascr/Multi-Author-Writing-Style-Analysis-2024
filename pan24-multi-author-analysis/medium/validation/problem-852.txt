You see, as soon as they have enough fissile material it becomes quite easy (for a State, mind you) to make a bomb. Also, bombs are relatively small, so easy to hide. A military nuclear program can only be stopped by military means if it is in the production of fissile material stage, as the Israelis did before with Iraq and Syria. After that it is fait acompli.
If you have enough enriched Uranium or Plutonium making a bomb is very easy. For an individual even.
It is easy to create an inefficient bomb that fizzes a bit and makes a lot of mess. There is a lot more complexity to creating an efficient bomb that has a decent yield (neutron reflectors, etc).
It's basically 1/2 the fuel in a bowl shape, 1/2 in a sphere to fit the bowl and slam them together hard. 15-20m of gravity is enough energy.
What he said is correct, but it wouldn't be a very impressive explosion. The reason nuclear weapons are complex is that getting decent yields is somewhat difficult (and pretty much all classified). Plutonium is bloody hard to machine as well.
