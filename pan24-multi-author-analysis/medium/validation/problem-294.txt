International competition can be a good and bad thing. Somaliland has made clever use of China/US tensions by openly supporting Taiwan in a bid for US support. Elsewhere I imagine if you're a leader who wants better terms for Chinese investment, you could play up the threat of going to the US or France.
If you find yourself in a fair fight, something has gone wrong. If you find yourself on the wrong side of an unfair fight, something has gone terribly wrong.
The thing is, schoolyard, boxing ring, etc. is waaaayy different than the struggle of nations. Second place is, to put it mildly, unpleasant. All we have to do is look at what the Russians are doing in Ukraine now. Or in Poland and Germany in 1939 & 1945 respectively. Or the Japanese for decades. Or, or, or… Hell, the Assyrians were such violent evil assholes they still have a reputation thousands of years later. And they haven’t mattered in thousand of years. Think about that.
In the course of my life I have had a few fights, including as an adult. Do not recommend. But, I have tried my damndest to make sure I had the advantage. All the advantage. All of it. Why? Because losing is awful.
