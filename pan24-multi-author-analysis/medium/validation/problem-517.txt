Every time I follow a link to Twitter it's nothing but a cess pool. I'm not LGBTQ+ and I just don't care how people conduct themselves as long as they're not harming others. I can't imagine getting so mad about this that you show up and yell at strangers. No one has ever demonstrated how a person reading a book to a child hurts them. It just makes me think these protesters are the actual pedos / self-loathers. They hate that aspect of themselves but take it out on others. Admitting they have unresolved issues is too painful.
you have to be in a crazy state of mind to observe kids doing normal activities and go strait to sex and sexual abuse.
i was shopping for a hula hoop for my kids on amazon, came across one, noticed the reviews were all about the marketing photo of a kid and then there was a discussion about how it's sexualizing, etc. the photo on amazon had been removed by the time i came about it, but i found it on the brand's website and it was just a kid in a normal gym outfit posing with the hula hoop.
