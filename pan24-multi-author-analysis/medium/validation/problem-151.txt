“Our use of the lowercase for adjectives such as “english,” “christian,” “protestant,” “catholic,” “european,” “spanish,” and “american” is intentional.
While the noun might be capitalized out of some respect, using the lowercase allows us to avoid any unnecessary normalizing or universalizing of the principal institutional, political, or social quotient of the euro-west.
Paradoxically, we insist on capitalizing the “w” in White (adjective or noun) to indicate a clear cultural pattern invested in Whiteness that is all too often ignored or even denied by American Whites.” (Tink Tinker and Mark Freeland, 44).
> In the beginning there was nothing then God created White Rich America and it was good. Satan couldn't allow America to be good so he dropped the Poor Non-Whites on us to tempt us with sin and it was bad.
