They adopted colour quotas for the staff of the power stations and other grid staff, fired many of the experienced staff solely because they were white, and are now struggling to maintain the grid.
Power stations which are (well, were) perfectly capable of operating are not actually generating power now because they were not maintained and are now broken most of the time.
That's coupled with laws which basically grant a countrywide monopoly to one company and massively disincentivise or ban all other forms of power generation, including private.
Completely true, white are basically disenfranchised by the government in SA. They mostly work for private companies as state ones don't employ many. It's shocking we don't face sanctions really for blatant racism.
