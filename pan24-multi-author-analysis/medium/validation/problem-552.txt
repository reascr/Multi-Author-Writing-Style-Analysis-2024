There are a few who put Ukrainian flags on their profile and support Ukraine - but others who either put blithering statements saying Ukraine should seek a 'Russian peace' or just support Putin. I'm still friends with any that support Ukraine, but the others can go get fucked. The worst offenders (that I know are still on Visas) I have reported to the government with screenshots of the hate speech. They are too stupid and just think they can post hate speech and call Ukrainians denigrating names on Facebook/Twitter/Telegram etc. without consequence. Hopefully the relevant Irish/British authorities will kick them out when their visas are up for renewal.
My Russian wife knows someone who has been told to book overseas travel for all their company's male employees within the next few days.
They tried to (illegally) serve my step-father-in-law a conscription notice. He's a 50-something year old lung cancer survivor who was last trained for war for a year under the Soviet Union in the 80s. He was at the DMV.
