“Putin told the Russian people that Kherson is part of Russia. Therefore, he will need a story (which may even include some facts) to justify the withdrawal and distract the domestic audience from it.”.
The article doesn’t mention what facts those might be. But it says it seems like Putin is setting up the military to be the scapegoat. And will continue attacking infrastructure with long range munitions to help distract from the loss of Kherson.
I mean by their logic Russia has just been invaded by a foreign nation right, which should mean they immediately declare war ... It's almost like they don't believe it themselves.
