I don't think Trump ought to call DeSantis Meatball Ron. Meatball Ron is an unfriendly name. Meatball Ron is undignified. Meatball Ron is not something you should call a governor. Meatball Ron is vague and indefinable. Meatball Ron could stick and hound the man forever. Meatball Ron could become how Floridians refer to their governor. Meatball Ron could become accepted through repetition rather than appropriateness. "Meatball Ron": what do you, as a Reddit user, really think about the name Meatball Ron? I bet Meatball Ron doesn't like it, but I like it, do you hear, Meatball Ron?
