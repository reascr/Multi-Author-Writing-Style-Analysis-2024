They made billions charging us to use the port of Karachi during 20 years in Afghanistan. Fuck Pakistan and their corrupt warlords and human rights abuses. Not to mention treating women like slaves.
It’s amazing how you can mention “human rights abuses” and the Afghan war in the same sentence an not have those connected. Home boy you were committing war crimes in Afghanistan in those 20 years. 95% civilian casualties in thousands of drone strikes. Brought pedophiles into the government there. Bush, Obama and Biden have been the most destabilizing administrations the world has seen since WW2.
Well we’ll what do you know a citizen of Pakistan. Did you know for 20 years your neighbors were sucking American credit cards? Sucking and begging for our cash? Hypocrites.
Yes, such an insightful commentary from our distinguished diplomat. US has lost 20 years and billions of dollars in Pak and Afg. If they still think it's a viable strategy to balance out India, they're blind to the fact that those economies of scale are vastly different in all major factors and are just pushing their money in a bottomless pit.
I’ll give you one point America does have a major cultural problem. We are losing our moral foundation we are losing our religion. I’ll give you that.
I’ll make you a deal. I’ll keep my promise. Never harbor terrorists that attack the USA. Never have the Pakistani Intel agencies support them with arms and weapons. In return I promise to be an advocate for peace.
