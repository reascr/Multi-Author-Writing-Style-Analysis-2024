apparently my English is really bad, I will write through a translator. the T14 is designed for a different engine, a new one, this engine is not being built now, there are no factory capacities, there are no long-term operational checks, there is a rather large complexity in manufacturing and operation. also with the transmission, the use of Western aiming systems and night vision systems can not even be remembered. it is radically different from the tanks of the 70 series. The T72 is still in service as the main battle tank, there are repair plants and well-known engines for it. the fact that the t14 was designed and there was enough knowledge and strenh for it - I do not dispute, but there is no capacity to manufacture a commercial quantity, there is no time to create these capacities either. I know about the continuity of generations in the development and production of tanks, as well as any other equipment. But the T14 is not the successor of the 70th series. Due to corruption and massive abuse of state subsidies, the Russian army does not have these tanks in service, plus global production problems. This is another beautiful picture from Russian propagandists and a story about the Great Army. In the army, there are not even enough underpants with socks, not to mention the t14.
They want to sell the tank abroad. With a selling price of 4 million usd it would be a disaster if it would spread on youtube how easily the ukrainians can take it out from a distance with a single javelin or something similar.
