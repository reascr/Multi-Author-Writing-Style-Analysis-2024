There were aspects of this that were both complicated and petty, on all sides. He was officially, at one point, King of Greece, which was a constitutional monarchy but did not have a merely ceremonial monarch at the time, and he didn't treat it simply as ceremonial, getting himself quite embroiled in political messes while being quite politically inept. Much of his life, even after being deposed, was heavily affected by political and diplomatic machinations involving him. There were significant impediments to him living a normal life, and in some sense, his grifting was one of the clearer options for him after being exiled. He was not simply part of the extensive worldwide royal-roleplaying community of descendants who style themselves with titles long abolished, keeping track themselves of make-believe lines of succession that, absent the decisive force of state power, inevitably end up splitting off into disputes that will never be resolved.
On the one hand, at one point, he was stateless, with his Greek citizenship revoked because, the Greek government stated, he couldn't be a Greek citizen because he didn't have a surname. On the other, he chose to continue to be stateless rather than ever adopting a surname. He lost most of his possessions and property (personal, not just state) fleeing a rather brutal and regressive military dictatorship that could well have killed him, but it was also his political ineptness that heavily contributed that dictatorship taking power. He spent much of his life trying to force Greece to give him huge amounts of money, property, and possessions, but then when he was able to get some comparatively small amount of money back through the ECHR, the Greek government made a bizarre and petty show of paying him by taking money out of a natural disasters fund. He continued to try to insist on getting property back that was dubiously personal rather than former crown property, but there were always rumours that Greek governments refused to give many of these not because they went to good state use, but because many things had disappeared into the hands of the well-connected during problematic periods of Greek history (not just a royalist rumour, and perhaps even more common amongst the left, because the dictatorship was far/weird-right). He was a figure that was known throughout Greece, but was also known more as a target of mockery than anything else. He wasn't the only person to continue to call himself King of Greece long after he was deposed; many Greeks did as well in some contexts, only, not with quite the same tone of voice or meaning.
wow great summary... the post war Greece Political theater was a flying circus. you had to think during policital studies classes in school back in my youth, that "this was the place where democracy started???" (my ancient history class was before PS class) ya the ancient world was a totally different animal, but it seem like it was way better then what was going on in Greece during the 60's-80's. between the assinations, corruptions, bombings, coups.. you think there wasnt any real goverment.
