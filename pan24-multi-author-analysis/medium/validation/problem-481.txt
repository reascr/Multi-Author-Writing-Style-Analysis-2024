I have this same question. Is it possible to have a declining workforce, and offset it completely with automation and other technology improvements? If that were possible, then the real question would become, what is the appropriate economic model for a world like that? For example, if all businesses had to give some % ownership to their city, more % to their province, and more % to the country (let’s say 5%, 10% and 15% respectively), would that kind of partial nationalization of businesses be helpful? The shares would be a special non-voting class that can’t be sold. Corporate tax would still be levied on revenues to give ongoing funding for Government programs, but each citizen would additionally have a tiny share of every business in the country, a slightly larger share in each business in the province, and a slightly larger share of local companies. As the collated dividend cheques come in, probably it would make people more business friendly and reduce nimbyism (not that that is a huge issue in China?). It also means that having more efficient companies and increasing automation would still benefit everyone, so long as total GDP is growing. The dividends would be paid to everyone over 18, and at some smaller rate for children, so their would still be incentive to work if you can still find a job.
Stagnate maybe but not dying, even if their population slowly declines in this century the wealth and industry they managed to build up in the last 30 years isn't going to magically evaporate. They may not overtake the USA in terms of global economic impact but they'll still be a competitive 2nd runner up.
