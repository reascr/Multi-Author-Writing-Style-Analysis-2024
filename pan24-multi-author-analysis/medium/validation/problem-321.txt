The problem w this is that it desensitizes normal people to brutality and when you do that you run the risk of rearing people in that society who are desensitized to brutality realizing they're desensitized and using that as a platform to elevate themselves.
As dumb as it sounds I think it is easier to maintain a civilized society if certain things are done behind closed doors.
It's why I think all executions should be broadcast to the public. The reality is that I support the death death penalty. However I feel like it should only be used in extreme cases. I also believe it would act as a better deterrent if video was publicly available.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Ninja edit: extreme and clear cases true no shadow of a doubt not the bullshit that happens now. Like mass shootings/terrorism and the like.
I'm with you on the death penalty. We fucking know nikolas Cruz did that shit. Take him in a room, spend 15 cents on a .22 round and be done with it. Then bury him in an unmarked grave. Maybe even in a mass grave where we just throw the worst of us to rot until there's nothing left.
It's even harder to come by if during your formative years your watched public executions instead of Disney movies. Or even regular adult movies where they pan away before the murder.
I am not one of those "boomers who think television makes people insensitive to violence" but I am. It doesn't make sane, rational, and/or empathetic people insensitive to violence. I believe that group of viewers is the majority but it also exposes the minority of psychopaths to that shit and makes them feel it's not profoundly abnormal.
If you took a sampling of popular movies, tv and rap/heavy rock music and shook it up you could dissect a murder a minute from what huge portions of our population pump into their brains when in reality almost none of us will ever experience an irl murder. That shit has been normalized by more than just the people doing it. It was normalized before that. And again, it doesn't just have to be acceptable to the common man to have an impact on society. It only needs to radicalize a few people out of hundreds of millions to have the impact we are feeling now.
