I also think that certain people/orgs within the US government knew about these much sooner than we know and the interesting part of this whole thing is not the occurrence, but what led to the decision to go public with this stuff now.
The US was almost certainly running a counter-intel operation against it. Probably not jamming per se as that might cause issues with critical infrastructure depending on what signals it was transmitting. But I think, with a reasonably high degree of certainty, that the US was trying to figure out what sort of information it was collecting and where it was sending it with SIGINT assets (both COMINT and ELINT) of our own. And there's probably a related HUMINT operation underway, too. And I have no doubt any other country in this situation would do the same.
