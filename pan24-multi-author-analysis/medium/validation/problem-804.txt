I have a small understanding so I say this not as humour but as an expression of my understand… agree or disagree tell me why… i wanna know.
Actually, Cuba has a reasonable supply of trained medical professionals, including doctors, that could help Russia out a lot, especially the wealthy types.That said, I don't know what Russia can send back that is worth a shit to the Cubans in any meaningful amounts.
Russia would have to tanker all that oil in so I don't see it. That said, I don't know if Cuba needs large amounts of fertilizer so that is on the table.
But are they even of use to each other… would it not just be both parties combining their problems? I believe they would try to use each-other to no ultimate gain.
Probably not going to happen after the Cuban governments reaction to the last protest. Disappearing citizens and long prison sentences for protests are not a good way to end an embargo.
Tourism was the country's primary revenue source, and COVID demolished that. But if you want a cheap vacation this winter, Cuba's cheaper than it has been in a long time, but be prepared for shortages.
Plus the Cubans in the US are people who have suffered extremely under the regime. From torture, long prison sentences, execution of family members.
