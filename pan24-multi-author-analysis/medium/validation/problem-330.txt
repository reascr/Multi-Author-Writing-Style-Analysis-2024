José Aldo is ridiculous, dude was born in poverty and suffered himself all the inequality this country has to offer, to what? To support Bolsonaro late in life. He totally forgot his roots, fuck him.

Yeah except brasil has a history of picking bad presidents. Also half of them are very right this time. Lula nearly destroyed the country last time he was in. It would be like if the UK re-elected Elizabeth Truss if she ran again.
Half of Brazilians think this is the greatest thing to happen in so long. The other half thinks this is the worst possible thing to happen.
Define conservative, that’s a pretty fucking broad term. Could mean anything from right of centre to deregulated free market hellscape. Why am I “conservative”? Because they represent my values and opinions better than progressives, they also have a far better understanding of the economy.
Because it’s very debatable if Lula was directly responsible for the economic progress in Brazil at the time and not because of the actions of the previous government of FHC.
However, I believe universities should be as cheap as possible, I believe information should be free to be shared as a collective instead of being hidden behind a stupid amount paywalls. I believe we should have social security nets to help people who fall onto hard times, god knows I sure did. I’m an atheist and I think religion should be completely fucked off from legal everything, religion should not play a part in laws ever (ironic considering the “god knows” last sentence). I believe abortion should be completely legal up until a point and after that point have progressively more restrictions placed on it, I do not believe “I changed my mind” is a valid reason for a third trimester abortion. I believe that if you’re gay and like dick then fucking go for it, same for lesbians, idgaf unless you’re sexually harassing me, but then the issue is the harassment not the being gay. If you’re trans same shit, I mean why the fuck would I care? I don’t plan on dating a trans person, the though makes me feel weird but fuck I’ll call you Alyssa if you really want me to idgaf. I’m all for reducing pollution from litter and plastics. I think there should be some restrictions to the economic ecosystem to stop monopolisation and price gouging. I believe in science. I believe the process of legal immigration is pretty shit and needs reworking. I believe the legal system needs a bit of a reform and that police should be trained for longer and be subject to yearly audits to ensure they’re conducting themselves properly. My mother is black, I’m mixed so obviously I’ve not got any dumb racist opinions, be kinda counterintuitive to hate myself for my race instead of the slew of other reasons I could hate myself.
I’d still be typically considered a conservative and yet I’ve proven the typical “conservatives are just evil” is fucking stupid. It’d be like saying “progressives are just commies” it’s not true. Yes, there are some conservatives who are so insanely conservative they’re just horrible people, but there are also progressives so progressive that they’re nothing more than a brain dead yes-man for ideas that are kinda nuts. I’m conservative because currently not a single progressive politician running for power has a single sensible idea. At least not here in Australia and not in the states or brasil either.
In his previous government the deforestation was higher than in the Bolsonaro government, so take every positive comment on Reddit with a grain of salt.
They released THOUSANDS of murderers, rapists, human traffickers, and drug traffickers all to get one dumb fuck out of prison. I am ashamed to be Brasilian and yet unsurprised considering they once voted in a literal terrorist and bank robber.
It should never be a choice between terrible and worse, but since we got to this point, we might as well not pretend that one is great because the other is terrible.
Well I suppose we’ll have to agree to disagree on that. Lula is one of the most corrupt politicians to ever live and I will not be surprised at any assassination attempts or successful ones against him once he drives Brasil into the ground again.
Both can be terrible, and pretending that the guy who was in charge of Brazil’s two largest corruption scandals is anything good, just fuels the opposition.
Ignore the idiots saying it’s not. It 100% is a shit show in Brazil rn. There was a 0.9% difference in votes between them. Honestly I think it’s more divisive than the trump elections were.
I don’t like socialism. I especially don’t like communism, they’re wonderful ideas in theory but i know for a fact they won’t work without mass indoctrination over generations of humans, I sure as fuck wouldn’t still be an engineer if I could get basically the same amount to do jack shit. I hate the overtaxing that most progressives want. I don’t agree with deregulated abortion, I believe there should be limits placed, a 30 week fetus is not the same as a 6 week embryo and should be treated differently. I don’t believe in neopronouns at all, or the excuse that adhd and autism make you experience gender differently, I have pretty severe adhd and a friend has autism, neither of us feel like we’re actually a cat gender cloud or some dumb shit. I want the government as far out of my life as possible, I don’t want them watching what I do daily. I want to be able to protect myself, I don’t want to be held accountable because a criminal broke into my house and fell down my stairs that don’t have rails (this actually fucking happens in Australia and the criminal wins the court case every time). I don’t want dumb shit like misgendering someone to be a jailable offence. I believe in protecting borders from people illegally entering the country, whatever country that is. I ABSOLUTELY NO NOT believe in the abolishment of the police, especially if you want to impose anti gun laws as well. I do not believe men should be collectively held responsible for the actions of a few dumb fucks. The list goes on.
You mean the one where he lowered the bar for poverty? Like didn’t actually raise people out of poverty, just made is so “poor” was classed as lower income than it was before he changed it?
You realise he did that by lowering the poverty line right? People who were considered poor before weren’t after he “fixed” it despite making the same amount of money as they did before.
