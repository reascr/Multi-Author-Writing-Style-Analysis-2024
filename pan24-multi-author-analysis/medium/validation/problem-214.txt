Alright people, the report made by the FBI/DoE is of "low confidence." As someone who went to college for a degree in Intelligence Analysis, this is fancy talk for "We're taking a shot in the dark and we don't really believe this." Saying you assess something with low confidence is also something frowned upon in the intelligence community as it means you're not sure of what you're even trying to say is true.
Edits: The article claims that the FBI supports the theory that Covid originated from a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Viriology according to a linked article - it doesn't. The linked article is about a FORMER head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service/MI6 claiming such. Hell, despite claiming that this was leaked to the Wall Street Journal, it didn't even bother sourcing or linking the WSJ.
Most people don’t bother to know or understand this. They just read the headline and blame China. This article essentially means nothing. They’re just confirming that it’s all still just speculation.
