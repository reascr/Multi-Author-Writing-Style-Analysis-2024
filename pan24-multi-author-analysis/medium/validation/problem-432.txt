Zelenskyy himself is Jewish, Ukraine has an enormous Jewish Diaspora that dates back thousands of years, Israel's mortal enemy - Iran - is actively equipping the Russian Invaders...
Every sensible reason would point towards Israel embracing using their formidable Military Industrial Complex for such valiant a cause as this geopolitical David vs. Goliath.
Israel doesn't want to alienate Russia because Russia allows them to bomb Iranian weapons caches in Syria that are destined for Hamas. Russia also helps ensure that Iranian troops in Syria stay away from the Israeli border.
And such geopolitical minutiae is worth thrusting the Iranian Defense Industry into such prominence and wealth unopposed?
From Israel's perspective, preventing a a terrorist group that is actively attacking them from acquiring more weapons and preventing their main enemy from staging an invasion force on their border under the cover of fighting Syrian rebel groups are immediate national security concerns. Israel is worried about the development of the Iranian arms industry, especially Iran's nuclear program. However, their current strategy, is to engage in targeted bombing of infrastructure and the assassination of scientists and engineers critical to the Iranian arms industry and weapons development programs. I will grant you that this strategy is proving to be an obstacle, but not an existential threat, to the growth of Iranian arms industry.
Also the fact that Russia has a reasonable large Jewish population and ties with Israel. I'm not saying I don't think Israel should not help more, but there are definitely well documents reasons they want to be an intermediary between both sides. I think people don't realise how complicated international politics actually is.
I genuinely think a lot of people don't understand how complicated international politics is. There is a lot of reasons why it is in America's interest to have good relations with Israel.
While they are not giving lethal aid at this time if you check the next country down, Italy, a much larger country, Israel has given significantly more humanitarian aid. That does count.
There are some deep negative ties to Ukraine as well. Ukraine has consistently voted against Israel at the UN. I’m not sure if that’s changing lately but that’s how it’s been for years. The fact is that Israel has it’s own serious security threats and their working relationship with Russia could greatly affect that.
Israel is a military powerhouse, and yet is refusing to raise their hand to defend a Nation they have deep ties to.
Ok, I haven’t looked into that in a long time but my understanding is that the US doesn’t just write Israel a check, they basically give them credits for purchases from US defense contractors. Since Israel is providing only non lethal aid at this time none of that would go to Ukraine.
You do realize that they’d love that, right? Of course you don’t. Because of that aid and the treaty it came with the US exerts a control over their arms and technology exports. You don’t think the IDI can replace that three billion with unrestricted sales? They can. And beyond that we get first dibs on a lot of things they develop. Israel currently does not have enough Iron Dome batteries for themselves but the US has a few. Why did they give any to the US when they don’t have enough for themselves? That aid and the treaty it came with.
What? Israel’s GDP is almost 500 billion. That makes the US aid a little less then one percent of GDP. Do you really think that would break Israel’s bank?
In the UK people always complain about foreign aid like it's just giving money away. It's not, it's a means of buying favour with other countries which often involves them reinvesting a certain amount back with you (say through service contracts or buying weapons from you).
America wouldn't just be giving money to Israel for the fun of it and it would be much more cost. For example it would damage their information gathering capabilities in the middle east.
