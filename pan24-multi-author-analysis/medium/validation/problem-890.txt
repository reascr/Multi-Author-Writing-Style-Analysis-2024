The media is speaking about climate change 24/7 anyways. This is just more noise over a topic that is in everybodies head in Germany anways. All it causes is eye rolling at a time politics make ever greater enrvironmental changes anyways.
As someone who was quite active in climate protests, also with extinction rebellion in Germany, in any of these protests when we heard an ambulance, we cleared the streets. Any emergency was communicated by deescalation teams and then we acted to make space for people to get through. But when you glue yourself on the damn street, there is no way to make space. This should be stopped. Generally, I learned that blocking roads in the wrong places is absolutly dangerous, for the own life and others. I wonder that no one drove anyone of the last generation protesters over yet.
In general, protest rely on sympathy to succeed. With actions like this climate activists activly sabtoage any effort to convince ppl to see the light. You do not do that by fucking up the life of the very ppl whose support you need. Quite the opposite.
