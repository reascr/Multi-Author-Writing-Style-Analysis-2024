The platform, not that specific variation.. sorry… I should have specified. The genius of this platform is its loc cost components. It has been cobbled together from OTS components.
I think this is standard operating procedure. Deny deny Denys and then deny some more. Even Murica does this.. according to the McNamara doctrine The funny thing is that they want public credit, based on this article, which is counterintuitive, given the fact that in military circles it’s undeniable . But since their drones are used by NGO’s maybe they want commercial clients with this horn tooting exercise. I would definitely consider their tech, it’s as close to sn open source drone we will get.(I remember reading that it has car parts and washing machine tech and the engines can be mounted in tandem).
There are NGOs using kamikaze drones? Aren’t NGOs normally things like Doctors Without Borders? What kind of NGO uses drones that are designed to blow stuff up?
I’m actually thinking, were it not politically detrimental, these drones could be deployed to central americ to deter cesna filled with Colombian cargo in clandestine runways. You could circle them in 100 mile radius in loiter mode and redirect once a target is acquired. You could also program a fail safe mechanism which makes detonation impossible below 8,000 ft. I don’t think the Colombian pilots would want to play “battleship” with these loitering drones! These drones could pull double duty serving as eye in the sky and reconnaissance for police and highway patrol.
