The World Bank president, David Malpass, has announced his resignation after sparking controversy for failing to say whether he accepted that fossil fuels were driving the climate crisis. Malpass, who was appointed to the post by Donald Trump in 2019, said he would step down from the multilateral development bank by the end of June and offered no specific reason for the decision. The incident re-ignited calls for a leadership shake-up at the bank, where pressure has been building to make changes and ensure it responded to the climate crisis more aggressively. US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, has launched a major push to change the way the World Bank operates to ensure broader lending to combat the climate crisis and other global challenges. Yellen issued a statement thanking Malpass for his service. The US will soon nominate a replacement for Malpass and the bank’s board will undertake a “transparent, merit-based and swift nomination process for the next World Bank president”.
>Malpass previously served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under Donald Trump, Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under George H. W. Bush. He served as Chief Economist at Bear Stearns for the six years preceding its collapse.
