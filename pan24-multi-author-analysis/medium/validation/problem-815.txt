He wants to go back to the Cold War when Russia was treated as a superpower instead of the regional power it nowadays is. And it will never happen, since Russia both lost its European vassals (including its sphere of influence due to them joining NATO) as well as China’s rise to power.
You can thank Elon Musk for what’s happening to Twitter He’s an egotistical, self-centered maniac Look at what he’s done to Tesla He actually is on the side of the Russians.
The only reason I brought China and their economic model up was, Russia had TRILLIONS of easily accessible wealth to invest, an education system, roads, bridges, industrial capacity, even a g-d SPACE program. China had to transition from oxen labor to computer chip manufacturing. Russia’s place in the world was Putin and his crony’s choice.
Yes. You’re nitpicking. You’re also not addressing the fact Russia hasn’t had a functional government since 1993. They had to invent words like “kleptocracy” for what Putin’s regime did to that country. Rot from within brought Russia down. Putin and his cronies blaming the EU, NATO, the US, the weather on Tuesday, are just distractions.
Maybe a liberal western democracy would have worked. Maybe not. There’s no denying that with Russias wealth (before it was looted), and its resources in manpower and infrastructure, Russia had unlimited potential, if it had simply moved forward with a similar model to China’s.
