if nuclear weapon is used by Putin would leave russia truly isolated. None of its allies, save North Korea would support them. Its really hard to emphasize how much of a misstep it would be for russia to do this. Putin maybe a cold hearted butcher, but I don’t think he’s that stupid.
Russia is pretty much isolated right now. Given how powerful nukes are the argument is very, very weak. Unless there will be a better one we're heading straight into the nuclear war.
Russia is not isolated from african countries, most south american countries, iran, syria, india, and china. Yes its isolated from most of the developed world, but even then not all of them. India and china alone make like a quarter of the world’s population.
Both China and India are unhappy with how things are going and both made sure that Russian authorities know it. Both have provided exactly zero military help (or any help of significance) despite extensive military cooperation history. Africa & South America don't matter much because the ties between them and Russia are pretty weak. What will change exactly?
Which way does the wind blow from Ukraine? Like literally would the wind blow the fallout over China? They might have a pragmatic reason for the weapons to not be used.
