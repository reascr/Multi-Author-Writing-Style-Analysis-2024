In a competitive presidential race the GOP will have an extremely hard time getting to 270 electoral votes with swing states showing in 2020 and 2022 they’re not tolerating this no platform fascist bullshit GOP playbook.
Thankfully so are Arizona voters. The more the GOP doubles down (quadrupled down?) on this bullshit the more they’re going to lose independent and moderate voters who will take just a functioning adult in office compared to the crazy idiots the GOP keeps putting up.
