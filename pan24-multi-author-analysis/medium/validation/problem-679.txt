I happily would, but it’s a bit presumptuous isn’t it? I donate money to small local charities but I am not sure I can really walk up to her an offer her £50 for a supermarket shop. Maybe she’s too proud to go to the food bank where she could get more food, I don’t know. It’s not my job to insert myself into other people’s lives. But I also know that we pay good money so that every kid is fed well at nursery - including this little girl who clearly isn’t getting enough food at home, but is at nursery and looks very healthy. Unfortunately there are plenty of kids who don’t have a great nursery to fall back on and don’t get the nutrition they need.
Now I understand how the Irish famine wasn’t really a genocide, because the British elite would do the same to their countrymen. It’s not about ethicity or culture, it’s all about money and how much you got.
It's not even that. It's like asking them to take a nonperishable food from a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of packages of it, that they literally couldn't get through even if they really really tried.
