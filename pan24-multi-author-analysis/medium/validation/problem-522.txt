Right he says tentative deal, basically give some extra benefits now, work out the rest later. he's asking for more give to the workers so they can at least stay working as a permanent deal is worked out.
Did anyone here read the actual statement? He wants congress to adopt the plan approved by the majority of unions. 24% raises, sick leave and more. He's not asking congress to force rail workers back to work.
sick leave = 3 days of unpaid leave with 30 days notice. That isn't good enough for workers touching something that if shut down costs the country billions. Shut it down and get some real sick days.
