Someone needs to explain it to Trump this way: At the end of the day, he was an nothing more than a high level employee for the government, not the owner. When you are fired from your job, all documents pertaining to the job and it's trade secrets belong to your boss. He has/had zero authority. He can keep saying he does all he likes, that will never make it true.
And did the special master tell him, "No. That's not a thing. Nothing has or will ever give you that authority." ?
Yeah, I forgot who I was talking about there for a second, a 76 year old toddler who thinks every thing he sees is his. I suddenly want to watch that skit where he is playing at daycare and he throws a tantrum when he has to leave.
