Which writ, warrant, mandate or other court issued method was used by the FBI in the process of Biden asking them to search his shit for more documents?
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Needs to be taken forcibly or suddenly. This whole ordeal was planned, and consensual. Again, I understand that you struggle with consent, but keep up or shut up.
It's nowhere near as bad. If they're from his time as vice president, the National Archives obviously didn't know they were even missing and he wasn't trying to prevent their return. Trump basically ignored the NA informing him they were missing documents and asked form then to be returned and Trump basically refused to cooperate to the point his home was raided. Biden has been fully cooperating and he/his staff had previously found documents and returned them on their own.
And if you cooperate with the authorities, after breaking the law the crime instantly disappears. Reddit said so.
Documents hes said he wasnt aware he had, and is working with the DOJ to ensure that any more are found and turn in.
Likely human error as, from reports that I've read, it's a small number of rocuments like less than 30 from many different larger files. Trump had numerous files and hundreds of thousands of documents.
So unless youve got a source that shows otherwise happened with Biden, youve got speculation that holds about as much weight as the idea that Trumps telepathically declassified, personally owned, but planted by the FBI documents are 100% legal.
Big difference here is that Biden was likely entirely unaware, as was the National Archives, that any documents were missing. Both Trump and the NA knew Trump was in possession of documents.
They both did wrong, but you know damn well theyre both not getting the same treatment because there is a clear distinction.
Thats part of the problem. If you didnt have anything to say when it happened then, you have no ground to talk here.
Lets draw a bit of a comparison here. 2 people speed down the road, 2 people get lit up by the cops.
