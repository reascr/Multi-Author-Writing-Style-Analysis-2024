The first point of the Chinese peace plan says that every countries sovereignty and borders must be respected but nowhere does it state that Russia must withdraw from Ukraine.
Obviously this leaves enough room for interpretation since Putin believes the occupied regions are Russian.
It would be great if China listens to the Ukrainian viewpoint but I doubt much will come of it. China is totally fine with Russia being cut of from the west as they can grow their influence and export.
You are aware that this is just Zelinski calling China's bluff right? Because if Ukraine dismissed it out of hand Russia and china go to the UN and scream "see He's not interested in peace!" By saying, yeah sure I'll meet Xi, and the outline Ukraines red lines in the context of Chinas plan then it forces Xi to either work those into it's currently very vague plan or show it's hand by not actually respecting Ukrainian territorial integrity.
Yeah, I think the last thing we have to worry about is Zelenskiy making a bad peace deal with China. He will hear them out (no harm in that) and then counter. Zelenskiy has been rock solid so far, I donâ€™t see that suddenly changing.
The new West Taiwan / Donbas (WTW/DB) will remain neutral under a 99 year lease to China from Ukraine/Russia (similar to the Hong Kong lease).
Recognize Donbas as the new "Taiwanese" home land. Relocate anti-reunification Taiwanese to Donbas as peace keepers -- creating an effective de-militarized zone.
The new Taiwanese Donbas peace keepers will integrate with the local Russian and Ukrainian population -- creating a lasting peace and a new western economic center for semi-conductor manufacturing and bubble tea.
Once old (East) Taiwan has been cleansed of popular splittist sentiment, then the remaining population of (East) Taiwan can apply for peacefully reunite with the mainland China.
After 99 years, the population of the neutral region will hold a referendum on whether to join Ukraine, Russia or China.
Maybe the assassination of both Zelensky and Xi during the Ukraine/China peace summit by Russian militant extremists will be the Archduke Ferdinand moment of World War 3 or at least the Star Trek VI Undiscovered Country moment -- love to see Xi quoting Shakespeare.
