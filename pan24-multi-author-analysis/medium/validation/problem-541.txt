Nah dude, I follow it on opposition and independent media all the time. They are actually quite optimistic and keep saying the prosecution is winning, even in the battles the pro Bibi media claims as detrimental to the prosecution, usually there's a legal win that was ignored in the pro Bibi article.

India has the Hindu supremacist Modi and his Hindutva BJP’s barely disguised crusade against Muslims, Christians, atheists etc. and his rollback of media and academic freedoms.
Afghanistan has the Taliban, who have just banned education for all females, while forcing their harsh version of Sharia law on the country.
