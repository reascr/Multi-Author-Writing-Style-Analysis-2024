Following the MAGA fascist support for Russia's invasion and killings in Ukraine the number of Republicans supporting Biden has grown from 3% to 15% - and still growing!
I predict that once he formally announces he's gonna have a rough time since the knives from Trumpland will be out. Desantis isn't going to be able to acquit himself well enough on Fox News explaining why whatever Trump is ranting about isn't actually correct. He's currently having the same kind of polling boom that Giuliani and Fred Thompson had in 2007 and Scott Walker had in 2015. The media assumes they're the guy and voters project what they want on to them. Then once they start actually having to campaign and hit the circuit it's underwhelming and everyone realizes they're boring.
Yeah Trump’s tactic is never about standing out or being better but rather tearing down his opponent. Trump won’t gain voters but he may very well kill all enthusiasm for DeSantis.
It certainly looks that way, and we’ve never had someone so blatantly right wing win (Trump had his own dumpster fires but his media issues in 2016 weren’t really about his extreme political ideology yet). But who knows. The republicans love both these guys and they’ll all vote for either of them.
