When the fascists are terrified that their reign is coming to an end they resort to violence and intimidation, anything to stop the voice of the people.
Unfortunately state run propaganda continues to hide their actions, but we keep seeing the cracks growing.
This is what we've been seeing for the last few months. Both the military and political feudal lords are terrified that the people are voicing their opinion and their uncontrolled corruption may end.
Imran was ousted through a democratic and constitutional vote of no confidence, and he’s been stoking violence across the country ever since. PMLN may not be a whole lot better, but Imran is 100% a wannabe fascist (dissolving the NA, jailing more journalists than any previous admin, attacking the judiciary, etc).
He’s just butthurt the military stopped holding his hand after he proved he’s wholly ineffective at governance.
Members of PDM already admitted they had help from the military, so please stop your bullshit no one is buying it.
Oh and what an amazing "boTH SIdEs are bad argument," the most pathetic excuse for spineless fascist supporters who want to appear as enlightened centrists.
When a sitting senator was abducted for months in jail and beaten, while the government silent was it both sides?
Imran Khan was shot and the government tried to say he's lying and there are no bullets, social media posters abducted from their houses, journalists forced to flee the country the list goes on while the government closed their eyes.
