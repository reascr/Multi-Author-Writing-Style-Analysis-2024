Hopefully the court dispenses with the special master and allows DOJ to use the documents undisturbed. The whole move to hire a special master was nothing but a delay tactic that Trump went forum shopping for one of his own judges to pull.

I didn’t understand how truly ridiculous the situation with Cannon was until a lawyer friend of mine explained it to me a few weeks ago. I’m full of antihistamines and cold meds and in an absolute brain fog right now, so I won’t even try to explain what he said, as I’ll mangle it horribly, but yeah…it was egregious. I’m sure there are many lawyers who have posted great explanations online.
