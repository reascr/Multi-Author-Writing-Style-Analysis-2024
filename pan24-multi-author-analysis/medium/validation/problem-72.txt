You either don’t know communism, China or both. At least you know how to write, so I assume you can read this and learn to research before spouting off next time.
That’s a really good point I hadn’t thought about. Also loss in profits just via the extra processes being done, on top of middle men taking their cut.
In China, the state plays a significant role in controlling the economy. The government sets economic policies and goals, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a major role in key industries such as energy, transportation, and heavy manufacturing. The government also regulates prices and foreign investment, and controls the flow of capital in and out of the country.
The state also has a strong influence on the allocation of resources, and often prioritizes investment in strategic industries deemed important for national development. Additionally, the government sets targets for economic growth, and local officials are often evaluated based on their ability to meet these targets.
In recent years, China has implemented market-oriented economic reforms, such as liberalizing prices and reducing state intervention in certain sectors, but the state sector still plays a major role in the economy, and the state still maintains control over key industries and resources.
This kind of state control has brought impressive results to China, as it has enabled the government to make long-term investments in infrastructure and strategic industries that have contributed to the country's rapid economic growth.
Russian oil already costs more to produce than their competitors so they are already making less money at market prices. The fact they have to sell at a steep markdown hurts them. But they are so desperate for Western cash, they will sell for a much lower profit.
Not every person gets a say in how things are done in China. Far from it in fact. It’s basically an oligarchy with better planning for the future.
Every barrel that is "sneaked" in that way, costs a lot to hide. That's money the middle men make, but they can't compete at world market oil prices, unless they pay Russia a lot less than world market prices.
Net result: world oil markets are stable, prices reasonable; yet Russia isn't making nearly as much as they did a year ago for a barrel of oil.
This isn't as bad as it seems. The goal is to lower Russian profits while also keeping oil markets running.
If they make no money their oil simply isn't reaching world markets. That makes Western oil prices shoot up. People pay more at the pump. People will put up with a lot of crap, but paying a lot for gas makes people angry.
Angry people can be manipulated into thinking the fastest way to cheap gas is to remove sanctions, perhaps even find a way to end the war faster by "keeping our weapons here, to protect us".
There was already a lot of that talk a few months ago when gas prices reached their peak, but it cooled off as gas prices went back down.
The goal is to keep the Western public happy enough to allow arming Ukraine and sanctions in place, while denying Russia "most" of the money they would have made.
tl;dr cutting Russia off 100% will make oil prices shoot up. People angry about gas prices will drop support for sanctions and Ukraine.
