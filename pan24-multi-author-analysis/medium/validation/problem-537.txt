The Texas and Florida democratic parties are a joke . Florida to this day I don’t believe even has a chair. In Texas the national DNC was no help while the GOP raked in millions from outside funds . Here in Texas we ran Beto knowing he wouldn’t win the swing vote due to his gun comments had a failed senate run and a worse presidential run , a AG no one knew , and a Lt gov that already lost twice before . First thing would be to run quality candidates which we haven’t had in Texas for many years. Democrats do very little state wide to get elected , poll closures in areas where democrats are more prone to vote didn’t help either as well as added voter restrictions . To this day there’s really no democrats in Texas with state name recognition. To even remotely be able to challenge the GOP. It goes a lot farther than the people of Texas want to be ruled by Republicans .
There's always the governor race. I know the people of TX and FL want to be ruled by Republicans because they voted for their governors and it was not that close, either. By contrast, the people of WS want to be ruled by Democrats because they voted for their governor, and the Republican legislature there is due to gerrymandering.
