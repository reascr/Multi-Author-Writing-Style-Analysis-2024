The one thing I can say that has shown some restraint from the Russians is that they haven't done any heavy bombing campaigns. If they did decide to use that tactic there will be 100000+ civilian casualties very quickly. So yes "they" can still go bigger without going nuclear.
They are unable to carry out bombing attacks because if they send aircraft over Ukraine they will lose them. The missile attacks that they send in are fired from hundreds or thousands of kilometres away.
They don't have enough shells, they are resorting to NK and Iran for help, Russia the second biggest military force is re-buying their own stockpiles of equipment sold to North Korea 30 or 50 years ago. So not a chance my dear friend. And if they buy equipment made in North Korea I expect even worse quality controls than Russia itself.
Russia lacks the air superiority needed to use traditional bombs or bomber aircraft within Ukraine, their heavy bombers stay hundreds of kilometers away well outside of Ukraine and launch cruise missiles.
