I'm all for EVs but this literally only hurts poor people. Fuck policies like this. Figure out how to put the burden of financial responsibility on those that caused this, not the people struggling to get by as is.
Nobody says you have to dispose of your car, just that you won't enter the city center..seems reasonable and some cities already do that. You'll still be able to drive your car, disposing of property working cars would be idiotic and nobody in their right mind (i hope) should suggest.
In France they did a scrappage program in 2009, where they’d pay you to get rid of your old car and buy a new one. Supposedly because the new one pollute less.
Yeah. Also I don’t think that disposing of a properly working car to manufacture a new EV has such a great impact on the environment... Especially since Poland’s electricity is 83% fossil fuel….
But in the end, people with functional cars will be forced to buy new cars, so theres a forced demand for car manufacturing, which is not good for the environment I guess?
The US did something similar around the same time. It was partly for environmental reasons and partly economic due to the recession. I know here it initially looked like a massive success, but ended up actually being a disastet.
