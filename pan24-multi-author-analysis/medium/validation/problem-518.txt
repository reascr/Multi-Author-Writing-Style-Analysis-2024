I wonder if this is going to pass down the chain of command, which would favor Steny Hoyer as the current majority leader, or will go to an up-and-comer, esp. a woman or a person of color.
I like Katherine Clark, currently the Ass’t Speaker and 4 in the caucus, but I am biased - she is my rep.
Ooh - she’s awesome. Way too junior to be a serious candidate for Speaker but I’d love to see her get more visibility in the party. I am somewhat disheartened that she didn’t perform better in her re-election but running in a new district is always a challenge.
