WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The United States and Ukraine announced on Wednesday that they will launch negotiations to upgrade a bilateral 2008 trade and investment accord to support Ukraineâ€™s efforts to establish a more transparent and predictable business environment.
In a joint statement issued after the 11th meeting of the U.S.-Ukraine Trade and Investment Council, the two countries said they would work to improve the underlying 2008 Trade and Investment Cooperation Agreement.
In opening remarks, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai urged the delegations "to work together to create an environment that encourages companies and individuals to live, work, and invest in Ukraine," the statement said, underscoring the importance of predictability, transparency and the rule of law.
Allowed the US to save face in the wake of the Afghanistan disaster by finding a way to intervene in situations differently: soft power, information sharing, rallying allies to contribute, and showing leadership.
Caused Germany to snap out of seeing their relationship with Russia through such a narrow and energy-dependent lens. Hopefully this leads to the expensive and politically-intensive reforms the Bundeswehr has needed.
