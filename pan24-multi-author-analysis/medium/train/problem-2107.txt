it looks like the city is aiding disenfranchised people in need, its better then them being reduced to homelessness and relying on emergency services.
op has a habit of posting 'controversial' topics to both r/ politics and con, so regard this submission through that lens in the subsequent discussions.
But it can do that on a gender neutral basis and focus on needs-based. These carve outs for this group or that group not only serve to divide ("Hey, how came "they" get that and I don't?!?" is likely a common response), but also makes the left look loony to many voters out there who Dems could otherwise win over if not associated with these programs. As a lifelong liberal and Dem voter, I disapprove of this program and these approaches.
I predict this will not sit well with envious crab buckets. "But what about us huh? Where's our guaranteed program?".
