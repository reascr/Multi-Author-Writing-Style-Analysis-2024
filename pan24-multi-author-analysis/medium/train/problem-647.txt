English isn’t very efficient, space-wise. As an example: English translations of Hebrew text are typically 50% longer than the source text, despite Hebrew having 4 letters less and 3 consonants more than English. More extreme ratios can be achieved in shorter texts. Hebrew obviously isn’t Canaanite, but these examples might help demonstrate how different languages can convey the same information with a substantially different character count:
Well, I thought that just because Hebrew is written without vowels, doesn't mean this related language was also written without vowels. Was the text on the comb written with ? In that case there are no vowel letters.
A number of potential reasons. Maybe the Canaanite language has a single word for "hair on the head + facial hair", they may have more compact verbs (e.g. a single word for "root out"), they may not use articles (no "the" equivalents), they may use a case system to distinguish "this tusk" rather than having two separate words, etc. etc.
