Russians really do believe this war is an existential threat to their country. Ukrainians obviously believe this as well. So, if Russia starts loosing, there is no doubt in my mind nukes will be used in Ukraine. This will have severe consequences, but so does not using them in Russias mind. If Ukraine starts loosing, the U.N will intervene, and nukes will be used. The only solution is a negotiation that is acceptable to both countries. Hopefully this happens soon. Ukrainian has been turned upside down, hundreds of thousands of lives lost, cities demolished, millions displaced, but Ukraine and Russia are still standing. No matter what happens, it can always get worse and this type of war will eventually spread if there is no end soon. The sooner they come to an agreement, the better for the world.
I was about to say, people in this thread are acting like he knows it's false, but authoritarians tend to believe this shit. Putin almost certainly believes that he is necessary for the survival of Russia.
