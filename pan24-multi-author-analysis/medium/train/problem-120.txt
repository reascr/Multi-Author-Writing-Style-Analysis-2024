I am really sorry to hear that. Have you been able to find anyone who specializes in trauma? My specialty is in people who have Schizophrenia. I do case management work meaning helping people to learn ways to manage their lives outside of the hospital n effort to keep them in the community and not locked in facilities. I don't do therapy. and honestly wasn't trained in trauma unfortunately. My goal for the new year is to take as many continuing education courses in trauma informed care. It's definitely a deficit of mine. I will say, we were taught flight or fight. I wasn't taught the fawn or freeze - it's a novel concept and makes so much sense.
This makes a lot of sense. I dated someone who had been abused in a prior relationship, to the point of suicide attempt, and it was unsettling when they'd switch to overly nice and accommodating out of the blue. The most innocuous things could be a trigger. Abuse should be punishable like any major crime. It literally kills the person they were, even if their body is still there.
