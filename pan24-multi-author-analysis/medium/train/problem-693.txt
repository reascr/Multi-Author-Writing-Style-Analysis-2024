Many rural nurses (mainly nurse aides, the core of any nursing home) are making 10-13/hour to start, if not less. These folks also have to go through a licensing process similar to LPN/RNs (though not nearly as extensive). Long hours, very hard work, and constant stress due to residents that are so demented (due to age and/or illness) they verbally abuse these nurses daily, if not hourly.
Too often Assistants were overburdened with Residents. They dealt with incontinence, dementia, preventing falls, bathing, turning among catering to the many requests by Residents, having fifteen to eighteen. There are regulations relating from to how often people are bathed to the ratio of Resident/Assistants. It is very difficult work. I imagine these Senators would not like the Assistant to Resident ratio be dictated among other cost saving measures. If they actually want to improve Nursing Homes situations, I would be happy. But I rather think they want to dictate rules to reopen Nursing Homes which and reduce quality of care. I wish they would address concerning issues such as many NH are managed by private money-making corps. They make it difficult to determine who owns them. Nursing Homes are a concerning issue that does need to be addressed FULLY.
I understand the “concern” of the Senators. Nursing Homes are way understaffed especially Nursing Assistants. I worked five years in one. I was an RN in one for five years before quitting nursing just as Covid hit. We had twenty five-thirty residents each as an RN, many were LPNs. Most all were very competent. When well staffed with assistants our job was easier and Residents received fine care.
