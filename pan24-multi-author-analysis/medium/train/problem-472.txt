I’m not super political on Facebook but for president’s day I reposted Pete Sousa’s photo of the former presidents minus trump in my stories. I didn’t include the caption. I went about my day and my uncle, who I don’t speak to frequently but have always been nice to him and his family. I don’t ever bring up politics at family gatherings.
The GOP hasn't released a platform since 2016. They have not run in any specific policy positions recently. There is still no healthcare plan. It seems incredibly foolish for the GOP challengers to think anything other than the culture war matters. I would venture to guess most people who care about policy have left the Republican party, because they have abandoned the policy making aspect of governing.
