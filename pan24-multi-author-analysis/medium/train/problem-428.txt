Israel attacked Iraq in the early '80s, destroying their nuclear research facilities in an airstrike.
I imagine the Iraq Iran war, and the invasion of Kuwait, would have turned out much differently if Iraq had become a nuclear power.
it does matter, it matters a lot actually, did you all forgot that hezbollah has 100k troops just north of israel?
not to mention that israel has other internal threats, hamas and other militas wouldnt just stand by and watch, if a war breaks out, they're almost guaranteed to be involved.
also it would take A LOT more than just few targeted strikes to stop the iranian nuclear program, iran is a mountainous country unlike syria and iraq, it has so many places to hide their nuclear sites.
Several times they've attacked Iran's nuclear program. Stuxnet was the big one but they have bombed several places, sent saboteurs to break in and steal documents, plant charges. They've assassinated Iranian nuclear scientists. Recently they used a remote control machine gun to ambush some nuclear official. Iran does nothing but continue to fund Hezbollah.
