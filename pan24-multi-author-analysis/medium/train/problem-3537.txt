Anyone get the sense that he keeps firing more and more random shit the more nobody appears to give a fuck or talk about them anymore?
But realistically, it's because it's just not worth whatever incredibly stupid thing NK would do as "retaliation" for SK's "escalation." NK is like a tiny bully who's always got a knife on him. It doesn't actually matter that much when they try to bully people so it's not worth forcing them to stop because then the knife comes out and you gotta kill the idiot over it.
There's a rule in the arena of life that you never interrupt your opponent when he's busy fucking up. If the guy wants to use up his entire government's treasury on expensive fireworks,... I just hope that at least he masturbates or something with each missile he fires off,... At least that way, he has a fond memory to attach to each time he threw away millions of dollars.
At this point I’m just thinking lil kimmy here just can’t swim or just hates his beach body and is trying to destroy the water in an act of anger.
