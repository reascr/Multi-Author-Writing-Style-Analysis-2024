Many meetings. Huge meetings. Important powerful meetings. Strong meetings. Such meetings that no president before ever... met. With such huge powerful strong leadership. Busy meetings.. very busy, so busy -- no time for golf. Meetings at such wonderful locations. Important locations... so important. Like at T. Golf courses in NJ, FL and Scotland Europe. Amazing golf. So amazing. And strong. Winning meetings with strong leaders and generals -- very big, hugely powerful and strong generals. And their hands: big powerful hands like nobody has ever seen, strongly hugely negotiating powerful winning meetings.
