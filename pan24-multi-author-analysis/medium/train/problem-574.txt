It’s crazy you can just donate to a war effort online now. I’m surprised there aren’t laws against “funding another country’s war” or something like that. Is it legal everywhere?
“There will be times when the struggle seems impossible. I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy. Remember this, Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they’ve already enlisted in the cause. Remember that the frontier of the rebellion is everywhere and even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward. And then remember this, the imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires contact effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance, will have flooded the banks of the emperor’s authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing that will break the siege. Remember this. Try. “. Nemik from Andor.
The same practice can apply though? Citizens of those 93 countries, if presented with a compelling argument, will be more than happy to lay down cash money in the defense of freedom.
I'll prob get downvoted for this but playing devils advocate; why is being investigated by NZ police but we can click a link and donate directly for drones. Genuine question, I do not support Russia in any way.
