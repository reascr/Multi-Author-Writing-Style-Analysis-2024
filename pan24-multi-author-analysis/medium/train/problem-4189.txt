I’m also an election judge in my county. When we did the Bobo/Frisch recount, there were less that 100 ballots where that contest wasn’t voted on at all. What that may mean is that those people hated Bobo, but couldn’t force themselves (too republican) to vote for Frisch or the other three candidates. I wonder how many other counties in her district had the same thing happen? Will Frisch learn from his loss and actually have a stance? I guess time will tell.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

It was a close call because her district became one of the safest red districts in the country in 2022, the fact she nearly blew such a handicap speaks volumes.
