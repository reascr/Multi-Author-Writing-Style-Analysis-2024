It’s important to note that fascists will always try to do it if you let them. They will try and pretend that their “past views” were mistakes,jokes or that they regret expressing their past views.
I mean the best example of this is well…Hitler himself. He wrote mein kampf while he was in prison for you know…the beer hall Putsch(A failed Coup attempt) and it came out in 1925. In that book he laid out his hatred of Jews,leftists,Communists,Bolsheviks and other groups that he hated like the french plus he talked about what he wanted to do.
TLDR: fascists like MTG will always try and lie or downplay their views for political survival purposes. Never trust them. Especially in cases where they have a past of lying/saying outrageous things.
