They won't send anyone for a loss of ping, unless they have been specifically setup to do so. Most companies would just phone the first contact and say, "hey what's up?".
You ignored the GSM part of my comment. You have alarm systems. They are hooked up to either phone or internet to maintain contact with the station, and to send alerts if an alarm gets triggered. Someone comes along with a chainsaw, and cuts the entire group of lines connecting your building to power, phone, and internet. Now they break in to each unit in the building. The alarms will sound but not be sent anywhere, except that one unit. They have a GSM backup connected to their alarm system. It sends an alarm alert via the cellular network. The base station works for many hours on battery, and you typically can't get to the GSM module without triggering a motion or contact. Thieves are arrested, caught in the act.
I guess it depends on the clients. For banks, loss of communication is always an immediate security or police dispatch, would have assumed a place like a museum would have similar rules.
