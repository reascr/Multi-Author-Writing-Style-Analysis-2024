Now we're "back to normal" (even if COVID is still a thing) and so the numbers are back up, but only halfway to where they were before, likely in large part due to the narrowing of scope to focus on recent entries or those who could be dangerous.
From the article: "At the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, the number of people in ICE detention was 38,000, according to TRAC’s analysis. Just before Biden took office in January 2021, the number of detainees decreased to as low as 15,000 — a 60% drop. That downward trend continued for the first month of the Biden administration before the number of ICE detainees started to rise.".
This is highly misleading. While the numbers are technically accurate, the current total also represents about a 40% drop from where things stood at the beginning of COVID. Obviously in the ensuing 9 months those numbers dropped dramatically as the government adapted to the pandemic.
