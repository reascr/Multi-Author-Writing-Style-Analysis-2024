Yep, it’s pathetic. When he reinstated Trump’s account and Trump said bye, Elon was practically begging him to tweet something. It’s clear to anyone with half a brain what he’s doing, and it’s quite a fall for someone who used to have the respect of a lot of people.
Steve Jobs was a huge asshole, and did very little of the actual innovating himself, just like Elon. But he also came from relatively normal middle class family, and worked his way up from being an intern at Hewlett Packard to iconoclast head of the 1 technology company of all time. Some part of him, even when he was a huge dick to those around him, understood the customers they were going after and how he was presenting himself to them.
There’s a modern Simpsons episode from a few years ago where Elon Musk guest stars and the whole episode is about him, and he’s introduced by Lisa as the world’s last great inventor. They even go as far as to have him end up in Springfield by crashing a rocket ship in the Simpson’s backyard. Makes me so angry on multiple levels because A. literally none of that is true B. It’s clear he bought himself an episode to get his ego stroked and C. Modern Simpsons bad.
