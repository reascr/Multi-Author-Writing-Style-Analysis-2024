In general also she was uninformed regarding who issue letters patent regarding titles and what they meant. They were issued in 1917 by George V which would give titles to male line grandchildren of the monarch and to oldest son of oldest son of Prince of Wales. So that would now mean George (son of William who is oldest son of then Prince of Wales) and that exemption is because he is going to be a king one day. However when there was law change in 2013 that gave women equal rights to the throne there were new letters patent issued that all children of Prince of Wales would get titles (so any girl would not unequal). So all of William’s children had Prince/Princess titles from birth. But this didn’t effect Harry and his children since he isn’t the oldest son of Prince of Wales has his children aren’t in direct line to the throne. But now that Charles is king his children do have Prince/Princess titles since they are male line grandchildren of the current monarch. But for some reason they seemed to be confused what the laws were and why Archie didn’t get Prince title from birth. And seemed to assume the titles were connected to ability to have security. Which isn’t the case, Harry’s cousins Beatrice and Eugenie don’t have security and they are male line grandchildren of the monarch at the time (so have equal standing to Harry’s children).
I have no problem with Twitter as a source to get quotes from subjects — my problem is with Twitter as a source (especially the only source) for public opinion or reaction.
