This is the varient that focuses on fucking up your appetite and poop and stomach feelings and stuff? Cause I heard that's the case and I'm fucked up rn with that plus stuffy nose. I could have it.
Hey let me ask you something. Do you consider virus to be alive? Many scientists don't but I disagree. I think they are alive, in their own way. Just a different type of life than cellular life. What do you think?
Oh man, I had a severe version of that for about 2 months about 6 years ago. It permanently left my tonsils swollen, dentists even mention it to this day. That was the worst sickness I've had, thankfully my immune system did its thing eventually and I got better. I have faith that you will too!
People get colds and flus all the time. They come and go. Our immune system is built to fight it off. Unfortunately just like we learned in school, the strong survive and the weak do not. My grandfather died of pneumonia because he was in his 90's and his body couldn't fight it off. I didn't change my life because of this. I know that I am young and have a healthy, working immune system.
