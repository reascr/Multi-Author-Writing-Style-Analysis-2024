This "shift in attitudes" is why conservatives are fighting their imagined "culture war" so frantically. They realize the walls are closing in on their backward 19th Century agenda of pig ignorance. The attitudes of hatred and intolerance that have fueled them for decades are slowly phasing out and Gen Z and Millennials are overtaking boomers as a voting block and they're more liberal and tolerant than any other generation before them. Man, the future is BLEAK for Republicans. They're either going to have to drastically rethink their attitudes, or face continual election loss.
But of course they don't do that despite it basically being a guaranteed win for the GOP in every election forever because that would be treating non-whites like people and that's too much to ask of them.
Itâ€™s part of why Appalachia kept voting blue for a few decades after the Democratic Party turned left. And New England was electing Republicans until recently. The shift in the 2000s was not just because of stances. FDR Democrats and Eisenhower Republicans were gradually dying off. My grandma (96) is a rural white churchgoing lady. She votes reliably Democratic simply because she always has, since 1944, even if Republicans now better fit her mores. Old habits die hard and sometimes not at all.
