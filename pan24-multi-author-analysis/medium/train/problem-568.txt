Left unsaid is that while the Admiral Gorshkov is one of Russia's most modern ships and there are three in the Black Sea I think, This one can't get there because Turkey won't let it into the Black sea.
So it's free to PR around the world since it can't do anything to affect the war since it can't actually get there. What is interesting is that they are going on and on about these hypersonic missiles that can penetrate the best air defenses in the world. You'd think they'd use them against Ukraine since they are having trouble penetrating their air defenses. Weird that.
Like the scene at the opening of Air America where the old farmer is walking through the paddy. Sees the transport plane far overhead, casually unslings his rifle, takes one shot, and carries on walking. Ten seconds later smoke pours from the engine and the plane goes down.
Hypersonic missiles are being flaunted by Russia like Nazis did the V1, except Russia is by no means innovators in this space. Russia also has only used glide hypersonic missiles, and as far as I'm aware, only USA has successfully demonstrated cruise hypersonic missiles, which are significantly more effective (really not even comparable).
Hypersonics are just another tool in military capabilities. They arw by no means a silver bullet. Also, all other aspects of effectiveness remain important, including production quality and quantity, supported launch platforms, and variants.
