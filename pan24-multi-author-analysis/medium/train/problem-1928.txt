Again, this does not mean that Russia was the sole cause of Brexit. Rather, because Brexit aligned with Russia’s strategy — at a time when Tories and Boris had unsupervised meetings with oligarchs, and when Russia had been caught funding rightwing political programs in the US, Italy, Germany, and elsewhere — I find it ridiculous to suggest that they had no part in pushing it forward, though only time will tell. Russia didn’t create the Tea Party in the US, for a similar example, but instead funded the most insane members of this crowd through PAC’s, capitalizing on existing, grassroots sentiments and helping them overtake the mainstream GOP platform. That was a decisive Russian victory, without really even requiring direct cooperation or even knowledge on behalf of most of said sponsored candidates.

And will talk about publicly. If there were some that the perpetrators don’t know that MI5 are aware of, they wouldn’t necessarily confirm they knew about it.
