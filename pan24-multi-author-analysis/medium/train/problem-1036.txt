A redditor a lot smarter than me once commented something along the lines of, putin is foremost a political animal because he was former KGB a spy he’s not a military strategist in the sense of like a general who wants to go around in battle it would be something he would have complete and total advantage over it that’s what he would want if you want political gain that’s why he does the false voting thing is no reason for that if he’s just a general just send in his forces too kill everyone instead that’s why he wants to be so loved and seen as a strong man.it’s like how is he gonna be able to keep this image while still facing reality.
Even if Russia used a nuke (assuming it's been maintaining them this entire time which is a dubious assumption), there's no reason at this point for US/NATO to respond in kind. US/NATO could win a conventional war against a nuclear Russia.
Russia's military has failed to modernize and keep up since the end of the Cold War. The US is literally decades ahead of them.
In other-words, Russia is no longer our peer. The game has changed. What were optimal strategies 3 decades ago have been replaced.
I hope I look so stupid, wrong, naive, and gullible after this disappears as biggest propaganda scare in history instead of starting WWIII in history.
