That is true but I donâ€™t think that all of the aid that we are discussing sending them should be made public till the last minute if at all because it gives Russia the chance to prepare. Also, he said we were sending planes months ago but we never did and the tanks that have been promised have arrived. Since Russia knows what is coming they know they need to do as much as possible as fast as possible.
That's the kind of behavior that gets you on the "can't be trusted" list real quick. And they need long term support, I'm sure they're not ready to sacrifice this relationship for a one time risky bet.
My guess is that he may have had the approval of mentioned partners to "let the cat out of the bag".
Pretty sure that's how diplomacy can be conducted when your country is being invaded. Maybe the immediate threat of a massive Russian offensive in 2 weeks is more important.
I know it isn't practical, but seeing A10 Warthogs being flown with Ukrainian flags and pblllltttt all up and down the Russian artillery lines would be something special.
I have seen it argued in videos that giving in waves (although bad for some in Ukraine) is a tactical way to keep luring Russia into thinking its troops are fine just before a new extended range comes into play and then their complacency is rewarded (with artillery and missiles).
