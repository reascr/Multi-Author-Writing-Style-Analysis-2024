I like the idea that Walker paid for a fucking novel's worth of oppo, and then was like, "yeah, but I was really good at UGA football, so it cancels out.".
The GOP has learned that candidates don’t matter, party matters. Their base trusts that whomever is elected will vote exactly like they’re told to, in lock step with the rest of the party. The only requirement the party has is that their candidate is loyal and plays well with focus groups.

Which is why I laugh at the people who complain about democrats who vote Democrat no matter who it is. You need those people because that’s your base, and party loyalty has its place.
I suspect Walker was a test by the GOP to “see how much shit we can pack into one candidate before voters reject him.” Considering how damned close he got to winning, expect the next shitstain test candidate to be a hell of a lot worse.
