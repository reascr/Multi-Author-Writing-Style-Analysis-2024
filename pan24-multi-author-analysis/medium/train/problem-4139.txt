When we went in 2021, we had to take PCR tests 24 hours before boarding, another test at the airport at landing, wait for one hour to get results (if we had been positive we would have been transferred to a public isolation room or hospital if we had symptoms), we were then given a bracelet that we had to wear during quarantine and we had to go to a special quarantine hotel that cost a fortune for 21 days and which we couldn’t exit at any time for the full duration (with the GPS linked bracelets as verification). And we had several more tests to take while we were there, I can’t recall exactly, but something like days 5,8,14,21.
Definitely got rid of them very recently when the COVID restrictions were lifted with china itself. Some people might still be in the process but any new arrivals definitely don’t have that anymore.
We were quite concerned that one of us would have symptoms by landing time or test positive and we would be separated, including the kids. It was an ordeal and we haven’t gone back yet, and we used to go 2-3 times a year (wife’s family).
But yeah, Canada bad, very bad. Unfortunately China really doesn’t do soft power and diplomacy very well, always kind of bully-ish and hard power centric.
