The post title is extremely misleading. The article’s actual title is “Soccer players union "sickened" as Iran's Amir Nasr-Azadani faces possible death sentence over protests”. From the article it seems like he hasn’t been sentenced to death yet. I’m not defending Iran at all. Just passing on info as someone who read the article. He’s not officially doomed to die. It’s still a possibility though.
The fact that these countries are basically pariahs for doing what's been done for time immemorial is a testament to progress.
All over the west look at Italia it's a post fascist governement, France, Swiss, UK, Germany, Scandinavia, USA etc. Ultra nationalist tried to take the power in Germany some days ago. All of thèse countries don't have an alt right gouvernement for the moment except Italia and Hungary but the score increase a lot they are the 2nd party something like that they can win in the next elections.
It only took 30% to take over Germany and the south and now there is around that amount of people now very openly seditious or supporting the openly seditious here on the west coast ….
I think the 30% are living outside the city’s as a rule. I could be wrong, I haven’t been paying attention to LA but it would not surprise me. California is by in large quite conservative. Surprisingly so.
