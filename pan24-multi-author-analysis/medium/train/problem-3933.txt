Connelly is a fiction writer featuring a detective named Hieronymus Bosch (same as the Dutch painter). When people in the stories he writes have trouble with the pronunciation, Bosch will say, "Hieronymous, rhymes with anonymous.".
Imagine yourself as an owner of a huge shopping mall. Ikea is gone, many other stores are gone, people's incomes go down, there are no customers, you can not properly maintain the store because all those electricians, plumbers and even managers are mobilized to the war.
Russians _could_ have chosen a path of what most likely would have been prosperity unlike anything in history due to the wastness of their resources. Instead they chose to let mafia run their country, mismanage their resources and on top of all they decided that getting more or less embargoed by 90% of the world would be great decision.
However; the probability that putinas decisions has set in effects the motions that eventually will lead to the dissolution of Russia has never been higher. And this brings me great schadenfreude as he, and his cronies, are _obsessed_ with preventing just that and putina is the leader who has brought Russia the closest to dissolution by far.
And I'm saying Russians, not putina. Any dictatorship has to have a great level of support to stay in power.
