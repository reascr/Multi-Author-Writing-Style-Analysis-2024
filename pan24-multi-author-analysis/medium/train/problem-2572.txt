These elite of the GOP live insular lives in their mansions with servants’ quarters and private security, travel on private jets, and vacation on private islands or their own personal super-yachts. They don’t really care that much about race because it’s not an issue in their daily lives: the people who enter the circle around them and their families are tight.
Also, they will never change because they believe in a bunch of nonsense such as they will be wealthy under the GOP. However the ones I know have not made gains of being better off under the GOP. So they just believe in the power of prayer and continue to vote against their self interests, instead of answering the question of “ What is the definition of insanity”?
They’ve funded think tanks in every state and at the federal level, sponsor anti-labor economics and political science professors in our colleges and universities, lever judges into positions all the way up to the Supreme Court, and pour a seemingly unending river of cash into Republican candidates for office.
They pour lots of money into politics, ... a small fraction of their wealth and it seems to pay off handsomely.
