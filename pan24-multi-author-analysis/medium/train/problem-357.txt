you're right, but I personally find it unhelpful when professions manufacture jargon for simple concepts. "Group attack" would have been fine for their internal usage and less confusing for external audience. I suppose confusing the external audience is intentional as it helps trip-up a lot of potential criticism on semantics alone.
And I'm not gonna do a big back and forth, Canada has shown time and time again it takes a forgiveness approach to violent crime. It has shown over and over again victims don't matter and that fine if you wanna live in a society like that. I don't. So take care bud.
In Canadian English, the correct term here is "swarming". Writing "group attack" would be to deviate from the established term, and therefore would be less clear to the Canadian audience that expects that crime to be referred to as "swarming".
No, an execution is specifically a killing that occurs as a punishment for a real or imagined transgression, or alternately refers to a specific "style" of killing that usually refers to an individual being made helpless and then killed at the "leisure" of the killer.
