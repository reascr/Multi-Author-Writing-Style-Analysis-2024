There's enough retired US generals out there that one can be found to espouse just about any viewpoint (see: retired US General Michael Flynn), so this isn't really the ringing endorsement it purports to be.
I do believe that Ukraine will righteously chastise Russia for this aggression, but retired generals are just another style of hired talking head ( he's probably a lobbyist for Raytheon, lol.).
Right now both sides are digging in for Winter, there have been very few gains by either side, look at liveuamap.com to see the live front, it’s been the same for a while now.
The current temperatures keep the soil fluid, which is not good for any major offensive, however, with all the troops freed up from Kherson and frost coming that makes the soil firm and allows mechanized manoeuvres, I’d reckon Ukraine will want to hold the initiative and momentum they have right now to push the invaders further.
I’m not going to pretend I’m an expert on Easter Europe offensives, but I am basing my statement off what I’ve seen. When I say nothing has really changed on the maps, it’s pretty much been the same except for the advancements in Kherson for a month.
