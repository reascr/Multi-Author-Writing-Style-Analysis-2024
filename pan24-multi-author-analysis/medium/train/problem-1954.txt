What I said was I don't believe Christianity is under attack. I don't believe that you can have the overwhelming vast majority of a government identifying as Christian and then claim that oppression of Christians is happening on a wide scale basis. When you control the political power in this country you control the country. It's ridiculous to imply that Christianity is somehow oppressed in America. There are no laws that prevent Christians from worshiping, no one is telling you you can't be a Christian. No one is telling you you can't teach your children Christianity. It's simply not under attack.
