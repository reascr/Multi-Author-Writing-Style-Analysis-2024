Most likely it will happen. Major russian social sites and forums just today had 2 types of news - Putin/Peskov saying that mobilization will not happen again (even as it is officially not even ended yet, so it can just be resumed, instead of started again) and posts about how those who left the country are traitors/cowards/losers. But that begs the question, if mobilization will not resume, why so many efforts to discourage more people from leaving the country specifically now? And yes, many people report that they were told to visit military organizations in January, just to "make data in databases more precize". When one guy sent his wife with all documents, and she said that every data needed is there, so no reason for husband to personally come later, they just dismissed her.
I'd love to see a dramatised television series about the intelligence gathering that has gone into this war.
I wonder how many men actually fall for that and check in at their nearest military “center”. It’s one thing if You’re threatened or just picked up off the street. I’m not sure I would want soldiers in my army that can be fooled that easily. Good luck with that.
