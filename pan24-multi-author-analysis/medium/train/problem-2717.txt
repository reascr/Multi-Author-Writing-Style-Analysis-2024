TL;DR; The incident appears to have happened in a forest area in Vsevolozhsk, a residential area around 24km (15 miles) east of St Petersburg. The explosion, according to state media, was caused by an erupting gas pipeline that runs through the Leningrad region.
And that patriarch is so narcissistic that he would denounce an oligarch for interrupting his bowel exercises. Or cause the FSB to "take care of" that oligarch.
That is Patriarch, not Pope, unless it really is Pope Francis you are talking about. The Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church is a very close buddy to Putin and has an outside chance to become Putin's successor as President of Russia.
First we had self defenestrating oligarchs, then self census removing oligarchs with 3 taps to the back of the head, then spontaneously exploding oligarchs, itâ€™s not a good time to be a Russian oligarch.
Very dangerous things those oligarchs. Can go up at any time. Strangely happens most often after meetings with President Putin. Must investigate further.
