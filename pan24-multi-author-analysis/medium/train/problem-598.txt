All that they have to do is properly announce the balloon flight and fit it with an ADS-B transponder to allow civil authorities to track and monitor it.
If it truly is an innocent weather balloon, then there’s no need for secrecy. If you don’t acknowledge its existence until after you’re caught, it’s a good sign that you’re up to some shady shit.
The US already knew about the balloons before it enters Alaska, nothing really "secrecy" about it. This is only a big deal because it got too close to the ground and was spotted by civilian.
It’s “secret” in that, had the US military not detected it, no one would have known about it. A regular weather balloon is not some clandestine operation that needs to be kept quiet, and something that you deny involvement with until faced with evidence that you did it.
If it really were a civilian weather balloon, they’d alert the US before it entered their airspace and FLEW __DIRECTLY__ OVER NUMEROUS NUCLEAR WEAPONS FACILITIES.
Just look at how the US are shooting down a bunch of civillian balloons right after. Clearly none of these announced anything. It's simply not the expectation, not how it works.
