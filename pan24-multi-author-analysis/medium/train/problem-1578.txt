Russia's entire military plan relies on being able to sustain heavy rates of artillery fire. Russia's capability to produce enough shells to sustain heavy rates of artillery fire is dubious at best. Russia's stockpiles are running out much faster than they anticipated. In another few months, Russia won't be able to defend the entire 'land bridge' and will be crying that Ukraine 'doesn't want peace' just because Ukraine is winning and not letting Russia keep the areas they invaded in 2014.
The spat between Wagner and the Russian general military is just so funny to watch. Wagner acts like it's some elite PMC while the Russian top brass feel that a handful of artillery shells are worth more than all of Wagner combined.
And what's even funnier is that in reality, Wagner is nothing but a raag bunch of poor people from impoverished banana republics, convicted criminals, and other "mercenaries" who mostly have next to no real military experience.
There's no proof that Wagner is that good, sure maybe they have a core that's "good" compare to their average mercenary, but that's not really saying much at all.
This does not seem to be entirely true. Sure there is a bigger part of Wagner made of prisoners. But there is that core of professional soldiers that are decently supplied compared to regular ru army. So they use raag prisoners to discover or weaken enemy positions and then pros do the sweeping. This is why Wagner seemingly does produce any tangible results at all. But that professional Wagner core is about 10k soldiers according to some counts... Not exactly that many given size of entire conflict. They are doomed either way.
