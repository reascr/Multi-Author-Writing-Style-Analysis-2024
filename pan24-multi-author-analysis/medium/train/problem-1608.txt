al-Qaeda is Sunni and Iran is Shia. Sunni's hold Shia as apostates who should be executed for not following the true religion. So, no, he's not hiding in Iran.
Edit: I should clarify that I don't mean all terrorists, just al-Qaeda specifically. The others can fuck off too but they're a different kind of asshole than the ones who made 9/11 happen. These guys are just pure evil and need to be wiped from the face of the planet for good. They've been around since before Osama was even born and he's dead now so there's no reason they shouldn't be next if we have the means to do it!
And yes, I know some people will say "but what about their families?" Well firstly, most of them aren't married or have kids so that argument is null and void for most of them anyway Secondly, if you want to help their families then go help their families Don't join a terrorist group because you think it'll somehow help your family in some way That's selfish as hell Go help your family yourself instead of joining an organization whose only goal is death on a massive scale for everyone involved!
