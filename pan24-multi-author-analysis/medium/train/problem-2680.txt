Seems like even if Ukraine win the war they'd be in massive debt for a century... unless Russia is held to compensate, but I'm not holding my breath on that one.
Germany and Japan surrendered unconditionally and did not have nukes. Not sure what you mean by Vietnam. The US didn't pay war reparations to Vietnam.
I'm sorry if I didn't get it, but this is sarcasm right? Japan and Germany are absolutely power house nations, they both recovered quickly and were economically dominant in there respective regions just 40 years after losing. You could even make the argument that Vietnam, while not exactly a beacon of economic health, is doing better now than before the Vietnam War. South Korea as well. These countries suffered tremendously and were built back up with the goal of providing to themselves AND the world and it worked. The Ukraine won't be any different, they'll have loans to pay of course... but they won't be stripmined as that helps no one in the long run. They will be built up and likely end up better than before the war.
Total hellscapes, entirely extracted of all wealth. The people of Japan and Germany live in rags, reduced to digging through the dirt to find more valuable crops and gems to provide their loan-entitled overlords.
