Right but you are using open ground so you can spread the vehicles out a lot more vs the current situation where you mainly have to stick to the roads.
So, and I believe this will be relatively soon, the ground will freeze over and it will become easy to move heavy equipment and tanks around again. There is no way Ukraine doesn't try some sort of offensive when they can go off road safely.
I cant blame Ukraine for saying no. Fall/early winter is the best time to put down the Russian fertilizer so their lands are ready for the spring planting season with all the farmers new industrial Russian donated tractors.
Not to mention what the winter would do to the Russians in the battle field, they look well supplied for winter. Putin does not have winter supplies for all these soldiers. He thought it would be done in a week or two.
The Germans made that same mistake. They found their tanks immobilized by frozen mud in the rollers. Course, the Soviet tanks had the same problem but history's written by the victors and what have you.
