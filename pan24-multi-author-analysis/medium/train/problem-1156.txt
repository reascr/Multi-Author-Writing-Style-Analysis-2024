What if someone forced Islam onto your kids? Or forced them to get a tattoo? All of this shit is pretty irreversible, right? Indoctrination of religion at a young age tends to stick, and you can’t really reverse a tattoo. How egotistical do you need to be to think you know better for someone else’s child than their own parents? They really think LGBTQ people are forcing queerness onto their kids, when in reality, the community knows all too well just how difficult it is to be in the community and probably don’t want that for their kids. Not to mention, they know what it’s like to have shit forced on them and how damaging that is.
