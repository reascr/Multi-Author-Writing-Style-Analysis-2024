All oil trading in the world has to be done with us dollars. To buy oil normally they would have to buy us dollars, pay with them, and then the seller converts those dollars to their own currency. The us could never have the debt it has and keep their credit rating if it wasn't for this "rule". This is why countries who suggest not using us dollars to trade oil are usually bombed and subject to regime change.
I mean, it’s not really a “rule”. There is an agreement between US and Saudi Arabia for the “petrodollar”, but the reason oil exporters prefer U.S. dollars is simply because it’s the most widely accepted world currency. And that’s because they are incredibly stable and they have the least amount of risk of wild fluctuations.
Obviously these are volatile times as the world fights inflation, but the Euro is down 10% YTD, the GBP is down 10.76% and the Yuan is down 11.3%… and that’s why this is even a headline. Ghana is out of US dollars because everyone is trying to get them because their own currencies are rapidly falling….
