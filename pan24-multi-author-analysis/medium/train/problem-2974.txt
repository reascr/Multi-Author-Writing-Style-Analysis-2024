It's gotten worse with no child left behind. I could do a good hour of the stuff I've come across. My first year I taught middle school and one of the teachers told me to give kids a 50 on any assignment they didn't do. She referred to it as a grade for just breathing. Fast forward to 2019 early 2020 and my principal made a similar comment. That I should give them at least 50s as a sort of mind trick to give them a grade that gives them a notion that they can come back from. I didn't say anything but that's dumb. From where I'm standing, giving them a grade for not doing anything teaches them that they'll be rewarded for doing nothing.
