Hell yeah it is. Sometimes we should all be self indulgent, lazy, slovenly and greedy. We all deserve to be in small doses.
This is the only context I’ve seen it in. That or “Need Help: my husband keeps going into goblin mode during sex”.
I travel in a few circles that call friends/each other "goblins;" last year it was "cryptid" for the same meaning. But I don't hear or see people using "goblin mode" together a lot, if at all?
in 2022 the word is a joke. zuck is trying to force his own employees to work with a VR headset on to encourage a "metaverse". the word needs to be buried for another 30 years.
Maybe if they see the world as infinitely doomed and overworked, maybe they see goblin mode as making light of a guilty pleasure.
I get that, but, and maybe this is me being super positive, I like to think younger generations are embracing their off-time to go “goblin mode”.
Lord knows I feel guilty taking time off when I really shouldn’t, but laughing at myself and called it going goblin mode, might just make me see the light side of it.
