You can see above that in the first paragraph, they asked ‘employees’ if they disclosed the opinion. They didn’t ask if it was possible for their spouse to have done so. The second paragraph shows multiple people had to ‘amend’ statements, otherwise known as an opportunity to correct previous false statements, made about their spouse. The third paragraph lays out how a spouse or Supreme could have simply ‘accidentally’ left it on a park bench for a reporter at Politico to ‘find;’ oopsie. The final paragraph says they couldn’t find any connections between employees and reporters. They didn’t say they investigated connections between their spouses and reporters. Finally, I’m not even necessarily convinced ‘employees’ includes the Supremes themselves, and I’m pretty sure the report indicates they didn’t investigate a single spouse.
