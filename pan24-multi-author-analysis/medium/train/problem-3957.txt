The US would very much like to get India away from using Russian military gear, and to have good military relations with India. India would like good relations but isn't going to put all its eggs in a Western basket after British colonization and the US taking Pakistan's side when India and Pakistan were in one of their conflicts (among other things). So this might reflect India diversifying, but seems unlikely to presage any more wholesale shift to Western gear.
Buying and developing weapons between countries isnt like going shopping, its often a unilateral agreement and cooperation between nations, kindof like a marriage.
India has historically often bought Russian or French, as they also tend to want to buy rights and the blueprints, not just the tank or plane. The US is pretty tight about information and technical exchanges, Russia and France less so.
The US showing intent to increase military cooperation and development and India being interested is showing two things.
Thankfully the Muricans in the USGOV have realised their disaster of a foreign policy with India over the decades and are now rectifying it ( they started rectifying it with the Nuclear Agreement with India).
Unlike armchair Redditors who go “India bad” everytime there is a news of India yet again buying shit tonnes of crude from Russia.
