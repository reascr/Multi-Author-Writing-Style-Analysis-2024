Trump's sphere of influence after the midterms is only now seen with far right people and I feel even with them he is split with DeSantis.
Next week Trump will announce he is running polls will come out showing Republican voters still heavily back Trump. All these Republicans representatives will quickly be kissing Trumps ass again.

Maybe. Trump still has them by the balls, but his influence with voters has been steadily shrinking. They are going to be stuck between a rock and a hard place, and they deserve every bit of it.
After the midterms I just can't see how they slowly start to turn from Trump. Trump was a huge part of why they lost and it's very obvious DeSantis is their future.
It is eroding, it is far from evaporating. Even if he still has control of 20 percent of Republicans and independents, that is enough to screw the Republicans in general.
