I've been making my GTFO of Texas plan and Minneapolis is on my list with Chicago, Denver, the Northeast, and the west coast for placea to look at. My only real concern is that I've heard people are generally pretty closed off insofar as they have their established friend grounds so it's hard to make friends as a transplant.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Realistically just some of the major cities in those areas, but it's easier to just say the Northeast or the West coast instead of specifically listing them. The biggest thing I learned from living in Texas is that I don't want to live anywhere Republicans have a good amount of power.
