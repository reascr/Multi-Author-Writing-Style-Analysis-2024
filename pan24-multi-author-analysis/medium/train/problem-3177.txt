If Iran budges at all on hijab it’ll be like the Berlin Wall. They’ve ignored the people for too long and this will only be seen as a sign of the regime’s weakness. Iran will be free soon.
No....it's not that easy. They are thinking they make this big heroic turn around decision on head scarves, and the world and many it's citizens will see it as a victory. ThenI iran can go back to it's terrorist business...and they will. They never stopped.
You don’t get it. Mandatory hijab is the symbol of the regime. The regime making any concessions regarding it would essentially be seen within the country as an admission they are powerless to stop the protests.
This isn't about Iran and terrorists or Iran and foreign policy. It's simply Iran's ruling body (which is religious) giving a concession so big to their supposed moral stance that it would be a huge dynamic shift for Iranian citizens.
Like the guy said, this is would be like the Berlin wall coming down or the ruling in the US that gave the woman the right to vote (or ended segregation if you want another example).
I think the Berlin Wall comparison could be very apt, and I think their analysis is very plausible, but no one actually knows for certain, and to suggest that you know for certain what would happen if that policy were to change is absurd.
It's absurd to try and predict these things with that much certainty. I agree it's a very good/plausible analysis, but to be that sure of what will happen is foolish.
