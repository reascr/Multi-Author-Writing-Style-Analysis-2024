Basic human decency has never been basic, especially when looking at workers and the people who employ them. To date, those things have only happened when the government makes them happen. Otherwise, our employers would cheerfully pay us pennies for 80 hour work weeks with no benefits or even safety precautions and of course good old fashioned child labor to boot.
Companies already doing this can just look at the new rules and say "cool...looks like we're all good here".
But money is the only thing that matters in this world. Treating people with decency costs money and that money belongs to the rich.
But places like, say, Amazon, where they track breaks down to the fucking second, probably need a little push to do the decent thing.
