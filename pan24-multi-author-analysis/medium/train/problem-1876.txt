Pence dare to run for president after enabling and habitually lying and covering up what was going on in the trump clown show White House those 4 years? Do he think the majority of the people are not smart enough to see that Pence knew, pence kept quiet, pence enabled that psyco in office!? Pence had the chance to end it before the jan 6 murders and injury of our police officers. Pence may think he is forgiven for that??
