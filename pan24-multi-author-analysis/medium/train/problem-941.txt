If I were you, I'd pay rent now, and reach out to family, friends and neighbors to see if they can spare any food for a day or two, if necessary in exchange of some task or other, while you use down time (if any) to look into social programs or charities. Also, if you haven't already, ask your boss for a cost of living raise, and if you have any contacts in food service (cafes, restuarants, and the like) if they could get you any day old bread or something they would normally waste, maybe on the cheap if not for free. Alternatively, look for someone advertising for a roommate to help with rent or look for a roommate yourself. But of course be careful, and screen your roommate. I'm sorry you're going through this, and try to keep your spirits up. The politicians will have to sort something out for we grunts eventually, their careers depend on it.
Living in Europe, this isn't limited to students, sadly. Maintainance guy with a solid income for almost 20 years, i'm about to lose my home because i need food, or about to starve cos i have to pay rent. Haven't made the decision yet.
I appreciate the tips, but i will find my own way through this. My whole point here is not that i'm in need of anything, but to point out that the system is just an utter failure.
