If they had these records six months ago the investigation of those records may have spun off dozens of other subpoenas to other organizations and individuals, and who knows what other information would have been revealed?

If they got these records in a timely manner we would have learned a lot more by the end of the year. Since they were delayed we learn only minor details, and no follow up.
Hey, I'll take DoJ release at this point over nothing. At the very least, any actionable info can be directed to the proper state circuit courts to get sorted out, and we all know SDNY is hungry for all the info they can get on him.
