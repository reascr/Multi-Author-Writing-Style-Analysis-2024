It's incidents like these that make me wonder about the state of our media. We literally shot a balloon out of the sky and caused an international incident, all because we were led to believe we couldn't figure out _exactly_ what it was doing.
I wish it wasn’t shot down but I don’t have a problem with it as that is pretty much how it goes. It’s the story that in 2023 China is sending a balloon across the world to take pictures of missile silos and that Republicans blew it out of proportion. If the Republican politicians of the greatest super power in the world get butt hurt over a balloon that just looks bad. Meanwhile people are telling me I’m wrong and China is in big trouble. They won’t be able to make agreements from a good position because now they owe USA a favor.
I blame China for losing 2 balloons and not giving USA a heads up. They also haven’t provided any details. But again, not a big deal. It’s a balloon. USA has it now. That's the next problem. Someone's story is going to have to change and how they handle it is what's important.
I heard it had cameras and a technology bay. The solar panels I like because I take that to mean it could have stayed airborne and running for some time. Hope the sea water doesn't damage everything.
