if israel is 20% arab and they have the same civil rights as israeli citizens, how is that aparteid? If israel arabs enjoy longer life expectancy than any other arab/muslim country, then you should maybe look at the rest of the middle east for issues rather than trying to demonize israel, which is not the source of the problem. The problem is indoctrination of the palestinian youth through the palestine authorities that mimic the things they taught to "hitler youth". The palestinian authority has been against coexistance from the start and Israel is only protecting jews from people that want to kill them is not aparteid. Their operations are against terrorist factions and sometimes people get hurt when weapons are involved, in this case it was a journalist. She knew the risk when reporting there and took the risk. If the killing was planned it would of been an assasination but we know that is what the palestinians would like us to beleive because that helps their "narrative" that israel is evil.
The US seems pretty lenient and forgiving when it comes to getting US citizens killed by certain countries.
An important point. Can you imagine the shit they do and get away with because no one cares about another Palestinian being killed?
You wouldnâ€™t believe how many people in the south believe there is a direct correlation between the president and the gas price. I often end up just staring back at them wondering how anyone could be that stupid.
