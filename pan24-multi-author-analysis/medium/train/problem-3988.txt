Rick Scott used to run a network of hundreds of hospitals called Columbia/HCA that billed Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or had not been ordered by physicians over a period of a decade. This led to the company being fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud, the largest fine of its type in history.

Which ever party spends the most in Florida wins every time. Dems abandoned Florida after 2012, the last time dens outspent and won. It’s also maybe the most transient state so it’s never worth abandoning. To much flux. This last election was a catastrophe. Never saw a single Christ sign, ad, sticker, poster, event or anything. It’s pay to play and dems didn’t pay.
I have no idea how this Voldemort cosplayer got elected in a state with such a high number of elderly. People, this is the guy coming for your retirement programs.
