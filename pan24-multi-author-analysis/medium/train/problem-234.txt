This is delusional. The “rest of the West?” Like what specifically? Sweden? Germany? The UK? We should take care of ukraine because they are in deep need of aid. Not because russia will try to conquer the “West.”.
Russia absolutely has lofty plans to take over all of Western Europe. The term used in Foundations of Geopolitics is "a Russian empire from Dublin to Vladivostok.".
The benefit is twofold. 1.) Ukraine needs the help to protect themselves from genocide. 2.) And, we need to help them because they are preventing Russia from moving closer to European countries and possibly attacking them.
The main way they hope to accomplish this is not necessarily through war but by installing far right Russian loyalists in Western governments, which they have already been incredibly successful at.
The good thing for Ukraine is that major European nations won’t be having new elections for a while. The problem comes with their largest donator, the United States. Republicans have already bitched about continuing support for Ukraine and their party is looking like they may take the cake in 2024.
I’m saying this under the guise that Biden doesn’t run again. Dems don’t really have anyone that can beat a Trump or DeSantis (that is, if Trump can continue to dodge indictments by the time 2024 comes around). I really worry that DeSantis takes the cake. He’ll make Reagan look like MLK.
This. Russia has been lasting on its own (with support from rinky-dink nations such as NK, Syria and Iran) since the beginning. Ukraine can only last as long as the west gives them support. Which means Ukraine needs this war to end.
