I hope that's the case. However, Fareed Zakaria just had a correspondent in Moscow on his show who said that Russian families who have lost relatives in the invasion are doubling down. So it sounds complicated.
Can't remember how many Russians understand English, but it was an impossibly small percentage. So even if they'd get balanced news, which they don't, they wouldn't understand them.
honestly I would say it is close to impossible, imagine you are being fed propoganda on tv, in the office no one talks about it, your son died in the war, and you expect them to denounce the war and admit that their whole way of life is wrong and they lost their child for a blood thirsty dictator's crazy delusions? Naturally I am not justifying their POV, just trying to see it from the perspective of the average russian boomer that doesn't know about VPNs etc.
There is countless of Russian speaking sources on the internet that are anti govermental. I'm speaking not about small channels, but Youtube channels that have million subscribers and regularly get millions or hundred of thousand views on their content. Language is not the problem. It's the mainstream media and those people who only consume those the problem.
Also, anyone who watches the alternative media is guaranteed that they'd avoid to be drafted by all means.
