But I’ll take your word that you are correct in that there’s nothing specifically preventing Hungary from denying entry for any reason they want. So I guess it could even be for an absurd reason. Maybe Orban propositioned Marin, Marin refused, and now Orban wants to get revenge.
you think that there is a parliament. those are incompetent servants of Orban. Dictators like this (and in my country as well, that's how I know) fill their ranks with people who'd never get there without their help, it's the classic Machiavelli. Then they get dictated what to do, and the dictator (see the semantic connection there?) use it as an excuse because the representatives chosen by the people have spoken and he "can't go against people". In reality they can't take a leak without permission and even their wives are not in illusion that those people decide anything.
Orban will shake his head, point and laugh, but when Biden leans forwards in his chair he shits himself. Guarantee a single conversation about this by Biden will put it to rest.
