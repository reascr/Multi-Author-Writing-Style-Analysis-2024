Erdogan had 20 years to improve conditions there, instead his government passed zoning amnesty laws that legalized those buildings instead of demolishing them, allowing them to collapse today.
I'm all aboard the "Fuck Erdogan" train, but how the hell was he supposed to be responsible for an earthquake?
Maybe you should consider voting to let Finland and Sweden into NATO, instead of being Putin's puppet. Then you would look more like a world leader, instead of a cheap despot.
Well his AK party is in charge in all levels, because opposition is silenced. But still after 20 years the country collapses when it is shaken up.
The guy should go, but blaming him for a response to a disaster that affects the entire nation, kills 10's of thousands of people within a couple days. No way to prep for that.
I don't know how the recovery efforts are going, but I am a bit reticent to blame a guy for that kind of disaster.
Seismologists and geologists had been pointing at the Maras fault line for decades, saying it's extremely risky, begging for authorities to take measures before a big earthquake happens. Naci Görür (leading turkish seismologist) was saying in his twitter account that he is worried about a possible earthquake in that fault line just two days before the quakes happened.
Scientists have also been pointing at the fault line under Istanbul for decades now and keep saying that when (not if) a quake finally happens in that fault line it will cause one of the worst catastrophes the world will ever see. Istanbul still has around 90,000 risky buildings today. I can't even imagine a scenario where half of them go down.
