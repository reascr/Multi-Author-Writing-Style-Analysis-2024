I agree about Biden threatening to pack the court. However if Hilary won then she would have set the pro life movement back so much with 3 pro choice justices. Democrats didn’t come out to vote for Hilary and it was because they didn’t like her. Some didn’t like her for good reasons (she wasn’t as progressive as Bernie) but things in this country became historically worse because Hilary lost that election. We cannot let ourselves get that vulnerable again. Republicans are winning because they vote for party and not for candidates. I doubt all those religious prudes liked voting for trump but they did anyways.
