Fearmongering nonsense. Water is neither created nor destroyed. And there is plenty of it for a lot more people and life than the planet has now.
No. We are only fighting wars over oil. We have plenty of food if obesity is still negatively correlated with wealth.
Very ugly, but it is not like the world is not ugly today. Putin does not need a super storm as an excuse to invade. The Junta does not need a super storm as an excuse to oppress. Iran does not need a super storm to murder girls for their hair.
Fighting over food and water probably started earlier, but I always think about the Arab Spring as being fuelled by the rising cost of food in drought stricken countries. Syria still suffers.
So, you think a couple of nations without a pot to piss in represents the state of water access for the entire rest of the world?!
The ignorance is astounding here. You've been fearmongered into buying this "water wars" nonsense for 50 years now...and it still hasn't happened. What should that tell you?!
