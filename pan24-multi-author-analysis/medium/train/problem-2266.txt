Like, if I asked you "hey, do you support the climate damage mechanism?", would you know how to respond?
"It is not the obligation of China but we are willing to make our contribution and make our effort.".
They will offer to go in and build infrastructure to counter the issue. This infrastructure will be built entirely with a Chinese workforce, so the host country has no opportunity to make money. The host country will be expected to pay for the imported Chinese workforce. They will be offered high interest loans to pay for this workforce. Then when they can't afford the loan payments China will offer to forgive the loan in exchange for ownership of the infrastructure and land it's on.
I know it's being shit on, but aren't the greater implications of supporting the notion of climate damages a really big fucking deal on the global stage, especially from China?
Sure, they're not accepting blame or responsibility, but the precedent of essentially internationally recognized climate reparations is kind of significant, no? Once set, it opens the door for future amenable governments to either pressure responsible parties or, who knows, maybe attempt some self-accountability and humility.
A spokesperson from the Chinese delegation later said that China would not contribute financially. A Reuters translation of Xie's original remarks showed he did not specify that China would contribute financially, but offered to "cooperate" with developing countries.
