There will definitely be people surviving 6+ days, and rescue work will definitely continue for 2 weeks. INSARAG works in the way that you rescue the easily rescued people first, then the harder and hardest last. It’s how you save the most people with limited resources in the least amount of time. Meanwhile this is going on there are people getting an overview of how many are missing and how many of the missing that have been found in an area. You continue until you find everyone reported missing. Dead or alive. But it’s here in the start it’s really important to be efficient, and save as many as you can. So you might move on when you get to the hardest if you can’t hear life, and there are others that are confirmed missing and stuck in another building. The deeper you are in the rubble the slimmer your chances, but they leave no one behind.
yeah as i understand it (correct me if i'm wrong) each number on the richter scale represents an order of magnitude.
so if you're thinking about it like 1,2,3,4,5 in "strenh levels", it's actually more like 1,10,100,1000,10000, etc.
