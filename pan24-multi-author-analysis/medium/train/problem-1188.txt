you don't even need to be connected to the internet. a lot of devices save your location data local if you are offline and then send it to their server if you have internet again.
a lot of devices / apps require you to activate location data to work (=mix of multiple tracking methods like SSID/mac addy of accesspoints, gps etc) on android as an example.
example: a lot of fitness trackers who use bluetooth to communicate with your phone ask you to activate it "for bluetooth to work correctly" etc.
so yes, there is no "live" tracking if you disable it.. but does that change much? as soon you activate internet again, they know your complete location profile from when you were offline. with enough data they know where you will likely be if the tracking and internet is off, even if you don't take your phone with you. since most people have regular shedules in their day like going to work, going out with friends on the weekend, going to the park with their dog etc..
Google however has a hand in the data collection at all levels so regardless of Google shares that data or how it‚Äôs shared with them, they can easily establish users. Which allows them to with or without your permission build a user profile which Google uses to make money.
Interesting perspective, every smart device has a unique id when accessing www or giving access to any other devices became very easy to track and "vulnerable". Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. ü§ù.

TDLR: Apple is collecting data exactly how it says it is, while Mysk is using clever wording to mislead and file a lawsuit.
Edit- ‚ÄúAsk not to track‚Äù means Apple isn‚Äôt gonna share data with other developers about other apps you use, etc. This cuts down on targeted ads and helps prevent a company from building a profile on you.
Any app you log into can track you, Meaning the Facebook app can still see everything you do on the app, they just can‚Äôt get data from Apple about other apps and services you use.
It should also be noted that Google can totally break this, as when you sign in on and use their apps and services they can track you and store data on their servers, this allows them to build a profile on you.
This is also the difference in Google and Apple, Apple shares data in a way that‚Äôs usually useless outside of app development, and developers generally can‚Äôt track back.
Apple has always collected data, and has always been open about it. Their privacy is in most cases they don‚Äôt know who you are or sell data to 3rd parties or allow cross app tracking.
‚Ä¢	Using Apple‚Äôs Stocks app? Apple will receive a list of the user‚Äôs watched stocks, any articles they read in-app, and the names of any stocks they searched for. The timestamps for which a user viewed stock information will be sent over too.
‚Ä¢	The data being collected is quite detailed, too. As Gizmodo points out, a user looking at the App Store app on their iPhone would have their search data, what they tapped on, and how long they were checking out an app all sent to Apple in real-time.
‚Ä¢	Some of Apple‚Äôs apps even collect detailed information about the user‚Äôs iPhone such as the model, screen resolution, and keyboard language.
‚Ä¢	According to the developers, attempts to turn this data collection off, such as selecting the Settings option ‚Äúdisable the sharing of Device Analytics altogether‚Äù did not affect the data from being sent.
And it won‚Äôt, Device Analytics shares ALL the data about the device with Apple and not just Apple use you, it also doesn‚Äôt prevent a 3rd party app that uses a log in from collecting data.
‚Ä¢	Apple is collecting this data regardless of a user‚Äôs settings where they are given the option to turn data collection off, possibly giving them a false sense of privacy.
Apple has been avoiding talking about its TOS publicly, specifically its privacy policy ever since the announcement of the "Do not track" feature. It's a taboo topic alongside encryption on the iCloud, considering the position and reasons of Apple on the encryption of their devices (again for privacy reasons).
