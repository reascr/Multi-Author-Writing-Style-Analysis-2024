I realize you’re being sarcastic but when Biden was trashing on trump for being irresponsible did he realize he did the same thing (illegally mishandling classified material) or did he forget? he’s either a liar or the old man can’t remember what’s in his garage and other offices.
trump had them in a locked closet in a house guarded by the secret service. Biden left them in a garage in a house that Hunter also lived in. one is a sad man hoarding letters from “little rocket man”. the other is gross negligence. they are both guilty of mishandling classified information. both should be in jail.
