I heard Andrew Weissman say something about looking out for an announcement about charges on or just after the 24th of January. I'm not sure why he said that specific date, but I'm primed for that time since for some reason, it seems to line up to me like a reasonable time period following the special grand jury being wrapped up. Everything takes "two weeks", and it may be in a grand jury's hands already (to indict - the special grand jury was not for that, only for investigative purposes), so the end of the month should be fun, hopefully Superbowl season will be wild.
I would pay to be in a courtroom when they ask him why he named that exact number of votes. Any answer is incriminating so he will probably take the 5th but oh to feel the crackle of electricity in the air at that moment.
Also, Willis doesnt have to wait until the 24th to make this decision. She could convene a grand jury today and get the ball rolling if she wanted too. So you can prime yourself for the 24th, but really could be any day now.

Yes it was irresponsible what was done with the docs but the similarities end there. His staff immediately reached out to NARA and turned everything over. Theyre actually cooperating with DOJ unlike trump.
The willful taking of the docs plus the obstruction (thats still ongoing) afterwards is what will fuck trump.
