Personally, I think Politico is one of the worst offenders in the mainstream for whataboutism and bothsiderisms as a soft supporter of Republicans. They were airing a bunch of the now-discredited red wave bullshit before the midterms that were largely fueled by Republican-leaning and even GOPer push-polled polling. Do you see them, or CNN, or any other supposed middle of the road media dissecting their abject failings?
And for what it's worth, I'm sick of being lumped in with all the racists because I look and have an accent like them.

I know exactly what kind of people they are talking about. Most of my relatives are that kind of people. And I would rather burn for all fucking eternity than be one of them.
