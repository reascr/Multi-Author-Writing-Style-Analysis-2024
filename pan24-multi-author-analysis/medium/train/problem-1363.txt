Sure, long term we aren't powerless, and from an anthropological standpoint we aren't helpless at the national or civilizations-level, but the reality is that this is a real woman, not just an idea or concept, and she will almost certainly be raped, tortured, and executed at some point in the near future for even daring to have an opinion.
Yea, this time it's Norway turn to invade a Muslim country and try to save it, then we can all criticize them for decades for everything bad that ever happened in the Muslim world in the last 1000 years.
Looks like she made sure she couldn't be accused of not being fully covered which is the excuse the Taliban have been using. I hope that she survives, and their regime doesn't.
In a crowd of protesters, it's easy to distribute the bravery. This one woman though. I cannot imagine the sheer strenh of will of knowing you may die in the hopes that your point is proven.
Nothing we say or comment on will change the fact that a woman with this much bravery and fire is getting culled from the Taliban regime at some point -- certainly at this phase in its existence and stability -- and that fucking sucks.
The futility shouldn't breed inaction: if anything it should be a signal to value democracy and push for projects that promote economic development. But this woman is currently living in a hell on earth, and it's fucking gut wrenching that her passion and strenh will be punished.
