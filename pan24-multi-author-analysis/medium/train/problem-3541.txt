It would probably take a year to make an MRNA vaccine like the covid vaccine. But just like the covid vaccine you would still be able to get sick from it which is not what you want. This virus is more deadly than Ebola and if it becomes transmissible from human to human then it’s also going to be more infectious than Ebola.
Avian flu is now jumping from bird to other mammals and most likely matter of time before someone will be become infected. Serious effort need to be made to prevent next potential pandemics.
People have already been infected with it. But it isn’t human to human transmission yet. It is alarming that other animals are getting sick with it though because that can signal that it has mutated. If it becomes transmissible from human to human then we are screwed. It has shown to have a 56% mortality rate keep in mind that study was done on a strain that wasn’t mutated in the way it is now.
Wow, thanks for the clarification. From bird to human it has infected but luckily for now human to human has not been confirmed.
Still I hope WHO and CDC take the matter seriously and start researching for human vaccine against avian flu.
