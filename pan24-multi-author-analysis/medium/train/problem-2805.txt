All companies, businesses, even governments need to evaluate what actual minimal personal information is actually needed to operate as opposed to wanted and "good to have" off customers to access services and how long do they need the information for. So many companies hold onto personal details long after you have left or stopped using them. Passing info to third parties needs to be banned. Unused accounts need to be deleted and not "paused". Plus a huge crack down on fake call centres with big penalties when raided.
While I 100% agree with you when it comes to random commercial applications like Trello or Kickstarter, what about legitimate cases, such as medical records?
But the Australian government wont pass comprehensive privacy laws like the EU nor do they want to even guarantee that Australian citizens have privacy rights. Its the politicians who give these corporations a get out of jail for free card for abusing privacy.
What labour says and does in opposition is what it thinks is the best course to get back in, what it does while it's in power is what it really wants to do. I know that's shitty and everyone should just be open but that's the political game. The liberal party would never say they are going to defund Medicare while in opposition but as soon as they get in what do they do, try and defund Medicare.
Healthcare also tends to be underfunded in most places in the world, often leaving proper IT/operations low on their priority list, which would put a lot of pressure on figuring out how exactly to scrub that data.
As a doctor, you probably want your patient's entire medical history with as much detail as possible, especially when facing a life threatening situation where misdiagnosis can kill the patient.
You could probably design a system for privacy first, but just like security - it's not a product, it's a process, and requires a certain mindset to maintain.
