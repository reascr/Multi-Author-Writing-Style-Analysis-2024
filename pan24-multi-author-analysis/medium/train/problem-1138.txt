Tbh tho the more I read about the nutty putty guy the more I dont feel bad for him. Dont get me wrong its a terrible, terrible way to go for him. But he had a pregnant fiance at home, hadnt gone caving in years, goes to a more difficult cave a couple weeks before his wedding, doesnt properly know the layout of the cave enough and yet he pushed through a unknown spot, and we all know the rest of the story.
I cant think of a more polite way to say that i didnt feel bad for him because it makes me seem like a huge asshole, but there was just so many things this guy could of done to prevent this, not to mention just not doing it, or going to an easier cave, and now theres a greiving widow with a child on the way becsuse this guy didnt stop and think of the consequences for a second.
Yes and also if doing pour over for grinds, if you make it thick it (edit: this it being the appropriate temp range instead of boiling temp) also lets you still get more cups out of it since you donâ€™t overextract and breakdown flavor in the first or first few pour throughs - still need to do them immediately though.
Edit: hey everyone - thank you so much for the recommendations and instructions. Your collective instruction/input is greatly appreciated. You all are saving me a lot of trial and error You all rock.
