Not exactly. There’s a major forward sub base in Guam, and a major airbase on Okinawa (and a couple on the Japanese main islands + S. Korea). These bases have the First Island Chain pretty well covered within their AOR, and more sub bases in Hawaii and the US West Coast can provide fairly rapid backup when needed, arriving in time to relieve the Guam-based assets after a tour in the area. Any of those subs can make port and receive supplies and service from existing naval supply depots in Okinawa, Sasebo, Yokosuka, Busan, Subic Bay, and Singapore, and probably a couple other locations I’m not thinking of, plus a dozen smaller ports where the US has standing agreements for port visits and purchase of supplies.
It becomes a significantly larger problem containing China without any of these key locations. With them, China could be effectively blockaded. Without Taiwan, it becomes virtually impossible. If China is able to escape this perimeter in any meaningful way, the risk is the capability of medium/short range missile strikes directly on US soil from submarines.
