Wilhelm and Nicolas were second and third cousins, as they shared a great grandfather in Fredrick William 3rd, and also separately shared a great great grandfather in Paul the First of Russia (son of Catherine the Great) so while they aren’t ALL first cousins, only Wilhelm and Nicolas weren’t second cousins.
Probably because those 2 and Kaiser Wilhelm were all first cousins, and not only that but King George and Kaiser Wilhelm were both grandchildren of Queen Victoria. All 3 boys grew up together as well.
It is also said that Wilhelm II was Victoria’s favourite grandson. She exchanged many letters with her daughter over his health issues, and had British doctors sent over to Berlin when she thought the German treatments were too backwards.
Yes, but in Catherine’s case, she literally grew up in Prussia as Sophie von Anhalt-Zerbst. She only took up the name “Catherine” after conversion to Russian Orthodoxy for her marriage.
“Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and German emperor Wilhelm II were all first cousins of King George V of the United Kingdom”.
