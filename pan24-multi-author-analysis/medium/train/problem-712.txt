This probably means that they realized that the state of their current nuclear arsenal and infrastructure is not what they thought it was.
Money diverted, maintenance not done. All the engineers who knew how to make critical parts nearing retirement and no way to quickly build new and better stuff except on paper.
So really, even without nukes, they'd still be around. In fact the nukes are straining relations a bit right now as NK loves to threaten with them all the time, and China doesn't want to drag themselves into a war NK starts. They just want to keep the US from having a proper border with them.
Or, simply have zero faith in their conventional forces deterring any aggression, and want to ramp up their nuclear arms backbone to further cement their security posture.
Basically becoming what Eisenhower dreamed of under Project Solarium. Don't need a regular military if you have the CIA FSB to kill everyone who opposes you, and nuclear arms to constantly threaten all out nuclear holocaust to anyone you can't just kill.
It was as moronic in the 1950s as it is now, but Russia doesn't really have any other choice. No one is threatened by their conventional forces anymore with how much they've struggled in Ukraine. Only option to even look powerful going forward is to expedite the retirement of the older RT-2PMs, UR-100s, and R-36s for newer ICBMs, rush the production of RSM-56 SLBMs for the submarines, continued production of the Kh-101s for increased survivability vs the now antique Kh-55, etc.
