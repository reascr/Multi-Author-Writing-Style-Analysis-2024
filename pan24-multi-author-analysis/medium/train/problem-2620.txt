There’s a great line from the YouTube series “The Alt-Right Playbook.” Essentially, the creator says that, fundamentally, fascists aren’t authoritarians, monarchist, socialists, democracy advocates or anything else. They’re “Whatever puts them in power-ists.” Fascists will absolutely use democracy to elevate themselves to power if they can. But because their chosen model of government is designed to benefit a handful of people while the rest suffer, and no one is allowed to improve their position, authoritarianism is the only way they can maintain their power. Hence the above story.
