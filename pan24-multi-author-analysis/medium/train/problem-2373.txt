It's not likely, it's almost certain. There is video evidence of at least 3 t90s getting fucking ruined in that axis in the last week alone. Not to mention the scores of other vehicles and countless soldiers getting wrecked in the same area. Probably lost a dozen vehicles in one push alone.
It blows me away when I read about people thinking that Russia can sustain this. They can't. No one can. Sacrificing an entire battalions worth of people per every city block is not a sustainable amount of attrition. There is a LOOOOOOOOOOT of Ukraine left for Russia to take before this even gets close to over.
Vehicle in the front gets taken out by a mine. Second vehicle in line tries to drive around it and immediately gets taken out by another mine. Third vehicle tries driving around the other side of the first vehicle and, miraculously, isn't immediately blown up -- then thinks better of it and decides to back up... directly into another mine.
According to wikipedia russia made 25k t-72 tanks alone,most of that is exported but they got shitloads of stuff to send still,ukraine is running low on artillery shells and russia knows it.Everyone is talking about jets but they really need ammo more right now.
They've probably lost around half of their serviceable tanks already. They're also running out of ammo themselves and trained crew to run those tanks.
The ammo is being taken care of. Ukrainians are asking for aircraft, because they know more about what they need than anyone else does.
Think it was mostly Excalibur shells, but yes, just keep on trying to push on through as oppose to spreading out and performing more advanced maneuvers beyond parade day tight packed column.
