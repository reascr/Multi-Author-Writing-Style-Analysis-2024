The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for procuring and supplying uniforms for the DoD. They are basically a contracting organization: they make a contract for 50,000 Blouses, then take bids to fill that contract. The selected bidder is awarded the contract on a point-based system, of which price and domesticity are both part of the points equation (among others). This creates a preference, but not a hard requirement, towards domestic producers. In times where the needed purchase volume is greater than domestic bidders can produce by the required deadline, then overseas bids may suddenly become competitive even with their lower point score. An easy example of this is when a branch rolls out new uniforms: all active members need to update their wardrobe, which creates a sudden surge in volume demand that then tapers off after a short time.
UN primary goal was to avoid a direct confrontation bewtween the winners of that war and drag the rest of their allies into that mess after all.
