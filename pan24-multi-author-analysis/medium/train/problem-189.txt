I'm pretty sure we were only able to make SR-71s bc we used a ton of back channels to buy titanium from the USSR. As in the USSR had the best source and mining capabilities for it at the time, so we did some crazy shit like have a shell company in x country buy it from the USSR, sell to another shell company in country y, who sold it to another shell company in country z, who sold it to us.
We didn't really know what mig 25s we're outside that they had a weird design and were fast until a Russian pilot defected and landed at a random airfield in Japan.
I heard a story of an Iranian physician who was a former military pilot. He wanted to defect to the united states and stole a fighter jet (I believe it was an old Mig) and brought his wife and young child into the cockpit with him, then flew below radar detection altitude all the way to the border. Crazy.
I would call them a target drone, not a suicide drone. The have a very low chance of reach the target and will just be used as anti-air missile targets.
