Indigenous communities have been fighting for centuries but still get massive backlash and hostility.
You cant even talk about indigenous political stances because decolonization politics attacks the foundations of pretty much the entire political world.
Say Identity Politics in the Americas has roots in racial essentialism and erases indigenous culture to just "genetics", and that gender theory appropriates indigenous concepts like two spirited people without actually understanding the concept and you get in trouble with people who talk over feelings of Indigenous people.
Its hard to find political support when there is so much institutional hostility and these institutions literally do not think of the world the same way. An interview with an indigenous author had the interviewer ask if she was not "happy civilization lifted everyone out of poverty" instead of being pro-environment.
Could you explain how "non-indigenous" gender theory appropriates indigenous gender theory? I've never met a 2S person who thought this way about it at all.
