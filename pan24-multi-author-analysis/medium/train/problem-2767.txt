Yep, it’s super frustrating the monopoly they’ve built. That being said, with a little actual work, they could’ve planned a tour that doesn’t hit TM venues, it IS possible. But the TM ecosystem makes it so easy/simple that they go the easy route, not to mention TSwift and Co stand to make the most $$$ by having this circus occur. Any press is good press, now this tour is even more hyped up.
Fuck Ticketmaster in general but the artists make the decisions. Not the touring management, not the record company.
EDIT: and before some Swifties come in to defend her just know the premise: there are other options outside of Ticketmaster. These artist just want big fucking stadiums when you can find big enough venues that don’t contract with TM. Just more work for your team to set up.
Where do you suggest I look for this data? Would love to find a list of Arenas/Venues owned/operated by Ticketmaster/LiveNation to compare against arenas around the country, but such a list doesn’t seem to exist. If every venue is truly owned by TM, then we’re just fucked and it’s really sad. I’d be interested if you could prove that though, like I said I’d love to see the data.
Thanks for telling me to shut up on a thread about a pop star selling tickets though, you’re clearly a fun person.
