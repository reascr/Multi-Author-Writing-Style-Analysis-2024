Unless the Russians are wiling to escalate beyond high explosive warheads on those missiles, it's difficult to see how these occasional bombardments will seriously affect the war, one way or another. Additionally, one has to doubt whether Russian production can sustain these occasional bombardments.
They won't: the history of strategic bombing is one of failures. Even the Hiroshima nuclear bomb didn't lead to an immediate Japanese capitulation - they were still thinking they might negotiate favorable surrender terms.
Sure, but "massive civilian casualties" didn't convince the Japanese of anything, otherwise the firebombing of Tokyo and like 46% of their other cities should've done it.
Unlike the firebombings, which were conducted at low altitude and allowed the military to return fire, the atomic bombs could be dropped from altitude not particularly accurately and still hit every military asset in an area, and required committing only a single high altitude bomber to do it.
Nuclear bombardment today would be unlikely to lead to a desire to surrender to a regime, particularly one set on population annihilation like Russia is - not so long as there remained viable options for military engagement (modern AA can hit the SR-71, so there is no unassailable air power).
