As an American in a same-sex marriage with a Russian, this is very depressing. We have family in Russia who we very much want to see. The war is currently making that something we won't be doing until at least that is over (let's hope with Ukraine successfully defending freedom). Now this law makes it difficult to see family there even after the war. It sounds like just acknowledging that we exist is now illegal.
And that's just for us. I can't imagine how depressing this must be for gay people still living in Russia. The suicide rate for gay teens is already higher than for straight kids. How many more kids' lives will this now cost Russia? That is the blood of children on their hands.
I recall reading another article that a 17 year old in Russia came out to his childhood friends at school.
And it's another nail in the coffin of Russia even pretending to follow the free speech rights outlined in their constitution. What a sad joke that has become.
And what did they do afterwards? Simple, they murdered him while torturing and raping him with bottles.
And the worst part, the kids got off scot-free and his parents said (to paraphrase), “it’s sad he’s gay, rather have him die a drunk at a bar fight.”.
Dude, russians are taught "Taras Bulba" novel in the school. A novel where a man kills his own son for treason saying: "I gave you life, I will also kill you!".
