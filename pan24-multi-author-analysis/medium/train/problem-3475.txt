As a professional legal lawer, I can tell you that everyone accused of a crime can simply declare themselves to be a presidential candidate and they can't be charged. It's what we "in the business" call a loophole.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

This is likely why he is running. To claim its a witch hunt and persecution. It also plays well with his supporters as it energizes the base. Republican leaders can get mad at Trump all they want. But if the fanatical Trump supporters stick with him he may very well still get the republican nomination.
