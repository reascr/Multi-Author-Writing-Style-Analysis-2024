If zoning laws, around WWII, limited the accessibility of brand new wartime housing and neighborhoods exclusively to whites, and essentially establishing ghettos, offering shitty run down old properties to Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and other minorities whom also served…you can get zoning laws to limit the corporate entities that can own the property, to begin with. Thus, the general public can allot more control in a local level on how much volume of land can be used for rentals. If in a situation exists where the local economy needs to increase or decrease rental property eligibility then the community has a say. You don’t hurt developers much by slapping a tax, they increase the rents. What you want is to minimize the opportunity for companies like BlackRock to buy the properties to begin with…or at least make it a vehement pain in the ass to do so. Taxes don’t balance oligarchs for fuck, they can always make a quick buck while you struggle to pay rent.
Here in Portland, the population decreased slightly and yet the housing availability went down significantly due to hedgefund guys buying all the houses (with cash, above asking price, and with no inspections) and using them for AirBnB.
