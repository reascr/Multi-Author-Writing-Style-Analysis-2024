Once developing countries catch up with the west, we are all fucked. I went to Iraq last year and the consumerism is off the charts. So much China plastic junk all around.
It took us decades of hard work to change the mindsets. So it'll probably get worse before it gets better.
Yup, we had a short window to course correct ourselves and society before we exported our lifestyle to the rest of the world but instead we spread it like a cancer. If we had solved a lot of these issues like rampant consumerism and obsolescence we'd be in much better place. Instead we build products to break. Each product takes energy to create, from trucks to ship them, from factories keeping lights on plus the cost to bury it a year later because they designed it so the battery can't replaced even though every other part on the product works perfectly.
We (as in Europe/NA) really take pollution and littering relatively seriously too. I traveled around West Africa in November and people just throw plastic trash like bottles and water in plastic bags out of car windows. There's plastic and other trash everywhere just dumped on the streets.
We have 3 billion people out of 9 billion who live that consumer lifestyle and its growing every year. We could sustain it 3 billion.
