You only need to go back to the ten years from 1985-1995 to find a time when “community standards” meant anything deemed obscene by the most prudish members of the community was difficult to access, Congress was holding on censoring obscene song lyrics, and were being closed because of the content of books they stocked, and musicians were being at live performances. All of this happened with broad public support because laws like this inherently set up the argument that you’re for censorship, or you are a pervert.
These laws have little to do with pornography and much more to do with with shutting down opposing viewpoints. It’s an extension of what happens when people take offense at someone shouting profanities because taking offense means you never have to ask why are they shouting profanities.
