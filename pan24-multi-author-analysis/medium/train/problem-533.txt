Not sure if this was mentioned but teleworking large groups of employees save lots of tax dollars by not having to have full buildings up and running to accommodate them. Example, just before the lockdown, my employer sighed a lease for x number of square feet in a new building. The lockdown came when the building was half done and our old building was now vacant. They realize how much money they saved in electric alone but also all other areas too. Post lockdown, the building is done and they do not want us to come back. They are on the hook for that x number of square feet but it does not mean we have to be in it. There is an entire floor that could be used for a ping pong tournament. Now they are subleasing some of the third floor to others, probably GOP folks.

Yes, they do. Or rather their billionaire donors do. Billionaire capitol holders need a massive pool of pore people to funnel money up from, to buy their shitty products and work their min wage death march jobs.
