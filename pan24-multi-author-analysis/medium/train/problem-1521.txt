It's clear that we are not. Our entire evolutionary path was based around intelligence, and with intelligence came technology. We evolved this way because survival of the fittest brought us to this point. The technology, whether it be primitive herbal remedies, axes, and basic camp fires, or modern medicine, guns, and advanced cooking and cleaning. Everything around us is part of our evolution as a species. What you are saying is like saying "The ability to run fast rescued cheetahs from starvation, without it they would be an evolutionary dead end" or "If whales were the size of baby turtles and couldn't swim to the depths, then they would be extinct by now because they would be a failure". You cannot discount our technology, our technology is what we both evolved for and around as a species.
Unsurprising; Pregnancy is never really a safe thing to go through, no matter where in the world you are. Shit like can have poor outcomes (including death), not to mention complications during birth, immediately post birth, etc.
