Lmao These dumbass jokers cannot even defeat Ukraine, at least not yet. A 3 day voyage has turned into a year now. And seriously, Poland? Poland would absolutely destroy the fuck out of Russia if they decided to invade. Their military is wayyy stronger than the Ukrainians. Comments like this show why most of the Russian population still shits in outhouses and why they'll never be no more than a mafia/kleptocracy government. They'll never be any better than they currently are bc of the sheer amount of dumbasses that control the country. Exactly why they are a country on the decline in a fucking fast way.
I believe "Gott mitt uns" was originally a Swedish army motto during the 30 years war, that eventually got picked up by the Prussians who in turn became the Germans.
I mean yeah to us english speakers it sounds hilarious, almost like a play on got milk? - but it probably wasn't so funny to the germans 400 years ago..
Swedes had some of the finest & smallest cannons back in that era, due them owning some humongous mine.
