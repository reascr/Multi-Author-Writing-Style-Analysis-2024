If they counted all of the votes really quickly, Fox News and the loser republicans that lost their races would claim that the speed of the counting was insanity and would be begging them to slow down.
There is no winning with these assholes because, deep down, they don't care about actually counting votes, they care about only counting republican votes.
yeah, look at the comments section in that 'article'. its just a flurry of dumb rehashed right wing talking points about dems cheating, ballot harvesting/stuffing (whatever the fuck that is), election security lies, not understanding the basics of how voting works or is tallied.
reality doesn't matter to them anymore, they remain perpetually angry and just shift the narratives around to keep that collective anger going.
that's one aspect but look at what the gop has been doing with electioneering shenanigan for the last decade. closing down polling places, not enough voter counters, changing the laws for 'security reasons' that add all sorts of needless speedbumps. they're trying all the bullshit they can to disenfranchise voters they dont like within the existing laws. they created this beast and now they are unhappy with their actions.
