Russian elites want to be done with Russian soldiers and their families and citizens. Why is there jail times up to 15 years for Russian protesting Putin’s war, why are Russians getting thrown off buildings to their death, why are Russians getting shot behind their head, why is Putin and accomplices being accused of WAR CRIMINAL CRIMES, why has Putin’s war caused so much economic drain on Russia, why have thousands of educated Russians leave Russia in protest against the war, why is Navalny still in prison if Putin is so sure of his cause, why is Putin cancelling the treaty to nuclear arms with the US if they consider themselves serious world stage players, why is Putin always threatening use of nuclear nukes if he has a powerful army like he says, why is the EU more united than ever and more countries are joining NATO against Russian threats, why is Putin doing all this if he himself doesn’t understand what he’s doing to Russia.
In most of Russia (outside of Moscow/Petersburg) anyone that has indoor plumbing, toilets and can afford a refrigerator without having their children loot it from Ukraine at the cost of their lives, is considered an 'elite'. So congrats, unless you are homeless, Russians consider you the grand amazing and unreachable 'elite'.
