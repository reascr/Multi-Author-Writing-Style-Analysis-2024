Not sure where fear mongering cones into play here this us just how evolution works. What were talking about us genetic drift. We are a species that uses tons of energy to procreate and to rear the young but if we have less success due to some outside factor which we can't cobtrol then what happens to our gene pool? It's not like a person who's genes coded for creating a human who takes too many risks ended up not passing on genes as a result of their risk taking ways, this is affecting random people (actually seemingly all males) and will have an effect on the individual. Ultimately you want to pass genes down and if you can't your fitness decreases which will be cause for those genes fluttering out and ceasing to be part of the gene pool. Again I said before we don't know how this will affect us yet but I think my prediction of "this will impact our gene pool" is extremely accurate. To deny this is to be willingly ignorant.
Interesting read, but so alarmist that it can't be taken seriously. I am seeing the plot of a post-apocalyptic porn here.
I buy that sperm counts are dropping precipitously and that will lead to a dramatic decline in birth rates. l buy that chemicals, poor health habits etc are contributors/causes. You lose me when you say that worldwide siren counts will drop to zero in less than 25 years and result in human extinction within a century. Welcome to Q world.
