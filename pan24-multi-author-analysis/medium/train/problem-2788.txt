Hostels in Europe are cheap too, I stayed in London for a weekend for 120 total, and you can cook your own food at then so it's paying for groceries, not going out everyday, also the distance from Sweden to Germany is basically the difference of say New York to Florida driving (and flights being stupidly cheap in Europe, it's basically like taking a grey hound in terms of price, but much faster).
Not all that expensive, especially when you don't necessarily have to rely on flights. Pretty good train links across the continent and free movement. It's about as easy/cheap as visiting other states in the US, or driving up to Canada if you live near enough to the border.
Meanwhile, the crooks who are destroying our planet get to make more money and live in extreme luxury while the rest of us deal with the effects of climate change. More people should be out protesting against fossil fuels. Our survival depends on it.
It sounds like you're still stuck in the industrial revolution. Welcome to the modern age, where we have all sorts of different non-fossil energy sources like nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, tidal, etc.
To eliminate fossil fuels means a return to agrarian pre industrial revolution lifestyle which means a 90% reduction in world population, especially in colder climates. It's cool if you're fine with that, but be aware of the consequences of what you ask.
