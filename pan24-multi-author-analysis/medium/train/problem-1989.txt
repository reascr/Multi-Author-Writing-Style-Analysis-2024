Old reporters die off or quit after the last strike and each crop of new interns, get used to lots of new slang.
I think the first time I heard that was during some picture meme of Pelosi clapping during State of the Union, but speakers always do that so I didn't get it.
I dont understand how "unidentified sources" hold more value than a public, offical position of our new MOD.
Also the comments about American tanks are silly. First of all America is doing the most of all countries and this is, above all other things a European issue ( saying this as a neighbor of Germany).
Secondly America Bradley’s are not practical so they are sending their armored vehicles ( which are amazing). Germany cannot send those because their are shit ( the almost all broke down recently). Germany’s tanks are amazing though and there are a lot of them.
Thirdly what does America has to do with Germany giving permission to other EU allies to supply Ukraine with tanks? Most other EU members want to help but are being held hostage by German passivity.
Lastly, the fact that Germany on the one hand claims to want to show leadership, especially in Eastern Europe, but keeps shitting the bed on all international issues due to cowardice and a double moral standard ( supports Russia and China, makes deal with Middle eastern countries yet harps about leading in human rights) is holding the whole of the EU back. Germany has become the nation that has become Europe biggest political headache and this is even before the are really suffering economically. Their leadership (mostly the SPD to be honest) is failing to adjust to the new world dooming everybody in the process.
Your the biggest nation in the EU, in large part morally responsible for Putin actions, start leading instead of following.
