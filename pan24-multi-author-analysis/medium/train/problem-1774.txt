If you're going to threaten us with genocide they can at least put the effort to make a good threat.
Like a decade ago Hezbollah made a video threatening Israel of "פיעוגי ההתבאדות" which should have been "suicide bombers" but due to multiple spelling errors and bad grammar turned out more like "bewarb of succulant bonders" (I'm trying to translate the spelling errors in the spirit of the original).
I disagree with the thought process that they’re going to indulge proper grammar or spelling in a language of a people they hate.
They don’t give a shit. They got the basic message across and the disrespect of the time and effort to make it proper adds to the effect.
Which is when you have to question the intent. If it's actually meant to intimidate Israelis it's failing miserably, they are seen as a laughing stock.
There’s no doubt their intent/result isn’t hitting. No shit. Especially when regardless of Israel, the US is standing behind Israel and far far scarier. But we’re talking about their approach in this one PR stunt. Not the result or intent.
