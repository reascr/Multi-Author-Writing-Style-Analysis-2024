Wow just wow, so there is evidence that South Korea committed such crimes, but your defense is that it’s Vietnamese themselves! Not suure what disturbing mental gymnastics you trying to pull here, but refusing to acknowledge past crimes, victim-blaming, passing the buck and being insincere won’t improve Korea’s image.
The people of Jeju who suffered attempted ethnic cleansing at the hands of the South Korean military will also be watching closely to see what happens here.
This topic is a really interesting one. The whole reason for Korea sending troops is one that South Korea would love to forget. LBJ was so desperate for other countries to participate that he offered ludicrous trade deals to willing partners…. Those trade deals are a huge part of the financial foundation that built modern day South Korea.
South Korea and USA needs to apologise and provide compensation for its war crimes and sexual crimes it has committed during the Vietnam War. The other victims are still waiting for justice.
