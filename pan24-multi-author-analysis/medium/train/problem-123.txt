Ya, so the right track is massive corruption, the removal of women's rights, voting rights, making the poor, poorer, having the court remove safeguards and environmental programs, having a house and senate that is completely dysfunctional, making women cover their arms, allow smoking in congress just to piss off the libs , having grade 1 teachers life threatened by parents for teaching "CRT" to their kids, having a coup, having a white supremacist group try to kidnap a governor, having ex presidents steal highly classified documents, then having a family member receive 2 billion dollars from SA , having lithe classified documents scattered all over the place with no accountability or changes in policy to prevent this, having kids starve, women dying at alarming rates while pregnant or giving birth, having governors ship migrants all over the country to be cruel, having an insane amount of people go bankrupt simply to get medical care, having the most people in prison per capita in the world, having multiple mass shootings in a single day....
It's not like our news talks about the 100% inflation rate hitting Argentina, the floods that wiped out Pakistan where they literally ration energy, or the political crisis in Peru.
