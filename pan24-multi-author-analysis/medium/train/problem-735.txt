It’s interesting because my only exposure to Walsh is as an anti trump figure. He appeared on this YouTube documentary I watched about republicans who left the cult of trump.

Being from IL, I remember Joe Walsh and his election to Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010. Prior to that he was a radio host in the Chicago area. An absolutely disgusting human being. Don’t let his anti-Trump rhetoric fool you, this guy is pure scum and has terrible right wing positions on nearly every issue.
Just basing from that documentary, I at least was glad he was sane enough to oppose trump. Sad to hear he’s just as rabid in other areas.
I really don't think it's as easy as you make it seem to just write him off. I haven't followed him lately, but just brushing up, he seems to be pretty sick of the current GOP and their bullshit. His pinned tweet is a video of him showing GOP voter intimidation tactics and attacking them for restricting voting rights and being a threat to our democracy.
Maybe he was putting on a show to win the tea party crowd, maybe he's putting on a show now, I really don't know. People can change, but grifters can also adapt.
Like I said, I just did ten minutes of brush up on the guy. I have no idea how much he believes what he's saying, but I do appreciate former republicans who are willing to attack the utter lunacy that is the current GOP.
