We cant survive on US and middle east help alone. Russia has oil. We need it. We need it for best prices which Russia will probably offer.
If people say these countries support Ukrainian war then every Windows or Apple user for past 20 years supported US wars in Middle East. You support the "genocide" in China by having most things in your house made in China. Millions of people who tuned in or turned up to Qutar football supports the treatment of their workers.
Besides when you know something is NEEDED then you would be stupid to sell it dirt cheap. Besides if Russia offers the best price then you also save a bit on transport since ME is not right next to Japan like Russia is.
Please tell us beT course of action against these evil countries that want to ease their already difficult situations.
So I am sure there is a TON of logistics that I know I am unawares of, BUT in the end it does seem that the result is:
List can go on and on. And you know what? I dont care. Because it is my job not to care about these things.
Ukraine would gladly cut those pipelines if the recipients weren't part of the block that helps Ukraine survive.
