Yeah. I was skeptical whether the Patriots will make much of a difference in the war. But now that Moscow says they won't, they probably will make a big difference.
If nothing else, it can protect against ballistic missiles. Not perfectly, but there's no 100% air defense network in this world.
Those are hard to engage with other systems Ukraine has, which is why Putin begged and scraped before Iran to get some.
My concern is that they are vulnerable to cruise missiles, small suicide drones, and spec ops. They are going to have to be protected extremely well with ground troops and maybe those German AA tanks -- a couple per Patriot battery.
Dude i was thinking same - it's one battery that's coming in couple months. What is that gonna cover, like one city? But the amount of screetching and confused screaming coming from Russia over this is starting to make me convinced there is something more going on here.
Putin is pissed he is going to have his Kyiv Invasion Part 2 fucked by a single piece of US equiptment. A well placed Patriot Battery is a nasty, nasty thing. Especially if the side with the Patriots also has the upper hand in intellegence.
