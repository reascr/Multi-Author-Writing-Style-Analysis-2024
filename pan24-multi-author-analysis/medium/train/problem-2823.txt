Sanctions can take different forms.. like restricting chinas access to chip making tech thats underway already. If anything reliance on russian energy fiasco prompts changes for more domestic production; even if its more costly.
Not just a matter of cost although that's a big part of it. It's a matter of scale and pervasiveness. China makes everything. There is not a single US industry that's completely divorced from China. Most buy produced goods and raw materials from china. Those who don't buy their equipment from china. But everyone buys parts and components and the vast majority of electronics are made in china. More than half the world's steel, 85% of all lithium ion batteries are made in china and 95% of all electronics contain at least one Chinese component. It would take trillions of dollars of investment and then years to completely wean the USA off of china and it would be extremely painful for US firms and consumers.
China has switched away from plastic crap. They now make budget high end electronics like phones and computers and cars. And they're good quality. Think Xiaomi, Huawei, BYD. If the west is unable to evolve their perspective on China, they'll lose to china. China is changing. If you don't recognize that you will be a step behind always.
Did you not read my comment? Not pretty fast. It would take a decade at least to fully reproduce China's infrastructure. And who's going to pay for it?
You can put a 100% custom tax on anything from China and you stop people buying anything Chinese overnight. There would be pain initially but the world would change to the new situation pretty fast.
