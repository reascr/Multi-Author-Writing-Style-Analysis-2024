Democrats should take advantage of these moments to show Americans how Republicans are still very much a clear and present danger to our democracy, let alone that they donâ€™t have any actual solutions for our issues.
The real danger in all of this isn't that so many Republicans are showing themselves to be weak misguided and cowards. The real danger is the more that Trump stretches the boundaries the more these ideas become mainstream and normalize. It's like the parent who tells their child to be home by 10:00pm and then the child says 11 and then 12 and then 1am and then 2 and then 3 and at first you're shocked but then the new norm becomes 2:00 a.m. because nobody stuck to 9pm. Look at how far we've come where people can openly admire and praise Adolf Hitler and nobody speaks up and condemned Jews and Blacks and attack LGBTQ people and Hispanics etc. The last seven years have been absolutely horrific and are only getting worse. Amazing how the originalists that revere the Constitution and the Founding Father's intention are now silent when one of their own advocates shredding the document.
