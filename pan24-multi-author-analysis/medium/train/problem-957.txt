I'd be much more worried by what Gen.Milley said than anything the DM publishes. It may be that USA is more worried about it's ally Taiwan, and being unable to face China in a conflict as well as helping Ukraine at the same time. Even the remote possibility of war on 2 fronts will scare them...America really has no 'friends' only 'interests'.
You think if russia had the type of offensive gains ukraine has been having, that they would wanna go yo the negotiation table?
