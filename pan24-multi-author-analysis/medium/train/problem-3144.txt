Assuming the tanks appear on a Ukrainian training field tomorrow the average training cycle is 6-22 weeks on M1 Abrams. Russia is expected to launch their next major offensive within the next eight weeks or so.
While I am confident that the Russians will continue to make strategic blunders there is a very real concern that Ukrainians manning the Leopards and M1’s will only have the bare minimum amount of training whereas the Russians have been training in late model T-80’s and T-90’s since early November.
With this current timeline the Ukrainians won’t be ready for a counteroffensive of their own until June.
It's also that there is lot of training, logistics, learning from the battlefield. It would be terrible to send them hundreds of tanks and have them captured by the Russians.
Because contrary to what many people think 14 is not a random number. It's actually the maximum number of tanks that can be made available on short notice. I don't see why so many people fail to understand such a simple concept.
So the West is sending them a few of them first, let them finding their way with it. Once the Ukrainians will demonstrate full capacity with it, I'm pretty sure they will have more.
