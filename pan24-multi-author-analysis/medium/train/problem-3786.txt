True, but there are plenty that will cozy up to him for the time being until shit hits the fan and they bail as the military storms his office and capture him. Its all about timing and seeing the writing on the wall for most of those people and hoping they aren't in any position to be got before fleeing the country.
Luka has an issue with his military: there are a lot (if not most) of them that hate him and would coup him the moment they had a chance.
My guess is that he is going to move people he trusts exclusively into this new paramilitary force, and then use it to strategically and systematically remove military forces within his own country that have commanders not loyal to him. Seems like a move to consolidate power to me.
That’s why it’s a dying business model. It’s simply unsustainable to function once you realize nobody likes you as much as they like bribe money.
Handing them all guns and training is going to have looney tunes levels of predictable consequences for dipshit Lukeshenko.
Actually, if you look at the newest articles, someone leaked plans for Belarus to join Russia within the next decade.
This plan of his makes sense now. The loyalists will be transferred to the paramilitary unit, which will then be absorbed into the Russian military. Then Luka will disband Belarus's military, leaving only the paramilitary unit (read Russian Army) in Belarus.
It's likely not him that is managing or planning this--it's likely the FSB and Putin, and Luka might be incapable but they are not. If there is one thing Russia is good at, it's controlling domestic dissent.
