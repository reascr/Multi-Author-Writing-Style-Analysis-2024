If someone gets out of their car on the motorway in order to drag away a couple of blockaders, the traffic has already stopped, so there is no danger. Unless some bloodthirsty psychopath in the first row of cars decides to drive over the protesters of course. You would think that's unlikely, but judging from the number of times this has happened, it seems like a significant percentage of car drivers are bloodthirsty psychopaths.
Say what you want about the protests themselves, but dawn raids on people who might be planning to attend a non-violent protest is seriously dystopian. I would hope that everyone can agree on that.
The bigger problem if you ask me is how selectively this is being enforced. A few years ago the police themselves did it by slowing down traffic and there were no consequences. More recently farmers did it and nobody intervened. But now climate protesters are doing it and suddenly the police are called into action.
They were arrested for inciting people to take part of blockading the highway (both blockading and inciting people to violate the law are illegal).
