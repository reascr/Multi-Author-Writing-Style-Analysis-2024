You go up in the hills and you dig out a place in the rocks. And you live there! That's what you do. You dig it out, and you just fuckin' live there.
What I instead do not understand is why they needed to build a sporty car. It does not seem like a priority to me.
You know how your tent gets sand in it all the time? Super shitty. Suuucks. So I made a sand-proof tent.
It's not a tent tent. Get rid of that shit. Nobody likes that. No, this is a rock tent. A tent made out of rocks. Sounds fucking awesome, right? It's a cave.
Generally a “super car” has a v12. But don’t laugh at that motor until it’s been modified and tuned. F1 cars run 4 cylinder engines and get a ton of HP and it’s possible to build and tune even an inline 6 up to over 1000 horsepower. that has that much HP.
I’m going to reserve judgment until I see some numbers on hp and speed. 0-100. I’m surprised so many people are mocking the small engine. F1 cars can be even small and are hybrid diesel. I’m sure some engineers can modify the shit out of a Corolla engine.
