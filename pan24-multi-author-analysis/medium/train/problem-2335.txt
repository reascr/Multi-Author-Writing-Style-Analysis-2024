I think the unions' demands have been pretty well demarcated here. We know what they want, and it isn't really unreasonable. Congress could also settle this labor dispute by forcing the company to give the unions 100% of what they're asking for. Why isn't that on the table? If anyone proposes that, the Chamber of Commerce would scream bloody murder about the government forcing a business to accept an unwanted contract.
Oh look, union Pacific is a member of the chamber of commerce. I wonder how many other boards the railroad companies are on across the country. It's almost like they run the chamber of commerce or something.

Oh goodie. Congress can fuck it up, rail workers will quit, and we'll be right back where we are now or worse, and they won't have workers to force to work in poor conditions.
