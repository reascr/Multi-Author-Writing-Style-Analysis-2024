In a prior career, I was the head developer for a FAA certified helicopter flight simulator (can log flight hours in it, so highly detailed sim). When we were at Helicopter Association International Expo one year, we were approached by a handful of really excited Chinese business people, I was stoked to speak with them, was a huge language barrier but we got out google translate and had a bunch of laughs trying to get google to muddle through highly technical bits. Eventually it emerged from the chat that they werent involved in a flight school or operator at all, but they really wanted to buy one of our sims. Just one. When I asked them how big their operation was, would they need more than one as they grow? Did they have satellite operations? etc etc... nope, they were carefully trying to not say they wanted just one so they could reverse engineer the whole thing and undercut a product we spent \15 million dollars developing.
Which is funny because they are touting it as some huge achievement towards Russian independence from Europe and the name of the car literally means "Native of Moscow".
