No shit. What did you expect? One of the single worst nations on the planet for human rights abuses, notorious for using the human meat wave approach to warfare doesn’t treat convicts turned soldiers well? I mean, they don’t even care about their ordinary troops decently.
People who defend Russia on social media are fucking scum. Every last one of them without exception. They committed more warcrimes in their first fucking week of occupation than the US did in its entire 20 years in Afghanistan.
They threaten us with nuclear death, every fucking day. They force marginalized citizens to die in Ukraine for some old piece of shits ideas of glory. They've probably lost well over 100k soldiers, and that's just dead. Who knows how many have been critically injured. God only knows how many Ukrainian civilians they've murdered. We'll probably never know. They kidnap children and civilians and send them to fucking concentration camps.
They've leveled whole Ukrainian cities, and bulldoze the dead with the rubble. They deliberately attack civilian targets EVERY DAY for the last nearly a year. They have a literal neo nazi private army that goes around the world murdering people and bragging about it.
They're proud allies with at least three of the most dystopian nightmare nations on the planet. China, Iran and North Korea. They poisoned someone with nerve agents in the UK and just dumped the canister in the trash and laughed about it. Then a UK citizen got ahold of it and died.
