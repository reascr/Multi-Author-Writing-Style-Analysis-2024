The power of analytics , machine learning, and social media. If you need to find neo nazi flat earthers who are okay with your homosexuality, given enough time, google, facebook, etc. will probably connect you with that community. Modern algorithms and deep learning are amazing.
The weirdest part is they all met online. Like how do EIGHT murderous 13-16 old girls from the same city find eachother online and decide to stab some random homeless guy to death?
That's one of the scariest things about the internet to me, the fact that any niche of crazy person can find other people with that hyper-specific psychological fixation and potentially collaborate with them to do real life harm. That's all I think about when I see subs like BanPitBulls and the like.
I would also imagine only 1-2 of the girls are probably actual murderous psychopaths in a vacuum. The others are probably dumb, impressionable, and have enough mental health issues to participate in the act based upon the pressure/guidance of the leader(s) but that's completely speculation without more information.
