Another big question, why are there so many Republican women who are eacher to strip women of their rights?
because the biggest morons in the gender latched onto something to finally make themselves feel intelligent as opposed to worthless insecure undereducated and unappreciated housewives. which is a hilarious irony considering it exposes them as all of the above even more so.
I'm convinced it's this. In fact, I think even a lot of the men don't believe the shit they're peddling. It's all about conforming to the base so they can weasel their way into power and money. Some people have no integrity or morals.
