and you have Dinesh Souza, and he likes me a lot that much I can tell you, so you know he's probably not so bad, and he came out recently with a Documentary, full of Incredibly Strong Evidence against Sleepy Joe and the Democrats, you have mules, many many mules, it says 2,000 but it's probably a lot more, and they're coming in, they're bringing Radical Left Agents to take your Guns and your Houses, because all you get with those people is pain and bankruptcy, believe me. our Farms, our Beautiful Farms, never stronger under Trump, our Farmers were making millions, they had Incredible 401Ks, and now the Democrats have taken it down to probably close to 0. it's a real shame. and I have people all the time they're coming up to me, "Sir, thank you for saving us from Obama, Sir. we need you to save us from Sleepy Joe too," and I say I'll think about it, I'll think about it, who knows, we'll see what happens.
