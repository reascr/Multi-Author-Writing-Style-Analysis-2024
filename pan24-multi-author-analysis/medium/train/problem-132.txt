This confused screeching coming out of moscow for the past week or so really do hit a little different than the usual noises through the whole war.... Or maybe it's just journalists making more creative headlines? Idk what it is but it feels like something is going very wrong in the Russian motherland.....
You raise a good point and thank you for bring it up. To clarify, my comment is in reference to the story of Br’er rabbit that I read as a kid, certainly not the house of mouse movie (had to look that reference up as I hadn’t heard of the movie).
Or, maybe just a subtle hint at what they would like the U.S. to do and where to do it “Oh no, you wouldn’t dare throw me in that briar bush mr. fox, oh that would be so terrible, you must really not like me to do something like throw me in that prickly bush right over there” …. “No, not that bush, that prickly one one over there…”.
I do agree that John Oliver voicing this in his shrill, faux-posh British accent would be hilarious (no offense John Oliver, love your routine, in fact, it’s extra funny because of these qualities).
Splash Mountain is awesome, but I was always perplexed by the decision to make a ride based on a film Disney hadn't shown anyone in years and likely would never show again. I vaguely knew the stories because of some of the kids' books I had, but I didn't know about Song of the South.
