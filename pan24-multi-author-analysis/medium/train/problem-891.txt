According to the Hindu outfit, students who believe in the Sanatan Hindu religion and culture are being forcefully asked to bring Christmas trees and dress up as Santa Claus.
Some people's parents never told them Santa Clause is an elected office. It takes years of campaigning if you want to sit at the big desk at the North Pole.
I see this argument but it makes it a no in my eyes. He is based on Nicolas, he isn't Nicolas. They look different, have a different name, different holidays, one is a middle Eastern man and the other clearly frictional and lives on north pole.
I an European in Europe from an European country that celebrates st Nicolas day and doesn't have Santa for Christmas.
Also St. Nicholas happened on December 6th. Though looks like Santa Claus is essentially taking over everywhere.
Schools often don't realise that it is an intrusion as Santa is not a proper saint of any kind and nor he part of many people's Christmas (is just that most commercial stuff uses him or started to use him only for commercial reasons which makes them money out of Christmas ... Just think of how Santa in red clothes is from Coca Cola adds not from the original looks).
