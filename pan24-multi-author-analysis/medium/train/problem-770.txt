Michigan appears to have “built back blue,” and has a strong list of candidates to offer on the Democratic side. So I think the D’s will keep the seat. The only way to lose will be if a “normie” Republican like Fred Upton slips past the primary (unlikely) and/or the Democrat chosen is a weak candidate or runs a terrible campaign.
That’s the most typical time for a Gov to run. Shows they can get re-elected by their people. I don’t know much about my northern neighbor but she certainly has the chops. I’m interested in how this develops.
I’m not going to sweat Michigan unless it’s obvious we’re in trouble. (Same with Nevada - I mean who do they have to offer on the R side? Laxalt, again?).
