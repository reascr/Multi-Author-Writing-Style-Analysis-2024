On today’s episode of the podcast , Attourney Andrew Torrez predicted a Boebert loss from the remaining (approximate) 1500(ish) votes to be counted in the last remaining voting district still counting votes (which also happens to be a relatively blue district). This won’t be certified until 35 days after Election Day (Tuesday). This is because Boebert will lose by a very small margin that will trigger a mandatory recount by Colorado law, the 35 day mark is the time limit the Colorado Attourney General has to complete the recount and certify the election count.
