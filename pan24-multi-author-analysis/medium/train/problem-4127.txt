You mistake murderer with bravery? Half this guys interview can be summed up like this “I always wanted to be a soldier, I can’t wait to go and fight, but I can’t do it now, obviously, it’s very cold outside right now and I don’t like being chilly.” And no this isn’t me making fun of him, this is literally what he says.
See the real problem here is that serial killers by and large crave the feeling of doing something illegal, the ‘power’ that comes with that. It’s highly unlikely that sanctioned killing would suit this man. he’d likely ditch to either slink into Ukraine and kill on his own OR turn back around and slink into Russia and kill people there.
You're actually 100% wrong on this. War is a great place to kill women. War is usually not like Call of Duty where you're engaging the enemy face-to-face, a huge chunk of the time is sitting around doing nothing, and if you're in a city center you can easily kill civilians with little repercussion. Its happened in every single war since time began.
