Nah I don't quite get what you're driving at but I remember the revolution well and that was central to the 2014 gas crisis. Hunter Biden started working for Burisma in 2014. There's a lotta domestic US BS politics at play with Burisma. Hunter is currently being investigated by the House but that could be domestic US politics too. It's hard to pin things down. Care to share some thoughts as to what you're driving at?
Maybe it's time to bring back the one year of military service for Germans during their GAP year, and this time for women as well. Let's see how the protesters will like that. I don't think it's necessary by any means, but it's worth talking about, and worth reminding the pacifists that their freedoms are guaranteed by NATO soldiers. Diplomacy is not a two-way street with autocrats.
for reference. Naftogaz is Ukrainian state owned and was in a dispute with russian owned gazprom along a long list of post 2014 arbitrations following the Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine and the unfair crimea referendum.
Going after business deals is more in the sanction realm. Putting war criminals in prison requires being in the ICC.
You can't prosecute war criminals until you defeat them. This can not end without one side winning the war with weapons and force. Talking does nothing. Putin and his cronies will not show up in International Court unless they are toppled.
