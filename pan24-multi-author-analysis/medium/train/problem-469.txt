>Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau summoned the Russian ambassador and “demanded immediate detailed explanations.”.
How unreasonable would it be if Poland deployed a sort of “peacekeeping” force with anti air batteries (no offensive weapons, only defensive ones) inside the Ukrainian territory (like in and around Lvov) and essentially force Russia to stop launching missiles in that general direction unless Putin actively wanted to escalate shit further. And if by any chance russia wants wants to keep fucking around and then accidentally hit polish soldiers extend the no fly zone to the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea….
NATO could say "well since apparently no one knows where these mystery Russian missiles are coming from, we'll just have to park a few Patriot batteries on the border and shoot down any fucking missiles we can see. To make sure this doesn't happen again.".
They should just do it anyway. NATO Combat air patrol and air defense all over western ukraine. Putin always wants to play chicken and the tough guy act but bombs civilians, I see no reason why we cant defend said civilians.
I think reasonable would be a combination of that and "Here is a satellite photo of the unit we have ascertained the missile was launched from... and here is a satellite photo of a crater where that unit used to exist...".
