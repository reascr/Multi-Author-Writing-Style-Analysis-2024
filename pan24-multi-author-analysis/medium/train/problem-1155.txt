Based on some Excel magic from NBC's county by county breakdown and % vote remaining, Dems only need \60% of remaining Clark and Washoe counties to win, which seems pretty doable being that the remaining ballots are mail-in which skew Democrat because republicans aren't smart enough to vote by mail.
Masto is actually performing slightly better now without the outstanding ballots than in 2016 (an election year) WITH the ballots. Maybe I’m missing something, but even if the race is close, I don’t see how Masto loses this.
