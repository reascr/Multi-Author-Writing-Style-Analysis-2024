I met an Israeli chef in Thailand recently. He would brag about how Israel is the 51st US state and how they celebrate the 4th of July over there. I'm pretty sure the US sends Israel more money than it does for a lot of US states.
US: He's your billion dollars Israel enjoy, please stop trying to Annex parts of the West Bank, or we'll ask you again, maybe just maybe, we'll send you a strongly worded letter!
But in reality that money is a handout to the MI complex and allows those weapons to get battle tested for free. It also gives the US access to prime intelligence and aids an ally in furthering mutual causes without opening more military bases each year which already cost about $55B annually.
If the terrorists didn’t hide in apartment complexes for the benefit of human shields, and the residents didn’t shelter them, there’d be no need to attack apartments. We both know that hiding behind a non combatant doesn’t give a terrorist carte blanche to commit their crimes and murder civilians. Israel uses roof knockers and makes warning calls to minimize casualties. Get your facts straight.
