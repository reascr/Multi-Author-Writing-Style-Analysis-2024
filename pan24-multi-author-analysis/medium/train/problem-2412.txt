I find it interesting that the article manages to dodge the real elephant in the room (if you’ll excuse the pun): the reason why support for Ukraine is opposed by some in the GOP is because Russia has provided support to the GOP.
This is the first time in years the Republicans have had to be a coalition party. Their party is entirely made up of snakes who will devour one another at a moments notice for a crumb of power. They’re going to absolutely destroy themselves and they’re too stupid and craven to notice, stop it, or care. Super looking forward to seeing it get worse for them lol.
The GOP civil war. MAGA vs Establishment GOP. They are never going to agree on anything. MAGA should just rip the bandaid off and launch a 3rd party. GOP Establishment want nothing to do with them and are trying to marginalize them.
