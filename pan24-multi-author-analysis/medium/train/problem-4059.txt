I'm not defending it because I do think they should be banned from trading individual stocks (index funds I'm fine with and blind trusts should be mandatory), but so it's not like they're doing any of their stock investing in secret, it's quite easy to see what legislation is being debated and is going to come up for a vote, often months to years in advance of it happening. I also think the reason Congress tends to do better in the market then the average "investor" is the average investor isn't as clued into current economic trends, Congress has to be as it's part of their job. So it's not like most congresspeople are doing anything that is nefarious because it's all out in the open, more so than everyone else simply because they have more strict individual reporting requirements (well, not as strict as actual financial institutions).
