No, it's the complete lack of polices, morals, and ethics. That's what lead to Trump in the first place and that's what's leading them to an uncharismatic goober whose every sentence contains a noun, a verb, and the word "woke" as their next savior.

People that are lashing out and upset at being called morons without ever considering the possibility the reason they are treated like morons is because they believe moronic things. Calling people stupid is not helpful because they just double down. Making them understand that they maybe believed stupid things ( which everyone is guilty of) and that they should maybe rethink it are completely different things.
