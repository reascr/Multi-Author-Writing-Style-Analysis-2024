Many people in Germany claimed after the war that they didn't know what was happening to all the jews, yet at the same time Goebbels was able to find enough people to cheer to his "wollt ihr den totalen Krieg" speech and people on the outside (or smarter people on the inside) didn't know how that could be. I think we see that again here... The grim reality is propaganda works. If the only language you understand is Russia (Insert any language here really) and your only Information is government controlled bullshit, you soak it up when you just suck at critical thinking, which unfortunately is a brain function of higher order that develops very late if at all. Many people are simply born to be just part of a herd, follow instructions blindly and don't question anything. Gullibility is as much a human trait as enlightenment, maybe even the default.
There is a cultural affliction in Russia that we just don’t understand, it’s something in the lines of: I don’t give a shit about any one else, and they won’t give a shit about me. They don’t care about some else at all and just want to fly under the radar. It’s a thing that’s been this way for a long time because of the regimes that’s been in place there for so long.
I'm not being very nuanced actually. I really am saying that it is a cultural issue that as far as I can tell goes back hundreds if not thousands of years. Russians see their land and culture as something that must be preserved 100% at all costs. This is not how the universe works. Fuck em, let's change them for them.
