I feel for you. It must be tough living in a Red state. I'm in California so we don't have to deal with the BS that you guys do. You are correct, the descent into fascism our country is taking is frightening. It does not happen over night, it takes time. The fascist Republicans have been pushing this for years. They hate this country. I can't help but think we are on a very bad path from which there is no return. I hope that I am wrong, but I can see us living in a post-Constitution USA in the near future. I am 61, so maybe I will not be alive to see that, but I am really scared about what is happening. I have never really felt that before.
