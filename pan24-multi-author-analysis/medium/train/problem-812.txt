Guess one example is: If someone is going as far as editing porn about you it’s safe to say they might have more of an obsession with you. Some people just use their imagination but effort to take your photos for a deep fake is an effort borders kinda stalker. think of person you are not attracted to or who might scare you if they get obsessive because they’re stronger or more powerful. How’d you feel if they took your photo to make porn. Risk is they may use it to shame or blackmail you if you don’t act how they want you to. Or if their security sucks and it ends up leaking online. It’s common for people to use nudes if their exes to threaten them or get more nudes. Porn is great fun but no one should have to be in one they don’t consent to. Sharing sex and your nudes to someone should be consensual and it’s not as if there’s a porn shortage to create the need to deep fake it. Another example what if you had a child who was victim of this and was upset someone they knew did this and images leaked or were released.
People focus on deepfakes, but doesn't this potentially apply to fashioned photomanips as well? Those have existed since photoshop has been a thing and predate deepfakes by decades.
