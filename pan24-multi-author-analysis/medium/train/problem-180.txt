Basically, Russia has been bribing Transnistria for the past three decades with unlimited "free" natural gas, which props up the breakaway region's economy by using it to generate electricity to sell for cheap to Moldova. So Transnistria gets an export for their failed economy, Moldova gets cheap electricity to help their poor economy, and the citizens of both would kind of just rather keep the status quo. Travel between the two is allowed but it sounds like nobody really cares to since there's nothing on either side for its respective citizens. And Russia's 30,000 troops are more like pensioners who technically have a rifle and would theoretically be ready to go fight but many of them may already be dead from old age, or refuse such orders if they ever come. And then there's the magazine with a Hiroshima worth of explosives sitting around for decades. Nobody really knows its status, if corruption has siphoned off some of its supplies, or how safely stored all the ordnance is. It'd be, well, pretty bad if it just all exploded one day and wiped out the whole of its surrounding towns. But it basically sounds like the citizens of Moldova just need some economic stimulus from the West to become less poor, since they don't love Russia's influence however they do kind of prefer the status quo over a war or Russia cutting off its "free" gas (which they keep delivering, but tallying up a multi-billion-dollar bill as theoretical debt). That's my summary, but please read the article for a better overview than what I can provide from my memory having read it a couple months ago.
You kill one or a dozen, you are a murder,, kill a thousand and you are hero.. in Putinâ€™s case, take that piece of crap out,, and you are hero.,, it is the exception to the rule.
I'd be mighty Vlad if someone were to... impale him. On a large wooden spike. All the way through. Put out on display.
Murder is bad... But sometimes justified. He will one day see Lady Justice, and she will not be merciful.
