I strongly suspect the GOP and its non-Trump presidential candidate will offer a federal pardon in exchange for him actively pushing his base behind their candidate (presumably DeSantis). It's not an offer he will be in a position to refuse, particularly if/when he's indicted. Either way, at their first opportunity they will absolutely pardon him for federal crimes as they have gone all in on the "we're being persecuted" narrative.
