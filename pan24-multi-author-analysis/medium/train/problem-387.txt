Ukraine will need hundreds of thousands of troops to match Russia's recent build-up. As winter cold sets in putin has the most/highest leverage by providing heat (gas/oil) to neighboring countries in exchange for loyalty and troops to add to his multi-country force. The Balkans, some -istan countries, (and maybe Hungary) are signing with putin for gas now, together with Iranian, Chechnyan, Belarus and N.Korean troops. Ukraine could be easily overwhelmed by a huge winter assault soon. Unfortunately, while Russia is building a huge multi-hundred thousand force, Ukraine can't because NATO and the EU won't add fighters. In the end Ukraine will be overrun and Europe will have a closer, stronger Russia. BTW, watch the Black Sea for an increased attack force to go into Ukraine through Moldova and Navy missiles. putin won't squander this unique leveraged opportunity. Kick putin.
