The convoy was a ginormous failed risk to reinforce the taking of the airport early on by the Russian Air borne. Failure to connect and resupply meant the initial seizure of the airport was a failure. Airborne assaults are meant in general to have a couple days of hard fighting but without resupply they'll fail. Successful airborne mission always have a method of resupply and reinforcement as part of the plan. It was an audacious plan that had it worked could have significantly changed the war. Forcing the experienced eleite Russian unit to retreat with significant losses was pretty telling how this war would ultimately be fought. If expeditionary forces don't work, then of Russia wants to succeed they'd have to declared full war and actually fully mobilize. Putin shot himself in the foot by not escalating to full war early on.
I think I read it in "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" by Paul Kennedy. Not sure if it was his original quote or he got it from someone else and I forgot the attribution.
