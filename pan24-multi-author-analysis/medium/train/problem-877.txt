Inreality, you need a very strong mandate, across the multiple different power centers, to all be willing to let it happen. The fact that his own cabinet started resigning en mass, just shows that he really didn't have his pieces in play to pull something off like this. Before going this bold, you must have EVERYONE in order. You need the generals willing to uphold the illegal orders using the military, the judges to rubber stamp everything, the bureaucrats willing to keep moving the gears, and swift removal of all significant political opposition (with very public showings of what happens to dissent).
You mostly need enough guys with guns that are willing to enforce your will. Obviously controlling other pillars of power helps by reducing the number of people you need to intimidate with force of arms, but at the end of the day that is the one mandatory bit.
What happened to the good ol' days where a man could disappear millions of his own citizens and their descendants continue to worship you decades later?
