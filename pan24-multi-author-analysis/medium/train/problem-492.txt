you will be surprized to know how many jewish people came from russia to israel only to have their Judaism (the reason they chose israel over any other place) be revoked from them by a council of old rabbis who think they can claim who is jewish and who isn't jewish enough.
don't forget the L.G.B.T.Q+, immigrants, Ethiopians and Russians (their Judaism is questioned by the religious hierarchy). there will be more victims to this government beside just Palestinians.
I say it again - this is to be expected a lot more now. Because this ultra far right govt will fuck shit up now and stir things up. Hardliners will now be emboldened more than ever. The Two state solution discussion is now dead for good and things will be bad for next few years for the region, esp. for Palestinians. These incidents are just a start.
The two state solution has been dead for well over a decade now. The Palestinian side does not want to co-exist with a Jewish State next to it and has refused multiple peace offerings that could lead to one.
