This one will not be different I am afraid: more and more refugees to both Europe and Russia. Right now the borders are closed for adult men, but will eventually reopen, and they will go earn money there and rejoin families. Itâ€™s the ones that stay who will have very hard years ahead, if not decades.
These 8 million refugees will, most likely, not go back. And investments into rebuilding will be literal cabal contracts with draconian conditions (because the higher the risk, the more money will the investor demand back).
The US financed the rebuilding of vastly more deteriorated economies of Japan & Europe at a loss to protect the integrity of democratic institutions against Communism and its totalitarian regimes.
BlackRock can act as a bridge financier to immediately deploy capital to help Ukraine while the slower decision making process of governments goes through its motions.
BlackRock is an to the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine. They will advise on where, and which investments are most useful to the Ukrainian economy.
