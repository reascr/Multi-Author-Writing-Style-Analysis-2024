That's what really pisses me off. I saw a Tweet with like 250k retweets from some Qatari prince about how they shouldn't be forced to uphold western ideals. You fucking said you would allow everyone, allow for beer sales, etc. and then pulled the rug out last minute. Lying is fucking okay to get what you want and westerners should just put up with it? You never should have gotten the WC to begin with, but the only reaso you did was lies and money. Real moralistic.
Exactly. All these people telling athletes and others to take a stand are sitting in the comfort of their presumably western homes and don't have to worry about disappearing in a Qatar prison.
Nobody expects the Qatari inquisition. Our chief weapon is alcohol bans. Alcohols bans and no pride signs. Our two weapons are alcohol bans, no pride signs and no Jews. Oh damn. Amongst our weaponry are such elements... I'll come in again.
The weird thing is FIFA accepting it. They're not known for being lenient when somebody other then them decides to change the rules. Normally this would lead to all kinds of legal and disciplinary action by FIFA.
