Yea, I'm breaking it down. I'm on the level of grammar and semantics. I don't care if you find it pedantic and useless. I'm a writer so I pay attention to these things. If I start writing shitty sentences, it will result in shitty paragraphs. Which will result in shitty pages. Which will result in shitty chapters. Which will result in shitty work. Got it?
"For want of a battle the kingdom was lost." doesn't really make sense, though, does it? When you break it down...
There’s this thing called a “failure cascade” where an event (a small failure, or a major battle defeat) bleeds into one thing, into another, into another, and the whole effort can unravel SHOCKINGLY quick. Like an engine with a small problem, and suddenly it’s dead.
The funny part is that Volodymyr is just a weirder transliteration, it's still rooted in the exact same name, so really we have two Vlads fighting each other. One's the idiot and one's the hero.
I am not sure when it ends (I think before Summer), but you will be surprised how quickly it all comes down.
