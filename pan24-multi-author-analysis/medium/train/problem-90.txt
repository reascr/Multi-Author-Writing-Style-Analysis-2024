Well, this guy did care about his body since the article said that he tried to get the earbud out multiple times over the course of five years before finally going to the doctor because he was "at his wit's end".
Really just serves as a reminder that when you feel that something is definitely wrong over a period of days, weeks, months, then you should see a doctor ASAP. No, it won't make you look weak, you won't bother anyone by doing this, and it's all for your benefit.
Sometimes you don't realize what's wrong until someone points it out. Using ears as an example, I've needed to get my ears flushed out before, because through the regular use of earbuds and having a fear of sticking stuff in my ear to clean them (plus at the time I didn't know better), I managed to get massive balls of ear wax piled into my ear to the point where it couldn't fall out naturally. I wasn't noticing any difficulties in hearing, and in fact my hearing was quite good. I also didn't feel anything wrong. But the difference it made when the doctor finally flushed my ears, and being able to hear very nuanced differences in quiet sounds, was amazing.
