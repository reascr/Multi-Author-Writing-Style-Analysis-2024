Putin might be seeking leverage for a diplomatic solution, such as restoring Crimea to Russia and promising that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO. But it's hard to imagine Putin and hardliners in Russia accepting such a compromise even if it was offered. It seems more likely to me that Putin is just stalling for time, and has no idea how to win this war or get out of it with his power intact at home. He is well and truly stuck.
Winter is going to be tough for the Ukrainian soldiers, but even tougher for the Russian invaders. Kyiv has received far better winter clothing and equipment from NATO militaries. But it's not just the cold, it's also the dark. Night vision goggles and thermal imagers have been at the top of the list of equipment requested by Ukraine from the West. Fighting won't stop, and the Ukrainians are advancing.
Putin's strategy seems to be to inflict as much pain as possible on Ukrainian civilians by attacking infrastructure. This not only harms civilians but also factories and businesses. Kiev might have to be evacuated, and Ukraine will have to be continually supplied with air defense systems. But these attacks on non-military targets don't actually lead to Russian military gains.
It's as ineffective as the strategy Hitler pushed for in WW2: if you aren't going to destroy a countries' ability to defend itself, destroying houses, shops, and infrastructure just makes the population more angry and the armed forces more willing to fight on.
Like Hitler, Putin is trapped by needing to punish civilians for morale purposes at the cost of real military objectives that aren't as flashy.
