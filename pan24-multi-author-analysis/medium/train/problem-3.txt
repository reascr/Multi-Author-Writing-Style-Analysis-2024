I've never seen the supposed Elon-Simps in the wild so this a first for me. To be fair though the article you linked gives credit for the accuracy to GIS Arta - which yes Starlink is currently providing the internet that lets it work- but its a bit disingenuous to claim that it's all because of Starlink. In addition the other dude has made a bunch of points about Elon's other very serious detriments to the Ukrainian cause and I would say its probably a wash right now? Maybe a bit less?
And don’t even think of trusting the Danish. They are too happy and relaxed. Definitely hiding something as well.
Everyone knows you can trust Norwegian princes. Except the Swedish princes, the Swedes seem to be a bit shady….
On a lighter note, some technical screw-up meant that Norwegian government accounts were showing up as Nigerian-affiliated accounts, leading to both sides having a bit of a laugh.
Seeing as how essential Twitter has been in communicating Russian-perpetrated atrocities to the wider world, this is plainly unacceptable.
