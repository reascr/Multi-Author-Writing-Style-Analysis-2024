I wasn't born then so I can only comment on info I can find about it and seems like a small niche community of climate scientists back then used the technology they had at the time to come up with a hypothesis of weather trends. As with any good hypothesis there were other scientists with counter hypotheses that it was getting warmer and not colder. As more evidence and real time information was added to the collection the ice age hypothesis didn't hold up compared to global warming. Today we have even more evidence and advanced technology that lends to it. As for whether this is just natural weather actions we haven't experienced yet due to the brief period of weather records we have that doesn't seem to be the case. We can look at tree rings and see the different periods/amounts of rainfall in the tree's lifespan. We can take arctic core samples that go back 800,000 years. Everything points to humans affecting climate in a serious way.
Itâ€™s weird how concentrated efforts by all the worlds governments might actually affect the climate.
