Thanks for the link. It's not a question of liking Newsweek though. Many non US people around the world remember Newsweek as a reputable magazine and still take the name at face value without realizing what it become in terms of click-bait. I'd guess over 75% of what it publishes is rubbish or lifted from non verified sources. Some of course will be true and newsworthy but as a primary news source its of little use.
There was a documentary from this wildlife reserve the centered around their troublesome honey badger.
When the little guy recovered he broke into the lion area again and didn't just pick a fight, he bit the male lion's ball sack.
I know two isn't a lot but I'm hopeful for a third to commiserate his fall out of a window, and it'll be the biggest womp in history.
I’m loving it; it seems like there’s almost daily a counter-offensive lately, and I hope it’s making the formerly comfortable Russian forces scramble and detract from their invasion.
The source is Newsweek...for half a century, Newsweek was owned by the Washinon Post and was a well-respected voice in American journalism. In 2010, the Post sold Newsweek to 91-year-old businessman Sidney Harman. Ownership turned over a few more times, a shell of its former self. All that was left was clickbait, op-eds from the likes of Nigel Farage and Newt Gingrich, and a general sense of drift, basically “a zombie magazine.” Sad.
