Is it normal to have a member of a grand jury speaking publicly like this, especially before any indictments are announced?
I'm not insinuating there's something suspicious or wrong happening like some paranoid right wing conspiracy theorist. I'm not a legal experts at all and I'm legitimately curious about about why she is allowed to give interviews to the press, at this point.
Serving on a jury is supposed to be a solemn duty. A 10-second clip of her laughing and joking about it will fuel doubts about the legitimacy and seriousness of the entire process.
It is very damaging. There is nothing about this that is helpful to the prosecution. It can only make getting a conviction more difficult.
It’s a grand jury and not a trial jury. If they bring an indictment then the trial will be about the facts of the case. Can’t really argue that the grand jury was problematic. Have to argue that the facts of the case are the issue.
