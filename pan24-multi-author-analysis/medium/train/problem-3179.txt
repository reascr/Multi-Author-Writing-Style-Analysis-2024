To me is seems like Supreme Court is testing their powers which seem to be limitless if they choose that they are limitless. And only limit on their power is that they have no enforcement power, but I am not aware of, in general, of executive branch not enforcing Supreme Court decisions. There instances like when police (executive branch) violating Supreme Court's decision that recording in public places is constitutional. But there is no mayor, governor, or president that directly directs LEO to arrest those that recording police in public.
