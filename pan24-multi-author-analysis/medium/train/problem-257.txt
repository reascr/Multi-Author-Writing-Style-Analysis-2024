Okay, you got ahead of me there. Agree, Faux has to be punished, the voting machine suit will be a start. The old entertainment thing isn't going to work this time ,"my prediction". There is another suit filling, the company that has the vote tabulators "insert name". There is also a SCOTUS opinion due that I think is going to go against the sect 230, that Facebook is counting on to save it's gonads. Fascists can not have accountability that doesn't include consequences. All told I think this ship is about to find some rocks. I might be optimistic, but, I am.
