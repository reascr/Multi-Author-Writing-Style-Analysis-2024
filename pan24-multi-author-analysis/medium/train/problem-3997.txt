With your logic, if every seat flipped, democrats would add 38 seats (19x2) to their majority… and they currently have 22, which would be 59 seats, but there’s only 40. It would be correct to say they increased their majority by 19 and now have a majority of 40.

It matters because votes are passed on plurality and not absolute majority. So flipping 1 seat gives you a 2 vote buffer, meaning you can still pass legislation even if people are absent or vote present.
