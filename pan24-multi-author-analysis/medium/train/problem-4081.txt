it's time to start thinking about gearing up for long term defense, and transforming ukraine into a military citadel. Keep building up your defenses so that no plane can fly over your territory, and no armored vehicles can enter your border. Maybe set up a permanent defense contract. NATO can contribute some of its annual defense on maintaining a permanent defense structure in ukraine. Redirect some of NATO's annual defense spending to maintaining defense forces in ukraine.
After the tiny man loses, Iâ€™m sure Ukraine is going to sign some documents allowing US military bases into the country both for defense purposes and for training purposes.
Ok. but it has to be unanimous for the countries to be able to work together cohesively. If you have countries that don't want another country, it could lead to all kinds of adversarial issues. And, that cannot happen within NATO, ever.
They have submitted. 28 out of 30 nations have voted to enlarge their membership to include them. It appears 2 countries stand in the way. Here are the details.
Definitely more battle hardened than the American, just less well equipped and networked. The last time the US fought a peer threat was WWII. Experience in counterinsurgency simply doesn't translate. Two armies in the world have now fought a land war in Europe in the lifetime of their leadership, and nobody else will ever match that experience, I hope.
