If I wanted 'good' medical care, I could tack on another $300 a month for a concierge practice which would mean I could get same day appointments and priority treatment in an ER. That means I'll be paying $10,000 per year for medical care and 100% of the drug bill as I don't have Part D - which is a ripoff - or $6,500 a year for mediocre medical care.
But think of the profits, the sneering at the suffering as they get their jollies off of hurting people for their pockets We must roll over and bow to our egomaniacal overlords and let them sodomize society.
