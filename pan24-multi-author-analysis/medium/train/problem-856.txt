I can‘t say for certain how they will see it but I can tell you if it doesn’t work for them they will come up with various reasons why it isn’t true. If it were just Fox it would be one thing because the base no longer likes FOX but Tucker is the only one left they like to watch. It really just comes down to how much they like Tucker. I would say since they hate FOX but still like Tucker they like him a lot.
Ooh, the base wouldn’t take too kindly to this. I’m sure they can come up with a conspiracy theory that would explain away Tuckers remarks.

The only thing the base watches on Fox any more is Tucker, otherwise they consider Fox just too liberal for them.
