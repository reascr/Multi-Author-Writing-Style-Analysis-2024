You can believe in the utility of capitalism harnessing the greed of human nature while also believing that there's a moral imperative to make people play fair within the system.
I'm not a socialist, but 1% of the people in America owning 30% of the wealth, or whatever the latest number is, is ridiculous and fucks over the 99%. What rich people, sorry, I mean job creators, don't understand is that if there's no middle class, nobody can buy your stuff. Greed is evil.
Edit: I was wrong, sources do not support that claim, see . That said, it's still outrageously high.
For real. Hell, there's not even anything about being a capitalist that inherently means you have to be against regulation. It is in fact axiomatic to capitalism that actors will be rewarded for doing underhanded and nasty things unless external non-economic forces stop them.
I believe the paradigm of socialism, or one of them, is wealth distribution. Saying I'm not a socialist reinforces to me, that the the wealthy are pushing this kind of government tilt and even non-socialists agree it is warranted.
