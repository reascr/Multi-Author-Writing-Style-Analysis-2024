I guess next is: Trump targets Republican Party for not nominating him, calls them all RINOs and enemies of the people, forms new party with MTG, Matt Gaetz, Mike Flynn, and Pillow Guy.
My scenario is that the GOP decides that they'll go all in on pushing Trump for jail on the New York finance charges. If Trump goes to jail that will satisfy the Left, and let the rest of the insurrectionists off the hook.
