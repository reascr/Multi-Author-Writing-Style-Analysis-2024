Late, but it makes them more likely to interact with cougars by reducing fear. It also reduces fear of cats in mice and rats and makes [some kind of monkey or ape, I’m too lazy to look it up again] less fearful of leopards. The parasite’s “goal” is to have the current infected species get eaten by a feline, which is the only host it can reproduce in.
tl;dr Yellowstone wolves have been getting toxoplasmosis as a result of eating the feces of infected mountain lions. This makes them more predisposed towards risky behaviour like leaving their home pack and fighting other wolves for dominance. This makes them more likely to become pack leaders but also more likely to sustain fatal injuries or lead their pack into dangerous situations.

They also use pig toilets in India, even in drug infested goa. Poor pigs go through withdrawals when a heavy user leaves.
