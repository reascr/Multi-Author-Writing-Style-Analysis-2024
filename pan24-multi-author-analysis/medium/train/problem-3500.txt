Russia is Trying to use the fact Ukraine doesn't want to strike sovereign Russian soil (they do but it may escalated the conflict).
But Ukraine isn't going to honor the land grab of it's own soil. It's idiotic to " NO this our land now. You can't have. It's Russia now and you can't attack us directly. yep yep yep. That's how it works".
Nah, itâ€™s more simple than that. They can arrest Ukrainian civilians living in those areas and charge them in Russian courts.
Either Putin dies soon or it's going to escalated. I see us giving Ukraine some of our Abrams and they are gonna slaughter Russia's troops and armor QUICK. Putin panics and uses chemical weapons.the politburo in Moscow panics and kills him and hope like hell NATO doesn't respond.
It's gut wrenching to think that despite how horrifyingly wrong and unjust the American justice system is, there's even worse bullshit ruining lives in even worse ways out there.
Everything you are talking about is 100% dependend on context that you don't choose when you are born, not willingness.
I'd like to see you will your rights into existence in any country where you would get killed by police without anyone even knowing it.
I can see why a majority of people just give up on making the world a better place. I mean I'll still cling to it til my last breath but then I'm the idiot sort.
For now. I get the idea that the Republicans are trying to chance that tho. They have established a clear pattern of trying to punish anyone who doesn't stick to their approved narrative. And they're pushing it hard into everything they can. Now they're pushing to control social media too.
It just doesn't feel like we're moving in a good direction here. We didn't even get to where things were good and were already rubber banding in the other direction.
