Or anywhere else that is totalitarian, fascist, or experiencing war or major civil unrest. There is very little your home country can do for you if wind up in prison somewhere thousands of miles away. And if you chose to go to someplace like that, if your own volition? Just…c’mon.
As an Iranian-American, I think it's easier said than done for a lot of people. I went back a few years ago for a family emergency. I know a lot of people, family and friends, who have gone back and forth with no problem.
Yes, there's always the chance that just by being a dual citizen you can get in a lot of trouble - but people weigh those risks when it's down to big events that have to do with their families. It's not so cut and dry as "never go back to your homeland ever again" for a lot of people.
Also, I agree with this detainee that the US should do more. After decades of sanctions to tell us we need to revolt against our government and force regime change, time and time again when there are movements... our people haven't really gotten support from western governments. Now we're talking about 4 months of sustained civil unrest against the IRI... and there's still so many high level members of sepah/IRGC and the government that western countries are sanctioning.
It blows my mind, why are there still so many high level people that should have been sanctioned such a long time ago when so many sanctions have hurt ordinary people for decades?
The IRI is always going to claim that any unrest is the US/Israel's fault... so now that Iranians have spent 4 months doing what the west has asked them to do in the face of sanctions... maybe the US can do something more than a slow rollout of targeted sanctions and saying "well there's no way we can return to the JCPOA any time soon.".
