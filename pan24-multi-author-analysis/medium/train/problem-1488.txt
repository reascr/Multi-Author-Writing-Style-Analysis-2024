What kept Biden from making garland doj secretary, getting Jackson to appeals court, taking stock of the fact that garland did not do enough to get back sensitive documents, firing him, and appointing someone who would focus on doing the job rather than looking good? Ffs, when the seditious orange is busy selling state secrets, it is not partisan activity to raid all his properties to secure all documents he stole. Not doing that bare minimum to avoid criticism is a political activity. Same goes with not prosecuting him for literally inciting and orchestrating the insurrection. Two years is a very very long time when dealing with insurrectionists. Wait and watch as garland does nothing, "because arresting presidential candidates is a partisan activity". No, it fucking isn't, when the said candidate happens to have literally tried to install himself as dictator after losing elections.
Less hilariously, none of the scumfuck conservatives involved in this went to jail or have been given any real reason not to try the same tricks in the next election.
