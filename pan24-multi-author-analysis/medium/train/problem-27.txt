Hopes are not reality. It would be nice if Russia lost a war soon. But the reality is Russia can sustain this war for a very very long time, Ukraine cannot. They're not about to lose anything other than their position in the world.
For the most part, 99% of the countries of the world don't need modern equipment unless they're intending to go into a war with their neighbors. They only have to have the same level of military as their neighbors to maintain peace. If one neighboring country got more advanced weapons it'd become an arms race. It's why Pakistan and India both got nuclear weapons around the same time. Pakistan sources most of its equipment from Russia and China. India manufactures most of its equipment with permission from the country that developed it.
India would certainly like to get closer to the West and buy their weapons. But any random senator or congressman can introduce a bill in the future that can cut the defence ties anytime. As long that sword hangs over the relationship it is difficult to move in that direction.
