Yes, we just got fucked by those nazis wich committed 2 genocides that we know of, fucked brazilian economy (half of the population don't know if they're getting to eat anything the next day), we suffered a coup (which the US was part of), we had one of the most conturbed elections in our history; Even though Bolsonaro lost fascism grew a lot in senate and in congress; the fascists invaded the the congress, Supreme Court and the president's office (that one happened this month).
That’s a suckers response for defending a partner nation who has invaded its neighbor to steal its lands while it indiscriminately murders, terrorizes and tortures the civilian populace. This ‘war’ is a direct result of Putins imperialistic desires, there’s no diplomatic resolve with a tyrant. Putin was coming for Ukraine regardless of what they did or said. His entire pretext for war was right out of Hitlers playbook with Poland.
Brazil is a BRICS member. They're not going to oppose Russia militarily. This shouldn't shock anyone. Good on Germany to get their opinion out into the open though.
