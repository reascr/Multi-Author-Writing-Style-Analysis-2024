If that's your take away then I don't know what else to tell you. Nowhere did I say "fuck" anybody, particularly DV victims. I just pointed out that false allegations of DV and charges brought, happen a lot more often than people think. And when they are brought up, most people act as judge, jury and executioner before even hearing a person out. There are even lawyers who specialize in "what to do if you've been falsely accused of DV.". If you don't believe, google the subject yourself then ask yourself if we should have blanket laws like the one shut down in this article. If you've been charged and found guilty or admit guilt - sure no more booms booms for you. But the fact is women, like men are not saints and some, like men, will use the grossest tactics to exact revenge. I've experienced first hand.
