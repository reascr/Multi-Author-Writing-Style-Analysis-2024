Something to remember the actual unit price for F-35 is estimated at around $60 Million US per plane down from an estimated $200 million at the start of it's production cycle. These contracts include significantly more than just the planes, and may include spare parts, maintenance support, training, munitions, special considerations, etc.
It's cheap enough that SAAB who sells a a less capable but much cheaper 4th Gen aircraft can no longer market solely on cost savings anymore because the F-35's price is now low enough to be in the same ballpark while being more capable.
It's worse than that for SAAB, the Gripen now costs anywhere from $7-15 Million Euros more than the F35. Despite being an older and more simple aircraft.
what's ironic is the gripen is a masterclass of efficient development, that saab was able to design such a good plane for so little money is super impressive. meanwhile the f-35 was an absolute boondoggle of a program with cost overruns in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
despite all that, the f-35 is now the cheapest option in unit price, despite it being way more capable than any contenders including the gripen. it's like a tesla Y dropping in price to being cheaper than a corrolla. it's just hard to justify buying the latter unless you have some sort of stance against buying tesla.
