It resulted in increased counter-espionage investments, restrictions on donations to political parties by foreign donors, the routing of organisations in Australia that were fronts for Chinese espionage and influence operations, and a foreign policy that focused on countering Chinese influence in the Pacific region and developing even closer economic and security ties with the US.
I anticipate that there will be some reprecussions for China for its influence operations in Canada as well.
There were the usual suspects that actively encouraged it like Fox News anchors, Trump, Ted Cruz, Candace Owens etc. But no evidence so to speak at the moment of donations so far.
There were many Americans that donated to GiveSendGo (the second one) fundraiser pertaining the freedom convoy. There was around 37 percent of value of donations stemming from the states with more than 50 percent of donors stemming from the US. Canadians donated 60 percent of the value from about 42 percent percent in the amount of donors. However, it should be noted that there is a possibility for a margin of error accounting for Canadians living abroad.
For the first GoFundMe fundraiser, 88 percent of the $10m came from Canadians with the other 12 percent deriving from other countries.
