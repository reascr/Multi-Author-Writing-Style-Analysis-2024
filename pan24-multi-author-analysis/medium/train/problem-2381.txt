Because he is a great great businessman, one of the best, probably the best, a lot of his friends have told him that he is the best businessman they have ever met and also that he is one of the all round best persons they have ever met. It is well known that he is a very good and intelligent man, one of the most intelligent men out there, a lot of people would say he is in fact a genius, not even a regular genius but one of the geniuses at the top of the genius game. Trump would never say that out loud as he is very humble, one of the most humble people out there, a lot of people knowledgeable in that area would tell you he is one of the most humble persons they ever had met.
They only know what they hear from their "news" sources and their news sources do not tell them that Trump's policies harm them. The "do your research" crowd has never actually researched a single thing. Mostly because they don't know how.
It's not about that. These people can't meaningfully connect policy to positive change. They just can't.
They get off on stunts and symbols. "Wins". A vague sense that someone is punching your enemies for you. They're motivated by owning libs, literally nothing else factors in.
