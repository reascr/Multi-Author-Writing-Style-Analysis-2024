What?? Haha the man who said he graduated summa cum laude when he never graduated, that he worked with the FBI when he didn't, that he worked with the cops when he didn't, that he graduated with honors in high school when he didn't, that he was CEO of a company with hundreds more employees when it had just like 2 dozen, he sold garbage like "proven COVID treatments" that were snake oil, defrauded the VA, and either committed tax fraud or election fraud (pick one depending whether he truly lived in GA or TX; he chose tax fraud because it was the lesser punishment.
So this man has lied to friends, fans, family, voters, customers, and the government about the most trivial things years before he was a candidate. He's the epitome of "pathological".
I don’t know if Herschel Walker was a pathological liar…I think he was just so stupid he would attempt to parrot back whatever script he was given that day and still mess it up. It was obvious the guy knew nothing about what he was talking about most of the time. Honestly if the views he was espousing weren’t so disgusting I would almost feel bad for the dude. Limited education and blows to head have definitely taken their toll.
