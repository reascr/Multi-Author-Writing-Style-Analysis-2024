Oh sorry, I misunderstood. Yes it is usually the case that there’s a Garda presence outside embassies and former presidents and Taoisigh but I think they had ramped up the security on the Russian embassy after the truck thing in case there was an international incident.
(It’s a political declaration signed by 80 nations -including 23 NATO countries - in Dublin today condemning the use of explosive ordinance in areas where civilians may be present.
On the other hand you could be driving same person around, feel the considerable wallop of the ordinance plummeting through your vehicle and then turn around and see your passenger is now cut cleanly in half.
On one hand, you’re taking a drive and the passenger of your car is targeted by a missile. You’re driving, driving, driving, and then suddenly cease to be anymore.
So I guess this flying sword weapon is a benefit to the innocent people who might surround a target. But at the same time, what those people will end up seeing are worse than any nightmare I can imagine.
