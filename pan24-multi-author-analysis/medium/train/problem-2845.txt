Not quite but kind of. As the laws are written these berry pickers aren't picking on private land but public land, these are "forest berries." The companies sell the berry pickers services (accommodations, transportation, food, etc.) and the berry pickers sell them berries. As the law is written the berry pickers can choose whoever they want to sell to. But obviously it's easier to sell to the people you own debt to because then they can resolve your accounts faster. It also means these companies are more likely to invite you back next year to berry pick again using their accommodations.
I used to care about buying local,now I don't care at all. Why? Because I've learned that almost all business owners around me are scumbags like everyone else. I learned most of the farms near me hire immigrants so that they can pay the bare minimum while getting the most work out of them legally possible. Now I just buy the produce/ food that has the least amount of plastic packaging, whether it's local or not.
