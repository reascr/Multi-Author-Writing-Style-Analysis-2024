Everything I said is still true, and the article is operating on the assumption that the most positive decisions will be guaranteed to be made and therefore we should stop worrying. When has humanity ever collectively made the best decisions on a global level? I’m not saying it’s impossible, but it sounds like a hell of a lot of coping in that article without any actual data backing it up, just “trust us, we’ll solve it. Don’t worry”, giving people an excuse to just not make any lifestyle changes because “all those smart scientists will solve all our problems for us. We’ll be fine....”.
Unfortunately we're too dumb as a species to adapt to global issues. There will be war, mass migrations and starvations, genocides, and the worst of us will thrive.
Praise allah, god bless america, god save the king, jesus loves you, heil [insert dictator], and so on.
I don't get why people make soapboxy speeches like this. Are you hoping to accomplish something? Or just, like, wanting to express yourself and move on?
