EU citizen here. I am very positively surprised how well we coped with the abrupt end of ruzzian gas deliveries. We are now accelerating the transition to renewables and have organized LNG deliveries for the transitioning period.
After they realized Europe cannot be blackmailed into ending support for Ukraine, and that Europe transitioned to other sources of energy with unexpected success, russian deputy prime minister alexander novak generously offered to resume gas deliveries to Europe via the Yamal pipeline.
I'm not in EU so it is up to them but who will take up Russia's "offer" when it weaponized energy to blackmail?
Once you lose the trust it will be a while if any countries Russia tried to harm will even consider restarting energy import again.
Our gas reservoirs are like 90% full, and we have actually increased the levels over the last week. It's very warm here.
And we have just opened our 1st LNG ship terminal. 2 more will follow. We were 100% invested in ruzzian gas (Nord Stream etc), but we have managed to plan, build and take into operation the gas terminal in 9 months!
Totally unheard of for a country that opened the airport of their capital 10 years later than planned...
