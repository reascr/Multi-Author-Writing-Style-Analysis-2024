Wives threatening to storm into the battlefield to rescue their husbands? I might be wrong, but I thought the entire psyche of a Russian soldier was to be super masculine and tough.
Imagine Ivan walking into a bar after this is all over. Another person recognizes him and yells, "Did wife give you purse to fight with when she pull you from battlefield?".
No no no, Comrade. Simple mistranslation. Wife not rescue FROM battlefield. Brave, courageous, wife come to battlefield to give heavy purse to smack nazis with. You see? Small but big difference. Will hold us over until we get ammo. And guns. And food...and warm clothes....
It's embarrassing that puff pieces like this upvoted. Ukraine needs weapons and other support. Not idiots counting on, let's see, "more than a dozen Russian wives.
What Russians need to do is unleash all their world boss Babushkas with purse on Putin. No window, stairs, or poison would stop them.
I don't think they will. "More than a dozen wives of mobilized Russian soldiers", so like 12-17 tops. 18 would have been nearly twenty. And even 20 is not a rounding error. The Russians have already lost 100k of their best troops. 300k more are coming. All much less trained and capable. Basically volunteering or drafted to be cannons fodder and immediately die.
