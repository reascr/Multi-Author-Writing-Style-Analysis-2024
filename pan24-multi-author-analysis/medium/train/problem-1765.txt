Governing the country, protecting human rights, helping people get jobs and healthcare. None of it's important to them. They only care about beating the other guy and have no plan once they take over. The party of nothing. Disband already.

I think they just have a different definition of ‘function’. To them, that means enriching themselves and their rich buddies. They have done quite well there.
They always do the same shit when they are in power. Cut taxes for the rich and powerful and boost spending on the military. All the other stuff is just rhetoric. They will also talk in circles about wedge issues. They will again talk about repealing Obamacare or cutting social security, but they would’ve actually do it if they could. Now that they overturned Roe, they will talk about banning medication abortions and birth control next. They might stop talking about that when they realize it won’t make them more popular with voters.
You can find videos on YouTube of mcconnell saying his proudest moment was the lame duck scotus block under Obama, and I've always been struck by the fact that his proudest moment is causing a year of senate lock with the goal of getting nothing done, rather than anything he had actually accomplished for his party or anyone.
