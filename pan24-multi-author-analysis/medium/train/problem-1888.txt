I'm surprised a actual Qatari was driving the taxi , they only make up %14 percent of thr population and since by law for foreign businesses to operate in qatar you have to hire a local there are a bunch of " just sit here and look good " positions open in companies.
No one said anything about a Qatari taxi driver. Driver just said he felt kinship with the Palestinians and don't feel like driving around Israelis and accepting their money. Could be easily an Indian Muslim.
That's how its like in most Arab states, even the ones that have made peace with Israel. While the governments may cooperate with Israel, the population absolutely despises them and if any of the states were actually democratic, peace projects like the Abraham Accords would never be accepted. Something like 90% of Egyptians want to cut all diplomatic relations with Israel, and they've had a peace agreement for decades now.
The Russians want to eradicate this smaller Ukraine, but it manages to hold on. The smaller nearer Russia gets conquered after it failed to invade, and so it sends suicide bombers to the smaller Ukraine every five years or so, in waves.
That's basically Israel, extremely simplified, and most likely a wrong analogy, but you get the jist.
Europe doesn't get that if Israel gives up this fight, it's done for. Kaput. Surrounded by religious enemies on all fronts, the only reason Israel can exist, the most recent crusade exists, is because of a country the didn't exist during the crusade. The US of A.
That quote isn't the greatest in my opinion, since the hatred is on both sides now. Israel just elected its most right wing government with actual extremists in it for the first time. I think one of the parties leaders called for the expulsion of Arabs from government at one point. I don't imagine that helps the process any bit.
