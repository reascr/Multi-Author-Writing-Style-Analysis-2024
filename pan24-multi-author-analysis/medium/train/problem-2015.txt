I mean I hate to see the Russians and Ukrainians die. That’s absolute bullshit over Putin wanting the oil off Crimea and a legacy. He can f right off. But I wouldn’t mind seeing all his toy solders removed from play.
On another note, does it make it back to port under its own steam, or does it get towed back? Or perhaps does it do the whole Transformers thing and morph from a surface ship into another Russian submarine?
What's the over/under for how long it takes before this finely crafted piece of Russian cutting edge technology catches fire or breaks down like the other ships in it's navy?
Belarus and many nearby countries are giving troops and loyalty to putin in exchange for heat (gas/oil). They need heat. If Hungary signs a gas deal with Russia (high likelihood?), Ukraine will be surrounded. The troops from the other gas signee countries will be in the hundreds of thousands.This means Ukraine has to defend all other border areas in addition to their current goals. Russia and those troops can overrun Ukraine. China is providing tons (in 50 ton loads) of winter gear to Russia. N. Korea is sending arms and troops. So, Ukraine will immediately need more guns, ammo, tanks, winter gear, and troops than expected. Don't forget to protect the waterfront and Moldova from Black Sea subs and ship attacks. putin won't squander this unique opportunity. Kick putin.
