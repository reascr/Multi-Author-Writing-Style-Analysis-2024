Today I saw certain US rightwing talking heads on twitter spreading parts of a recording from a military parade in Belarus and claiming it's footage of a staged attack in Ukraine being carried out for the mainstream media. After other twitter users pointed out the original recording and blatant manipulation, the people who spread the disinfo didn't even delete their original tweets - just a short "I stand corrected" mention with no relation to the problem at hand, while the fake claim still got thousands of retweets and likes. As somewhat of a rightwing person myself I'm flabbergasted how many westerners(both in the EU and US) actually believe that russia is a defender of conservative values fighting against evil global elites, which obviously is total hogwash spread by all kinds of crazies the likes of antivaxxers and conspiracy nutjobs. Anyone who ever lived near russian borders knows it's literally the anti-civilization compared to the current western status-quo.
It was the most puzzling piece of propaganda ever. No footage? Dude, there is a whole subreddit filled with combat footage. There are tens of thousands of videos from this war.
