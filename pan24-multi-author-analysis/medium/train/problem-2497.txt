I only recently found out about clerk.house.gov, but it's ridiculously powerful. You can see exactly who voted for what in a very clear format with filters that let you drill down into who from where did what, and you can go directly to a representative's page and see everything they've voted on and what they voted, so you can figure out if your representative is accurately representing what you want to happen in government.
If you can take a step back from the hyper-partisan mindset, there's no ground lost in actually discussing how they voted for it. Calling republicans "the party of rape" doesn't quite jive with nearly half of them voting against it ( keep in mind, 4 democrats abstained, what kind of bad faith arguments should we hyperventilate in their direction? ), and 5 of them cosponsoring it. It's just twitter-level shit-flinging.
