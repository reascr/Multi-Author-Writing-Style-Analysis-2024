This is the first time in American history, when a former President of the United States has been referred for criminal charges, and referrals to the ethics committee were made for Republican congressmen, including the next possible Speaker.
The committee did the heavy lifting on bringing the evidence to the public. The amazing women in NY and GA are next. The DOJ needs to show what they can do now.
