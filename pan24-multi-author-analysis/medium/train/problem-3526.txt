Yep. The smart move for them would be to purge the crazies out and get candidates who reside inside the current Overton window. Not all early Trump backers were clan members. A lot were disaffected by our system and they wanted a disruptor. Trump disrupted a lot of things, but mostly just norms and ethical standards. When it came to governance he ruled like a Republican, judges and tax cuts. The tax cuts benefitting most voters were temporary, and it seems a majority of Americans think the judges they've placed are out of touch with what Americans think or want. So what reason do these voters have to continue voting for Republicans?
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
