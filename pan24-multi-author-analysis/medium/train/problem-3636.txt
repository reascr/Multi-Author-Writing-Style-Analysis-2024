Seeing as she’s using her elected position to fuck over the country, it’s almost a moral obligation to give up the dirt.
In another thread about her & Manchin high-fiving each other re: no filibuster reform, I saw a condescending-ass comment about how “they’re not elected to serve your interests, but rather Arizonans’ & West Virginians’ interests.”.
First of all, thanks for the belittling explanation; I am an anthropomorphic baby not unlike the film Boss Baby so the concept of federalism was confusing to me until now. More importantly, o wise oracle of what AZ & WV residents really like and want: are you gonna tell me that clinking champagne flutes with the world’s wealthiest in a Swiss ski resort town is a “meat & potatoes issue” in those states? It’s funny how we shouldn’t speak for those folks, but they have no problem telling us what these constituents really want….
Manchin is there as well both of them openly celebrating running the Democratic agenda of the tracks. They are literally whining and dining with people who to address inflation want to lower wages and fire people.
She’s not saying that removing the filibuster is absolutely wrong, just that the Dems tried too early.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
So when the Republicans suggest removing the filibuster at some later date, I expect she’ll consider it no longer “premature” and vote with them.
