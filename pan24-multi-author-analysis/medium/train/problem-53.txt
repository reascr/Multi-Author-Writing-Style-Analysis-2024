I’ll honestly keep paying for dental and vision without complaining about it if we could just get basic universal health care. Generally, there’s not going to be a sudden dental emergency that financially ruins you so long as you’re practicing good hygiene and getting your exams and cleanings regularly, and eye exams and glasses are very affordable without insurance of any sort.
Yeah, I totally agree in principle but in a country that won’t even provide basic care it definitely feels like a lofty dream to expect the whole package. Sadly, I don’t expect to see much progress in my remaining years since there has been so little in the decades I’ve lived already.
