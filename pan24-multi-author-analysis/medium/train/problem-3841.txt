Yes But not nuclear force. It won’t retaliate with nuclear force. certainly there will be a declaration of war but the policy will be towards non nuclear options. MAD has long been the policy between our nations, it’s well acknowledged that nuclear annihilation is not an option for any nation and Putin has done well over two decades operating under those pretenses. He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union not destroy it. His not so thinly disguised nuclear rhetoric saber rattling is just that.. a constant reminder to the west that he two has that destructive power.. and it’s simply because he cornered himself that he’s reminding the world of it. It’s not Putin we have to fear with that, is the Russians. The military, the generals, his inner circle, his outer circle.. Russia isn’t a nation. It’s a bunch of cronies with a gas tap and nukes.
