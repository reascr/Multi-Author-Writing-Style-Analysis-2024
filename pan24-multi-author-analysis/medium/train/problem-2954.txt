The concession speech and accompanying congratulatory phone call to your opponent are not formal requirements that must be met for the certification of election results to move forward. They are merely a polite tradition that is expected of functioning adults to observe once the tabulations are complete- a tradition which right wing conservatives have abandoned in the Trump era. Anytime they lose, it just automatically means the election was rigged or somehow stolen, despite a complete lack of tangible evidence. Whether or not Lake concedes is not relevant to the process- it is not an indictment of the election itself, mere an indictment of her own lack of maturity. It's a non-issue.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
