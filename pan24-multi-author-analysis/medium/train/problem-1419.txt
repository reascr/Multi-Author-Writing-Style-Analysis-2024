To be clear, are you talking about the group of Republican voters that simultaneously love Wal Mart while ranting and raving about "jina" viruses, globalization, etc.? Because I'm pretty sure there's no alienating them; they will do what they are fucking told without any sort of logical analysis or self reflection.
In all seriousness we make it out of this in the bright side I look forward to not only reminding them of this for the 60 years to get everything passed in the future toward the left but also I personally will be pushing for a hand in writing our history books. So that we never forget this nonsense again.

There is no "apolitical". Choosing not to take any sides is still a choice. Choosing to remain ignorant is still a choice. "Apolitical" is a cop-out so people can help themselves sleep at night by lying to their conscience and patting themselves on the back for not being ACTIVELY cruel, just passively.
