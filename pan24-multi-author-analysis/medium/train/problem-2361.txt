The US might not be the best comparison. In most Europeans countries companies can’t pour nearly unlimited amounts into dark money election funds like they can in the US.
Just because they are defending their interests or sharing their professional opinion doesn’t make it illegal.
I knew someone who worked in a university hospital who regularly went to lobby against the use of antibiotics in animal feed to increase weight gain.
Money changing hands to the politicians would be illegal and should be prosecuted. But that’s not something all MNC are necessary doing.
Just because something is legal doesn't make it morally correct or fair either. The person you replied to wasn't talking about universities or hospitals. He's talking about multi billion revenue companies who have much more sway in politics due to their wealth than many voters combined, just consider how many politicians or political parties get paid by these companies to lobby for them. As an obvious example, look at the awful design of American cities and how it came to be that public transport is drastically underdeveloped in the US.
