Any parallels or latching on to Tolkien's work to promote ideologies is done at the sole discretion of the other party, and was not intended as such by Tolkien himself.
I quite enjoyed the read, however I think it's very important to note that Tolkien himself in his preface of the Lord of the Rings states that “I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.".
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
