There is literally no quicker way to guarantee no southern republican will vote republican than asking them to vote for a black guy. The one time having an R in front of your name won't matter, cuz ya ain't getting Bubbas vote. Just true, and astonishing GOP doesn't recognize that.
Granted, but he's a former football player. That counted for more than anything. (I live in the south, football is a religion as much as guns and bible thumping).
As usual they will try to elevate the black republican during the beginning of the primaries so they seem less racists, but he has no chance with the base of the GOP. And given his stance on policing I doubt he will attract many black voters.
