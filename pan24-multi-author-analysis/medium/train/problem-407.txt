Whether you agree with it or not, nobody can in good faith deny how successful its use was. The EA swiftly ended an occupation practically overnight that multiple police forces couldnâ€™t do over 3 weeks.
The police also had no motivation to do so; Ford didn't want to deal with this because it would hurt him with some conservatives and because he knew there would be political fallout. So he sat on his hands and played chicken with the federal government.
This was my point when it happened and people were going off about it. Should we be using emergencies act against civilians? No. Not at all. Was it the right thing to do? Yes, yes it was. Had ANY level of service below this acted in the way they were meant to act, it would never have come to this, but every link on the chain failed until the EA became necessary.
It was the province's responsibility to handle this, which is why it went on for weeks before the federal government eventually acted in the public interest despite the province being unwilling.
