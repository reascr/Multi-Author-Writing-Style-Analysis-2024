"Zelenskyy received thunderous applause from members of Congress and presented lawmakers with a Ukrainian flag autographed by front-line troops in Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s contested Donetsk province. The flag was displayed behind him on the rostrum by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris. Pelosi, in turn, presented Zelenskyy with an American flag that had flown over the Capitol that day, and Zelenskyy pumped it up and down as he exited the chamber.".
Russia is using most of it's missiles and many of it's tanks. Disarming Russian oppression is in the best interests of both our countries and keeps the US physically out of it. We are getting real value helping a brave nation. Slava Ukraine.
Are they pro-Russian or just the isolationist types who don't want money spent on behalf of anybody else? I don't know that I've met anybody who is pro-Russian, but I have met some people who think we shouldn't send money or resources to other countries. Not saying that's OK, just asking out of curiosity when I see such stats.
It’s not the job (or appropriate) for the Ukrainian president on an official state visit to comment on internal US politics.
