So was I? Saying that India is funding Russia is like spitting in the ocean and saying that it’s making ocean levels rise. Russia is barely making profit from the discounted oil that they’re selling to India. When you throw in all the sanctions from other countries, it hardly makes a difference what India is doing. It can’t even compare to the amount Russia made off Europe for so many years.
I specifically dislike this government for their habit of bending over to populists. Take the example of farm laws, lowering education standards in railway exams, land reform and CAA.
Could be an ideal time to invest the money made from profit to become less dependant on oil energetically. So when price rise up again, they wouldn't even see the difference.
Government is giving massive amount of subsidies to people for EVs. Also, massive agriculture aids and interest free loans to farm palm and oil seed crops. Would have achieved this a year ago if economists like rihanna, mia Khalifa and others would not have misguided farmers against farm laws that benefited them. Punjabis are gonna regret missing out on prosperity for a long time.
