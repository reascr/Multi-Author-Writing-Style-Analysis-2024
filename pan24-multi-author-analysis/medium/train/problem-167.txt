I'm more amazed that RS would have a guest editorial by a Libertarian who used to write for the National Review than any of the content of the editorial, which seems to be doing a fair amount of wishcasting itself.
Sounds like the Saudis have realized they can use money to strategically control the media and business, thereby subverting democracy through commerce.
I mean, I'm not going to try to refute you on that... just really wish everyone can just put some things aside for the greater good of humanity but money drives everything.
Why do countries have to be out for each other and tear each other down. We got Russia, Saudi Arabia, China, all fucking with us. It's not a zero sum game. We could like, all work together on a global scale. But leaders (including ours) want to try and suppress competition. We could all live in peace. But that doesn't line the elites pockets so we don't. People talk about leaving their state or their country over shit but it's everywhere, society as a whole is the problem. Saudis going to continue to buy our media and buy our land to grow alfalfa and shit and nothing we can do about it because they own a resource that will kill the planet.
