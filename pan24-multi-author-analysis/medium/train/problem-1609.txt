People forget that the last thing China wants to do is enter a war, it would destroy their country. They have a lot of bluster but something like 85% (Don't quote me on this being exact) of their trade income comes from the West. Something around 7% comes from Russia. They are also a massive net importer of food, their country would starve. If they split from the West their economy tanks in a historical fashion. What is most logical is they want to keep good ties with Russia so that they can be a cheap source of resources, especially food - so they can stop relying on the West for food imports. Once they have a cheaper supply of critical resources they can start working to destabilize the petrodollar. China's expansion policy has been through monetary means and not military might.
China is the main lifeline for Russia providing financial services and purchasing super cheap fossil fuel and natural resources along with Dubai and Turkey to a lesser extent for the latest. India was initially neutral / pro Russia at the beginning of the conflict as they are the largest customer for Russian weapons. India is now progressively sliding towards a true neutral standpoint as they realized the weapons, tanks and planes they've been buying are likely shit.
