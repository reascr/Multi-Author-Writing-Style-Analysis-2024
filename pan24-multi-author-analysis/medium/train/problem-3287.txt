That doesn't counter that. There were Jewish Nazis as well. With how much genocide and indoctrination the Catholic church did.. it's a wonder that it wasn't bigger sooner. Hispanics much like the black community trend heavily religious conservative. If it wasn't for the Republican party's blatant bigotry. They'd have a much bigger share of both groups. Combine that with the fact that it's infinitely more easy to obstruct than it is to govern. And with Democrats unable to deliver much to help anyone let alone these communities. They don't feel that either of them are really serving them. But one at least aligns with them more religiously. And they will end up tolerating the racism and bigotry for that if for nothing else.
