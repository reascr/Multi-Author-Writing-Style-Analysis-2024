Russia needs to keep shipping oil. It’s not like they can just turn off the taps of the well. They might be in a take it or leave it scenario.
That’s my understanding. I think it is important to point out though that it could be enforced through the shipping insurance ships are typically required to have to dock at a port and unload their oil. This is at least what some other articles I’ve read / videos I’ve watched are saying. Who is in the business of supplying shipping insurance? Apparently, it’s generally western countries (like potentially up to 90%). If this is all true (I assume it generally is, but would like to read more about it), these insurance companies could forbid their insured customers from shipping oil over $30. Of course, I’m sure it is more complicated than that.
From what I understand, it’s not the oil they’re insuring, it’s the ships and the associated risks with transport/loading. Of which, a vast majority are owned/insured by western countries, even if they are “flagged” in a country of convenience.
