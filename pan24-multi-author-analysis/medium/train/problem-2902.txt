This is not too different from Lebanon looking at Phoenician artifacts to create a sense of national identity that predates the religious and tribal divisions of that country.
Judaism is difficult to categorize, it has nationalistic elements, it has religious elements. Itâ€™s inherently confederated and lacks a central authority to mandate conformity (though many are trying to do that).
Not all Israelis are Jews, not all Jews are Israelis, but this publication has an agenda to promote a national origin to the state that views in positive light a dynasty that forcibly converted people, centralized religious and legislative in a single monarchic autocrat, and game of throned their Ptolemaic client state into Roman occupation.
It is true that Israel has a national interest to find physical archeologic references to Jewish history seeing itself as a Jewish state. but in doing so they are helping us all imo as archeology is shared with the world, peer reviewed and helps us piece the puzzle of our human history. Including our own bias and stories we were told. I resent that some of this info is used towards nationalism. I would much rather it be historic and academic. But this indeed looks like a pre Hanukkah nationalistic propoganda piece.
Palestinian invest a lot of efforts in denying the relation between Jews and Israel. The Jordanian Waqf is systematically destroying archeological findings on the temple mountain. I can understand why some people can become paranoid over it.
That being said, that journal and the claim are indeed crap. I refuse to accept or even understand people who make up this type of stuff.
