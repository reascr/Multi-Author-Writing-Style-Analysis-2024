The severity of her sepsis later led to her needing the quadruple-limb amputations, Elizabeth-Anne Gumbel KC, who is representing the family, said, the BBC reported. The girl had above-knee amputations of both legs, and above-elbow amputations of her arms.
A house that's accessible requires a lot more square footage (for ramps, wider hallways, etc.) plus a bunch of specialized equipment. Any house she buys/builds will easily be 50% more expensive and will have reduced resale potential.
Paying someone to do almost everything for you every day, for the rest of your life, is not cheap. Let's say 50k/year for 60 years = 3 million (ignoring inflation).
Then everything she buys will have to be accessible and therefore expensive. For instance, an accessible van is 150-200k easily, let's say 10 over your lifetime = 2 million.
I think the amount awarded is fair given the needs of the person in question over a lifetime, this is not about trading anything. The limbs are gone, they aren’t coming back, restitution is still required.
That's just getting started. It all adds up. And who knows what further consequences the damage done by the infection will have over the course of her life.
It’s unfair that she lost her limbs. It’s fair that she’s compensated for that loss in a way that accounts for future struggles, pain and suffering.
For context with that must money invested conservatively, you could expect to live in great comfort without even touching the principle of the investment. 5% overall on an investment of $48 million would give you more than $2 million a year to live on, without diminishing your principle.
That’s a lot of money, even with the sort of care a limbless person required, even taking into account the unfairness of her condition.
I see your point, and agree legally it's fair, but I still argue the situation as a whole is not fair, even with the money. morally or emotionally, whatever you wanna call it. I think we agree.
