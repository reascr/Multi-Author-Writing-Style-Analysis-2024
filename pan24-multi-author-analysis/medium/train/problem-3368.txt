you know how much a fighter jet costs, even to maintain.... you don't just gift them to a country that probably would not be able to repay its debt owed back for years... there huge reasons why F35s are not being sent to Ukraine also F16s are old tech now more likely they would be sent instead but still would be pretty ineffective, all it will do is further escalate the situation so no no no fighter jets, also the USA needs all the air capacity it's got in its arnsal for a possible fight over the Taiwan straight and indo pacific that threat is outweighing a Ukraine strategic loss, let Nato handle it if they get attacked this should end in a Ukraine defeat and a weak Russia but hopefully a peace deal, give Russia the territories it wants domas and luhansk and end this way this year, pumping USA F16s into the mix right now is the wrong call if they want to find a peace deal. I think there's more at play with the Biden administration having family ties to the energy markets in Europe than anything else, this is all about money and the threat of China right now. 3 countries you don't want to fuck with is China Russia and the USA the fact they're all facing each other off right now is bad for world and prosperity of the Human Race. shame on us.
Yep. End business and end recognition of debt going in their direction. Seize and redistribute all assets in all foreign countries. Chinaâ€™s in such a worse position than Russia if there was foreign intervention.
Are you taking about the American government or who do you mean with 'our overlord oligarchs'? reshoring will only make them richer.. and our products m ore expensive.
