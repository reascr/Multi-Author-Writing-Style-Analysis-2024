> During a video conference on Monday Zelenskyy told host Germany and other leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers that his country needed long-range missiles, modern tanks, artillery and missile batteries and other high-tech air defense systems to counter Russian attacks that have knocked out electricity and water supplies for millions of Ukrainians.
No defense will be 100% and the Patriot system, while highly capable, is no different nor is it a silver bullet for every threat. There are less expensive solutions to deal with cheap and small drones and hypersonic missiles are a whole another matter entirely.
Despite Patriot's high price, it is far cheaper than having to replace critical infrastructure that would have otherwise been destroyed and of course, there is no doubt, it will save lives which are priceless.
iirc the original pushback against Patriot was due to the time required to train Ukrainian operators. Itâ€™ll be interesting to see how long it takes for Patriot to reach Ukraine- might imply that the training has already been completed.
