I don't see too many differences between this article and what OP posted from Fox. What am I missing?
I think that if you want to dump on Fox, 1. That's not original. 2. Provide a better source you feel comfortable discussing 3. Discredit the article.
Are you genuinely curious why people are saying Fox News is biased? Or are you being contrarian? If you're actually looking for answers someone on this thread will provide.
Well I mean right out the gates the first few comments were that Fox is garbage and don't even address the article, it's contents, or continuing the Convo about Zelenskys visit.
I actually agree with everyone here the Fox isn't exactly unbiased. But this is a political forum not a let's shit on Fox forum. There's already plenty of that and it's stale.
It must be repeated anytime someone posts a Fox News link, here or anywhere else. It can't get stale because it's vital to our nation that these propaganda outlets stop being trusted. It's more important than the the news that Zelenskyy is traveling to the US.
