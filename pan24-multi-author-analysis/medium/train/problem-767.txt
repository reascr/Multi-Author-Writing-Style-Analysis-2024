Iranian security forces massacred 96 civilians in balochistan last month, iranian sunni clerics are intimidated and even killed because they are vocal when it comes to iranian-backed militias killing sunnies in Iraq and Syria. Another reason is in the sunni tradition, sunnies are only allowed to pray in sunni mosques but the Iranian government forcibly close the sunnni mosques so they could pray at the shia shrines, all under the false guise of "unity". Don't belive me.... Sunnies own or control 9 mosques in Tehran, and to call these "mosques" are disingenuous as some say they are legit prayer rooms not mosques.
Bear in mind that he's part of the Sunni minority and doesn't necessarily reflect the views of the leaders despite being a cleric. I don't know much about him, but a quick google seems to show that he's been critical of the regime in the past.
Your right sunnies are critical of shittes but because your ignorant. Not everything is black and white but put this in perspective.
Unless the military sides with protestors probably not as sad as that is. My hope is even if revolution doesn't come from this, people remember.. they hold onto how their government really treats them and they stay mad.
