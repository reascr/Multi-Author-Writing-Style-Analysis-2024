Which would sound pretty good... except, when they say "family values" they mean "traditional family" aka nuclear heterosexual family. So they're against things like same-sex marriage because, in their view, it's somehow an insult or a threat to "real families". And they're usually also against decriminalising drugs, because they perceive everything from this protectionist "think of the children!" angle.
There are big trade offs. A bipartisan government is frustrating because politics can either get extremely polarized, or there can be a tendency to appeal to the center. Special interests and insider politics can dominate, and it’s difficult for outsiders to gain power because parties are completely in charge. It’s frustrating and not very democratic. However, with enough support, a populist can break through the party’s preferences, as Trump did, and to a lesser extent, Obama (who was perceived as a populist and was not the party’s preferred candidate in 2008, even if he ended up becoming more centrist with time). Bipartisan governments are considerably more stable and take a lot of effort to upend. It’s actually kind of amazing that US democracy has become this unstable in a matter of six years because so much more has to fall into place than one or two favorable elections; an entire half of the government had to be taken over and thousands of lackeys had to be installed at all levels. And it still hasn’t totally fallen apart. This probably wouldn’t be the case without a rigidly structured bipartisan system.
