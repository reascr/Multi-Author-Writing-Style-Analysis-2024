Modi and the BJP have significantly eroded democratic institutions in India, including the free press. It's impossible to predict at this point if the Indian people will manage to repair that damage, or if they'll allow their country to slide further toward authoritarianism. But India does have strong democratic traditions and values. Assuming that they are able to return their democracy to a healthier state (hopefully addressing the corruption problem along the way), one would assume that they'll resume the trajectory they were on before of moving closer the the rest of the free world.
Oh, do you mean that little BBC documentary THE MODI QUESTION that was banned in India and the Indian government raided the BBC offices in India for a "totally separate" reason??
You can discuss the war, just not sanctions. The G20 is to discuss issues that concern everyone like development or climate change. Sanctions are a Western thing, other countries won't follow them anyway so why bother discussing them?
It was such a banger they raided the BBC offices of India for a completely "unrelated" reason and banned the documentary!
