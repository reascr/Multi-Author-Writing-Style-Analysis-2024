What they want is stupid. Biden is going to spend everyday saying no way is he hitting social security and Medicare and anyone not addicted to faux news will never vote Republican again. I remember when they tried this shit with Clinton and it propelled him to reelection.
Yeah we just watched them take fifteen bites to get the speaker we all knew they were going to get from the beginning. This is not a group of politically savvy individuals.
They know the shit they propose isn't going to pass, it's all optics like most Republican bullshit. I doubt after the abortion fiasco they actually want to pass anything but they will put forward all sorts of bills for propaganda purposes and blame Biden for not passing them. All they care about is obstructing government and blocking tax reform, it's what they were paid off to do.
And they got their balanced budget and kept majorities in the house and senate and Bill started being more centrist.
Yeah you're not going to be able to gaslight me. Clinton kicked their asses. Clinton got the budget surplus and then the next Republican squandered it. Biden has been a great president. Far better than I'd hoped for. Seventy percent of Gen Z is democrat. The boomers are starting to die off. You've lost three straight national elections including with this crazy inflation. You have won the popular vote exactly one time in the past eight presidential elections. Your party's platform is to gut social security and Medicare and institute a twenty-five percent sales tax. It really doesn't matter what you say. Republicans only can about the national debt when a Democrat is president.
