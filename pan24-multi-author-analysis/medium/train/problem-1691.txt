While Musk is becoming increasingly aggressive in regurgitating Russian propaganda, it's also true that many in the media space don't do themselves any favours, either, with how loose they play with accurate representation of facts in the age of "clicks and views above everything else". Journalistic integrity is almost as low as it was at the inception of the profession (i.e. the original tabloid print newspapers). Sensationalized into absurdity clickbait titles & articles reign supreme.
Just quickly perusing their hot posts right now, it's mostly train derailment conspiracy stuff, but there are also a few pure anti-vaxx misinfo posts, one homophobic post, some pro-authoritarian stuff (praising Gaddafi ffs), some guy hilariously claiming oil doesn't come from dead dinos and also dinos didn't go extinct until just 100,000 years ago, some Greta Thunberg hate, several posts only slightly masking their anti-semitism in a veil of "ackshully Epstein wasn't the mastermind - it was the Jews" type posts, and a whole bunch of "Biden is Evil and the Media is Covering It Up" posts.
That's the underlying goal of strategic misinformation - not to get people to believe a certain thing, but getting people to inherently distrust everything that's said.
