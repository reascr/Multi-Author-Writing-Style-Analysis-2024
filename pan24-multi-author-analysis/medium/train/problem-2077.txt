This has nothing to do with Lula or Bolsonaro, despite what some frustrated commenters are saying here. For the record, the judges who voted in favor of his release were appointed by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Lula and Bolsonaro.
What happened is that Cabral has been in preventive imprisonment for 6 years, and his attorneys argued that keeping him there for 6 years without an actual trial was unreasonable. The court accepted that argument. So, the main issue here is an ineffective system. That said, charges were not dropped, and he still faces sentences that add up to over 400 years in prison.
Lula wins, and more corrupt bullshit resumes just in a different capacity since it's "their team" this time? Basically just one big gang ran against a different big gang?
who is "buddy" with the guy is the difference. an corrupt will free the ones on the same "side" as them and let the opposition stay rotting in the jail.
I just find it strange that "That was expected" after a corrupt politician is being released is something that would be said for someone who is less corrupt than the previous individual who had the same opportunity to release this person...
Gotcha, so it's basically 2 corrupt pieces of shit who ran while the world was lied to believing Lula would be a revolutionary difference (or at least in the areas I perused since he was a "worker's party" candidate).
