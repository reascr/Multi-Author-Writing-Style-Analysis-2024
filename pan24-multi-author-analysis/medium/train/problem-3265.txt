We need to pass around running lists of these people and organizations that are attempting to hurt Americans. Shine some light on it. That's effectively what they're about, simply hurting people for money and power.
You’re describing like half the humans on the planet, maybe a lot more. But these guys are at the top of the shit list, literally making it their mission to publicly ratfuck their own home. I’ve met people like this, they love to say shit like “the planet is fine, it will self-correct, calm down.” And I’m like, “yeah it will, but we won’t be here to see that happen you fucking ghoul!”.
I mean even beyond that this headline paints them as pro-fuck the world. Even if you didn’t think we’re all fucked, isn’t making sure the world is cleaner a good thing?
