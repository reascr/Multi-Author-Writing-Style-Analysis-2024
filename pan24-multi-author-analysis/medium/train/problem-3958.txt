I'm gonna assume your first sentence was a question and drive on. When the original ticket agent also owns the agent that buys most of the original tickets and resells them, you absolutely create an artificial scarcity situation because you're releasing the tickets as you please. You could sell one of the 30k, or you could sell all of them. Nobody knows how many are available except the ticketing agent. So if there are only 100 tickets on the entire planet available for the show, guess what, those tickets are more valuable than if there were 30k available. So you withhold sales on the other 29,900 tickets until you've sold the 100 at a rate commensurate with them being the only tickets available, rinse and repeat. This is not a new concept, this is not something I invented for this comment, this is how the industry works and why the prices are as high as they are. It's not because there are too many fans and not enough artists.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
