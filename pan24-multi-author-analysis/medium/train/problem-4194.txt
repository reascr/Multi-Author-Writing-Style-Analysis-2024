Healthcare in America needs a major overhaul. First and most important, healthcare needs to be 100% separated from employment. It's crazy that an uninsured (or underinsured) person has to struggle with the decision to seek medical care because of the cost. I knew a guy in college many years ago who had a freak accident knee injury and didn't get it seen to. That's a young man whose entire life (and subsequent employment) was affected by a lack of healthcare.
It needs to lose the profit motive entirely. My special lady's coworker who just completed her 3rd round of chemo found out that insurance is refusing to cover it. Each round has been 33k. She makes like 16k a year and is going through fucking cancer.
