Iâ€™m Georgi Kantchev, a WSJ reporter based in Berlin. I started reporting for the Journal in 2014 in London, covering energy and financial markets. After that, I was stationed in Moscow where I wrote about Russia and the conflict in Ukraine.
Europe has long been reliant on Russian gas. This year, Russia has cut off most of its gas exports to Europe in retaliation for Western support of Ukraine . Though European companies and governments have been stockpiling fuel and reducing consumption, they face an energy crisis this winter . Consumers are bracing themselves , companies are considering reducing their footprint in Europe due to high energy costs and Ukrainians are preparing for a new obstacle to their war effort [link].
Temperatures are dropping across Europe this week as its new, makeshift energy system undergoes the first test of the season.
Despite gas storage levels and gas consumption levels looking like Europe will get through this winter just fine (perhaps the next one may be slightly trickier), it still seems like the majority of reporting on the matter from US news papers is rather alarmist.
