Fuck that. This isn’t about hijab. It’s about women being beaten to death for breaking a ‘morality’ law. It’s about women (and men) being arrested and raped, beaten, whipped, shocked, tortured so badly they need medical care and being denied that. It’s about having a 10 minute trial, without a lawyer and being sentenced to death by hanging. It’s about them being lifted by a crane so that they slowly (20-30 minutes) suffocate to death. It’s about their tortured and murdered bodies being buried in secret or held for ransom by the police. It’s about families being threatened with the safety of the family if they say how how a family member was killed/died.
Yes, it is also about seemingly smaller laws, not being allowed a pet dog, not helping any of the strays, not showing hair, school girls not being able to pluck/groom their eyebrows, and etc.
I'm pretty sure the Iranian people aren't completely fixated on just the issue of the hijab? I'm thinking they question the entire theocratic hold over their lives and the inability to live those lives without sanction for incidental infractions of harsh interpretations of Islamic law?
It's obvious the mullah's desire power and control over their people and they intend on maintaining that control at any cost. The suffering of the people under their charge is not even a concern.
But it all comes down to the evil, greedy, weak men in control thinking of themselves as Gods. If you speak out against what is happening in Iran or wanting to be free of the Islamic regime you are arrested for moharebeh, ‘waging war against God’. Yes, moharebeh is punishable by death.
