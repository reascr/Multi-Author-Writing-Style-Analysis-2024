I wouldn’t go that far. I suspect it’s a mix of not enough time, not enough transport capacity and, if particularly cynical, the calculation that caring for a wounded man who won’t be returning to combat any time soon is a non-trivial resource drain…but one that’s easily turned into the enemy’s problem.
Looking back over Russia from the last century, I don't think any of the Russian officers have the resources, time, or empathy for their wounded soldiers.
Let's be honest, the main reason Russia leaves them is because it puts a burden on Ukraine and the West. Due to the nobility and empathy, I don't think we would just let anyone die if they could be treated.
Battlefield medicine has transformed so much and can preserve life, but at a cost of money and manpower. After the wounded soldiers get patched up they will need clothing, food, water, and someone to guard them.
If Russia wasn't using these soldiers trying to get Ukraine to spend money/time/energy on POWs, I shudder to think of what they might otherwise be used for.
we supply Ukraine with so much, this will not ad much money to the tally but oh my god that will do to russian morale and what tales will those wounded tell after the war.
Besides caring for enemy soldiers being the objectively moral good, this is positive propaganda that will absolutely shatter someone's worldview if they believe the West/NATO being some boogieman.
