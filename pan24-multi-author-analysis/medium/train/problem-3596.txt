The HARM missiles have been the unsung hero of Ukrainian defense. MANPAD's and HIMARS get all the attention but it's thanks to air-launched anti-radiation missiles that Russia was never able to gain air-superiority. In the early stages of the invasion Ukrainian engineers figured out how to interface the NATO supplied missiles to their Soviet-era warplanes and they've been brutally effective. Any Russian battery radar operator foolish enough to switch their radar on can expect an incoming missile in short order.
Off top of my head, the $1 billion package included 10 120 mm, 82mm, and 60mm mortar systems plus ammo, the patriot battery, more Excalibur 155mm howitzer rounds and HIMAR rockets, more MRAPs (mine resistant trucks) and HMMWVs, more HARM anti radar missiles, and JDAM guided missiles. Then the $800 million that's actually part of the US military budget is to purchase Soviet caliber artillery munitions (122mm artillery/rocket, 152mm artillery, and 125mm tank rounds). Then there is a whole assortment of small arms and munitions.
