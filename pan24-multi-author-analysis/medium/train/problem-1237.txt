When they say they want to be grown-ups they really mean they want to whine and throw tantrums about everything they pretend is unfair to them. When they say they want to address the root of division what they really mean is that they think the "mainstream media" is causing the division, not the Right-wing Regressive media that's constantly lying to them to purposely spread division. When they talk about discrimination what they really mean is that they think they are the real victims of discrimination. When they're say they want unity what they really mean is that they want the people on the Left to concede and let them have their way on everything.
Here in the states if you follow the money funding these kinds of right wing 'protests' you're usually led to China or Russia. Sure it's very similar up north.
I don’t get it. No one is being forced to mask anymore unless they choose too. They’re literally just being whiny little pussys for no reason other than just to be whiny little Pussys.
