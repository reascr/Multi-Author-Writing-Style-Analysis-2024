Agreed they need better monitoring and more frequent shutoff/diversion control along lines. I live near an ocean transfer point and shore tanks sit behind tertiary coffer dams and secondary containment pools. The same pipeline that feeds these tanks sits at the bottom of a small mountain. A few years ago, a city engineer flagged a run of this pipe for a sub working on a city highway project, the as-built drawings were incorrect and a neighbourhood was showered with Bunker C until the excavator operator got his bucket uncurled to direct the flow downward…. Into yards, a couple of streams- it was a mess. Two houses were destroyed due to basements full of oil. They could not stop the gravity-driven flow because it wasn’t driven by a pump or gas pressure that could be shut down and trying to stop a mass of crude flowing downhill by “putting your finger on top of the straw” would have risked causing vacuum-induced pipeline collapse miles uphill and more leaks in worse locations. We need triple layer, human-proof safeguards, company-posted cash bonds and company-funded response teams.
We need tighter regulations and to make them account for inevitable leaks, maybe a sleeve around the pipe or a drip pan running the lenh of it. And every yard of pipe should be monitored so they can catch leaks when they start.
What is it like there? How are they cleaning it? Is farmland impacted? I grew up in NE Kansas and so this story is on my mind, but I can’t find much about it beyond the number of gallons leaked.
