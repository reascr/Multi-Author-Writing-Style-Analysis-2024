“This is a legal determination made by the State Department under longstanding and well-established principles of customary international law,” a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a written statement. “It has nothing to do with the merits of the case.”.
Shocking that Fox News conveniently ignores this piece in their headline. They in no way "requested immunity." That is a lie.
Missing the point here guy. Used to be legal to beat your wife in the US, but didn't make it right. The fact that they are hiding behind legalese without making a stand against this extreme barbarism is why this feels icky.
Yes, then we changed that law because it was a bad one. We should work to change the law. But unfortunately it's an international law and we are not the world police. I'm simply pointing out that as usual this fox News article is highly misleading st best and outright lying in the headline here on reddit.
I hate fox news, but in this case I don't think it's as misleading as it seems if you understand that the US sidesteps international law whenever convenient.
The Biden admin did not need to grant this form of immunity considering our "longstanding precedent" of ignoring international law.
Do I think fox news was intentionally calling into question our hypocrisy in international diplomacy / intervention and our role in world hegemony? Absolutely not. But hey, a broken clock is right twice a day.
