I feel like anti-LGBT people (MAGA conservatives) have remaining gay disease AIDS mentality when it comes to this stuff. Like, they think it's contagious, don't want their kids exposed to it because their basic understanding of it is as a pathology. It's not linear to why they apply this to trans people, there are a lot of dots that can connect for these people, but the fact that a lot of trans issues are associated with body dysmorphia they see it as an illness, and illnesses are contagious. Now, if they are so scared of diseases then why are they so weird about COVID? Covid manifests pretty similarly to respiratory viruses that everyone has personal experience with, now, it can become much more severe, but most people who contract COVID are going to be alright. It's not like COVID turns people trans. If they thought COVID turned people trans then they would be wearing n-95s everytime they stepped outside. I wouldn't be surprised to see Trump branded straight air supplies that these people would buy...
