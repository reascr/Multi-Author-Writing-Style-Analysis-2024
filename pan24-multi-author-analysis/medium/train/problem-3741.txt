The slide fire stock that was in common use before their banning my Trump and the ATF, and doesn’t make semi automatic rifles into machine guns by definition. It would have to modify the receiver, bolt, and the fire control group internals to meet the definitions of the GCA and NFA. Instead of using the mechanical parts of the firearm to meet these goals, it uses inertia and physics to achieve this goal. Even tho it’s main purpose is to “simulate” automatic fire, it is not a fully automatic machine gun by definition. It is still pulling the trigger to fire sequential rounds technically. Also, if you have a “trigger finger” or even a shoelace, you can achieve the same simulation without the stock on the weapon. It’s more of a matter of the ATF circumventing law with trumps blessing to make their own regulations and not enforcement of existing laws and definitions under the legislative process.
