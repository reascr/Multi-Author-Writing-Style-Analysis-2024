was thinking about this issue earlier today coincidentally, and I agree in principle that the Indian Nations should have their own votes and representation, but then again don't they kind of do already? Native Americans are US citizens with the right to vote in whatever state they live in. Arizona would never have gone blue if it weren't for the turnout from the tribes. Deb Haaland is Pueblo and she's Secretary of the Interior and was a congresswoman for New Mexico before that. It's a weird sort of disenfranchisement, because they're not disenfranchised as American citizens, but the Indian Nations themselves are disenfranchised as sovereign entities within the country.
I'm from Tennessee and hate hogs as much as the next guy, but to be fair they made the wording of all those amendments purposefully obtuse and confusing in my opinion. We had another amendment on weakening unions, and my absolutely prounion mother voted in favor of it thinking she was voting against it. Not to excuse all 20% but at least a portion of them.
