Yeah. I’m a young(ish)(30s) voter. I do need to pay more attention to what a politician plans are if elected though. My wife just went through (and is still) a terrible spat of pneumonia with sepsis on top of that. If it weren’t for her mother being the VP of the hospital we were at we would be destroyed by medical debt right now. Luckily though she’s going to help us with it but we still most likely have to go see a specialist soon at a different hospital so we’re going to be stuck with those bills no matter what. We’re only a one income household as she is a stay at home mom. At least until our youngest goes to school full time in kindergarten which is just next August. Too many big businesses have too much money invested in the government though to get any good change for everyone. It’s not only healthcare either. The companies we have to do our taxes with pay to keep them from just telling us how much we owe on our taxes.
And Biden who won't even try to use march in rights to lower prescription drug costs or import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada.
