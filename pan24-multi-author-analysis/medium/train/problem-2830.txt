You dont get it. All important people who make decisions live in Moscow, and they are not willing to risk getting blown up. It is other Russians who can be blowed up without consequences. Common Russians dont matter. Bridge does not matter. However life threat to themselves is unacceptable. So they would have to make sure Ukraine wont repeat something like that. And the only thing which has not been used yet is nukes. If they just launch missile strikes again, Ukraine would just shrug (it has been done many times already, so who cares) and keep bombing Moscow. So they would nuke something at Ukraine and say "thats what will happen to all your cities if you dont stop".
This reminds me of the Doolittle raid in WW2. The point of the raid was not to cause material damage, but to shatter the opponentâ€™s sense of invulnerability, decrease their morale and force them to divert resources.
Actually it had very important military consequences. Before that raid Japanese army was opposed to navy plan of taking Midway, considering it too risky and poorly planned. But after raid army felt humiliated and agreed to follow that plan to restore its honour. And we know how it ended.
