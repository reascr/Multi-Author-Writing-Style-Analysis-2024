Seriously. A particular dumbass and her husband I know (and both I loathe, but fortunately don’t have to be around anymore) live in Simi Valley and all they do is complain about Democrats and bought a gun because - and I’m not joking - they need to protect themselves from the roving BLM gangs they think are Mad Maxing it up around here and are gonna come for them. They’ve 110% dropped the “If you don’t like America, then leave!” line when I/we have complained about Trump, etc. They’ve spent years bitching about this state even though they live comfortably, have literally nothing to suffer for (financially well off, white, etc.) and keep saying they wanna leave and they perpetually go to Tennessee and other red states “looking for a home.”.

What did California ever do for me besides provide an environment where I can prosper and a rising home value which allows me to move to many other states with a huge cost of living drop?
