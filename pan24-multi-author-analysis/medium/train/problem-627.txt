I only recently twigged to that pun/double meaning on "too big to fail". For ages I just thought it meant "massive enough that it can tank most problems that would tank a smaller system" but what it actually means is more along the lines of "oh god if this fails we're all super duper screwed".
Similarly some businesses claim to be "too big to fail" so they can maximize profit to the point of screwing things up, then receive a bail out.
If i was a big business and i had an issue with Qatar's actions then i would very very vocally say i am pulling all sponsorships, and guess what, that would be a story. Free brand awareness 24/7, asking customers to make a choice between my principled stance and the businesses who do not care.
The tank autoantonym wasn't meant to be the wordplay, that's how I naturally worded the sentence before I re-read it and realised how confusing it was.
(edit: er, "tank" as in gaming tank in the first instance - absorb damage. And "tank" as in fail in the 2nd. Could've worded that better...).
