Lemme guess, they also have NO lobbyists, nor CPAs who make most of their fees by gaming the tax code, nor software tax return vendors getting rich by getting the government to prohibit the tax authority from developing their own free alternative, nor a financial services sector. It may also be helpful not to have a military which costs the equivalent of US$2,000 or more annually per capita.
but of course they did...republicans seem to only serve one of two functions any longer; they're either a massive distraction via their destructive/regressive antics or they're busy serving their Ã¼ber-wealthy overlords.
Question is, why haven't the Democrats not expanded it either? The GOP is very honest about how it's priorities are to dismantle the Federal government until it's reduced to just controlling the military.
But the Dems are for a centralized welfare state. Why have they been unable to increase the IRS's resources so far, and even ordered them to concentrate on 600$ transactions recently?
I feel we should really start criticizing Dem incompetence more. The GOP's incompetency is helpful to us, but the Dem's isn't.
Very populous countries are going to have crappy tax codes and crappy public schools. That's due to a combination of Murphy's Law and the Peter Principle. Far more ways for things to go wrong with populations of hundreds of millions, and more levels of management needed so many more quanta of incompetence to attain.
