For me it’s more that this report is late to the party - this should have been the news before they started straight up murdering people and firing live rounds on crowds.
I'd almost rather be killed than blinded and left alive. I'm sure I'd adjust to it but if you asked me right now I'd just take the bullet to the head.
Either way these are horrible human rights abuses and I sincerely hope the Iranian people can get their French revolution moment.
Oh I wish the Iranian people all the best, but it’s only a matter of time before we see outside interference and considering who put their fundie fascist government in power in the first place I’m less than optimistic about whose side we’ll pick.
(This did result in amusing exchange when a British military officer at some weapons expo was confronted by a journalist about a “dazzler” weapon. The journalist asked if he was aware it could potentially cause permanent blindness. The reply was, approximately “Oh, I don’t want to blind anyone permanently, just long enough to run up and bayonet them to death.”).
Killing people is sadly still an ordinary and common thing that we hear about in the modern world all the time.
