Look I know Putin has made errors here, but once he’s a month in and things ain’t ideal - did he really not fire up the war machine? Was there no machine? Was he just getting yes’ from his yes men on the war going well? I just don’t get it.
A month in, isn't that when all the fires started? People burning down buildings that were supposed to hold stocks and manufacturing capacity. I mean, the government paid for those things.

And you get to collect on the insurance after you bride the investigators into writing a report about a totally accidental fire.
