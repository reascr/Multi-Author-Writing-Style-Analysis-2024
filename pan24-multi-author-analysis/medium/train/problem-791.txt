Biden could save a baby from a burning building and Republicans would criticize him: for not putting out the fire too, for using it as a photo op, or that the baby's mother worked for Planned Parenthood or something. That baby could be the next Hitler. Did anyone notice that when Trump was president we didn't have all these fires? These "Biden Fires" are popping up everywhere these days. I'm not saying it's a deep-state false flag, but just... asking questions.
Yeah and its BECAUSE you are the meatiest meat eating Philly native. You know deep in your pock-marked, cholesterol-collective, carcinogenic heart that lettuce is basically a waste of good digestive enzymes, and spinach or arugula will actually have some kinda taste to make it worth the effort.
