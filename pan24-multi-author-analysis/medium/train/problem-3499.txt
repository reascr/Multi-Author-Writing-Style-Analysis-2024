Also I'm not saying take it by force, I'm talking a negotiated agreement. I was thinking starting really small. What if the border was moved so a ten by ten block area was now in DR instead of Haiti? It seems like over time, the DR could easily handle instituting basic services like power/water/trash removal/mail, etc. They could open a grocery store there using DR logistics routes, they could pave the streets, offer medical care and after a generation, the education and stability of that one neighborhood would have improved greatly with no negative impact on DR, right?
It's remarkable the inequality, different sides of the proverbial fence live radically different lives.
The Youtuber Indigo Traveller did an amazing series on Haiti recently. Highly recommend it, very eye-opening.
The west will give them $$$ to administer the program. Better for the people living in that slice having their lives improved, better for the donors seeing their money properly used, and better for the DR who get direct economic benefits.
