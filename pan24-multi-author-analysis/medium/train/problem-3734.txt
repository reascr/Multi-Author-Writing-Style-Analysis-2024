It will be very interesting what she can do with this Democratic controlled legislature. From what I understand the Democrats want to strenhen unions, and to that end they plan to repeal the right to work law, and I could also see them increasing the minimum wage.
If she helps pass important legislation, her stock could rise by 2028, or even 2024 depending on how things shape up. She has already proven to be a capable governor, and one that has won statewide office in a purple state twice.
