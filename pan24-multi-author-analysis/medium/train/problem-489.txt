You realize the bill didn't enforce the owner's demands, it enforced the neutrally arbitrated compromise (2/3 of the NMB were appointed by Obama/Biden and had a long history working in union leadership).
Edit: apparently I’m speaking on outdated information and missed the Senate fucking things up like they usually do.
Congress voted for this. Democrats AND Republicans 80 to 15 in the Senate. Yes, Biden will sign it. But the blame goes all around. Most of the blame belongs to the railroad owners. They are the ones putting profit before their workers. They have been making record profit and don't want to give any of it up.
The 4/12 figure is from a prior deal that was shot down. The 7 sick days figure satisfied 2 of the unions, and the 0 sick day version of this was voted down by slim majorities in all 4 of those unions.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I was speaking earlier under the impression the 7 sick days passed. I’ve since been updated that the Senate fell short of 60, even with 6 Republicans joining the Democrats.
