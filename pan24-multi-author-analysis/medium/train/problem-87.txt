WTF is wrong with these arsehole countries, internal pressures as a result of our own incompetence and stupid policies, we know how to fix it lets starts messing with other countries to divert the attention away. Instead of starting wars or building nukes how about just not being a dick?
For all the downvotes the USA and it’s allies invaded Iraq illegally and suffered no consequences. But then again it’s rules for thee not for me. You downvote that as well.
You're not wrong, but what you're describing is a reason for China to make a move now instead of later.
The war in Ukraine has kicked the US's wartime production ecosystem into gear, and we're churning out all kinds of stuff to replace what we're sending out. We have enough spare weapons to adequately arm Taiwan for years.
China's in for a ride awakening if it thinks it can successfully invade Taiwan whilst the US has effectively infinite budget and manufacturing capability to send a steady stream of current and next-genetation weapons and materiel to Taiwan and other allies in the area.
They may also be betting that the US doesn't want to deal with multiple fronts at once between assisting Ukraine and also needing to come to Taiwan's aid, even though we will because we don't have a choice until we've built up the supply chain at home.
The problem is from China's standpoint there will probably never be a better time than now. What are they going to do, wait another couple years and give Taiwan more time to prepare, give the US more time to assist Taiwan, and give the chip ban more time to bite?
