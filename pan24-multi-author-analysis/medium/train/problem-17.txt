One bit missed from the full article, the law in question is requiring religious organisations to have the name of the denomination (or equivalent) in the name itself, and they asked for this church to make the affiliation to the Russian Orthodox denomination to be made clearer.
Which is odd because they are no longer affiliated with Moscow. They declared themselves independent last spring/summer is response to the Moscow Patriarchateâ€™s decision to support the Kremlin.
I wonder if it is an effort to cause additional harm to the church whilst helping out the much more blatantly nationalist OCU that was granted autocephalous status by Constantinople a few years ago (and granted it in a pretty odd series of decisions and events might I add).
They claim to be no longer affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church/Moscow Patriarchate. However, since the Moscow Patriarchate hasn't broken ties with the UOC-Moscow Patriarchate (like Moscow has broken ties with the Orthodox churches of Egypt, Greece, and Constantinople), their claim is a little suspect.
The Orthodox Church of Ukraine was formed out of a unification of three different churches, including parts of the UOC-Moscow Patriarchate that no longer wanted to be subservient to Moscow. This broad representation was why they were granted autocephalous status by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and recognized by other (non-Moscow-controlled) Orthodox churches.
