There are many pro gun democrats, we just not pro everyone should have one if they have mental illness or beat their wives, we want real background checks. People say cars kill people too, well, here in GA, you can't buy a car without a driver's license, but a gun, have at it. In Cobb County you can't drink alcohol in a strip bar, but you can carry a gun to a bar.
In a lot of southern states, pro gun democrats would do well. I consider myself a pro gun democrat. I've considered campaigning in the south. I bet I could do decently well.

I should have phrased that differently. It would be a lot better if we had democratic politicians who actually set out as part of their platform to preserve gun rights. I am well aware that many folks on the left appreciate their gun rights just as much as those on the right, me being one of them, but that isn't reflected in the politicians who claim to represent us.
