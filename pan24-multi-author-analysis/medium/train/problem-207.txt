While what they say is true, that's a big reason why there has been such a push by the GOP to gerrymander aggressively, restrict voting access, and blockade the changes attempted pre-midterm to address the voting issues revealed by 2020.
They know that it's a timetable before the percentages shift, partially due to older folks passing, but also due to younger folks having to move to more rural red areas in order to afford places to live, which brings more blue into historically red spaces.
They are also going to continue to show declines in suburban areas as millennials and gen z start being able to afford to live there more and more. Leaving the GOP with just heavily rural areas.
