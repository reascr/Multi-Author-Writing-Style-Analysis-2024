“Some VDV units have likely been reinforced with mobilised reservists. Although these poorly trained personnel will dilute VDV’s supposedly elite capability, Russia will likely still allocate these units to sectors deemed especially important.".
"One person gets the parachute, one person gets the rip cord. When the person with the parachute dies, the person with the ripcord grabs the parachute, puts it on and pulls the rip cord Anyone who doesn't jump out of the plane will be shot on site".
They were elite, problem is there were few units that had the skills to carry out even basic infantry roles with any degree of success so they had to do the heavy lifting on basically all fronts. Unsurprisingly they’re worn down to the nub at this point.
Nothing a soldier does is. To be badass. First time I saw a Korean weapon instructor. Hit 3 targets in tight AF. groups at a pretty decent target with a 9mm. Looked pretty. Badass. Doubt they said. Hey let's practice for years and fight in a war. So we can look badass.
Starchak Ivan " holy fuck. That guy was a badass. Thanks. Had a good read about him and his troops. They couldn't predict where they would drop in. So the Germans got ambushed a lot and where confused as to how they got there. Kinda like the story about the royal marines i heard about. They had to take a defensive position high up on sone kills with only a narrow entry point. It was easily defendable abd would have taken hundreds of troops to take. And most would have probably died. A small group marines hiked 200 km. Around. Swam a small portion and climbed the backside of the cliff. Taking out the hand full of men in pill boxes in the night.
And the uk has that sort of mentality when it comes to war. 1 man has the ability of 10. Crazy what some men can do. I'm here after eating. 2 rack of ribs. Finding it difficult to go 3 meters to pee.
