That’s not true, if substance here means goals, they absolutely have substance, that substance being that they desperately want the rich to be allowed to exploit the middle and lower classes into the dust for their own profit.
They want corporations to have rights over their employees and not be held accountable for poor treatment or working conditions.
They want to adjust civil rights to suit their taste (their taste of course being that minorities, women, and the poor will have none).
They want to be able to accept bribes from the oil and gas industry to block changes that would combat or slow climate change (just kidding, they already do this flagrantly).
They have plenty of substance and it’s easy to see because it revolves exclusively around their own interest to the detriment of everyone else.
