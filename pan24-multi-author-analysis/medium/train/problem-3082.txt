Yeah it is so weird to see countries like this(we have our own nut jobs here too though) talk about immigration "crisis"(edit. or maybe threat would be a better word) and then not actually back it up with any evidence. That's just pure racism and even worse.

SVP started to raise in the 90s, far right sentiment is not something new in Switzerland, it has been leading the Swiss political agenda for the past 20 years.

So, they don't want to be a part of any partnership unless they are being attacked then they can ask for help. If this passes than I say fuck all of Switzerland. Let the wolves have them. End all tech sell to them. Stop all trade with them. Black list them and let them do business with the Russians and India, China.
