At the very least, if Russia somehow wins, they will have tired themselves out so much in the process that a gentle breeze would destroy whatâ€™s left of them. However, I agree that this probably signals the beginning of the end of the war in favor of Ukraine, especially since I imagine this will only embolden nations to contribute more equipment.
I prefer to see this new supply of tanks as the start of a new trend to mechanize and invigorate the Ukrainian Army with new technologies that will allow the Ukrainians to overwhelm the Russians on an operational scale rather than just the tactical level.
If the Ukrainians can confirm to their suppliers that they can use and maintain these tanks effectively in the war, it will make it easier to convince their allies to send enough tanks to form a proper Brigade with rotating units and fighter jets that will allow Ukraine to control the skies, so instead of relying on Russian incompetence and foreign aid, they can truly turn their military into something self sustaining on par with their Western counterparts.
