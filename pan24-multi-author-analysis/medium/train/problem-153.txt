Russia has a unique prison and criminal culture due to the gulags in the Soviet days in many gulags gangs of prisoners were pay to help quell the growing rebellion’s from the other prisoners after the Soviet got rid of most of their gulags many of theses gangs stayed together making a business smuggling in western products to The ussr. After the fall of the ussr these now criminal empires gained vastly more power and now have large sway over the Russian government. I not so sure how much criminal’s dislike the current Russian government seeing how corrupt it is though it probably depends on the person.
Did you see the thing about the head of Wagner wanting to set up a "cocks" division for his soldiers? Apparently he thinks he can gay shame his soldiers into performing better.
Conscripting sex offenders (currently exempt from the prison mobilization apparently, but I did not bother to vet the sources).
Possibly conscripting women (though this has been very rare everywhere historically, though they apparently have drafted some women in occupied areas).
