It basically is impossible because it requires either believing that beliefs you hold in your head (in the present) are false, which is by definition not possible because beliefs are (again, by definition) claims we find "true," with some probability, or believing in no moral claims, which is kind of ridiculous. For example, say a person holds a set of moral beliefs X. If they believe that moral relativism is true, then that means ... they can't believe that beliefs in the set X are true because that would mean that people who hold a set of moral beliefs that contradict X would be wrong. So, a person who is a moral relativist basically can't believe anything is moral or immoral... which is very unlikely. It's much more likely that they are a) lying, or b) not lying, but they just don't realize that they're incorrectly describing their own views. I think b) is very, very usually the case.
It's closer to 5k, but ya.. divorce for the rich. It's so stupid. The whole reason they don't allow people to get divorced is the catholic church.. and I somehow doubt God is not okay with divorce but will be perfectly fine with annulment which is just divorce with a different name.
