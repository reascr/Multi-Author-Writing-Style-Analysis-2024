Yeah, this is the reality, China NEEDS a globalized world. A huge part of its original unrest was this very issue exactly. And the yellow River is only going to get crazier as the years progress. Thatâ€™s the reality of all this shut going on. Destabilizing regions a la Russia is just a bad idea. The West has learned this at the cost of huge debt, and now Russia is learning this first hand at the cost of lives. For China this would be EVEN greater as the blockade of China would be far easier for the US. Even the victory in Ukraine ,who is now basically now a kind of Israel in Eastern Europe for the US and Latin America for Europe in general, means that Ukrainian Wheat and natural resources are effectively allied to the west. This is a huge power play for the west, and arguably too early in the climate change cycle for the greening pastures of Russia to matter.
That is a really good point, but at least in the immediate future you will still need boots on the ground to hold positions imo. But give it 50+ years and that may not even be necessary.
Kind of have to read between the lines. What china really means is "don't lob a nuke or talk about lobbing a nuke". Russia participating in a nuclear exchange isn't a scenario they want to confront.
