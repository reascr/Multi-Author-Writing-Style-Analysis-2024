If the greatest effect of some situation is what the advocates do, then the situation is not a compelling situation and does not deserve immediate public thought. We know with climate change, the effects are slow and essentially invisible. You physically cannot make someone suddenly feel like there is a crisis when life literally does not change for them other than you pestering them. Petition the politicians when your solution is legislation. When that gets ignored, campaign for better politicians in a way that actually helps you get votes instead of pissing people off.
If you detest people who illegally block traffic and think this is a worthy cause to protest against, should you do it as dramatically and confrontationally as possible by inconveniencing their lives to the maximum possible degree?
"Coco had pleaded guilty to seven charges including using or modifying an authorised explosive not as prescribed and resisting a police offer during arrest.".
She's not in jail for blocking traffic. She's in for admiting to breaking Australia's weapon laws. Don't fall for clickbate titles (and don't plea guilty to crimes you didn't do).
