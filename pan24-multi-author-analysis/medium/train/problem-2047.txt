Honestly I don't think you're entirely wrong, the Panther has only been in development for 4-6 years (components since 2016, system level development began in 2018). So far, they've been using the tried-and-tested Leo 2A4 hull, layered in passive armour, reactive armour as well as their modular APS panels on top, so only the turret is really new - and feature like a launcher for loitering munition and such.
Rheinmetall just bought Expal, one of Europe's largest producer of all kinds of ammunition, for $1.24 billion. They're also building a new ammunition plant in Germany that will by June deliver 300,000 FAPDS Gepard rounds worth approx. $300 million to resupply the Gepards operating in Ukraine. If they can produce that many of the rather complicated FAPDS shells in half a year, I don't see why they should not be able to build a second production line for 130mm tank ammo there as well. They'd certainly have access to all manner of components and propellants now that they own Expal.
We're almost certainly getting a Tiger reboot at some point. Naming tanks after animals that lean into it's role (MBT = Apex predator for example) is just one of the extremely few traditions that was started by the Nazis but never abandoned.
