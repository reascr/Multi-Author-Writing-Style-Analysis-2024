Also, great account, created 3 months ago, started posting 2-3 hours ago and regurgitating other people's comments.
So for PR they speak about how much Putin is a threat for entire world piece, but in reality only ready to give some leftowers to fight him, and would rather use the systems for collecting dust because they clearly don't have big enough military budget to cover it.
Piorun MANPADs shot down almost half a billion dollars in Russian equipment, US army is interested in them as they have a low minimum altitude and longer range than Stingers. Ukraine was using our air-to-air missiles to shot down cruise missiles that Russia sent as well as using them in regular fights against russian jets.
the only system in the world thats comparable is the S-500 in theory and how true thats in praxis is a different story.
Better than nothing I guess. Ukraine received and bought some additional IRIS-T that is supposed to replace Patriots and for some reason there wasn't any problem with it.
Not just that & the whole US approval issue, Patriot batteries stationed in Poland will actually survive the war.
Those in Ukraine quite likely wouldn't, along with their German/Polish staff. So PiS wants to have several cakes & eat them, too.
Why? It's AA system goddamnit. Why can't we have it to protect civillians? You can't NOT look bad when making such desisions lol, because it becomes obvious that ending conflict is not in their interests.
