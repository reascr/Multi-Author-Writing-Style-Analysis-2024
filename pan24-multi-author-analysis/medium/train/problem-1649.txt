EDIT: To be clear, since trolls are playing bullshit gotcha games, I'm saying they should provide evidence that he previously CLAIMED this status, before the shooting. I don't care what his actual status is one way or another beyond that. If he did claim it before, fine, but if he's only claiming it now, it's probably to get out of a hate crime charge. Whatever the case may be, his actual status as non-binary or binary doesn't make him any less of a shit head and he should get the absolute max sentencing, which is at the heart of my point.
I hope he has evidence to back that up, because so far it looks like he's just angling to avoid hate crime charges.
Yeah, someone else said that. Maybe, idk. It’s odiously an individual who’s sick in the head. They likely would have no problem abusing a system for their advantage.
I don't give a fuck what your pronouns are but you specifically attacked a group out of hate. They will rot in prison and be convicted of a hate crime.
