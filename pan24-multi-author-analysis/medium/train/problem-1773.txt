2. Release them. They will tell everyone about the horrid conditions of their imprisonment. That will cause the people to hate the regime even more.
I mean, I sure fucking hope the people of Iran succeed. But we can’t act like the government doesn’t have an out.
3. Keep them in prison indefinitely. The abuse will continue and that will cause the people to hate the regime even more.
They can mow their people down, true, but they are raising a generation of people that bitterly hate them. They tried and failed 2 years ago at a terrible cost. They will have to be downright draconian to pull it off in full view of the world. How far are these bastards willing to go?
4.	Keep killing until the people brave enough to protest/revolt are dead. Give the people still alive the chance to live and go back to “normal” if they stop protesting.
HK was bad but it wasn't Tiananmen bad, or, the optics weren't as bad anyway. I don't think Iran starts mowing everyone down, the internet doesn't forget anymore.
The camera doesn't lie. I recognize the very real possibility that the regime may retain power through brutal means, but it's behavior is on full display for the world to see. This has implications both internal and external.
