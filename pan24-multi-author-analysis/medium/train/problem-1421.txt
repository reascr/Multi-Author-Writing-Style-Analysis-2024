Russia’s unilateral ceasefire to allow soldiers to celebrate Orthodox Christmas officially began at noon Moscow time, according to Russian state TV.
At noon today, the ceasefire regime came into force on the entire contact line. It will continue until the end of 7 January.
Hey dude, I just want to let you know that I’m not going to insult you, and I hope you’ll do the same….
Some are legitimate targets, some may be targeted with bad intel, and some may just be misses due to not top of the line guidance tech.

Indeed, at the beginning of the war, Ukraine discouraged civilians from leaving the metropolitan areas, in some ways helping to create the civilian casualties.
