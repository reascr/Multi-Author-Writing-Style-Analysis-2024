While 2016 and 2020 are different ist was glaringly obvious in 2016 he was a lying narcissist who had nobodys intrests at heart but his own and couldn't string a thought together. Anyone who ever voted for him was fooled by a walking caricature of a con man. I still am baffled americans fell for it.
