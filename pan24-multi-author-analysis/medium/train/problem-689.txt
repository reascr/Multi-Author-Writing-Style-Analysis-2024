These recruits are nothing but meat for the grinder. You have a better chance at that billion dollar lottery in the USA, than any recruited Russian prison inmates have of surviving this shit.
Edit: realistically the odds of them surviving six months in Ukraine are probably the same as ten years in a russian gulag. Not good, but why not get it over with?
Notice how large the jackpots are? Because they changed the rules and expanded the range of possible numbers, reducing the already insane odds of winning to half, something like 1 in 140M before to 1 in 300M now.
I would like to think I am special enough that I could possibly win, but I don't want to be a part of that. Too many people get caught up in it.
I guess we are different. I don't blow a weeks pay on the lottery, but i know the difference between a long shot and no chance and it's less than a cup of coffee.
And I would not serve for Wagner because murdering Ukrainians would be a poor way to absolve my sins, but maybe I would agree to go if I thought I could sabotage the Russia efforts somehow (before they have me killed).
I wouldn't murder to absolve my sins, but if i were locked down I'd take any chance to walk free under the stars and when i saw my chance I'd kill anyone who got between me and freedom regardless of their uniform.
I assume that if they survive the first tour with arms and legs still usable, they are forced back again, why would they be let go only after six months when they already short of soldiers.
