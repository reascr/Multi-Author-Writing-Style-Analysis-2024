Okay everyone, thanks for all the downvotes for asking a simple question. Maybe I should have posted this in the no stupid question forum. From the explanation in this article I still don’t see how specifically requiring an ID to vote is discriminatory. What I see is a bunch of voter disenfranchisement laws such as restricting early voting and mail in ballots etc. lumped into a “voter I’d” law. And I agree that these unfairly targets African American and democratic voters. What is stopping anyone from getting an ID? You need one to purchase alcohol, fly etc. are there large populations of people that don’t have an ID?
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
