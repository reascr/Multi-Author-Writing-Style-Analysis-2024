People talk about how the GOP underperformed in the midterms, but I think the opposite is true. They managed to take the house and nearly the Senate despite having ZERO policy or platform. That's astounding. If they had even one policy, they'd have easily taken supermajorities in both the house and Senate. Trump got his feelings hurt by desantis outperforming the trump backed candidates by a landslide in the midterms. Desantis has already said that he won't run for office if trump is running, so I don't think he will. Instead, I think trump will offer desantis to be his running mate so that way desantis can officially be in a less powerful position than Trump and trump can stroke his own ego over it. Nobody ever really liked pence that much, but they adore desantis.
