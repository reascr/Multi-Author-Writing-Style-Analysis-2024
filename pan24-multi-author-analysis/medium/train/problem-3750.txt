You mean a government that recently had protesters try to overturn an election is offering support for another government facing protesters of thier own?
The congress refused to recognize the will of the people, repeatedly tried to oust the democratically elected president on dubious grounds to the point that the government couldn't function, then he was ousted when he tried to put the kibosh on this whole shit-show, by dissolving parliament and moving towards elections... like any functioning democracy does when they have a hung parliament.
And now the people that seized power ("to prevent a coup" - lmfao!) are refusing to hold elections... because, why?
Sorry, I've heard everything I need to know. This American-backed coup against a leftist government in Latin America has about as much democratic merit as every other American-backed coup against leftist governments in Latin America.
It pretty much does, no country is going to support a popular overthrow of a government. The list of people the US doesnt support is much shorter than than the ones we do. The US government has barely said shit about Iran and that is a much worse situation and a hostile country to boot.
