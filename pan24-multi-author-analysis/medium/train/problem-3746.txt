Environmental justice won't come without economic justice. Economic justice can't come with the amount of special interests entrenched in our political systems. To excise them we need national strikes that shut down and destroy national economies. Do the people have the will to do this? Probably not.
I mean that it sounds like it will create problems eventually. When you say 'economic model', what do you mean? Are you referring to the intentions of some or all groups? some ideology? Or are you referring to an error and chain of problems due to greed, for which nations need healing rather than farther bouts of destruction.
Is that what Capitalism does? That system seems to shuffle goods and half-goods around. It's Greed that sets out to fixate on a single parameter. Without that, 'Capitalism' would be different.
Greed clouds the eyes, drives the person to push for 'profit in spite of everything else,' and leaves them subject to tilting and falling and chasing imbalance. That's what prevents teamwork; circumvents research and development; creates violence and disparities and poverty and other details you may be critical of.
Yes, profit is expected (due to coordination within market dynamics; essentially teamwork). That's supposed to get reinvested (R&D). Such a system is not problematic.
