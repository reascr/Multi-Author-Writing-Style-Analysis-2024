US only needed to tell them to soften their stance in order to appease conservatives complaining about a "blank check" after Russia pushed heavy propaganda here. It was a simple, "at least we tried" and never expected Ukraine to actually negotiate.
This is a war in the best interests of all allied nations and it's gonna be wayyyy cheaper than waging it with Russia directly.
You keep referring to the allied nations which is funny since back during WW2 where that term was coined, Ukrainian national heros who helped found the independent state of Ukraine were definitely not on the side of the allies.
Negotiate at the Russian border, Ukrainians on the Ukrainian side, and Russians on the Russian side.
I assume negotiations will have to happen at some point. Unless they think they can overthrow the Russian Government which is highly unlikely. However, Russia is now on the back foot, it makes sense to push them back to improve any eventual negotiation. If we get to a natural stalemate then it makes sense to negotiate.
It's important to not only drain Russia of their power and energy, but to also never back down from terrorism, and no one but the Ukrainian people should decide to negotiate and the terms of those negotiations.
