That’s a fair point. I was watching a video on how Obama started it by supporting SA as a way to placate them. At the end of the day these people are the ones voiceless and suffering.
As a non western person this brings to light to me how much political dialogue is influenced by “winning parties “.
The reality is indeed tragic, a civil war over existing ethnic and religious divides, exploited by Iran, and then exploited by Saudi Arabia as an extension of the conflict between Iran and KSA.
Party politics definitely matters for some things, but when it comes to how the US acts in the Middle East and North Africa... there is less of a distinction. I think the last time there was real policy divergence was probably under the Bush (W) admin, where I think a Democrat in the same position would have been unlikely to invade Iraq. The drone program for example has been equally popular under Republican and Democrat administrations, and has only ever increased over time.
For someone in the region affected, the difference between a Bush or an Obama is probably thin enough to strangle on.
Geopolitics is a tough subject. Yes I agree on the ground no one cares. I wish people of that country were more educated on what they have done too.
Same with British educating the next generation on the matter of colonization and my own country as well. We should be less gullible to propaganda.
