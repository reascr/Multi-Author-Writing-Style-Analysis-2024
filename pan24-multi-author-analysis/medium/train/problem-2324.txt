Get republicans to bite, try to get them to do something stupid like run an impeachment trial, then if Trump is restored to office it’s immediate ammunition. Insurance for democrats, especially if Biden decides he doesn’t want to run for a second term.

I doubt he going to get charged. He return the documents as soon as they found them. He will be fine. He will get pummeled politically but legally he is fine.
That is not how it work. Biden returned the documents as soon as they were discovered- he get slap on risk.
If Trump returned the documents when requested- he would gotten same slap on the wrist. Trump lied and obstructed justice - that is the problem.
Sure they will make this Hillary emails 2.0 - best ignore them - why are we letting control the narrative? Who care what they think.
If DOJ and Jack Smith think Trump committed a crime. They will charge him - Biden has nothing to do with. GOP would be hysterical regardless.
