Sad story all around. The poor girl has probably been dead for years, and this person is obviously struggling with her own trauma. Hope she will be ok.
I'm pretty sure it's false but maybe it'll help the woman claiming that she might possibly be McCann. It seems as if her childhood was very traumatic. I don't think it will blow up in the media though because she's been claiming this since at least 2021 and it's only been picked up by small outlets and tabloids.
In this article, she specifically mentions early childhood memories she should have of her mum and her stepdad and her dad. It'd be a bit odd not to mention if she'd been adopted at the same time.
I don't understand how none of them have offered a DNA test. That she says she can't afford. I think 23 and me could probably end it pretty quickly.
She claims that the McCanns have agreed to do a DNA test but she could be spinning. Based on comparison of looks alone I don't see any reason to do a DNA test and neither would the parents of the missing child.
She could do a DNA test with her own mother and if the result is not a match proceed from there. The McCanns have been through enough already with previous claimants.
