She should be Vice President right now but the democrats were afraid she would be vulnerable to birthed attacks, instead we’re stuck with useless Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris hasn't been useless. She has in most cases been trapped in Washinon in order to be the tie-breaking vote to pass the Democrat agenda and stop Republican tomfuckery. She hasn't been able to do much else because doing what she had been has been so essential.
Doesn't matter who you are. If you're a birther, Her family has most likely been in the country for hell of a lot longer than York says.
If we end up keeping Georgia and pickup Nevada, we will have an extra vote of breathing room, and you might see her doing more besides that.
Compared to what the vice presidency has become she is useless. Dick Cheney & Mike Pence ran the government with Bush and Trump being the person to sign the bills.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
No, her critics. Being a birther means accusing someone of not being born in the US to non-American parents because they're not white.
And that’s the problem. The midterms have democrats feeling big for their britches thinking people will vote for Kamala no matter what but the reality is she will get creamed by Trump or Desantis. She is a zero charisma candidate like Gore Kerry and Clinton and we know what happened to them.
