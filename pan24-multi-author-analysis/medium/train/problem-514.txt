Think about it, we are arguably in a more overall progressive time period, but I truly believe we wouldn't be able to get anti-segregation/civil rights bills passed into todays congress. That issue with our present congress itself is nuanced, but it still begs the question "what is different now?". Both party's have utterly given up on reaching out across party lines, and extending an olive branch. We are beholden to our party's respective zealots. Now, passing any bill (however sensical it may be) is rejected based solely on party affiliation. The only way to correct that is appealing democratic candidates in neutral/right leaning states (no effort is being made there outside the truly important ones). Sweeping out all the kyrsten sinemas and joe manchins would help too. Getting a rep in every single possible democratic stronghold of a red state is key. Getting more democratic governors is key too. Hell, maybe we just need to start offering Californians incentives, and bus them across the country's red sea to relocate... (lol).
