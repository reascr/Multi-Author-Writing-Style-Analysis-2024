They’ve got me talking about how useless, and counter productive their efforts are. 900 vehicles by 4 tires, that potentially 3600 tires will head into landfill, well before their life is up. So now we need to truck 3600 tires to get them replaced. Tow 900 cars to a garage to get the tires changed. Its almost $720,000 of property damage (at $200 a tire, which is close to a budget price tire) so thats the “minimum” please tell me that the greenhouse gas emissions from trucking, manufacturing, and taking the tires to their final resting place is less than the emissions by just leaving those tires inflated. Also - tire ranges from 15-25 pounds each, so 3600 tires at call it 20 pounds is 76,000 POUNDS of garbage. Super good for the environment right?
Yes, it does sound reasonable. Rebellion is not the same as righteousness. You claim to know they are just righteous? Because that DOES sound ridiculous.
I do find it far-fetched to imagine that anyone wants nothing more than to be an asshole and feel righteous while doing it. Whether they are right or not, pretty much everyone is the hero of their own story and most people tend to want something good for the world.
