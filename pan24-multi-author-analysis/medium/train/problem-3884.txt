But I’ll submit this: Why, at seemingly every critical moment, do Democrats find a way to back down from something or give up? Remember the nonsense with the Parliamentarian and the minimum wage hike? Remember when nobody bought that ridiculous bid so instead Sinema “out of the blue” decides to vote no? What about the infrastructure bill they let Joe Manchin kneecap? Why can’t they ever just cross the finish line when they have the opportunity? So often they get right there, only to either throw their hands up and say “we tried, sorry” or find some new obstacle to put in the way of achieving progress. Republicans just want to cause as much chaos and violence as possible and have no interest in governing. Democrats can do A LOT better, going forward.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
