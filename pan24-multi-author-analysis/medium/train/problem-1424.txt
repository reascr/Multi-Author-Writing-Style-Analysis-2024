It's not a major news story anymore. And if Democrats get aggressive when responding to the GOP's bullshit everyone will clutch their pearls about how sad the state of politics is or "Look at how terrible the Democrats are for calling Republicans fascists." Which is out of context because it's not necessarily the electorate, but the GOP politicians that are fascists. I'm pretty sure that a good chunk of their base just doesn't get it that they're supporting fascism. The ones that do are complicit (most likely the wealthy) are just looking to exploit whatever pro rich asshole policies the GOP passes.
