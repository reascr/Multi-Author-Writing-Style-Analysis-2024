Either way even if the US gets involved directly, that might make it no longer proxy by textbook definition, but it would still be the US effectively relying on TW to do the bulk of the fighting against the US's greatest adversary, or the US using another nation to attack it's enemies (and I don't want to make it sound overly manipulative, because obviously both Ukraine and Taiwan desperately want the aid of the west, and the west wants to aid them, but there is truth to the US wanting to use other nations to do the fighting if at all possible while instead supporting them financially...).
Yeah, I think that's a fair complaint, but also one that's hard to reconcile against military need - you want your combat solutions to be both cost effective and technically capable against peer competitors, and most environmentally-friendly systems fail the first one (if not also the second.).
Correct. For a while they, or Duterte, had been pivoting to closer ties to China even after China infringed on their waters likely because they he was paid off.
