This is different than the classification argument. But the same argument. It’s about whether certain documents are Presidential or personal records. Yes, he’s claiming in a court filing that the President can choose which documents are Presidential and which are personal by mere personal decision of the President. No, that argument won’t hold up in court because it would nullify the Presidential Records Act by rendering it useless.
