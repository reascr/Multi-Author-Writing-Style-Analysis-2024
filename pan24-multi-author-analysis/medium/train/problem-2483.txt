American here. They could have gone very wrong ordering the F/A-18. The Super Hornet is good, but even the US Navy acknowledges the Super Hornet is a mature airframe with a limited future. Whatever India orders needs to be capable of accepting upgrades and remaining viable for decades in the future. That immediately rules out the Super Hornet.
India is largely pushing hard for domestic production at this point. They have their own in Tejas and have a few models out now. Obviously its not as mature as Hornet or Rafale yet but that will remain their MO going forward. Home grown military industrial complex.
In the article it's stated that the order is a stopgap measure to fill a capability hole, so either aircraft would've done fine while waiting for another aircraft to be developed. It will either be domestically produced or the European replacement for the Rafale (so around 10-15 years).
Plus they need to build their military up as they increasingly live in a dangerous neighbourhood. Pakistan is a failed state with nukes, and China seems intent on being an asshole to everyone.
Su 35 is not up to fighting anything the west would throw it’s way. They don’t really have a great path forward on jet development to get anything better. Especially when so heavily sanctioned, they kinda need the foreign currency from jet/general military junk sales to pay for upgrades and bribes. That is going to drop substantially going forward.
Not going to happen. India will never rely on US for key military capabilities. US policies change with every election cycle, simply not reliable. Not to mention they do not do technology transfer and that is its own congressional approval cycle hell.
They do use some US capabilities in terms of helicopters (military and civilian) but fighter jet will likely not be from US.
