Governments should not be immune to criticism, in fact in light of it, governments able to weather the storm and adapt can become stronger and more viable.
That said, this is the same Amnesty Int'l that blamed UA's for civilian deaths in UA, accusing them of thus causing an increase in UA civilian deaths. Never once blaming the aggressor sending the bombs or committing actual human rights violations/atrocities.

Used to carry a lot of respect worldwide, now they are the equivalent of PETA but with perhaps less of a worthy reputation. Just gross.
