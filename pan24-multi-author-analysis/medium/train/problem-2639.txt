The bradley is an effective anti-tank vehicle, it’s a great anti-personnel vehicle, it can carry troops, its fast, it’s easily maintained, and it’s comfortable compared to soviet IFVs and AFVs. It can almost certainly take on any tank the Russians are fielding.

Bradleys are very good vehicles, easily one of the most successful armored fighting vehicles of the modern age. This is bad news for the russians, and the kind of vehicle ukraine has been asking for.
And maybe more importantly, Bradleys will help Ukrainian infantry keep pace with their tanks during assaults and breakthroughs, and also come with sweet optics that can be a huge asset for reconnaissance and target spotting for artillery and drones.
