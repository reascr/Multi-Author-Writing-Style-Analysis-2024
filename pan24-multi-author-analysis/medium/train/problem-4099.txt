US nuclear subs already chilling in the South Pacific carrying 24 Trident D5s per sub with 8 independently targetable Mk-5 RVs per missile:
The point is that China isn't going to use a DF-41 because they're not suicidal and don't want their country to literally cease to exist.
They want to get their entire arsenal up to 1500 by 2035. That's cute. The US already has over 1600 strategically deployed and an additional 3700 in the stockpile.
that's why I said 1500 is not enough as a deterrent against military action/intervention. They would need to at least reach nuclear parity with the US. It also depends on how much of the population and cities the US is willing to lose in that conflict. Apparently in the Cold War, the US would consider the scenario where they wipe out 100% of the Soviet population but lose 75% to be a victory.
Can China cause enough civilian casualties or wipe out enough cities that the US would not consider that particular war worth fighting?
They also know, for all of their recent posturing, that they can't win a conventional war against the US. Which is exactly why nothing will come of any of the recent back and forth. As the comment that you originally replied to so eloquently put it, they ain't ready to start shit. And they know that they ain't ready to start shit. So they won't. China will keep pretending that their spy balloon wasn't a spy balloon and threatening vague consequences, the US will continue to do exercises and emphasize their combat readiness against any threat of aggression. In a couple of months, when the news cycle has moved on, Blinken will have his visit and we'll stay in the same relative status quo that we have been in for decades.
It frankly doesn't matter. No matter how many warheads China gets, they already know that the US has enough to turn them into dust and echoes and therefore will never launch them at the US.
