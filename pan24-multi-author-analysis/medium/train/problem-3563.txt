They see this now as a test of endurance. Russia is counting on being able to suffer for longer in order to get their way, and are communicating that to the world. They genuinely believe that, at a certain point, western societies won’t tolerate drops in quality of life like Russians will, and at that point, they’ll either negotiate on favorable terms or cease military and financial support.
The longer this lasts the looser economic ties between Europe and Russia will become (energy included). While madly buying LNG elsewhere, Europe is boosting renewables investment. Economic value chains are reset to the detriment of Russia.
Meanwhile, the US is getting to weaken Russia for a fraction of the price of its failed attempt to control Afghanistan. The Afghan effort was affordable for 20 years. Politically, only a handful of western volunteers die in Ukraine while the military-industrial complex rubs its hands with glee. Any elected official with military production assets in its electorate will take this into account when deciding if it’s too painful.
Don't underestimate their stupidity, they will keep pushing in more young men until they run out of them. They are probably ready to call up million more souls to die for their goals.
