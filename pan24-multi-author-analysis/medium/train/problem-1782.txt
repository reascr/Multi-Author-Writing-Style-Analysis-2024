My family plays that you can put down whatever you want. Anyone can challenge it if they want to. If it isn't in the Scrabble dictionary then you lose a turn, if it is in the dictionary then the person who challenged you incorrectly loses a turn.
“Earlier, it was reported that the wives of the killed occupiers from the "DPR" [self-proclaimed and non-recognised Donetsk People's Republic in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine – ed.] received 21 fur coats. The widows of the killed have lined up in the video in order to express their gratitude for "help". The voiceover stated that fur coats were provided by "Russian activists".
Who knows, maybe they will make them down the line. Or (fingers crossed) a movie trilogy covering the last 3 books. They announced they'll be covering Persepolis Rising and Tiamat's Wrath in a comics form.
Yeah, the historic aspect I imagine has a real connotation since they were fighting for survival in WWII. But here it's completely misdirected as Russia was nowhere near being invaded, on the contrary, relations were good with the EU.
But later it became known that the women's fur coats were taken away from them after the filming of the video with gratitude.”.
