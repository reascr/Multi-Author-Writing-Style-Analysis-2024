It’s about the next one for the advertisers. If so many people boycott this one (which I doubt), then advertisers may be less likely to dump money into ads people might not even see. Boycotting this one won’t have that effect though because the World Cup moves, and it’s novelty is that it’s only once every four years. People will forget about the details of this one, except to say that it was corrupt and had human rights violations. It will have zero impact on the next one, and therefore boycotting it won’t impact fifa or the advertisers at all. For what it’s worth, I believe the games should have been moved when all the people at fifa involved with this one were arrested and charged with corruption, but it wasn’t. I also believe Qatar should have been given the chance to fulfill their human rights pledges, but there should have been back up plans for when they couldn’t. I don’t agree with shaming the players for doing their part of the deal. This is exactly why the execs of fifa made the call to give it to Qatar, because it’s too big of a tourney to just stop it in its tracks.
People seem to be missing that she is pointedly using their own words because everyone knows they were, and are, liars.
Because of slavery. Dramatically brings down the average when you count all the people who are basically forced into labor for nothing.
