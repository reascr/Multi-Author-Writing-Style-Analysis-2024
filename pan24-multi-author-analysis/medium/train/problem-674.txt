Well, I guess we'll know in a couple of days if they're lying again or if they actually shot this one down. Either way, it's impressive that Ukraine keeps getting their drones that deep into Russian territory and that close to a high-security base. The first one could be a fluke, but the second one, even if they shot it down, shows that Ukraine can hit sensitive facilities at a distance. I know that I'd be disturbed if say, Mexico was consistently drone striking air bases in Colorado or something. This has to feel similar to the Russians, and it's why you don't invade Ukraine, or Mexico for that matter. .
All we can do is be vigilant and debunk their arguments when they appear. Otherwise, Russia's narrative will get stronger.
It's working on the political extremists that were predisposed to like Russia: the far right that likes Russia's "traditional Christian values", and the far left that likes Russia's "standing up to 'Western imperialism' and restoring the Russian sphere of influence.".
