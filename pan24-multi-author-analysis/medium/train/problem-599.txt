it is bizarre how the GOP media (Fox, CNN, ABC et al) have trumped up the East Palestine train wrecks as Biden's fault.
GOP'er Trump was elected by the East Palestinians by over 72% to remove EPA rules, remove NHSTA rules, remove FEMA help which lead to the wreck and limited Federal response to investigating causes of the wreck.
I thought the whole point was to affect them and everyone else with less taxes and more freedom to have train wrecks and spew toxic chemicals into air and water.
