The genocide doesn't bother me unless it's happening here or if we're the one's causing it (We have enough problems at home with the treatment of PoC and LGBT people that we need to address). I can't worry about everyone all over world, and what other countries do to each other. I care very little for other countries democracies and problems. We need to secure our own oxygen masks before we can help others and things are kinda screwed up here. I tend to keep to myself and try not butt into other's lives. I've lived in this home for over 8 years and it's a point of pride that I don't know the names of my neighbors. The way I see it, I like my neighbors. Why would I ruin that by getting to know them? I take the same approach to our neighbors worldwide.
