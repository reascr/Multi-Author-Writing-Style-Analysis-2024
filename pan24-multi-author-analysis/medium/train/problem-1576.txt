I mean as an Indian we remember quite well when the US not only appeased but actively supported the second largest genocide since WW2 and threatened us with war when we tried to intervene against said genocide. The only reason we did manage to intervene against the genocide was because the Soviets said they'd have our backs if the US intervened.
India’s government has no useful input whatsoever, ever. They just open their mouths and hope something smart comes out. Like this imbecile of an official, suggesting Ukraine return to diplomacy, after the countless Russian atrocities on innocent Ukrainians, raping children, woman, men, the abductions and forced orphaning, chemical weapon use, the Russian soldier that cut off a Ukrainians dick and filmed it, etc etc. I’m sure the shit coming out of her mouth would turn to liquid gold real quick were Russia invading India instead.
India hasn't really played such a role yet since there's been no negotiations but would make a lot of sense as we have good relations with both the West and Russia.
In addition due to aforementioned good relations with both sides, India has served as something as an intermediary for the West and Russia since the war started.
