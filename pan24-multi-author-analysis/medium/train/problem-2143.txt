The real reason these executions go bad is that the proper drugs to "do it right" are manufactured in other countries, and because they know what we'll use it for they won't sell it to federal or state governments. So these states are trying to wing it using alternate drugs that don't work well for killing.
A guy at work stuck his head in a nitrogen filled tank, immediately passed out and fell backward. When he woke up he said he didn't remember a thing. He was lucky because even though he passed out he wasn't brain dead so his breathing response was still working and his next breath brought in a lungful of oxygen rich air.
The air we breathe is already 78% Nitrogen, which is classified as an because it has no toxic effect on the body by itself, but if the pure gas is inhaled it will displace all the oxygen in the lungs and cause suffocation. This is different than carbon dioxide (CO2) which is also an asphyxiant when the pure gas is inhaled (causing suffocation), but also toxic because breathing it in lower concentrations , causing unease and illness.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is also a non-toxic asphyxiant when a high concentration of the gas is breathed, and is the reason many people accidently die when they run engines indoors for a lenh of time.
