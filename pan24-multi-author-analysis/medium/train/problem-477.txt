Different pipeline but within the Keystone portfolio. A side note, no major media report on the multiples of train derailments carrying oil. Because pipeline leaks are rare, they get more coverage.
Safer in what sense? Because they definitely do more damage to the environments, are harder and more expensive to clean up and are more damaging to our water supply. Safer in the sense that pipelines don't have crews traveling with the thing being transported? Sure.
Sorry about that. Yeah I missed that and now I'm to lazy to go find the US gov data. The demand for oil will be consistent for many years.
According to the US Department of Transportation, pipelines are the safest way to transport energy. Statistics from the National Transportation Safety Board show pipelines make up less than one one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%) of all transportation accidents in the U.S.. Safer for people and the environment.
What I do know is that a pipeline incident has a much larger environmental impact than a rail incident.
I do hope we continue to find safer replacements for oil and gas. Until we do, the safest transportation should be allowed.
It might be because they were allowed to pump more then what was originally allowed for the pipeline.
An arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation oversees pipeline safety and permitted TC Energy to have greater pressures on the Keystone system because the company used pipe made from better steel.
But, more than that, out of the many reasons people didn't want it, one of the absolute last would be that 'they (Canadians) don't maintain their shit'.
Well, it's not like nuclear. The oil is transported whether you like it or not. We should choose the safest way to move it. Trucks moving it contains more risk, trail cars have less risk and pipelines are the least risky.
