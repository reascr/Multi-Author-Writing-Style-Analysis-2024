I’d like to ask these republicans, blaming biden for inflation, how corporations making record profits ties into that. In fact can anyone explain that? Also, is biden responsible for inflation happening all around the world? Because it’s happening. This is their reasoning for “punting” the budget until they have more power. Because of “bidens inflation”. Goes to show you how disingenuous these asshats are and how it’s really just about power and making biden look bad, never about what’s best for the american people.
