Germany is considering this from an economic lens. Currently they have no problem selling the Leapard 2 tanks. But if too many are destroyed or they should suffer some performance issues during combat, this can hurt future sales. That’s why they want the USA to send American tanks. They know that the Russians will want to instantly destroy at least a few US Abrams tanks for propaganda value, giving a bit more safety to the Leopard tanks. Also, any performance issues can be viewed in comparison to the (known) inefficiencies and heavy maintenance requirements of the Abrams. But the Abrams is so inefficient that it’s impractical to even send them to a war in which the US does not have troops and logistic support people in the battle field. So it doesn’t make any sense to send. Germany is cursed by having built more efficient and practical tanks and selling a large number— now people actually want to use them.
They just want that all of NATO pulls on this together and the decision to send MBTs to Ukraine is carried out by all the big NATO states.
Yes call them „cowards“ or what you want but you won’t get Germany to get into Wehrmacht-Mode or anything that resembles any kind of leading military power or supplier anymore. Sorry to say but these times are over. At least for the next years to decades.
