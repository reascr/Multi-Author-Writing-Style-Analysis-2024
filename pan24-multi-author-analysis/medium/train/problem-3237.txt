Like any other place on the planet, really. This is why it was so offensive when Trump referred to developing countries as "shitholes", it was a horrible insult, and completely hypocritical given the problems faced in the United States. Wholesale pilfering of public land by the oligarchs, for example, mining, timber, grazing, theft of resources, undrinkable water supplies in some places, crumbling bridges and roadways, the homeless sleeping in camps on the street corners of hallowed cities.
>The countries of the region have made little progress in building effective, environmentally sound trash disposal systems despite seeking membership in the European Union and adopting some of the EU's laws and regulations.
believe it or not there is much, much bigger problem with that watershed ... it is a disused gold mine Stolice, which has a huge reservoir of toxic sludge (cyanide, arsen, mercury) deteriorating and threatening to burst into the drina river (upstream to danube and shit lot of people, mind you).
there are open unattended waste dumps upstream and every time you have major rain this happens. but it's ok mate, when it comes up to their necks they'll just move to another planet... oh!
Yes, even here in Quebec, Canada we have places where it really is a different world. It just feels out of place to see these thing happens but at the same time education is not the same everywhere, even in the same country.
