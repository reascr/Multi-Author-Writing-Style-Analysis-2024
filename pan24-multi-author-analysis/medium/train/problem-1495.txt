At what point do we admit that nothing will be done and start preparing for the inevitable results of global warming.
People I know from the field (academics in environmental science) are already admitting it behind closed doors. Unless there are major technological breakthroughs in a lot of different fields, we are boned. That or we all universally agree that businesses and politicians aren't really doing and aren't going to do anything serious about it and somehow over turn them, and also accept that we are all going to have to lower our standards of living by a significant amount (baring those technological breakthroughs).
This assumes that a majority of people would accept significant reductions in standard of living and not just overturn the new politicians and business leaders. I think the global response to the pandemic shows otherwise. A majority of people will tolerate some restrictions for a little while, but given the choice, they will go back to normal as soon as possible.
This is something people tend to gloss over. Blame companies all you want, but at the end of the day they're just providing you with all the crap you don't need but you think you do.
