Mainly politics, I suspect. My brother used to work at a northern radar base a long time ago and was telling me that foreign jets routinely enter Canadian air space to test if we're watching. They were usually escorted out without fuss, but not in such a predictable pattern that whey would know exactly when they had been detected. Sometimes, Canada would do the same to Russia. The general public isn't aware of all the little dances done by the air force of every country. Recently though, a particular balloon dance has been widely publicized and everybody want to hear what's happening and what our officials are doing. For political reasons then, it's important to demonstrate air power by shooting stuff down, to reassure people that we can do it if necessary. It's not usually deemed necessary.
I'm especially curious, since they said it was a silver cylindrical object. The hell could that be? They said not a balloon, but what is a "balloon," I guess? Can't wait to hear more about the wreckages, especially from the one in Alaska.
Edit 2.5 Montana was not a false alarm, it showed back up on radar over Michigan today and was shot down.
