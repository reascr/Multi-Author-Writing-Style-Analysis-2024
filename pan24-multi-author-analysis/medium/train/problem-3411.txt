Banning war criminals guilty of the downing of civillian airliner, accused of the crime of genocide and 60,000 other crimes like child rape, torture, and targeting non-combattants would be a good start.
Not that banning embezzling sporting officials trying to enrich themselves is not important, let's just put things in perspective.
What a fantastically stupid thing to say. It's a sport enjoyed by millions, why would you want to deprive people of that?
The FIA suck ass and we shouldn't be racing in some places, but that's hardly got anything to do with the average fan.
Speaking as a lifelong fan, no we would not simply "move on". No other sport quite captures the same sense of speed and adrenaline and marries it with the moving history of that championship. In short, a lot of people have emotional ties to F1 and that isn't something which would just go away.
The Olympics events and the general system is good. It's the invitees that should not be from coutries actively destroying the conditions for Ukrainian (or another group) life like denying them electricity, water, and heat through repeated missile attacks. That's a pretty high bar, most will be able to participate.
