EU is surviving the winter thanks to their ability to stockpile energy. Ukraine will survive the winter thanks to Zelensky traveling to DC to secure the Patriot missile defense system.
Now, they're completely and totally in the wrong for invading a sovereign nation like Ukraine, and I've been saying that since they invaded Crimea immediately after the Winter Olympics in 2014. So let's clear that up right out of the gate. They've got no business being in Ukraine.
The reason why I don't think it was Russia is simply because it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face. They own the pipeline. The gas that travels down it is a major source of income for them. There is no scenario I can possibly think of where it benefits them to cause damage to their own assets.
It benefits a number of other countries, though. Foremost being Ukraine, but I honestly don't think they've got the assets to pull something like that off. At least, not without some major outside help.
Other countries have been bandied about, pretty much all of them NATO countries including the US. But while everyone is claiming it was sabotage, we haven't really seen any evidence in public that it was. Fragments of a detonating mechanism, or the bomb itself, etc. So we basically have to take the word of governments for it, and they may have some hidden incentives.
So I'm still not completely counting out the idea of accidents due to poor maintenance and lack of use. Especially since they happened 17 hours apart.
To be honest I dont believe the Usa did it. The Usa is so much clever and rational not to blow up russia+european owned infrastructure. I think russian assessment as a british/ukranian operation is more plausible.
A lot of new energy supply agreements over the last few weeks between the US & UK / EU should probably be all you need to know.
