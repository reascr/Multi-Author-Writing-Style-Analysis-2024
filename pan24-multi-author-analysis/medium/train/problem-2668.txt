Hakeem Jefferies is a anti-progressive democrat, so it is hardly surprising that he is a no show for progressive causes.
If your looking for a labor leader in Jefferies then you won’t find it. He’s so conservative that he doesn’t even support teachers…that’s how far the party leadership has shifted over the years. He’s basically a Republican without the terrible stances in regards to “social issues”…though I suspect most of us can agree that economic issues are also “social issues”.
