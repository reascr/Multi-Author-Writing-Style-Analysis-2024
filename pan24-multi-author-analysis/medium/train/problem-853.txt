How on earth do they think thatâ€™s a winning strategy for getting 2024 moderate voters when the whole country just gave them the middle finger to that rhetoric at the midterms.
They live in a propaganda bubble and their voters have been trained to respond only to the biggest, loudest, dumbest assholes possible. Every time Republicans make a non-sensical play, it's because they're catering to the rabid core of their voters, which the politicians think is a good idea because they've sequestered themselves into their own propagandistic media outlet safe spaces (be it radio or TV) which will never question Republican bullshit.
If they vote to impeach they piss off the moderates, but if they don't vote to impeach they'll piss off their base. Specifically the MAGA and Q believers who are what teenagers are to the Democrats. Non-voters that can help bring them over the edge in competitive districts.
