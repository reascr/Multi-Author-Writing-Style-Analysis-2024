And because the fallout would almost definitely lead to a change in regime (meaning people are likely to blame the incumbents for the problem and elect Republicans at all levels of government). Then they'll pass policies that benefit the rich in the long run.
Republicans get a win-win. If they don't act and it causes catastrophe, they likely regain control of the government in 2-4 years. If they cave, they still get to cry afoul of Democrats wasting money and being fiscally irresponsible. it's not true, but it doesn't have to be. People will still blame the Democrats.

For us companies and rich oligarchs wouldn't this be an incredible tight rope to walk? If they hurt the economy too much then their money and companies won't be worth as much. If they tank the economy too far and damage the reliability of the US dollar then the US dollar might not be the reserve currency in the future.
The US oligarchs currently are gathering wealth and power faster then ever before, I don't see them rocking the boat TOO hard by fucking with the debt ceiling. If it does happen I think it will be caused by incompetent political lackies who fuck up their orders.
