The 20-year-old Armita Abbasi, who sports a Star of David necklace in photographs of herself, was arrested and raped by the Islamic Republic’s security forces in October.
CNN reported that, in contrast to most Iranian dissidents within Iran, she “did not anonymize her anti-regime posts” on social media.
CNN, which did not note that Abbasi wore a Star of David, reported that leaked accounts “suggested that Iranian security forces tortured and sexually assaulted Abbasi.”.
Sheina Vojoudi, a spokesperson for the Senate of the National Iranian Congress, told the Post: “Ask the Islamic Republic where Armita Abbasi, the girl with Magen David is? She was arrested, raped and tortured. Where is she now?".
