But in my eyes, burning books is just a bad look. You can hate the content, and you can speak out against it. But anyone who burns a Quran, a Torah, a Bible, or any other text just makes you look like an ignorant fool. The guy who burnt the Quran in those videos this week is a total asshole, and while there are a lot of reasons to criticize Islam, that doesn’t mean he’s a good person for doing that. I mean, most people who go around burning Qurans are white supremacists, and fuck those guys. The same goes for anyone who burns a Torah. Especially someone who burns a work of art.
It would have had to come from a private seller. Because of the time and expense, it's not something you just pick up, and temples have very specific rules for when, why, and to whom a Torah can be sold. You couldn't even get one that was irreparably damaged, as those get buried.
Another thing to consider is that the Torah can be traced. There aren't that many people who make them, and I'm sure it would be fairly easy to find out who made it and who it passed through.
