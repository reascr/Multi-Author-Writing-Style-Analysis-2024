Pilot: Control tower this is Indian Air Force Delta Charlie Tango 4 8 7. We want to fly over to Turkey carrying humanitarian aid.
Your article doesn't actually refute it, it just says that the Indian Air Force's standard procedure is to fly around Pakistan.
Not taking sides here, and you bring up a good point by showing differing skew in the media, but out of curiosity why do you trust The Print over CNN News 18?
Because the news comes directly from the Indian military instead of speculations from unnamed sources.
It isn't a matter of trusting one outlet over the other, it's a matter of transparency. Print was open about their source and gave direct quotes, News18 was not and did not.
“Our aircraft don’t fly over Pakistan as this is our standard operating procedure. Our planes take a longer route by flying from the Gujarat side to avoid Pakistani air space while going towards Europe or West Asia,” an IAF official said.
