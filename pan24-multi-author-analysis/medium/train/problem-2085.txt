Seven years after he was first poised to become Speaker, and four since he became the Republican floor leader, it appears Kevin McCarthy still does not know how to count votes.

More than a dozen House Republicans torpedoed McCarthy’s grand plan to become Speaker of the House on Tuesday, denying him a majority of votes three times before the new Congress finally gave up and adjourned until Wednesday.
McCarthy faced a challenge from far-right former House Freedom Caucus chair Andy Biggs as well as Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.
Jeffries won a plurality of votes on the first ballot, as all 212 House Democrats in attendance voted for him, while 203 Republicans voted for McCarthy. The other 19 GOP votes were split between McCarthy, Biggs, and other Republicans.
“Feel like I’m living in a worldstar video the way McCarthy is getting beat down right now by his own party on the house floor,” Democratic Rep.-elect Maxwell Frost of Florida tweeted during the third ballot.
