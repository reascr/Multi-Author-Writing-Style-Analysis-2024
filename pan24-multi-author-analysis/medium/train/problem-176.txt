If he had achieved actual military successes, his political position would have likely skyrocketed. But Wagner’s Bakhmut campaign does’t seem to be much more advanced than it was 4 months ago and losses are mounting.
Now he’s left with massive costs, a lot of dead mercenaries, no real successes to show and he has just recently publicly criticized Russian army.
I think best case scenario (for him) is that he shuts up, falls in line, Wagner becomes fully subservient to the army and he’s allowed to continue as before.
Nah he has pissed off many higher up in the russian military brass. It’s too late as soon as his political position is no longer important he’s will prob commit suicide by jumping out some high rise.
And now I can't get rid of the idea, that some persona non grata gets defenestrated and simply bounces back from the safety net.
A couple days later the person responsible for the installation of the safety net... doesn't fall out of a window, but... what? Walks into an airfield and gets sucked into a jet engine? What is the next go-to response for Putin's gang?
You know how Putin cares so much about the safety of his citizens, he even deployed rescue helicopters around the buildings to be ready to save any attempted suicides. But, OH NO, that randomly suicidal person bounced off the safety net right into the whirling propellers of the helicopter. What a tragedy!
