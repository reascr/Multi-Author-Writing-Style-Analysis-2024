Someone just got released from gantonamo bay after 19 years after they realised he was innocent and US going to lecture india about minority rights. Also CAA has nothing to do with discrimination,it's NRC you should be focusing on because that has potential to strip people of their citizenship. CAA is about granting citizenship to minorities in neighbouring countries who consider them kafir aka blasphemer.
Yeah but CAA was designed to be paired with NRC and that's the reason why CAA doesn't includes Muslims. NRC doesn't even considers Passport as a proof of Nationality. So it doesn't takes much to understand that who ever planned the cocktail of CAA+NRC had ulterior motives.
A quick Google search comes up with interesting details, about 70% of the 1.9 million people who are out of the NRC in Assam are women shows that the method of asking people to furnish documents to prove their citizenship is incorrect at a very basic level â€“ the NRC can only catch those who lack the required documents, not illegal immigrants.
Grants citizenship by CAA for the refugees who came to India before 2014 who were persecuted on the basis of religion.
And suddenly everyone wonders why Muslims arent included in CAA ? Can Muslims be persecuted in a Islamic country for being Muslims?
The exclusion in the CAA was.... Honestly? Driven by islamophobia, but also India has unique history with muslims and Muslim nations, especially the partition in 1947 with Pakistan. But also India has a population of Muslims on parity with Pakistan, 3rd or 4th largest in tje world by the last count (full citizens that is, not including refugees).
