America deserves to be an authoritarian dictatorship run by the super rich 1% at this point. The people of this country are too fucking dumb and they deserve to be ripped off and shoved into the gutters to be forgotten about.

Yup, Americans might not deserve Donald Trump (anything that breathes, and most things that donâ€™t do not deserve him either) but the American institution she does.
