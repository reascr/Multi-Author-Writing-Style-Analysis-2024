A lot of people are pointing out how extreme of a solution this is, but those people haven't lived on the ground or visited El Salvador. The gangs would control large plots of land and demand entry and exit tolls, police couldn't even access the areas. This crackdown, however extreme, is working, and is extremely and overwhelmingly popular among the people of El Salvador.
If 75% of the people approve of this method, it's the right thing to do. To hell with all the social justice warriors. Sometimes a violent force of good is required to take on a violent force of evil.
I hope they succeed. And if this backfires into some kind of coup or whatever, I will be first to admit I was mistaken.
This!, people in the US and Europe don’t have any idea how awful is living there and let me tell you, the Taliban is a hella of a lot more compassionated than Central American gangs. It’s amazing how the Taliban was in the radar for decades while the gangs were doing business as usual but then they didn’t mess the cocaine flow like the Taliban did with heroin.
