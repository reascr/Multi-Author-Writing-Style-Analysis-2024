Wow, that's a really shit article that cherry picks elements to cast doubt on American media and military. Legal Eagle just did an about this, and point out that China's claims are all ridiculous bullshit, like claiming it was a weather balloon, which would be legal, if under certain size and weight restrictions; spoiler, it's dozens of times larger and heavier than what the international law allows, or would feasibly be a weather balloon. Just because the US isn't publicly detailing every element of info they may or may not have does not make them hawkish on this incident. I just lost a lot of respect for this news source.
this seems like a particularly shitty way to spy since it's uncontrollable and really fucking high up. the idea that it's doing signals intel doesn't seem too likely since they're on a randomish path and I can't imagine there's a whole lot of unencrypted radio chatter going on these days. when you've got low orbit spy sats that can be directed over anything these balloons being anything serious strikes me as pretty unlikely. plus Greene is super pissed about it and that makes me think it's a ball of nothing.
