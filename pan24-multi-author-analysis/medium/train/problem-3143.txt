better get all your shots in now, the idea that nukes be hosted in ukraine to ensure lasting peace is something I think will get serious consideration, if the army is beat back and nukes are installed, then this will never be able to happen again, unless you want to pay the price of getting nuked for it, ukraine had nukes before, imagine how good they'd have now if they kept them. We should have never taken them away. Was very unfair to them. It was good to have that nuclear deterrence. Of all the ways to ensure ukraine won't be invaded again this is the most sure way.
I concur with that statement. Also, low-key, I believe it is possible God blesses those who love him a lot by inhibiting cancer growth in some cases. For some it is part of their story and was the plan all along, however, Putin is the perpetuater of abomination after abomination and it would not be likely that God likes him at all for what he is doing.
People seem to trust the other American propaganda which says he's battling with cancer, suffering from Parkinsons, or the only world leader who shits in a briefcase though lol.
