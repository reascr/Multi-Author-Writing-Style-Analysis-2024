Because what hapened in the Republican Primary in 2016, was exactly the opposite of what happened in the Democratic Primary in 2020.
SO what happened in the democratic primary in 2020. Three democratic contenders decided to drop out and threw their support behind Biden.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
So by South Carolina, you had a VERY divided electorate. But after South Carolina - on March 1, Pete Buttigieg dropped out and endorsed Biden, on March 2, Amy Klobuchar dropped out and endorsed Biden. (Steyer and Bloomberg also dropped out and endorsed Biden in that one week).
South Carolina - on February 29th - - Biden won 48%, Sanders won 19%, Warren won 7%, Buttigieg won 8%, Klobuchar won 3%.
Super Tuesday was March 3. Of 15 States, Biden won 11, typically taking 35-50% of the vote, and Sanders won 4, taking 36% in California to Biden's 27%, 37% in Colorado to Biden's 24%, Utah taking 36% to Biden's 18%, and 50% in Vermont, to Biden's 21%. An March 4, Elizabeth Warren dropped out and endorsed Biden.
This turned the race into a 2 party race between Sanders and Biden, but where Biden had a significant advantage.
But alternately look at the 2016 republican primary. Trump and Cruz and Rubio stuck it out largely until it became mathematically impossible for anyone else to win.
New Hampshire - Trump won 35%, Kasich won 15%, Cruz won 11%, Rubio won 10%, Bush won 11%, Carson won 9%.
South Carolina, Trump won 32%, Cruz won 22%, Rubio won 22%, Kasich won 7%, Carson won 7%, Bush Won 7%.
So going into super Tuesday, Trump had won 3/4 elections, but only with an average of about 37% of the vote, whereas his contenders split 40% plus .
On Super Tuesday, Trump won 7 states, Cruz won 3, Rubio 1, but again, the vote was still very split.
Going on, all the way up through Mid April, the same results keep happening. Trump uplled about 33-38% of the electorate, with Cruz and Rubio each pulling 20-30%, except when they win. (Cruz won Kanzas, Main, Idaho, Utah, Wisconsin, Colorado, and Wyoming, Rubio won Puerto Rico and Washinon DC), Kasich won Ohio.
There's a credible case in the 2016 primary that if Cruz, Rubio, Carson and Kasich had not split the vote behind them, a consensus candidate would have beaten Trump.
