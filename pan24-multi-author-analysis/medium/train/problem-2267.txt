Kind of a minor quibble, but US companies and universities built (or, at least, used to build) their own software tech stacks from the bottom up. China builds their own hardware – and, increasingly, software – but it's all built on top of western tools and FOSS platforms. It is true that no non-US company has really come close to that recently, but samsung (to an extent), and even sony and nintendo have a fairly high degree of control (and customization) over their own hardware and tech stack, and the degree to which eg. apple (or microsoft) depends on the competitive advantage of having, arguably, higher quality custom-built closed source software to build off of (or for that matter google's internal stuff w/ GFS etc), would be difficult to understate.
Started thinking about it, and while it might speak to geographic ignorance to talk of a "civil war next door" like that, and good chance it is, the distance from Cambodia to Myanmar is about from the west coast to only as far as Montana/Wyoming/Colorado/New Mexico in the US. The chunk from the coast to there is only a third of the whole country.
