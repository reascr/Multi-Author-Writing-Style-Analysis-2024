We can hope. But lets not ignore how often people of power including politicians have fucked things up in the past. Or imagine what could happen if the republicans in the USA now or in the future would win at least one majority in the house or senate and/or presidency. It could either be a deadlock (Biden couldn’t do shit) or they would do worse (Biden could still not do anything except use his veto). And that is just the USA. Lets not talk about Erdogan and others.
True. Right now it just feels like, as they grossly overestimated their capabilities etc, they want to regroup, get weapons etc, and then perhaps try again within Putins lifetime. And we can’t be sure that his successor will be any better (for the Russians and the rest of the world).
lol get weapons. They've torched through their high end shit made with western components and now through tech sanctions and the like have ensured they won't be able to reproduce them in the near future. Them getting weapons at this point is refurbing tanks from the 1980s and pulling in MLRS unguided rockets from Korea.
