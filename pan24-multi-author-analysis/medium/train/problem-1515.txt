Colleges will get impacted by these shit laws as they can't teach this stuff either. Kids going into college will suffer here. Kids getting out of college will be missing key information, and have an extra, expensive class to pay for.
Can Universities just look at the curriculum of Florida schools and say their students donâ€™t meet the minimum standards for admission? That would probably cause enough uproar to end these regressive education policies.
But that's possibly the point, it will result in uneducated citizens. Kids that go to college, or are exposed to more cultures and viewpoints usually become less ignorant, and less conservative.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
