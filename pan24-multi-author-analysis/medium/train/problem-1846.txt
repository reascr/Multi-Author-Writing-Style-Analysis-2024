Probably like everywhere else. You're in a neoliberal oligarchy in an era when the empire is waning and multipolarity is rising. You see a democratic party that hates the economic implications of even social democracy and a republican party that embraces American fascism. The predations of capital continue on the workers.
If you look at the demographics of Kansas, the western half is becoming older and far less populated. The eastern half where the majority live has seen small but impressive gains for the Democrats including a county that had never previously voted for a Democratic nominee for president until 2020.
Relying on demographics alone is a terrible strategy that will leave you blindsided by gerrymandering and conservative racial minorities. Propagandizing the public and supporting left wing policy will offer the material improvements people want but you'll also have to fight against the party itself if you do that and want to pass them.
