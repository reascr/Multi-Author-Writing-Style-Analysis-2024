Look this is simple from voters' perspective on the ground: Enjoy wasting your time watching the "divide and conquer" crew. Vilify our democracy as much ss you wany. We will show you the REAL power of democracy. One defined by Indians. Not sharia or Britain.
The real real other side of story is that media won't talk about hundreds who were burnt alive in those trains in that state by muslims to start these riots that bbc is making content on.
Well there you go fucktard, you don't want to know of murders of folks you actually hate. And ofcourse even when you clowns mentioned burning the train you won't even acknowledge who started it.
Then why does the documentary so conveniently forgets to mention the fact that a train full of Hindus was burnt by muslims (Not one or two radical Islamists but over 2000), why are the instigators not to be blamed?
- Had it been Hindus who had instigated, the world would have collectively raised pitchforks against them.
- Conclusion: Hindus are just easy scapegoats and they should happily accept to die without retaliating.
Just read the above interchanging Muslims to Hindus and vice versa and you would still blame the Hindus. Just try it.
