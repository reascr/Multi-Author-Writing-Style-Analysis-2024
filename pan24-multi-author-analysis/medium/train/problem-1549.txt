Their best bet (again, strategically speaking) would be to return to their pre-Trump strategy of quietly undermining civil rights while publicly pretending they're not fascist bigots. Keeps the base happy and fools just enough uninformed swing voters to still win. IDK if they can put the mask back on now or not but the only alternative is to become a far right regional party that only wins in a few states. But that gives Dems a lot of power in the short term and leaves a vacuum that will ultimately be filled by some new centrist party.
