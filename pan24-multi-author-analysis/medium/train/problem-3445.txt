It's a very absurd situation. It's a Muslim student mad about a Muslim painter from hundreds of years ago belonging to a different sect/subgroup painting the prophet Muhammad and the university deciding that sharing said painting reaches the level of Islamophobia once the student complained.
I don't think the acknowledgment of Muslims not being a monolith can be deemed Islamophobia by any reasonable party. And in terms of avoiding offending specific individuals, the professor sounds like they went above and beyond in giving people ample time to briefly leave the room if necessary to them.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
