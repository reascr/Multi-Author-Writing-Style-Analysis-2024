Until Donald Trump, nobody ever cared or wondered if a US President possessed classified documents. I would bet my life savings that the National Archives has periodically notified ex-Presidents or other politicians that certain classified documents were not accounted for. And the proper response was to find them and return them. And the public never knew.

Well, it's not like Trump was in any way organized or cared for protocols, including security protocols.
As different as they were politically, nobody ever suspected that George Bush or Bill Clinton would actually give classified documents to foreign enemies; would use classified documents as leverage against domestic or foreign personal enemies; or would sell these documents to the highest bidder. Donald Trump would entertain any of these options.
He probably did the nation a favor by doing such a bad job heading the Executive Branch. Now a lot of rules and internal government processes have to be reviewed and repaired.
