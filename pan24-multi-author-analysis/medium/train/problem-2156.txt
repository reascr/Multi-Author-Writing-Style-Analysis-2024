This comment made me wonder what % of Hungary was Islamic in practice and the number was actually even lower than I would've expected. I guess most of the European Muslims are down in the southeast and Hungary is a little too north for that demographic to bleed into their country over time.
And (if Erdogan wins reelection) sanction the crap out of Turkey. Turkey's economy is in the shitter and heavy sanctions would make them think twice about stirring the pot. Their elections are already heavily manipulated by Erdogan, and can hardly be considered free or fair. Hope we get some international observers to help confirm the results in May.
If you think NATO would be stronger without Turkiye and to a much lesser extent Hungary then you are kidding yourself,.clueless.
Atm, they are no allied of anyone west of Russia tbh. Hungary's government is only looking out for themselves.
Would I lift a finger to help Hungary? No. Would most inhabitants of NATO feel obliged to do so? Most likely not. Turkey is different, because there is an actual duality there. They help with one hand and do political theater with the other.
Tbh, fuck Hungary. I would rather see them outside of NATO and outside of the EU. It would mean no difference to anyone in NATO or Europe. In fact, it would probably help the EU out alot.
