I'm not saying there's a need for any particular jet or that this is the best idea, I'm saying that established precedent from proxy wars between Russia and the USA includes sending soldiers to operate cutting edge antiaircraft systems within the proxy country and deploying whole squadrons of cutting edge fighter jets along with trained pilots & crew.
This seems like a good place for a historical reminder that Russian pilots flying advanced Russian fighter jets shot down hundreds of American aircraft during the Korean war and we didn't nuke the Soviet Union. Similar happened in Vietnam, with Russian soldiers manning advanced antiaircraft systems in Vietnam and shooting down Americans.
If we're going off of historical precedent we could literally deploy multiple F-35s squadrons or Patriot missile systems with western crews to the region along with buckets of paint in Ukrainian colors.
Besides, Russia can't even match last generation fighters, no need to use the latest. F-16s flown by Ukrainians would wreck Russia and outmatch them, and would keep this a proxy war.
