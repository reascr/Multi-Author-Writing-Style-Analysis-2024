Oh yeah, all the trans men, who are definitely at a huge advantage, having grown up as women then transitioning afterwards and suffering from bone density issues. I'd fear them.
They also said that the trans (yes, transgender and transexual) were super soldiers at one point. So either Russia is lying, or those hormones are better than expected.
Russia invaded Ukraine because some Ukrainians speak Russian. Also because Nato is nearby. And because the Ukrainians are nazis. And because the Ukrainians are satanists.
Hold up- I missed those ones Those are awesome If Ukraine is sitting on those, Russia is more screwed than it already is!
Okay I actually did some research into this after that one trans woman did really well in swimming and it became a controversy.
I was under the impression that it's actually quite harmful to your bones to get those hormone treatments. What's her face definitely lost a lot of speed after the hormones. Still better than your typical girl because she was like 6 foot something, but I wasn't aware of the secret superpowers that trans people receive.
