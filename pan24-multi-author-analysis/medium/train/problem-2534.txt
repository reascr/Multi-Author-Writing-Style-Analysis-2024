The reports of the German government linking Leopard permits/deliveries to US tanks always were about either unnamed officials or supposed private communication - i.e. not verifiable. It could very well be, that such a demand had been made in private, but that is being denied by the German government.
Kind of the problem with modern press. They rely heavily on "unnamed officials" and "unnamed sources" to print stories. The chances of these unnamed sources being either made up.... or simply being wrong is high. Not every single government official who hears rumors and rumblings inside government represents the actual stance of the state.
I mean, there is always the possibility of the official line and the unofficial line of the government being different. I don't think that's the case here, though. The potential lie could easily be disproven, if the US government confirms that such a demand has been made.
And these unnamed sources can be very reliable and valuable input. The problem for us readers is that we cannot evaluate the reliability.
