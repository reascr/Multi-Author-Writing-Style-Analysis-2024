Leopard 1A5 can fill the same role as the AMX10RC can to some extent. Mobile light armored fire support.
Theyre not good enough to match up against Russian mainline tanks or to break through enemy lines like the much heavier armored Leopard 2 and Abrams.
BUT you have a a stabilised 105mm gun coupled with thermals and a good FCS, enough armor to protect from IFV autocannon fire. Also theyre pretty light and have good mobility and reverse speed. Fire and maneuvre tactics is what they were made for.
Thats still going to provide great fire support and recon assets to infantry that would otherwise have no tank at all to support them.
105 stabilized using NATO standard 105 ammo is way better than the AMX 10RC, as is it's armor and those tracks will come in handy getting through mud.
The problem is they won't be able to shrug off even RPG-7s like the LEO II can. But the biggest problem is the optics and the lack of thermals (although I have heard they are to be upgraded. If there's one thing that stands out from soldier accounts, the thermals are the game winners.
