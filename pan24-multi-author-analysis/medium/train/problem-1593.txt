6 IL 76s is a few hundred troops and associated vehicles and supplies for a few days. Anything significant enough to do anything would require dozens of flights.
A lot of assumptions here. Putin will keep mobilising troops, the issue is thst they have broken command structure and inability to make mobilised troops usable (and quickly), they lost a fair amount of their core forces and just the fact that he delegated significant portion of the offensive action to a private firm tells a lot.
Belarus has limited military capability and very real risk of forces defying attack orders - this would be a disaster scenario for Lukashenko. Both himself and Putin are aware of that. He will also not be killed by Putin, who obviously does not care about literally anyone, problem is Lukashenko being killed will open void for pro European movement in Belarus, Putin will struggle with managing this in a peaceful manner and may struggle with using force too.
I agree, so far he’s done a great job but eventually he’s gonna get pushed either into the war or out a window. Eventually Putin will bully him into it I imagine. He doesn’t care about Lukashenko.
