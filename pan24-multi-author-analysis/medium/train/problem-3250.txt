We're about to elect a bunch of election-denying Republicans who will take away your voting rights and possibly cause the country to default, but by all means, let's talk about this instead.

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
But the reality is voting any other way is shooting yourself in the dick unless of course you're rich.
I get there is nothing more frustrating and maddening than having the Democrat sycophants who for 2 years just wailed excuses and excuses that "THERES NOTHING BIDEN CAN DOOOOO!" then have the audacity to tell people to vote for Democrats or Democracy will die.
Meanwhile the Dem house under Trump passed a ton of bills that then went no where in the Senate. Same thing under the current Congress because of the stupid filibuster rule and two very conservative Democratic Senators.
