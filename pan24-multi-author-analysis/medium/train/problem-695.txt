While i dont agree on the verdict on thus, elizabeth holmes was deemed innocent of defrauding patients with her faulty blood testing kits since it was decided that she didnt intend to harm them (she just got charged for defrauding some billionaires since that was direct and more provable).
Obviously that doesn’t apply to this situation but overall it’s true y’all are just blind idk how no one sees all the daily hypocrisy going on on both sides and act like their group is morally superior and does nothing wrong I hate both of y’all for ruining this country left and right ignorance and extremism is not limited to any one group of people two wrongs don’t make a right literally childhood lessons no one seems to understand.
You’re part of the problem unable to accept your side has issues and think that the other side is “evil” but nooo not our politicians all politicians are crooks look at WW2 propaganda and how the “enemy” is portrayed and maybe you can begin to understand media manipulation and propaganda.
