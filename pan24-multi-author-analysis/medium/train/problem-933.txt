Would Russia give up a single millimeter of land to anyone? So, tell these occupiers to do their boys a favor and get lost. Acts of barbaric aggression is long over.
Yep and without nukes most of the world would have actively turned on russia for this with warnings to india and china to keep their noses out of it. That's why ukraine gets so much support.
Russia is losing land that it illegally took from Ukraine. Russia is fighting with a mixture of weapons, some dating back to before WW2. About 1 million Russians left Russia, once there was a chance of them being called up to fight in Ukraine. Sanctions are having a major impact. The Silovarchs are one by one being thrown out of windows. There is in fighting at top levels. Putin doesn’t get provided with truthful information.
Russia invaded a sovereign nation. They managed to take land and to commit war crimes and genocide. Ukrainians are fighting for their lives and for their country.
Just the other week, over 500 Russian troops were killed. These “troops” had no training and no weapons. They were on the front lines - courtesy of Russia.
Could go on, but. I look forward to learning about how Russia will win in their invasion of Ukraine.
They have been buying missiles and artillery from other countries. Hopefully, because their massive WWII stocks are finally running out.
