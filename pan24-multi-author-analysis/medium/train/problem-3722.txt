And I think that's entirely backwards, because not every power structure acts the same way and the values of a faith will inform its actions. I truly cannot understand people who say that Christianity has almost never upheld Christian values (except for Christian primitivists, because nothing is more Christian than accusing other Christians of being insufficiently Christian), because cultural control, domination, and colonialism are Christian values. The Roman Empire was fine with allowing its subjects to retain their own gods, until Christianity arrived and they began forcible evangelization. The Western Roman Empire collapsed when its attempts to maintain Nicene control over the largely Arian Germanic tribes backfired horribly, but that didn't stop the death march of evangelization from continuing until it had ravaged every indigenous European faith. And so it went.
Yes. Have you ever been involved (or known someone who has been involved) in one of these missions? Sure, some may be scummy, but the vast majority involve real help like building school buildings/homes/wells, providing medical care/etc. They proselytize as well, but to say they're not helping the indigenous people is disingenuous.
