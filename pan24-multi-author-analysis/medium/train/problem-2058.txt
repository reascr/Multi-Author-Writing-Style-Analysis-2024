The soviets actually got the Japanese to surrender mostly, dropping the 2 bombs is all we had. No general thought invading japan would be efficient. Japan was deathly afraid of communism spreading (like every other nation basically), Stalin and FDR had an agreement to help each other finish the war. Japan notoriously weakened their forces in the bulk of China because they held massive reserves in Manchuria in fear of the soviets getting involved. America would have you believe it was the bombs, destructive power was unlike any ever seen, but the real threat were the soviets. They had the real ability to wage a gruesome ground based attack without regard for losses.
We're you the one that brought it up in another thread? If so thank you. If not? Keep up the good work.
Haha Michigan here. This was a topic of conversation just this morning in our office. A co worker genuinely told someone this being nice, and was horrified when we told her to not say that if she ever went down south. She was very concerned that she messed up.
