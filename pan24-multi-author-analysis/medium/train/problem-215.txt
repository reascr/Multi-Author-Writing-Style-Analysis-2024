Edit: As usual, there is such a gross amount of misinformation regarding the Shah in the replies of this comment. If you want to actually learn about the Pahlavi dynasty, pick up the book "The Fall of Heaven", where actual statistical data and unbiased accounts are used to paint an accurate picture of the Shah's reign. Don't listen to these people who are simply parrotting what they've heard without any research of their own. Most of them are non-Iranians, who through good intentions, believe they are "helping" Iranians by setting this false narrative that one of the great nation builders of our history was evil. The Islamic regime has dedicated the last 40 years of their existence to trashing his legacy through local and foreign avenues, much of their propaganda is being knowingly/unknowingly parrotted by Redditors.
As an iranian our problem is not mandatory hijab now its the whole regime and our freedom you canâ€™t just kill our children and say ok now you can go out with no hijab wtf do you think this is anyways this is a show of weakness and were winning so fuck dictator.
I believe that's mostly something the rich can afford to do, but yes, Iranian women do show some hair even if they wear a hijab, especially in the cities. It's pretty normal to show an inch or so of hair above your forehead.
