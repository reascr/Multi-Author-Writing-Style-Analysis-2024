McCarthy is losing because of the extreme right wing of his party. Meanwhile the most prominent elected Republican in the country is showing up at an event with his good buddy Joe Biden—almost as if he’s signaling that he doesn’t give a shit what the extreme right wing thinks because they are gormless losers.
Well, Biden is white, so "bipartisanship," is back on the table. They can get back to working with Democrats while putting in their nasty legislation to make sure government breaks or remains ineffective and Democrats can go back to touting "bipartisanship.".
