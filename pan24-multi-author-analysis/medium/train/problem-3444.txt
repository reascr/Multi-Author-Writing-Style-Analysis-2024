Looking at the COVID rates over the past year, there hasn't been anything close to resembling the Omicron spike that happened almost exactly a year ago since. To me, that indicates that COVID is indeed out of the pandemic phase and has become endemic, by definition.
I think the message this official was trying to convey is that the crisis isn't necessarily over, because people are still getting sick and hospitalized, but I don't think we can call this a pandemic any longer if the infection rate remains relatively consistent. That's the definition of it being endemic. The two are different phases of virus proliferation and are therefore mutually exclusive.
A steady rate of infection is the same thing as “not spreading out of control”. The rate is never going to be lower than it is now, so by your definition it will always be in a pandemic phase. I disagree with that. Once it’s stabilized, it’s endemic.
Only if you don't know what the word endemic means. Which you probably should, if you're going to make declarations like this.
No, it is not. Its spread is completely uncontrolled at present as no mitigation measures beyond a vaccine (that is ineffective for transmission) are being done. On top of that, the healthcare system has been imploding (and continues to) under the strain of COVID.
