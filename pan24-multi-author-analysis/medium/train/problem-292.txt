what a loaded sentence . Erbakan had nothing to do with CHP; he was the founder of "Milli Görüş", which translates to something like "national opinion", which is a Turkish nationalist-Islamist movement, as opposed to the Arabophiles ruling for 20 years now -- not that the Arabophilia is the only reason AKP is such filth. They were also both in coalition rule during both military actions in Cyprus, though the first was an intervention against the coup intending to enact Enosis, which did stop the coup in Cyprus and depose the military junta in Greece (who actually left NATO because they didn't find support for their expansionism which is pretty funny in retrospect), whereas the second was a fully nationalist act which led to the situation today.
There's nothing from stopping US, UK, France, Germany, etc from all leaving NATO and joining with Sweden/Finland, etc under a new treaty umbrella if Turkey strikes another NATO country.
All of NATO will defend Greece. Erdogan is clearly a Putin boot licker. I wouldn't be surprised if he did this in order to start a NATO civil war which is Putin's dream scenario.
