Germany was a war zone this year. North Americans have no idea how bad it is if you haven't been during new years in a major city. People shooting them at you and throwing them at you. Everyone letting them go without safety or concern, drunk.
The animals are absolutely scared shitless, they're going off 1 week before and 1 week after new years at random times. No designated areas or city organized fire works. Just madness. Shit is out of control.
Look up Byrna. They make a paintball marker designed as self defense. Fires harder. Projectiles are very firm to cause non-lethal pain to attacker at about 30 feet. If you take the short online security guard course, you can take that certificate to your state and become a certified security guard (you don't have to take a job). At that point, they will sell you pepper spray filled projectiles. These are also legal to ooen or conceal carry since they are not a firearm, and to make them recognizable they are painted bright colors. I am sure a few of these would keep some people from launching fireworks your direction.
