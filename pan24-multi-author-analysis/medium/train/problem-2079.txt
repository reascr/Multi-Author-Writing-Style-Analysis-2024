Depends if are counting to absolute zero (ie literally none left) or a relative zero (ie we only have shells we need for adequate strategic reserve). Majority of militaries count to a relative zero because they aren't in an end-of-the-world fight where you aren't concerned about strategic reserve.
It's most likely that Russia's vast reserve of ammo is getting down to the point they are either nearing no excess beyond strategic reserve or they are already lowering the limit of their strategic reserve to free up more shells for the front.
Either is bad news because the war with Ukraine is an artillery war and, if they run out, things are going to get bleaker for the Russian lines.
Hopefully it will lead to a full retreat and the end of the conflict. You can’t fight if you don’t have weapons and artillery has always been a major factor in any major war.
If any fallout from nuclear weapons reaches NATO countries Biden has said that will trigger Article 5, which means all of NATO, including the US, is now at war with Russia, so expect to US carrier groups enforcing blockades of Russia ports and destroying oil and gas pipelines. And China, quietly, but with tacit US approval, selling much need supplies to Russia at enormous mark-up.
No choice after they have already moved all their troops back into Russia you mean? For all of us, that’s an easy choice before using unconventional weapons.
