I'm from northern Finland. I can count on two hands the amount of days when we had -25c or colder temperatures since the new year. Usually around this time of year the temperature is a comfortable -15c to -25c, but this year it has been between 0c and -15c. This winter has been unbearably hot compared to last winter. Recently the temperature has alternated almost daily between 0c and freezing, which means that the top layer of the snow/ice is melting and then freezing into a smooth ice surface. It's fine to drive on in a car, but if you're walking on foot it's really annoying because there's always this one bit of the sidewalk that isn't covered by gravel and that's the part you step on while walking and end up almost slipping on.
If there's much left of civilization in 100 years, they're gonna look back on this shit and use it as an example of how fucking stupid humans can be. I overheard an older man at a local grocery store ranting about how the cold snap we had here in the US was an indication of how BS the 'liberal climate agenda' was. I had the briefest urge to confront him, but about a decade of this has completely worn me down.
When I was a kid we had snow every year at the beginning of December. It's February and there is no snow.
When the snow season starts it's usually around -1 so it snows, snow settles and stays. The sun can't warm up the region anymore.
This year, once again, it was above 0 degrees and we have no snow. Now it's -5, but the rain already passed.
