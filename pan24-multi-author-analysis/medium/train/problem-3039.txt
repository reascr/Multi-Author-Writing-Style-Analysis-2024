Seriously, too few wanted to get frustrated with China the first time around. We go through this again. Will those people learn from a second round of their evasiveness?
It was easy to blame the US when slow to roll out attempts to mitigate the disease. But "zero-Covid" China couldn't be bothered when people were leaving Wuhan while sick?
“Xenophobic” was the term being tossed around pretty heavily if I recall when a lot of us were calling for bans on Chinese flights until they get their reporting correct. But what do I know!
Let me try to simplify it a little bit. Trump made his thoughts on the links between COVID and China very clear. When you do that, and then ONLY ban travelers from China, despite knowing that you have not actually stopped anyone from China from coming here. At all. That is racist at best and a fucking incompetent response at worst.
The Chinese travel ban was stupid. It was literally a ban on travelers from China only. When COVID had already escaped. And it didn't stop them from going to another country before routing to the U.S.
