It's not even believing his word. Trump (or whoever the conservative media machine is playing defense for) just is innocent of whatever. That is presupposed out of the gate. All they need is an ex post facto justification that they can point to. It's not meant to actually convince or persuade; the line they go with is just to quiet that thought that their guy might have done something disagreeable. It's also why when an explanation is disproved you can just slot in a new one. The excuse just needs to exist, regardless of what it is or how true it is or even if it makes any sense.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
