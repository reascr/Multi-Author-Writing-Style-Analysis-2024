Yeah they have black budgets, underground SCIFs (where high ranking officials can learn of certain secrets they are cleared for), and incredibly compartmentalized to facilitate secrecy. The MIC is obsessed with compartments and modules. From their weapons platforms to their bunkers and especially with their hierarchy. I read one year (2016 I believe) that 6.5 trillion (with a T!) went “missing” into black budget projects. That’s not corruption, it’s way too much. It’s likely them spending on things they don’t want any record of. It’s very shady and needs to be thoroughly audited imo.
The US military is almost a shadow government. Not in the sense that they’re clandestinely manipulating events or whatever but they have a bigger budget(gdp) than many countries and very little oversight(compared to the civilian budget).
Maybe they have underground rivers they navigate to get between all the top-secret underground military bases?
/S because you know someone's gonna take it seriously and suggest it's our first line of defense against the reptilians.
Also I learned about SCIFs from Congressmen who have repeatedly described being allowed into these sites (not boats). Some may even be located in the aforementioned bunkers but that’s just an educated guess.
There’s a source that you didn’t ask for. It’s not the original it just references the original article. The 6.5 trillion was more than the Pentagon’s entire budget that year by A LOT. If it is corruption then we have a serious leak in our budget.
