Stockpiled weapons? Wasn't it a single firearm? Probably an old ww2 pistol, or a cannon from the eccentric "prince"'s castle. ;-).
Makes sense. The next time people plot to overthrow the government of their country (I.e. commit treason) they’ll realize they don’t have a way to get guns without breaking the law and give up.
Probably-close-to-the-truth jokes aside, it is a central responsibility of a state to ensure its continued existence, and a hard/disproportionate response is the smart move. The moral high ground is also on the German state's side here too. The vast majority of Germans are happy with the current constitution, and are able to criticise their politicians and vote them out.
However, the Government (edit: and mainstream parties) and its many arms and fingers should take a hard look at itself and its approach to its critics. There are repeated instances where individuals with legitimate opinions and analyses have been blackballed in the media, politics and academia. They are all too ready to paint anyone with an alternative opinion as "right wing", either directly or by association. This leads to a sense of disenfranchisement, which doesn't lead anywhere good.
Does anyone seriously take it seriously that a group of how many was it 25? Could seriously pose a threat to the German government. Scare mongering media sensationalism is what I would call it.
There are at least 21000 reichsbürger in Germany. Many might be in public positions, in the police and in the military. This is not media sensationalism. It is a serious concern.
