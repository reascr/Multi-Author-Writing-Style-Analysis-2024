Talking about my personal life is far beyond you. If you want to make an argument just stay at topic. If we gonna play the game like this your words can be assumed true for you too. About your argument in topic. Every government being fucked up doesnâ€™t mean they are pure evil. This is the narrow minded point of view I was talking about. Seeing things in a duality like a child watching cartoons. Oh at last I can literally make a list about countries that blackmailed another entity which affected innocent millions but make a little effort and use your pathetic brain to do research, maybe someday it can develop to rival an infant brain in intellect. I could burry your pity ass in the sea of shame but I think you might be already immune to feeling shame as you posted that garbage reply to my comment.
oooooo I \\like\\ this one So they move to Norway (already NATO) and poof the problem goes away? And Erdogan can go f himself - which he is free to do at any time, but especially over this? Definitely liking this!
