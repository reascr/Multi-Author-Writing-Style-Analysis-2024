It's a dire situation that's scary to witness. As a citizen. I live in an rural area just outside the Nairobi metropolitan area. This is supposed to be the rainy season, September-November, but we've had barely a week of rain. Farmers are going broke.
The people in North Eastern arid areas are dying. Every day on the news it's horror stories. Desperate nomadic people, whose lives depend on their herds are selling cows worth 20,000 for 500 shillings.
that is all very heartbreaking and devastating. i wish there was something i could do but i'm just one person with no money and no means to be able to do anything helpful.
I'm not even sure what I can do to help. I posted a question on the local subreddit on helping drought victims but information was not very helpful. It's difficult not to despair.
I'm angry that people still deny that climate change is a problem. Oil companies are making record profits at the expense of poor farmers, ordinary citizens and the most innocent of all, our wildlife. I don't know where I'm going with this rant. /.
