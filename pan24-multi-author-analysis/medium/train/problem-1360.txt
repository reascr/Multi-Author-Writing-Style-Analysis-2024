You people are so uninformed. All 100% true. You can hide from it but it will find you. The millions from China and Ukraine are front page news but you have to go to the back section to find the $200,000 shopping spree the ex mayor of Moscow's wife took hunter Biden on. Everyone took the money. In Afghanistan we built barracks hospitals bridges roads we brought in tanks planes soldiers we built schools and we never spent more than 50 billion in a year we've already given $90 billion to the Ukraine It's all unaccounted for It went through FTX to American politicians FTX was the second largest donor to the Democrat party in the last election cycle to the tune of 40 million George Soros was number one at 140 million My point is you can't spend $90 billion on a handful of rockets and grenades We didn't supply any equipment We didn't supply any tanks planes buildings nothing and it's all gone and they're demanding more You don't think you should question it? Vladimir Putin is selling all his oil to China and India India's thumbing their nose at us and buying their oil by the barrel. Russia is now in a military partnership with Iran to develop killer drones while Russia supplies Iran with planes and tanks and other weapons. No matter how you slice it America is losing and that means you're losing Wait till the digital currency comes along and the government controls your spending That's what Biden's been paid to do look up Claus Schwab. I know you don't want to hear this and I know you're going to deny it and pretend that nothing's wrong but you better start looking because you're going to wake up one day and the American dreams going to be over and that day will be soon.
There’s no way he’s “ducking” any questions, he literally never had a public debate in his entire political career, and all his “conferences” are 100% staged with questions agreed upon.
