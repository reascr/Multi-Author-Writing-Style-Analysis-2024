They and every right-wing outlet are partially responsible for garbage like santos getting elected, and now they're trying to profit off a problem they helped create.
We need to stop rewarding them with upvotes for clickbait headlines. They still exist to get people to vote their rights away, and still hate you if you don't vote GOP.
They post against-type articles to get normies to think they're OK, but they've made it abundantly clear they exist to misinform. Any support of them, even for "normal" stories helps fascism spread by normalizing their dishonesty.
