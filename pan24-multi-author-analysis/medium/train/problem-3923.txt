He was absolutely against NATO, he explicitly talked about pulling the US out of NATO repeatedly and might have even tried to get that going, and he cut funding to it too. At the time it seemed pretty crazy -- NATO is obviously extremely beneficial for America's interests that's like the main issue NATO opposition has with it lol -- and now, well, it seems obvious where he was getting these ideas. At the time the American public felt absolutely no worry or concern about Russia though (which in retrospect was also crazy).
Outright annexation of Belarus would be next, then Moldova. After that, Kazakhstan. Why risk a war with NATO when there's still juicy targets left?
EDIT: No, Belarus isn't already part of Russia, Lukashenko clearly isn't doing what Putin wants him to. He can't get the Belarusians under control() and he isn't sending soldiers to fight Ukraine. At the moment, Russia has to fix Belarus' problems, while they're not getting much in return. That's why an outright annexation would be a pretty high priority.
