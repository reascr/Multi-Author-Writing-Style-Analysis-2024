There's also another video about of some Ukrainians laughing themselves to death as they test like 2-3 captured Russian plates stacked on top of each other and they failed to stop a 5.56 round.
There's a vid about of some Wagner guys comparison testing their own body armour and captured Ukrainian stuff. The Wagner guys are genuinely shocked that a ballistic plate can stop 5.45 point blank. Their own plates didn't.
But, again, sucks for Ukrainians. Sucks really bad. But if Ukrainians want to keep all of their territory, this is the price they will inevitably have to pay. Only Ukrainians can make the decision on whether to keep fighting or not. All we can do is give them as much as we can of what they ask from us.
In the grand scheme of things, however, it could be a net positive for the world (Western, especially). A semi-demilitarised Russia can attempt another invasion again within a decade. One which has sacrificed nearly all of its arsenal and a big chunk of its young population will have a harder time ever rebounding to its prewar level of power. Thus, another two years of war might permanently remove Russia as a significant geopolitical player altogether.
