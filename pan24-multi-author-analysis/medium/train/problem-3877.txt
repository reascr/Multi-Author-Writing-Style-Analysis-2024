And I get it, it’s going to be expensive and painful to switch to electric nationwide, but even the mainstream media has already picked sides while trying to appear “balanced”.
They'll require a socket for a 100 watt incandescent bulb on the appliances. The bulb will turn on during operation and the machine won't function without it actually lighting.
Listened to a show on NPR the other day where they talked about it, and how there’s going to need to be a lot of pain switching to electric furnaces on the north east coat what with blizzards knocking out power, and I was like; a shit ton of gas furnaces and ovens stop working when the power goes out anyways, because they have safer electric starters instead of pilot lights and thermostats are electric as well. Not once was it even mentioned, even to the point where they linked gas stoves to emergency heating, which you are NEVER supposed to do.
Had gas furnaces in most of the places I’ve lived, and at all of them, when the electricity got knocked out the heat stopped working. Sure, theoretically you could start the gas furnace or oven with a lit taper, but that’s a quick road to an explosion or gas poisoning.
