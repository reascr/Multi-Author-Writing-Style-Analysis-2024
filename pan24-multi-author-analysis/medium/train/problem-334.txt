TL.R for people who clearly didn't read the post: European countries are selling Russian oil to the UK under their own flag, bypassing the "no russia" policy through a loophole. There you go no more circle jerk of 'UK bad'.
The has been copied to its discussion over in /r/europe, and makes it a bit clearer (and also goes into the ship-to-ship transfers):
However, maritime experts say the way the UK registers imports, as well as the increased use of ship-to-ship transfers, will make it difficult for the UK to sanction Russian oil.
When they pull into port, ships have to provide the country of origin of their cargo â€” in the case of oil, where it is refined. Figures on oil imports are compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HM Revenue & Customs. HMRC registers the value of a shipment, the country from which it was dispatched and its country of origin.
This information is collated by the ONS. However, it is the country of dispatch that is used to measure the nationality of an import, not the country where it was produced. This means a cargo of Chinese-made goods could be registered as being from Germany if it were imported to the UK by a German firm.
Eurostat, which produces trade statistics for EU countries, instead classifies imports according to country of origin.
