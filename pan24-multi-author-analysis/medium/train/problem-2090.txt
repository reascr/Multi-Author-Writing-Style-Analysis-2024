Shame we had to be the Canary in the coal mine. Glad Brazil also handled their insurrection so decisively instead of doing what we did. At least some are learning from our rightwing catastrophes. Right now our rightwing are trying desperately to incite a race war and civil war and so far we've been a bit lacking in our attempts to quash that unfortunately, so however our politicians botch this just remember "dont do what they did" and you'll already be ahead of the game.
We literally had people (though to be fair, he also mentioned that a large number of Spanish women were already using it, many of them well-off and able to access it from abroad).
Spain's right-wingers are not the same as in the US. If you've ever spoken to one and asked them about their views of the guardias' abuses against the Catalonians, the Galicians, the Moroccans, or how we used to ban gitanos from entering towns/cities which prevented them from being able to access schools/hospitals until 1976--you will discover that not one of them had any compassion to start with. Assholes like the Vox party () want all of us to go back to living like our parents and none of us want it.
Glad to see them react so quickly. Adding barriers through suggesting extra procedures and referrals out of “concern” is just the first step before they make them required, then further term limited, etc.
And why would they when maternity (and paternity) leave are paid by the government, not the company?
