One of the biggest and easiest things the US could do to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels is the conversion of our power grid from fossil fuel power plants to nuclear with supplementary wind, solar and hydroelectric wherever possible. More than 60% of our national power supply comes from the burning of fossil fuels, that is not at all necessary and hasn’t been for decades. The burning of fossil fuels for power generation in the US accounts for over 30% of our yearly carbon emissions, that in and of itself should be the biggest motivator for a move. The fact that it would make gas for combustion vehicles (which are still necessary for the moment) cheaper as well as make the cost of electricity cheaper as well are just huge bonuses on top of that.
The last thing that American politicians want is to establish a legal precedent that political figures are legally liable for assassinations that they ordered… lol. No one should be shocked by this ruling.
I hate to say this, but what would prosecuting the Prince even look like? How the fuck would they get him into court? It’s shitty, but if prosecuting heads of state was as easy as just announcing their guilt, things would get complicated fast. I hope this bastard gets what’s coming to him, but this was never going to happen the way people wanted it to.
