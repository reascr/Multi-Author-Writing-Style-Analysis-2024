- Ukrainians are bolstering their defences between Belarus and Kiyev to prevent previous year scenario.
- Russian puppet in Belarus claims that Ukrainian defensive tactics "imposes a risk for Belarus"... ðŸ¤¦.
Yeah - if russian army wouldn't be able to invade Ukraine then that will probably just take over Minsk and enact Belarus as their own Oblast.
Despite Russia's general incompetence, it's hard enough as it is for Ukraine to defend its territory. Going through Moldova and Belarus would be a death sentence as the Russian propaganda puppets there would decry it as an invasion by Ukraine and how Russia was right all along. And I'm fairly certain Ukraine would stop receiving outside help at that point as well.
Exactly my thoughts. If Belarus would kick the Russian army out of its territory, they'd be no reason to mobilize at the border. And I'm sure Ukraine would be happy to have one less front to worry about.
In Moldova, there's the possibility they are invited in by the Moldovan government, removing the risk of losing western support. And if successful, it would make for a more stable Moldova, and a western border that doesn't require as much of a military presence from Ukraine any longer.
Russia totally didnâ€™t get caught with written plans to take over Belarus in the coming years. That story didnâ€™t just come out. Itâ€™s Ukraine in their own territory that are the problem.
