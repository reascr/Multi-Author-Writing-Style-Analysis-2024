Anyone remember 10-15 years ago where we thought or at least assumed that Putin was some sort of mastermind, always playing 4d chess? And now it's obvious he's been kicked in the head a few many times, forces his impulsive & terrible decisions onto others, is completely disinterested in the massive suffering he causes his own people. We all assumed he was at least average intelligence, I mean he worked for the KGB Nope.
As recently as a year ago, he seemed relatively invincible. This has completely destroyed his prestige--and a dictator without prestige is really just a dead man walking.
A war between nuclear armed nations would be a loss for everyone. North Korea got nuclear weapons to ensure the Kim dynasty doesn't get the Gaddafi treatment. So you won't be seeing western planes airstriking North Korea. Cost would be too high.
Less than that. Like 3 years ago there were articles about how the US might not be able to stand up to the combined forces or China and Russia. Turns out Russia has almost nothing.
It will be highly unlikely that we will see a large scale war between major powers like China, Russia, or NATO. Far more likely that eventually the US will turn those weapons on themselves or they will rust away.
That was me too, no way Putin is fucking stupid enough to launch a land war in Eurasia of a country that is 40 million people and a bazillion NATO besties.
