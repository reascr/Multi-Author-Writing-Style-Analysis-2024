There's also the fact that the local areas that host things like the Olympics or the World Cup are typically screwed over while these events are going on and for several years afterwards because they suddenly have massive stadiums and other facilities they may or may not be able to use yet still have to maintain. Not to mention all the environmental damage that happens as a result of all this.
Yeah I watched a show about the building of the stadiums in Qatar and they said one of them was being built for 11 matches. All that work, blood, money and time for 11 matches. Crazy.
I'm thinking I'm just blessed to have a saggy sack. They are, according to my CNA girlfriend, on par with many of her 80+ year old residents while being in my early 30's. Good news is that if I ever get lost at sea these puppies will keep me afloat like a pair of hairy buoys.
I remember because, well, you don't really forget having to tell your trainer you were late because you accidentally shit on your balls.
But then I wouldn't be able to easily flop my beanbag on top of my penis and tell the old lady we have a pet snail, or wrap the penis in between the balls while turning it sideways so that it looks like a hamburger, or stretch the sack as far as it will go and tucking the whole kit in like some kind of weirdo. Hard to do all that with a tight set of balls.
