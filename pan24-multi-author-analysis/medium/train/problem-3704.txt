wait a minute, I was fined incredibly unfairly by a Radical Left Judge who only wants to hurt Trump so he can make Sleepy Joe look better. remember, I came in, Obama left us with nothing, I said what happened to our Military, "he sold it to China, Sir," oh isn't that nice, here you have very strong Trump Supporting Patriots and now we have to clean up after the Illegal Radical Left. and we wouldn't even have a Country right now if it wasn't for Trump, and they should make me King probably, we'll see what happens.
