If Trump waits till after after getting spanked by DeSantis in the primary to run third party he would have mere months to organize and execute 50 campaigns to gather signatures to fulfill ballot access law requirements. An insurmountable task even for a former president. Well that is if he wasn't such a petulant child trap in 80 year old man's body.
