Some of them are but not that many. They released maybe a few thousand prisoners, so no where close to the numbers that they are losing. Mostly it is just normal Russians from poor cities.
they say that, but honestly it might just be propaganda to get more prisoners to sign up, they probably all died. Could but true of course, but it's Russia so information like that needs to be taken with a grain of salt.
They have nukes, and invading them or whatnot is a bit over the line. So everyone is hoping Putin will decide the price is too high, and bring everyone home. There aren't a lot of viable options other than grinding it out. Unless one considers a Ukrainian surrender a viable option, and I don't think Ukraine is currently cool with that one. Nor is the rest of Europe eager for Russia to win and then start to regroup for the next invasion.
Those helping to arm Ukraine are wary that their weapons be used for offense rather than defense, where that line lies. German tanks (meaning tanks supplied by Germany, not necessarily operated by them) rolling through Red Square would be touchy. I'm not opposing more and more capable weaponry being supplied. Just saying there's a reason countries are a little cautious.
