There is a bias, but it’s so competitive that Republicans could win both the 2nd and 3rd district if they chose the right person. This map favors moderates.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Look at gerrymandering in Florida where they cram Democrats into districts with a 49 and 51 point advantage and intentionally skew formerly competitive districts towards Republicans with ultra safe 14 point advantage districts.
If this was the kind of gerrymandering Republicans did, I wouldn’t be as upset. Correct me if I’m wrong and 538 is wrong, but New Mexico intentionally created two highly competitive districts with a +4 point Democratic edge.
A 14 point district means, on average, we expect the vote to be 43% Democrat and 57% Republican. New Mexico’s Gerrymandering is 52% Democrat and 48% Republican.
