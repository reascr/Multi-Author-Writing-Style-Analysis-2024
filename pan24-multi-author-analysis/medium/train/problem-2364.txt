In other news, McCarthy awarded George Santos for his loyalty to the GOP by giving him seats on the Science and Small Business committees.
The NY Supreme Court ordered him to pay damages as well as imposed some pretty unheard of restrictions on any future charity participation for Trump (and a few for his kids too). So not much by far but not nothing either.
This whole scenario reads like a goddamn Parks and Rec script. On one hand, fuck Trump. On the other, I kinda love it for how downright bizarre it is, and for the fact that nobody got hurt for once (which is usually a common theme in Trump stories).
I kinda think he just saw an opportunity to sit his ass in front of a camera and went for it. No plan, no thinking through it. Just stimulus -> response. The sheer brazenness of it might be admirable if it were literally anyone else.
