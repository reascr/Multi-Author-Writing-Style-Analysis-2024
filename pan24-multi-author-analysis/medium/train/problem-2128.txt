All submissions to /r/politics need to be explicitly about current US politics. This means that if a subject has political implications but does not directly discuss politics it is most likely off topic.
To be explicitly political, submissions should focus on one of the following things that have political significance:
Information and opinions concerning the running of US governments, courts, public services and policy-making.
Private political actions and stories such as demonstrations, lobbying, candidacies and funding and political movements, groups and donors.
And how many "Conservative" Fascist Republican politicians are bought and sold by these businesses, consistently lowering their corporate tax rate and deregulating industry for 4+ decades?
Now that they’ve shown they’re fully willing to be fascists we can’t take anything they say at face value anymore. The culture wars are just a means to an ends and the people they hurt are simply collateral damage. They never cared about people to begin with. All they care about is power.
They understand it and they are terrified. That's why conservatives are going after women, LGBTQ+ people, black and brown people. They have to create a lower caste of "others" in order to maintain power in their dwindling numbers.
It is long pastvtime that all of us in the targeted "other" groups ban together. Even if we don't agree on everything, we need to unite against fascist oppression.
Fox "News" is a terrorist organization whose terror is Propaganda. There is no mistaking this after January 6th, they are willing to lie completely and thoroughly to the American public in their support of sedition and installing an unelected Fascist to rule the US for life.
Fox "News" and the anchors who spouted the lies, the ownership who supported the lies, should be stripped of their financial assets and imprisoned for sedition as the terrorists that they are.
