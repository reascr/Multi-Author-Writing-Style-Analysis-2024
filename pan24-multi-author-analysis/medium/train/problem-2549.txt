MDMA has been shown to be very effective in treating PTSD, but causes extreme negative side effects in depressives / bi polar. Shrooms is extremely effective for depression anxiety and addiction but very bad for schizophrenics, etc.
It’s why it’s good this is finally getting actual medical acceptance so it can be studied and applied properly.
While I, a depressive-anxious one, am thriving on anti-depressants and monthly psilocin dosing … I have lost a few friends to schizophrenia, which seemed exacerbated by LSD. I also believe MDMA exacerbated a few friends’ depression issues as well. This was mostly back in the 90s, when we didn’t have the such internet powers to help us connect the dots.
The thing is, afterwards; no matter what I did or thought, there’s this feeling that I “understand” and “everything is ok now” vs my old depression feelings of “everything is not ok and it’s probably all my fault.”.
Note: I’m in Seattle, where psilocybin has been decriminalized, so while I don’t have a truly legal source, im not quite as nervous about procuring it as I used to be.
