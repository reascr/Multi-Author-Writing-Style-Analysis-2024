Peacefully starting in Donbass. Ukraine should be neutral. No war. Everyone lives and Europe isn’t facing their worst economic crisis since WWII. There’s been absolutely zero peace negotiations. It’s stupid because no one wins in war. Europe was also stupid for over reliance on renewables before they operate at scale. But don’t tell the central planners that. They know better.
I mean, in that case Russia would've been not great, not terrible. And Russia wants the world to see it as both of those things, although terrible in another fashion. It wanted the power it used to have and all due respect to Norway, it's...a place, as good as many others I'm sure but Russia is after a sense of presence and power few are able to maintain.
To add insult to injury: Russia, with its wast natrual resources _could_ have been in a political and economical situation en par with Norway. Pr capita. They _could_ have had excellent social security, health care, free education and son on. And and a petro trust fund that would've dwarfed all funds in existence.
But, instead they got Putin, oligarchs and is run by a mafia organisation with a _massive_ and correct inferiority complex.
