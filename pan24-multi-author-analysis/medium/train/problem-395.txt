Unfortunately this is how Congress is run now for over a decade now, both when Dems or Repubs are in change. Nothing gets done until a ridiculously pork and nonsense filled last minute must pass omnibus spending bill gets rushed through at the zero hour. It truly sucks.
It truly does, it’s so horrible and aggravating. Let alone they purposely tied Ukraine funding into the bill in order to jam it through…which is extremely messed up on multiple levels. So many agencies, departments and organizations need massive audits and there budgets are beyond inflated, because they blow all the money they didn’t spend at the end of the fiscal year so they can get more money. It’s all such a headache….
The budget issues you mentioned are awful too. I have a friend who works as an engineer for the army . He says even if they don't need their full budget for the year, they likely will the next year, so they have to spend it or they potentially lose it. It's such a wasteful and dumb way to run things.
So that’s why Zelensky is flying down, help push this through Congress quickly. Over 4,000 pages dropped at 1:45 am right before they want to get out the door for Christmas break, wonder what else is crammed into this bill besides the bullet points being talked about. crazy to think people seem to care more about morons tax returns then where their own tax dollars are going.
