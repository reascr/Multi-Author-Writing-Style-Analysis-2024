WV Governor Jim Justice: “I think we only have 12 kids, maybe, in our state that are transgender-type kids. I mean, for crying out loud, Stephanie. I sign hundreds of bills — hundreds of bills. This is not a priority to me.".

Because targeting a tiny, marginalized portion of the population is easy and people love to have a villian to hate.
