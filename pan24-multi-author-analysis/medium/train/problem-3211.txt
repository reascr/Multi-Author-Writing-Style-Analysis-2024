So in theory the government could ban every single type of armament except say knives, and you'd still have the right to bear arms. Nothing in there prevents the government from determining the scope or range of weapons we can own. So far most guns are within the goalposts, but nothing stops a future liberal court from narrowing those goalposts further leaving guns on the outside. Like any of our rights that are not explicitly spelled out in the Constitution, which few are since the world has changed a little bit in the last 250 years, they are up for grabs so long as you stack the court in the way your agenda dictates. SCOTUS has said as much when they ruled on the Dobbs.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
