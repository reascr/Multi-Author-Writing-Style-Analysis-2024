Montréal and Québec City feel a lot more European than any other place I've seen in the US and Canada for sure.
it is also pro-business in many ways, it cherishes the concept of "" but is also very much in favor of state intervention at the same time. As such, in Quebec, large corporations are in bed with the Government as long as those Corporations uphold a "social mission", meaning they are expected to contribute to the Quebec society and its workers.
Quebec is a strange animal, it has elements of Conservatism that have to do with protecting the french language in a sea of Anglophones in North America and a spirit of Progressiveness in dealing with social issues such as gay and Trans rights, feminism and the absolute equality of women and men or criminal rehabilitation.
my impression when visiting it was always that the linguo-cultural conservativism there is also supposed to push against politically conservative anglo-american ideas, and to get into closer contact to the political ideologies of other romance-speaking languages in Europe and the Americas.
