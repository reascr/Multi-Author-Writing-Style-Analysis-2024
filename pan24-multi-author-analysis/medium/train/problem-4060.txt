Men get their licenses suspended and thrown in jail for an endless cycle of poverty and incarceration if they don't pay child support so they can pay their rent.
The Treasury Department is set to begin taking special measures to keep paying the government's bills on Thursday as the divided Congress braces for a lenhy and difficult debate over raising the debt ceiling. This comes as the federal government is approaching the debt limit of roughly $31.4 trillion. The Treasury Department plans to deploy extraordinary measures, such as suspending investments for certain government accounts, to keep paying obligations until early June. However, newly empowered House Republicans are vowing to not raise the borrowing limit unless President Biden agrees to cuts in federal spending, while President Biden has said he will not negotiate conditions for a debt-limit increase.
The report says they don't want to increase the ceiling if gov spending isn't reduced by Biden. I know the usual bullshit the reps do but this seems like a fair demand right?
Like when we start to go to debt, we reduce our spending. If the gov doesn't reduce spending then the ceiling will rise above and above.
