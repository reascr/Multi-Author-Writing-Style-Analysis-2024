So the Architect is in charge of security, maintenance, daily building operations, etc. Over 2,000 people work for the Office of the AOC.
I wonder how the duties of AoC and Capitol Police intersect. Chief Sund announced his resignation 1 day after the Jan 6 incident and resigned a few days later. It should be noted that one officer of the Capitol Police died Jan 6 during the incident and many others were injured.

The title is a relic of the early days of the United States, when most of the founding fathers were Freemasons.
