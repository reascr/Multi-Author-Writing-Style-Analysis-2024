On Halloween I had an argument with a well-educated family member over why her children’s candy was likely not riddled with drugs. She was convinced “the Skittles are really fentanyl made to look like Skittles, and people are putting the drugs in real packaging and passing it out to kids”. Nevermind my argument that no drug dealer/user is going to A) give hundreds of dollars in drugs away for free; B) give drugs to/kill random kids and ruin his business; C) go to all the trouble of carefully opening Skittles packages, removing the real Skittles and substituting the fentanyl Skittles, then resealing them invisibly just to do A and B. I reminded her of how many needles, razor blades, poison, Quaaludes, and/or bits of crack we found in our treats, or anyone’s, back in the day despite the rampant rumors of people putting such things in Halloween candy. Nope, all the Skittles in her kids bags still went right into the trash. But she didn’t give a shit about the possible drugs, needles, or poison in the rest of the candy because that wasn’t part of the latest rumor making the rounds.
The reason I stopped listening to NPR is because of their middle-of-the-road, nonchalant attitude to even the most inflammatory news story. And their Cletus safari segments during election season only help to give a voice to misinformed, bigoted voters.
