When you have a nuke, you gotta show the world you are willing to use it to protect yourself from outside attack. MAD doesn't work simply because you have the bomb. You have to go out of your way to show you will be willing to use it so other countries get the point.
Saddam did have WMDs. We know he had WMDs because America gave them to him to use against Iran. The issue wasn't as to whether or not he had (had as in past tense) WMDs it was to whether or not he was actively manufacturing them. Which he wasn't.
In reality, I feel awful for their people. Their resources are squandered to maintain a mostly mediocre military. The North Korean people deserve better than an autocrat and her chubby little brother carrying on their demented father's pipe dream.
I don’t think he had what Bush claimed but I still wonder why he wouldn’t still have some hidden away.
Let's put it this way: would you be more scared of a guy who owns a gun but keeps it at home, or a guy actively waving the gun around in public with his finger on the trigger? Now imagine that gun is a nuke. And as much as we like to make fun of North Korea for it, it seems to be working quite well. North Korea is not getting messed with through military means (granted, that we know of) and they aren't like Iran who is getting their facilities bombed by outside powers. Because North Korea has nukes. And more importantly because they are constantly making others remember they have a willingness to use such weapons if needed.
