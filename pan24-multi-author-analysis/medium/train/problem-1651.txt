At least five years ago, I lost a friendship over this idiot. I posted something about him and his mental health struggles. At the time, Kanye was openly admitting that he took Lexapro and was “crazy” without it. This old friend of mine came to his defense and said that I couldn’t possibly know anything about his mental state and that I shouldn’t be practicing armchair psychology. He said that plenty of genius’s were seen as “crazy” in their lives and that their genius was only recognized later. Ugh. I was a HUGE Kanye fan— up until he began to spiral out of control. Then I got concerned. And now very disappointed and disgusted.
