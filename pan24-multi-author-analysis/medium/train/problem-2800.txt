We've got a problem in this country where public service is attracting assholes, grifters, and sociopaths by the truckload. I don't care which whether you lean left or right (in normal times), the people you elect should have a common decency about them. They should be in it to do some good for the country, state, county, city, etc. Not for personal power, wealth, or ambition.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

If the rest of us just used some basic common sense when voting, we could bring this 'darkest timeline' era to an end this week.
