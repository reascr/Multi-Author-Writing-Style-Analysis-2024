To the best of my knowledge, a habeas corpus review can't overturn a conviction, but it can alter the sentencing of a conviction. So rather than the death penalty, this guy might "only" get life in prison if he's successful in his review.
I also am no legal expert, but it looks like a slam dunk case for a habeas corpus review. The juror in question wasn't any juror, it was the jury foreperson. This is an important thing to consider because the foreperson has the duty to ensure the fairness of the deliberation process (making sure all jurors have equal time to speak, making sure nobody bullies or influences other jurors, etc.). If the juror in question did indeed have a personal and business connection to the victims, then there is the possibility that she was not just biased, but that she influenced other jurors rather than coming to a conclusion based on the evidence presented.
Kind of makes my head spin that the GOP supports and his black nationalism but eh... logical consistency isn't a strong suit of the patriot-treason party.
