That sounds about right. For all China's bullshit, they are a fairly rational actor. There's probably no desire for any military alliance with Russia. But this arrangement keeps the West occupied longer with Russia and means cheaper imports for China. It's a great deal for them.
The issue is that the west is very dependent on Chinese labor. That is not going to change any time soon, and China knows this. China being sanctioned unfortunately hurts the west just as much as China, so it's kind of a moot point.
I hate it but it makes sense. China wants to have a safe and consistent source of oil imports and Russia can provide that. Also China dislikes Europe for the century of humiliation, so China is more than happy to take actions that would annoy/piss of Europe.
Also China is authoritarian as all hell and democracy existing and thriving poses an ideological threat to the CCP.
Also while they deal with a very real economic crisis having failed to fully transition their economy to one that will allow them to maintain their growth is gonna take a hit, their construction/housing bubble along with automation will end up also taking a toll on their economy in the next few decades so itâ€™ll be interesting to watch how they (CCP) react to it.
