Same situation, but I'm from Florida! I was working a full-time office management job for $12/hr. The minimum wage in FL will be $15 in 2026 and then they'll use that to never increase it again bc "wE jUsT rAiSeD iT". I moved here last year, and I'm finally not living on credit, and all my consumer debt from that will be paid off within the next year. I literally thought I'd be living on credit forever. It's INSANE what a few more dollars per hour can do to improve a person's life. I will rant about it forever lol.
