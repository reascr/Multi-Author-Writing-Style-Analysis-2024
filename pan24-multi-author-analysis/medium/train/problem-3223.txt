Idk man, ritualistically eating the body and drinking the blood of their “Christ” every Sunday (or more sparingly only on special holidays) sounds like the stable behavior of a collective group of individuals rooted firmly in a well established and grounded reality.
I REEEAAALLLLLY want to see this kind of question asked to his face and recorded when comparing jesus' mother being turned away to stay out in the cold in a stable to him shipping a bunch of migrants across the states to a politicians home Christmas eve during a 'once in a generation' storm.
Christmas is just a stolen pagan holiday, which is why it's in December and has nothing to do with Jesus' birth. A lot of people will say that they made a Jesus version of the pagan party to be more inclusive, but the opposite is true. The Church (as an arm of political power) was pressured into a December 25th celebration because people were abandoning the church as it was forbidden to celebrate the pagan holiday even though it was so popular.
