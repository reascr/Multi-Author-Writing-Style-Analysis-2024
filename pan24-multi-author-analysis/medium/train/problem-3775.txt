what climate challenge? The trash mountain is killing people a lot faster than how it affects climate change. The climate challenge is a lot less relevant than those who are being poisoned right now.
But there is no solution. You can't process the trash fast enough to even slow down its accumulation. Obviously there is no capacity to move the trash away or process them. You can try to move people away but I doubt there is the capacity to do so right now.
So basically everyone will just watch the disaster unfold with fascination, rant a lot and secretly relief that we are not over there (except those affected).
There are predictions that the entire subcontinent will be uninhabitable by the 2030's due to climate change.
They won't be able to get over the Himalayas or across the Gobi. They would have to go through Pakistan northwards to Siberia. Pakistan would probably be uninhabitable too.
Also I think that the 'sexiest' solution to world leaders with huge populations having to immigrate is fixing that global population decline issue. Whatever country takes in the most immigrants in the next 50 years will punch waaaay above its weight as every other nations population declines faster and harder.
I think Pakistan is a much better example than India. It literally did have a climate catastrophe this year, flooded most of the country (it's on one river system after all) and a huge population and next to Taliban Afghanistan.
