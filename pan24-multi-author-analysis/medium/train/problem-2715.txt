i don't think Brazil have any sort of Rangers or anything like that. in some parts there are some parts of local policies that does those jobs. but not their own thing.
Brazillian here. We already have , even if these were mostly made meaningless during Bolsonaro's reign. I have no idea why one would create something anew while the know-how already exists and only needs to be given 'roids & enforced. While I'm appreciative of the spirit, Lula will get jaded looks from brazillians who are more austere and voted for him because the alternative was too horrible to consider.
I'm Brazilian too... Just to clarify. IBAMA isn't a police force and the Institution already work with Federal Police to do something (arrests and etc.), but the Lula idea is to have a Federal Police branch dedicated to environmental issues, like we have for the federal highways.
Maybe some those people on the existing force need to be cleaned out because they’re corrupt. In cases like this, it’s best to just start a new team from scratch, led by people you trust to not be corrupt or let the team be (at least immediately) corrupted.
and if you dislike that, the only one who have to blame is the judge in the case that soon as he made Lula unable to run in that elections, got into Bolsonaro's government.
also, between the secret budget and all the land that has been stolen(what? you think the parts of amazon that was burning was properly bought?), is really hard to tell who was the biggest criminal.
