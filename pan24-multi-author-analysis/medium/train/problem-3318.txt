As I was growing up I realized I had a major douche in every generation so I'm very familiar with being on the receiving side of the narcissist spectrum.
Honestly don't understand why people are acting like any of this is new. Trump hired the likes of Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon as his WH advisors back in 2016. Both of these people, as well others in Trump's orbit at the time, had ties to white supremacists. These associations have been going on for years and haven't exactly been secret.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Tbh I hadn't heard anything about Milo recently until he showed up in Ye's post dinner rant video, I was guessing she just got played like anyone else that blindly sucks up to Trump.
