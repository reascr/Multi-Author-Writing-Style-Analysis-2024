This is actually really cool and also a great idea. Hopefully successes from this encourage it's uptake elsewhere. We are extincting species faster than we can record/sample/catalogue them.
Also as much as I hate agribusiness, if they could be made to realize how important genetic conservation is, it would be a great thing for humanity.
But the cynic in me also knows at some point a AgriCorp will come along and "partner" with this Uni, to turn it into a marketable product. Hopefully when this happens, it at least will show a strong business case for conservation and more seed banks sooner, rather than later.
Not being snarky or anything, but the Svalbard Global Seed Vault already safeguards duplicates of 1,165,041 seed varieties from almost every country in the world. More This isn't really a novel idea.
Yeah it sounds good to me…I think some people just don’t like seeing the words “Israel” and “DNA” anywhere near eachother.
Corporate ownership of the few hardy crops in an agricultural industry where genetic diversity is at an all time low would be dystopian cyberpunk. This isn't that. Far from it.
1. Corporation comes along and "partners" with the University to study/develop into a marketable product.
In Australia, where are Unis receive public funding, it's sometimes referred to as PPP - Public Private Partnership. They are usually with depts of govt, but I've also seen quite a few that involved Uni research and also the CSIRO (a govt research institute).
