Of all of the things that Hunter has been accused of that have a direct connection and implicate his father, like his father not knowing anything about Hunter’s business dealings and the connections back to things that were done while he was The VP, you don’t think there are ethical issues that have brought to light that are worth reviewing? I will agree that I don’t like wasting tax payer money on BS investigations but we spent four years looking for Russian stuff around the Cheeto that appeared really flimsy and that persons in the FBI knew we’re not legit yet they still did FISA work on. Should we ware money on BS, no, should these oligarchy politicians be above the law, no. Unless they all believe that they will be held accountable for unethical behavior we will never get decent representatives in Washinon. My problem with people that lie is that they lie and become good at it. I’d fire them in a minute if they worked for me but we tolerate it and worse support if at the government level. I guess that’s why we will get the government that we deserve, we allow it.
