So many people miss this. Why can Israel give warnings before destroying launch sites, offering civilians^^^‡ an opportunity to flee? Why can Israel take the time to locate exact location of launchers and use precision weaponry?
Because so many of the rockets can be stopped by the Iron Dome. If they couldn't be, Israel would have to hit back hard and fast, since they can't just let rockets fly without intervention. Palestinians would die in droves. It would be an absolute horror.
^^^‡ this also means that Hamas/PIJ terrorists doing the launching can escape. Israel knows this, and has consistently shown no qualms about allowing them to do so to try and keep civilian deaths to a minimum.
Not only that, when the shit finally got bad enough the only option Israel had before the ID was to send boots in and that’s a literal horror show. Now you’re talking artillery, close air support, all of it. It’s a blood bath.
1. This happens all the time (both the launching of rockets and, thankfully, [most of] their interception).
Edit - Funny shit here, the guy asked for an answer, I made this post, and his response was “can no longer do it because you’re now muted”. So much for wanting an answer.
