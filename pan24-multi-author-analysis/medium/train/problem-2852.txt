Mostly because CBS knows their audience is mostly ignorant about the rest of the world and realized that if they wrote British Columbia in the tagline the smooth brained readers would have a stroke trying to reconcile the UK with South America. Lives were saved.
Which is great, BC is just following the rest of the west coast in this. Where it gets super fucked up is the government takes “shouldn’t be punished for being addicts.” And translates it to mean “we won’t arrest anyone for anything.” And it’s a fuckin nightmare. Parts of west coast cities look like some poorly rendered md max movie set, we’re effectively held hostage by camps of drug addicts who are immune from the law. The quality of life plunges and then everyone loses every ounce of sympathy for the addicts and homeless in general. These laws only work when you have mandatory inpatient drug treatment programs for those not functioning anymore. If you can’t do that and you can’t function in society without pilfering neighborhoods, you belong in jail. Not for rehabilitation, but for the protection of society.
