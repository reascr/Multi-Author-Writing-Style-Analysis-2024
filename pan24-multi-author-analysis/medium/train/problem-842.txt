And then I thought about it… and realized that I did not leave abruptly. I started having more doubts than usual four months before I started asking questions, and it’d take another two months for me to lose belief. It’d be several months before I told anyone I knew. But during that time there would be instances where I would blurt out a leading, pointed question out of nowhere in a conversation — because I felt completely alone and unheard. I kept up my guard for well over a year, and struggled to do anything else.
