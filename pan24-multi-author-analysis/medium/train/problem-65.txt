"On the day of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Tisza immediately traveled to Vienna where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von HÃ¶tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking Serbia. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to Franz Joseph saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war. He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics.".
Yeah but why would we? Last I checked we are sitting at 1 million refugees and like 400 tanks sent to Ukraine. Feel free to deliver an aircraft carrier filled to brim with strategic bombers if you think it can pass through our borders and can help in beating Russia. Absolutely nobody would oppose the idea and you probably could even do it without anyone finding out until it's already in use (Polish forums specifically tell people NOT TO share any pics/videos of anything military related that goes to Ukraine).
