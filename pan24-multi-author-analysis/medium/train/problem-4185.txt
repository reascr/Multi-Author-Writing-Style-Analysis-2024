The thing that frustrates me is McCarthy and Moscow Mitch McConnell will just write this off as woke lib noise and not an indication how unpopular their actions are.
The video there of McConnell extending his hand and the people walking on by after shaking hands with Pelosi and Schumer is worth watching. And as Pink Floyd would ask, Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?
I think he was talking about his heart hurting for the officers. They lost people because McConnell and McCarthy refused to stand up for them.
I mean, we’ll wait for OP to clarify, but I don’t think very many people are feeling bad for McConnell or McCarthy. They just got a small taste of how many, many people feel about their betrayal of America. Personally, it might be the first real “fuck you” that may have registered for them. (better make sure thry get it, just in case).
