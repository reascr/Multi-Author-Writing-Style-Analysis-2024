But words also have an effect, and they should be viewed with the actions as a whole to really know what and why they're up to something.
When the founding fathers of the United States signed a document saying "All men are created equal," most of them didn't mean it and their actions didn't match it. But one would have to be both ridiculously cynical and historically illiterate to think the fact they wrote those words didn't matter.
For two and a half centuries, the words they never really meant have lived on as a sword in the hands of the oppressed. The world is a better place today because they claimed high ideals as their justification for creating America as an independent nation, and because they thereby permanently opened America to rebuke with its own hypocrisy.
When I was studying Linguistics we talked about this a lot in Pragmatics - the difference between speech and speech actions.
Part of this divide is that that document was very much a speech action, and embodied a lot of authority.
It's like how saying the word fire is speech, but shouting fire is a speech action. Saying "you're married" is usually speech but it's a speech act when a marriage commissioner says it in appropriate context.
How that relates to this topic is China making official statements carrying a claim is an action. When you see news stories about Chinese officials posting things on their social media that's speech.
Yes, it's given our society a goal to work towards, and to always be improving upon. The United States is not close to perfect, but we are a freekin' awesome country, as long as we keep expanding the notion of equality to every person who is an American. It's the best idea that a country could be founded upon, IMO. Very powerful words.
