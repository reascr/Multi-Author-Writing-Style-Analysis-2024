The 3 Appeals Court members hearing the case, all Republican nominees, 2 of them by Trump, saw right through this charade and called it a “side show”. The time has come for there to be consequences for Trump’s useful idiots who are responsible for who are egregiously waisting the court’s time to suffer consequences.
