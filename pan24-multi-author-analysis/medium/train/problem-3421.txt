We won't. The Doomers were wrong in the 70s claimed that hundreds of millions would die and they're wrong today. That's not to say that nothing needs to be done but things need to be done and they will largely be done (even if they are not done in the best way). Most people will not starve, starvation generally comes not from agricultural production but from broken political and economics systems that are okay with people starving. See Colonialism and Communism.
Grains are commodities. Grains shipped to Europe/Middle East are grains those countries won't buy from the rest of the market.
You reduce the supply of grain to the market? Those countries will buy grain from elsewhere, grains that otherwise would've gone to developing nations would be sold to Europe and Middle East because they make more money that way.
Onr important question: do they have any grain at all? This harvest must have been slim, with the war ongoing and I have a suspicion that Europe simply bought all the available wheat and corn.
Europe faced a drought that has not happened in 500 years, crop yields were minuscule here. Yet bread prices have not skyrocketed. That means Europe bought corn and wheat from somewhere. Ukraine would be a logical source.
