People don’t care about us down here in Florida. They just yell about it being a red state and to ignore that it’s becoming a fascist regime. People forget that the whole reason this state went red was because of Covid: they moved here from our governor, DeShitass, refused to follow federal mandate and opened the state back up early, killing a lot of people. Of course, with such loose restrictions, all the antivaxxing fuckers moved here. DeShitasses last election was a landslide of 20% lead, where as the one before they all moved in was only like a 1.4% lead. It’s a incursion that almost makes me think he planned to attract a bunch of people to make sure he got the vote, but that’s just conspiratorial, no one would manipulate their state to stay in power as a pseudo dictator would they?
