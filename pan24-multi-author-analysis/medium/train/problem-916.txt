Viking have had a bad history in Australian waters. Comes on top of mechanical problems pre pandemic. Princess is also having problems with access to various ports and sounds because of fear of something else. A lot of problems for the cruise industry.
The anti fouling paint on the hulls exterior must have failed. The fungus would be below the ships waterline and not a threat to the passengers. The environment the ship gathered the fungus in was probably not compatible with their final destination and this is a precautionary measure to protect the environment. Viking, like most companies, has great ships and will probably need an extra layer of red paint to keep this from occurring again. This is common of all types of vessels that operate in different ecosystems!
The rest of your comment sounds reasonable but "Viking, like most companies, has great ships" obviously isn't true if they've cut corners on preventative maintenance so much that they're being denied entry into their ports of call...
