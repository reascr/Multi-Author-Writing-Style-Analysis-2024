But the longer Apple's ominous silence goes on, the longer it seems possible they really are planning on deplatforming Twitter, so... yeah. Good guess, i suppose, Elon.
Based on rumors Musk started. I'm 90% sure Musk is trying to generate this controversy for the express reason of convincing skittish investors to stop running towards the doors by "tricking" Apple - which had mostly been minding its own business, ad spending aside - into stating officially that it's not currently planning on deplatforming Twitter.
This, it was speculated that since they ARE pulling ads and that they did kick others out over moderation that they WILL do it but Tim himself hasn't said anything.
I'd call it ironic that the people who scream the loudest about free speech are threatening to not buy apple products for apple exercising their 1st amendment rights. The reason I said I'd call it ironic is because I don't know if the ones screaming understand irony. I know they don't understand the 1st amendment.
