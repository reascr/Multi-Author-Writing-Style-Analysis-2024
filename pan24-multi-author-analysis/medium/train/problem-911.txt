I remember when the movie came out. A very mainstream magazine (I believe Life, but I’m not positive) had an article/photo spread on the movie. The issue of the nudity of a very young girl was raised (I don’t believe this nudity of the boy was even questioned) but it wasn’t really condemned. It was presented more as an example of Europeans being more open to sexuality than prudish Americans. The movie was seen as “daring” or “ edgy” but I don’t remember there being any real outrage over it. No effort to ban it or anything. I remember the article because I remembered Olivia. I was really hoping I would see more of her in a movie more interesting than Shakespeare. Times were really different then. There was plenty of opposition to nudity and explicit sex; probably more than now, but I recall much in the way of “ age of consent” issues.
The actors, who were 15 and 16 years old at the time, say they were assured they could wear flesh-coloured underwear during the bedroom scene, but on the morning of the shoot were pressured to perform naked, against their wishes. Subsequently they were assured that no nudity would be visible in the final cut, but Whiting's bare bottom and Hussey's bare breasts are visible in the final film. The actors are suing the studio for sexual exploitation and distribution of nude images of a minor.
