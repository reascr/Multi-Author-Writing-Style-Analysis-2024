The current gerrymander isn't much more extreme than last decade's, they mostly focused on protecting incumbents. They could definitely knock out a couple of Dems with harsher lines but they'd risk it blowing up in their face if current voting trends continue to move towards Dems. If Abbott and Co. are banking on the state staying red enough to 2030, they might decide to go for the jugular and gerrymander out candidates like Fletcher or Allred. The lines will be hideous, though.
Worth noting in this regard that Texas' geography and trends are really bad for Republicans and they know it. It's why Abbott's trying to force an exodus of educated liberals through his policies. Last time they focused mainly on protecting incumbents, but this time it seems they might try to go for the kill.
