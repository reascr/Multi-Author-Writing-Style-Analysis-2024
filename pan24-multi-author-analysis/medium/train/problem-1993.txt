Who knows as I laugh sarcastically to myself and while I think how bad the poverty level and humanitarian crisis is down there. Plus all the natural disasters they get on top of it. Those people don't have much of a chance do they?
Haiti has been out of control for quite awhile now "decades," but recently it's worse than just uncontrollable pure madness and chaos.
Eventually something will need to be done ( like ASAP) to help Haiti out as it wouldn't be too smart letting it be run by a bunch of insane murderous gangs.
So what country is it going to be to help them out? Probably the US, Canada, or even France I'm guessing.
I don't think it should be just the US in any case, since they've been criticised many times for being the "world police" (so, to turn around and ask for help now is a little disingenuous). It could be Canada, except that our peace enforcement capabilities have greatly atrophied and we'd need extra help. The French have the ability and the responsibility to act given the history of Haiti, but the current right wing government is unlikely to do so.
