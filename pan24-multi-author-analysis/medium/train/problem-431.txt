The very same things that independents, moderates, liberals, apolitical people with eyes and ears… have been saying for six years.

Did a switch flip? Amazing how overnight, Republicans and conservative forums everywhere are suddenly lamenting, seemingly in unison, that Trump “is only in it for himself”, he’s going to “divide the country” to “satisfy his ego”, and it’s “time to abandon Trump”.
Six years of Trump’s vindictive, thin-skinned twitter behavior and “sic em” personal attacks on people as a sitting president, his treating a deadly pandemic like a personal reality tv show, and a preposterous, flailing, dangerous attempt to overturn a US presidential election and tear the country apart in the process. Among other things.
