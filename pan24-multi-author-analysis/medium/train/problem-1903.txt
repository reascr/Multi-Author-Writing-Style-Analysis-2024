Russian NATO just collapsed with this, and with the war in Ukraine this basically dismantled any power tie they had on that area...
Armenia probably dont care about this because csto proved to be a money draining scheme than a defense pact, as they are alone dealing with turkey, azerbaiyan and basically all of NATO...
If Russia managed to piss off this small nation on a brink of extinction where everyday is a fight for survival than all the other nations can and should isolate Russia like North Korea.
Armenia is relatively small… but far far from ‘brink of extinction’. As a matter of fact, thanks to this war, Armenia is on a brink of huge economic jump (as most of countries around Russia). Armenia just had massive injection of Russian immigrants and quite a few big businesses moved to Armenia from Russia (if I remember correctly, Russian office of Google relocated to Armenia).
Armenians gave a lot to Russia like MiG fighter jets and so on. How many Mig fighters today they have?
Karma is a beach. Now let them feel how Armenians always felt when they had to leave Armenia to Russia because most if them got tired of endless wars. I hope they learn their lesson in Armenia how Russia divided Armenian lands and put Armenia in a position to always fight for survival so they can sell weapons and act like peacekeepers same time on the world stage.
CSTO is pointless… but these days Armenia has EU aspirations… and US extends it support, so Azerbaijan will not be successful. Not to mention, I am 99% sure that recent flair up on Armenian Azerbaijan border were instigated by Putin. He is dying for anything to divert world attention from Ukraine.
Yes but one country has a lot more of a history of genocide and invasion towards the other. It’s like the could war, there is no good side, there is the neutral and evil sides.
