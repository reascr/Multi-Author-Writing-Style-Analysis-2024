If supply reduces people pay more money for oil, this results in the company having more money for investment. Or they pay money to share holders in dividends which drives the stock price up. The stock price going up means the company can create new shares and sell them while only reducing the stock value slightly. This money can be invested into its ability to expand supply. So more oil well exploration which can drive the price down in the future. If this doesn’t happen then the supply does not increase and oil price remains high which increases the cost of goods. Even if the government does a windfall tax that serves to reduce the amount of investment in oil, which may not be a bad thing because it makes Green energy more viable. The problem with doing that in the short term is that people end up unable to afford to heat their homes until you have the technology for heating reliably with green energy. You can subsidise heating costs but this makes factories have to pay more for energy which increases the price of products that consumers buy. You can set price caps but then you need to decide who gets to buy oil and who doesn’t because price isn’t the determining factor. You can increase interest rates which makes it more expensive to get debt which sends unprofitable companies into bankruptcy, reduces demand for labour which further reduces the money in the economy causing demand destruction. That does lower the price of oil but it causes financial hardship.
Or you could do nothing. The oil companies will make a killing and they will increase their supply over time while we work on replacing our energy supply with fossil fuels.
So doubling their profits has nothing to do with rising prices, right? I mean, they keep giving us complicated reasons why everything is suddenly more expensive. They talk about things like the "supply chain". Couldn't all be something as simple as corporate greed. Could it?
