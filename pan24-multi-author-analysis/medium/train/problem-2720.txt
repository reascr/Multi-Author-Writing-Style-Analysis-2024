I’m not saying logging should be banned, it just can a negative impact on a local economy when you think it’s having positive effects.
A area in Colorado I spent a lot of time in over my lifetime thought logging was essential for the economy. The area had decent fishing because lakes were stocked but you NEVER saw wildlife and there was nothing for hunters to hunt. Camping was iffy because of noise from logging and getting to campgrounds was intimidating when you are sharing a narrow road with logging trucks.
When logging pulled out the place was transformed within ten years to a destination for campers and hunters. You always see deer and other wildlife now. The town is thriving.
