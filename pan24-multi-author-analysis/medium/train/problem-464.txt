This is the part that a lot of the "peace at any cost" folks fail to realize... if we enable Putin now, we aren't only giving Putin the greenlight to make more aggressive actions in the future...we've giving DOZENS of authoritarian lunatics the greenlight to use land-grabs and nuclear threats to gain an upper hand in negotiations or simply invade territory...
Stopping Russia here, and showing these despots that the world will not tolerate their power games is the best bet for a lasting peace.
Not to mention this was a major invasion of an entire country, in the direction of Western Europe, who had specifically put up with Putin's shit on the condition he didn't make them feel like they might have to deal with a major invasion by Russia in Europe.
Everyone's lightbulbs went off about supporting Ukraine this time because Putin had really stepped in it, the Ukrainians were overwhelmingly in support of resisting to the max, Putin was making a ton of NATO countries very nervous, and Putin had basically reneged on the implicit deal with Western powers like Germany ("hey let's trade it'll be fine!").
Let's be clear. Supporting Ukraine, a large country with a large population, and with several shared borders with NATO countries, and with 8 years to ramp up their preparedness after Putin's land grab in 2014, is a far easier prospect than somehow stopping Russia from overwhelming a tiny country like Georgia in the middle of central Asia. (And even that wasn't a full invasion.).
