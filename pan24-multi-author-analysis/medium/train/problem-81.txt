It's hard to believe it's been 50 years. I remember vividly watching the events back then on the old black and white TV we still had in '69. Space, and what humans have technically accomplished, still astounds and amazes me.
The first time for what? The moon has been visited by probes and rovers many times in the past 50 years. China has rovers there right now. Are they just talking about for America?
You give bunch of missions w/o understanding how heavy space capsule is. Alot of the missions above are tiny comparing to Orion space capsule.
I presume they are running the environmental control systems the whole way? Is there something to consume oxygen too?
That is because it classify the spacecraft as space capsule, albeit this flight is uncrewed. There are only handful of space capsules capable of carrying crew that reached the moon. And none in last 50 years.
Gotta say though, the verbiage they use "first launch (or whatever) of a rocket designed to take humans beyond LEO in 40 years" really comes off as stretched. Even though true.
