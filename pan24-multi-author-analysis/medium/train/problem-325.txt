The fly in the ointment so to speak (and it's a big one) is that the vote is during the legislative session and a LOT of bills have been filed already that seek to restrict cannabis programs in the state anticipating passage. Many bills have effective dates of 2025 <-- that's when rec would, if 820 passed, would be fully implemented and anyone could apply for a sales license (the ballot title indicates only businesses in operation as medical for a year could do this in the first 2 years).
The question doesn't amend OK's state constitution but is a statutory change (just like SQ788 which legalized medical) so the legislature can make changes on it every session, and the March 7 vote is around when each chamber presents bills to the floor out of committee.
We already have states that have legalized recreational marijuana. So far, nothing bad has happened. So what is the problem with legalizing it everywhere?
