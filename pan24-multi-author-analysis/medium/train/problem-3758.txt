Last fun fact on this topic: only the President of Ukraine can approve the removal of citizenship, no one else. He signs a formal document after a person submits a request to do so or after confirmation that they have broken the law. Theyâ€™ve basically halted regular processing of those requests since the beginning of the war, at least I had a friend in the summer who had submitted his docs in January 2022 so that he could gain citizenship of his long-term country of residence but there had been no movement since then. Looks like they did an expedited exception for those priests, good riddance.
Religious organizations, for all their faults, are usually out to look after themselves, or whatever fucked up dogma they've created in their own heads from reading their religious texts. I think the Orthodox church in Russia is a little different, in that in Soviet times it was mostly just another arm of the KGB. I would assume that the church is very much still in cahoots with the government, and security services. Especially as the Patriarch is ex KGB himself.
Speaking of which, can we paradrop Father Jack in front of the Russian army and tell him the Russians stole his whiskey?
