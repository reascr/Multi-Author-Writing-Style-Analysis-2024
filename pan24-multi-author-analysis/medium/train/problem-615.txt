The U.S. is by no means perfect, and they've done some shady shit themselves but in comparison, the US still looks pretty good. Granted corporations and outside influences are making the U.S. far less desirable than it once was. But to answer your question about why you would ever align with them, the answer is propaganda, and you don't know what the outside world is actually like or situations where you're jailed or executed for speaking against the status quo so you either flee the country as refugee, get killed, or fall in line and chances are, you won't be allowed to leave so you may or may not be able to flee. Look at Navalny in Russia, he almost got assassinated even when he left the country, then probably had family threatened so he went back to serve a jail sentence but torture in jail beats being hunted and having attempts at being assassinated or risking the lives of your family that still reside in the country. China actively threatens citizens abroad if they are asked to return to China, if they don't, well well looks like you have family that still resides in the country, would be a shame if something happened to them.
Well some of us don't have a farm of spare animals to feed them when we're not out hunting enemies. If the local feed mouse population drops no one's going to notice but if the farm out the back loses half its cows as a midnight snack they're going to suspect something's amiss.
