Some good news - there's a hearing in GA Tuesday about what from the completed Fulton County special grand jury report is made public. One of the prominent attorney analysts seemed certain that some kind of indictment or other serious move would follow from it. This might be a good week.
At what point do they finally move on him? It’s abundantly clear he’s guilty. His party questions him, he continuously takes the worst path instead of the way out. At what point do they finally say enough is enough like more than 70 million people said when they elected Biden.

If it's the former, there's not a whole lot to say, because nothing happened. If it's the latter, they're not going to want to say anything. And even if they want to, they can only say so much, because pursuing charges means that they need to assemble a grand jury for an indictment, and grand juries are secret proceedings.
Best case scenario is the DOJ was waiting on that and will attempt to combine all initial federal charges, including the GA case and the docs case, since the GA case has federal implications, too, and since they would likely need to coordinate indictment efforts for such a high profile subject so to not overstep each other. This is my hopium.
