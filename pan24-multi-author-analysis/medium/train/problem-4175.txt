They’ve taken Krasna Gora and will likely encircle all of Bakhmut by the end of February assuming the Ukrainians don’t withdraw. Once Bakhmut falls Russia will be able to push the Ukrainians to the Osko river and the Slavyansk-Kramatorsk defence line. Their offensive has slowed as they focus around Bakhmut and the rest of the Donbass because of Ukrainian fortifications plenty of which are 8 years old. There is currently no section of the front where Ukraine has the initiative. They lost it in the Kupyansk-Lyman frontline a few weeks ago, they managed to repel Russian offensives in the South but nonetheless the Russians are on the offensive and Donetsk city itself has been mostly a stalemate. Wagner isn’t being routed, they are outright gaining ground. Lets face the facts, its not unlikely that Russia will be able to conquer the Donbass. That doesn’t mean Russia wins the war mind you but they are far from routed. We’ll have to see ultimately how much the upcoming offensive can take.
They're a mercenary group, they profit off of war and instability. Wagner casualties are willing participates looking to profit off of death, and with how poor Russians are (and continue to get) they'll have a steady supply of willing fodder.
