Considering this and those two suspicious but apparently “totally okay” audits of trumps enemies, I hope someone looks into whether or not the presidential audits didn’t happen due to pressure from the White House.
He does have an ongoing Obama era audit that's stalled for no apparent reason (and he likely owes the US millions.) He was not being audited for any years he was president. This is one of the many times his vague language ensures we have no idea what he's actually talking about.
