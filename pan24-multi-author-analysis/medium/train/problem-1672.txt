Isolating Russia completely doesn't help with whatever truce will be accomplished. Sanctions should be against big companies because it affects their economy which dampens their ability to wage prolonged war. Banning athletes from competing internationally just closes another potential avenue for dialogue.
It would be good if their athletes could still compete (even if they cheat they will eventually be caught) because it gives the international community some kind of structure to promote cooperation.
Russia was allowed to compete in the Olympics for decades and somehow all that potential room for dialogue didn't stop them from becoming the regime they are today. If it couldn't prevent it, why do you think it could stop it?

Russia shouldn’t be allowed to compete in the Olympics, and all of their athletes should be barred as well. With their , they should be banned for 15-20 years. They’re out of control.
Okay, let’s say Russia initially succeeded in invading Ukraine at the start of the war. What will happen to Ukrainian athletes? There is a time for condemnation and a time for cooperation. This is the time to send a clear signal to everyone that invading a sovereign country and committing blatant war crimes absolutely cannot be tolerated.
Plus, if Russia is ready to actually engage in dialogue (and not just demands/accusations) there are already more fitting and productive avenues in place. You don't have to do it via a once-every-four-years sporting competition.
