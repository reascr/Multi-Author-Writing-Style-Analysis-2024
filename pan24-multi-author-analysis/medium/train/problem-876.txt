"We need more baths with only men, lots of sweaty fat naked men, because we're super not gay at all we promise. See, look how we beat and neglect every woman in a 200 mile radius before taking a steamy bath with the boys? Clearly, not gay.".
Hypocrisy of it is that this rape was being done by our allies. However Western military never punished the rapists. Crackdown too hard, you lose your allies plus all the other corruption that went on over there. There was some news reports about it over in the West but never fully told. Otherwise support for the mission would vanish quickly if widespread knowledge was known.
There was a “culture tradition “ regarding sexual assault and rape of young boys. A lot of this was done by certain Afghani allies such as police chiefs, military, warlord, rich older Afghani. Ironically Taliban banned this culture with punishment of death. They saw it as homosexuality and not to my knowledge as being a peadophile. There was good allies who respected the law/mission and bad allies.
So before Taliban rose to power this “tradition” was rampant in certain areas. Taliban even used their crack down on it to help gain power in the 90s. Village elders would ask them to rescue their sons. Then pledge support to them. Imagine politicians now rescuing sexual abuse victims acting like John wick/Rambo.
Used to be a Afghani saying when the culture was rampant “ when birds fly over Kandahar they only use one wing, the other is to cover their arse”.
So when Taliban took over again, they used the abused boys as honey pot traps to help kill their abusers, suicide bombers to kill their abusers etc.
