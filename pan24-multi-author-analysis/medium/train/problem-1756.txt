Did people criticizing actually read the whole article, that the fetus will not have quality of life? It would have severe handicap?
That could be anything from not having a brain or any vital organs. Sure the baby breathes. But is it life? How many hours, days or weeks can it live outside of the uterus?
This is a medical termination, not that of a healthy baby because she so chooses. This is not letting this life be in pain or suffer, and to be clear the only thing the court said was that it was the motherâ€™s choice. Weather she wants to give birth to a still born, wait weeks until the baby suffers and dies, or have mercy and terminate an unviable pregnancy.
They all skipping that part and only reading the Abortion at 33wks and looking at it from the perspective of US and EU law.
"Justice Singh further noted that in Indian law, it is ultimately a mother's choice whether or not she wants to continue with her pregnancy.".
Exactly, also the part where the mother is interviewed and she knows the trauma involved with any of her choices. To wait and give birth to a still born is extremely traumatic for any woman. If a Neuro surgeon was involved it is the assumption the baby after birth would have very little chance at life even after intervention.
