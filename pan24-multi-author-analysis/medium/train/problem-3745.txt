It’s just really embarrassing to SK that they were caught off guard, showed up late, and then lost an aircraft to an accident of some kind all while NK just took their drones and went home. It hurts peoples’ confidence in their military.
Yeah, it’s really embarrassing for SK. Drones managed to get right up to not only their nations capital, but one of the most populated cities in the world. If NK had wanted, they easily could have killed hundreds with armed drones before SK could have responded.
I’m surprised the Norks managed to send drones all the way to Seoul and have them come back unscathed. Reckon a few heads will roll within the South Korean military over this. The relatively small size but long range of some drones appears to be causing some headaches for air defence commanders as we are also seeing in Ukraine-Russia.
Not only did those drones get in basically unopposed until it was too late, but SK even lost an aircraft to some kind of malfunction when they tried to respond (though both crew members bailed out successfully). I foresee a lot of military PowerPoint presentations over this.
