I wonder how much money she saved from her many years as a star news anchor out there in Phoenix. Perhaps the whole reason behind her suddenly getting into politics was as a ready cash source if she and her hubby blew her anchorperson earnings on bad investments and the like. She can fundraise and I expect that she'll be coming out with a book soon as another potential cash cow. Maybe she's hoping for a generous offer from Fox News where they'll give her a national show and turn her into the female Tucker Carlson.

If Trump was to pick a woman for his VP running mate in 2024, I'd bet that he'd pick Lake over Marjorie Taylor Greene simply because he likely considers her 'hotter' and more 'high class' than Marge. Both women are despicably alike in their politics so the deciding factor for the Donald is likely to be on the shallow level of their looks.
