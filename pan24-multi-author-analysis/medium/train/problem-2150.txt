That's not an accurate summation of Zionists believe, but yes, most Americans are completely ignorant of history and get biased information from churches about Israel. While they probably aren't Zionists themselves they are supporters of Zionists.
Israel is primarily atheist. Zionism is just a bullshit excuse that white Europeans use for taking land from the actual inhabitants. None of the founders of Israel looked like their families came from the Middle East.
I'm Ashkenazi Jewish and we're white as fuck. Nobody in many generations of my ancestors had any connection to Palestine, or any kind of existence near it. Also my extended family was wiped out to about 90% give or take thanks to the Nazis. Know who didn't help them? And who didn't help liberate the concentration camps? Zionist terrorists attacking civilians to form Israel. White men claiming they owned the desert because of religion.
Edit: For three why have so many famously intelligent Jewish people criticized Israel and refused to associate with it? Why didn't Albert Einstein take the position of Prime Minister? Oh, because they thought it was an ugly terrorist ethnostate....
Gross. Biden's such a disappointment. I'm going to choke on my own bile if I have to vote for him again, but I will over any Republican. The only good thing you can say about Bibi is that he's not as much of an insane Zionist monster as some of the rest of Israel, but he's still an insane Zionist monster.
