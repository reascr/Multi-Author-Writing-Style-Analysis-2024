What this article and the authors also fail to mention is the absolute racketeering scheme that is the academic textbook market, with phony yearly "new" editions that do nothing more than change a handful of typos or switch chapter orders to fuck with the old syllabus and with no meaningful new content. Or worse, textbooks which require subscriptions or other fees to access all associated content on top of the cost of the book or come with single use codes whose only purpose is to stifle the second hand market. All this despite the fact that the costs of printing books in general has plummeted and that digital distribution would lower the costs of providing this information further still. But the prices remain high because the textbook market is one not driven by normal factors like process improvement or competition but by whatever books a professor/department forces their students to use (which itself is often subject to out and out bribery schemes from publishers).
That's why it's increasingly about selling yourself as a service via fan engagement, patreon sponsors etc. Not saying it's right - but it's what it is.
