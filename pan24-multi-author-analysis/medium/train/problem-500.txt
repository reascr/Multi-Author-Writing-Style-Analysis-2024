I believe it's because the Treason Trio of Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, and Marjorie TG refuse to use them (presumably because they're illegally carrying concealed handguns), and rack up a fine every time they bypass them.
Remove magnetometers that are in place to protect members of congress and their staff? Is that really an issue for the GOP? Why am I still surprised? Oy.
Ah, I have to tell you this simply isn't true. Open carry is prohibited in DC. Ownership, possession, and concealed carry of firearms are all possible in DC. Civilians need permits.
Those handguns are only prohibited in a handful of areas and are perfectly legal in most of the Capitol building. Boebert allegedly open carries in her office areas. So, there's no need to presume!
