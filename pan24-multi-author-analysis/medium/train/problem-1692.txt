Bomb-disposal experts defused a letter bomb at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid on Thursday, the sixth such device sent to high-profile targets in a wave that prompted Spain to step up security and vow not to be deterred from supporting Ukraine.
The campaign began with a package sent to Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Nov. 24, spurring Madrid to tighten security around public buildings.
Similar devices have also been sent to the defense ministry, an air force base, a weapons manufacturer and the Ukrainian embassy - where a security officer was slightly injured.
"What must be very clear is that none of these deliveries or any other violent action will change the clear and firm commitment of Spain, NATO countries and the European Union to support Ukraine," she said.
It could possibly be Spanish fascists. Not saying it is, but they sure are assholes and arenâ€™t particular fans of the Spanish government, the US, or Ukraine.
That does not mean all Russian people are, of course. But the Russian state and all who support and defend its actions are malevolent pieces of shit.
