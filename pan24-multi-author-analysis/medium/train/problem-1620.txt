To quote my very frustrated gen-Z friend who couldn’t wait to vote against the GOP in a CA swing district, “I’ve had menstrual flows that were more of a red wave”.
His opponent Tom patti is a huge piece of shit. I did security in the hoa he lives in. He had a huge McMansion and he’d call me all the time and complain that the quality of life in his gated community was going to hell because his neighbors dog wouldn’t stop barking or there were still trash cans out. Clowns a crybaby.

I really don’t have much haha. It’s in a gated community and a ton of the house are giant McMansions. His behavior was pretty typical of the people there so he was just one of dozens. Only reason that stuck out was because he specifically talked about his quality of life being jeopardized like I wasn’t making minimum wage and living in a roach infested apartment at the time. He was rude as shit most of the time too. I saw a smear campaign of his talking about how harder is just trying to get rich. Says the guy living like a king. I stopped working there like 2 years ago so hopefully I won’t hear from him again.
No. This is somewhere in Stockton. As much as I don’t like him I don’t wanna completely give out his address. But he’s in a gated community in Stockton where the wealthiest residents live.
