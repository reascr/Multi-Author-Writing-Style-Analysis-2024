Yes no shit. The public already knows and has always known, but our governments sometimes treat the public like we are all blind sheep while insulting all of our intelligence.
The relationship between our governments and our largest global corporations cheating it's citizens is just another way of saying legal corruption.
I feel like the fulcrum is shifting where "hey our system is super corrupt and controlled by an ultra-wealthy powerful few" is no longer seen as conspiracy-theory, just more.. depressing fact we have little power to fix.
It's no longer crazy talk. It's no longer short conversation. This is main table talk and a lot of people are getting "comfortable" allowing themselves to think thoughts like this. Which means eventually they'll evaluate it and discuss it more. They'll come to care about it one way or another. Then comes friction and then we'll have action. We may not be at the point where the main populace is angry enough to take to the streets but we are focusing in on the problem, a solution will come. And I think with the way the world governments are behaving they will accidentally hasten the process trying to control rather than solve the discontent.
