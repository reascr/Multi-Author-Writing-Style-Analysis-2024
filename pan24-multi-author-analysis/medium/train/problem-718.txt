It's actually more complicated than that. From a theological perspective, sin is like poison to the soul. It makes you worse.
Like if you cheat on your wife, that's a sin. If you lust after another person's wife, that's also a sin. Both of those things warp your relationships and make you a little bit less of a good person. They're habit forming.
I'm not saying that being gay is a sin, or that it makes you a worse person, by the way. I'm just trying to talk about how it's a bit more complicated than "sin is a crime against God".
C S Lewis thought that the people in hell weren't locked there. He thought they locked themselves in. He wrote a book called the Great Divorce which is about a bus of people from hell that went to visit heaven and were offered the option to stay. They all chose not to, because of the way they became in life. One guy didn't want charity and wanted some way to earn his stay, and out of principle wouldn't stay for free, for example.
That’s been the Catholic perspective since I was in high school or earlier. Liberal priests were more “welcoming” but Catholicism is one of the religions that preach intimacy is important in a marriage (thus teaching the rhythm method. Definitely learned that in middle school religion class).
That's just what Jesus (allegedly) said. Also something about being thrown into the sea with a millstone round the neck.
They will indeed say that the Pope is wrong and that he shouldn't be Pope and that they don't have to listen to him.
So saying “it’s totally cool to be gay, you just can’t engage in the intimacy that’s a fundamental part of a relationship. Yay, we’re so progressive Hooray us, this isn’t problematic at all”.
