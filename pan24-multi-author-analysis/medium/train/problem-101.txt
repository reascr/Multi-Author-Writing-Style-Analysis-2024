That's what it is. It isn't modern equipment being funneled from china. Like oc is implying. They have huge stockpiles of older arms, because they haven't been used in decades.
According to the article, the US is accusing NK of supplying Russia with artillery shells. NK has thousands of artillery pieces pointed at Seoul, and puts a lot of funding into their military at the expense of their own people. I wouldn't put it past them selling or trading artillery shells, especially if it's older stock.
If i remember correctly they already found some dumps/stockpiles with them and they had Chinese writing.(hence the "chinese is supplying russia rhetoric") but it wouldn't be something China has stock of, cause its from decades ago and hasn't been used by china for a while. Just like USA doesn't keep stockpiles of old outdated, discontinued ammunition.
I find it hilarious that the NK tracks conform to international standards and Russia is just fucking off with its own thing. You'd really expect the opposite.
