Actually that's not the whole story. Haaretz reported yesterday. Netanyahu wanted Ukraine to vote against the motion. Zelensky told him that in exchange for a vote in his favor or official abstention, he needed military support for the war. Netanyahu declined to commit military help but told him they could speak about it at a later point and Zelensky gave the order for the UA representative not to show up so that UA keeps the door open if Netanyahu chooses to help in exchange for a favorable vote. In this case Ukraine did not officially abstain either, they did not vote and abstention requires a vote.
I didn't say there won't be problems. But has occupying the Palestinian territories really stopped the violence? I would argue that so far it has been an abject security failure.
It didn't stop the violence, but it did shift it away from Israel's population centers. So yeah - it's justified.
What's the alternative anyway? You agree that if Israel returned to its 1967 borders there would still be violence. So what... Israel is just supposed to accept it as a fact of life? Would your country?
