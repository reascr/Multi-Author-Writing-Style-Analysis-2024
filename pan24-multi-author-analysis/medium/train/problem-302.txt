Agreed but if they wait too long, Russia will have a moment to shift its remaining veterans to that small border after the war. If the Ukraine war looks like it might end they will have to move before it actually does.
Seems like they don't mean anything to Russians either. How can people be OK with killing almost 100k of their people in less than a year is beyond me.
The tooth to tail ratio is how many support troops you need per front line soldier. It's usually between 5 and 10. For comparison the us military in vietnam was 1:12, but in the gulf war it was 1:5.
With about a million total in their military, a 10:1 ratio russian military would be completely out of fighting soldiers at this point.
If they have only 5 support per soldier, that suggests they could support more like 200k fighting troops...but some thousands would need to be left defending russias other borders and manning their ships.
My guess is that a lot of russia is undefended right now as they hollow out everything to feed the losses in ukraine and hope nobody notices. Good time for georgia to take their lost land back.
