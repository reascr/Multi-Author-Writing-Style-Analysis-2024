Bananas are an excellent example of why genetic monoculture farming is problematic over the long term. First the gros michel banana dominated, but a blight hit it and wiped out the world's gros michels. Then the cavendish banana took its place, but a blight hit it and wiped out the Old World's cavendish bananas, and now that blight has crossed the Atlantic.
It's disappointing to me that we as a society took something as awesome as genetic modification and made it boringly dystopian (monoculture, resistance to pesticides so they can pollute more etc).
I'm not ideologically opposed to genetic splicing. Yet with the current implementation and legal framework, patentable GMOs are basically setting up major staple crops for a similar collapse.
People who think GMOs are somehow inherently toxic or bad are really misled... But the implementation is so stupid.
And I could plant Blue Java bananas in my California backyard. But the thread is about commercial agriculture and so far no cultivar has been found that's suitable for replacing the Cavendish.
