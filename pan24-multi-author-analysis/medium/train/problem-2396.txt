I wonder if the Treasury Department is still sending cheques to the 'Treasurer General of the Republic', and whether uncashed cheques would still be indexed to the 1934 value? If Cuba ever normalizes with the US, that'd probably be the one thing they'd cash in on.
>"Over 95 or 96% of people want to de-occupy all their territory after Russia did it. I think the big mistake was in 2014, but the biggest mistake, the tragic one, was on the 24th of February, because that is the point [after which] nobody wants to come back, to any compromises," he said.
It would only be around 40,000$ per year in 2022 money if indexed to 1934. 25,000$ if indexed to 1974.
Even with interests, I imagine it would come out to basically to an unnoticeable change in the US budget.
A pilot ejection actually ridiculously costly, but not for the reason you would think of. Sure the plane is expensive, but the real cost is the loss of the pilot. Pilots only get a certain number of ejections before they’re grounded (if it’s not the first ejection it’s the second). It has to do with the massive forces an ejection does to your spine. And airworthy pilots are by far the most valuable and difficult to replace part of any Air Force.
