Triply so when not a single democrat or left leaning person gives a flyyyyying about protecting Hunter Biden. This fascist goons on the right would have you believe that every person would fall in their storage for every member of their team just like they would but we don’t care if he’s committed wrongdoing fucking fire him. But as of now, all it seems like they want to grill him about is having a drug addiction, and probably some nepotistic dealings with his dad. But aren’t the trumps equally as guilty of all that? Give a shit anyway. I fucking hate this timeline.
