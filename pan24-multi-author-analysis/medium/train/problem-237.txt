Non of the right wingers thought the union is conservative tbf I mean they refuse to cooperate with the afd wich makes them unappealing to the more moderate right wingers. The only reason the union held on for so long was because of Merkel. she was one of the most solid uncontrovesial poleticians ever seen. So aslong as they are not rebranding more left or more right they are not gona win anything being a center party is no longer the way to win votes in the current year. Also I remember afd voters shouting down with the Merkel dictatorship.
There was a window of time where it felt Russia could be economically brought into the modern world. But that window was a mirage based on rampant optimism and ignorance given what we (the public) has now gotten to know about Russia. But you expect the experts and those that engage in high-level geopolitics to have far better knowledge and judgement of the situations.
Safe to say your question is open-ended given examples like Putin actually believing his intelligence advisors about Ukraine, when obviously he has set up a situation where they would and could only tell him exactly what he wanted to hear.
Germany thought they where engaging in a mutaly beneficial partnership where economics are seperate from poletics. This model can work but only if both partners are willing to play this game. Basicly no matter how dire the political situation gets the gas will flow as it benefits Russia and Germany equally but Russia the bastards that they are broke that unspoken agreement.
