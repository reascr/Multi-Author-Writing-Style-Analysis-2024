Hysterically misleading title. They're worth $570K total, not individually. And even then, the 14K sold times $99 equates to $1,386,000 so what it's really saying is these things lost half their value in a day.
They "sold out" in the same way Walt's cancer donation page was "flooded with donations" in Breaking Bad.

Edit: some nice commenters corrected me that it is in fact considerably worse than this since all 45K sold, the 14K figure was how many buyers there were so some of these dopes bought several. At $99 a pop that makes $4,455,000, so a current value of $570,000 is good for a decline of 87.2%.
