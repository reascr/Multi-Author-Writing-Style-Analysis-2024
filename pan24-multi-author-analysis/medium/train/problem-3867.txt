The T72s are horrible by design. Their autoloader requires the ammo being in the turret. While that positively influences the tanks size to be smaller and it requiring 1 person less as crew, which both in theory soumd like good premises it expotentially decreases their survivability even against weaker weapons and thus destroys the whole purpose of the tank to take a few hits while still delivering heavy firepower. Their design would only be beneficial if you can guarantee that the tank won't be hit too much or by too heavy armor penetrating weapons. But given their lacking infantry support in quantity and/or quality their doctrine and equipment are just not compatible to work.
India likely figured that they could get a very good deal on all the R&D Russia has done for this stillbirth of a tank and developed their own model much cheaper and faster than they otherwise would have been able to. With a little luck they can even export the result to countries that would no longer want to buy Russian now.
