The Russians destroyed the bridges at Berezina trapping Napoleon's entire army including him and his imperial guard. He had earlier ordered his chief engineer to destory all his bridge making tools and supplies, an order he ignored. That man sent his best engineers - some of the best combat engineers that world had ever seen - into freezing water to build 2 pontoon bridges while under attack. Every man who entered the freezing water died tools in hand, but managed - somehow - to build a bridge that tens of thousands could cross including Napoleon. The bridges collapsed multiple times in the retreat and more engineers went into the water to fix it, and die. Not all troops made it over before Napoleon issued the order to destroy the bridge with the chief engineer delaying the order's execution over an hour. Many stragglers, including many men who were leading their own wives and children died at the Russians hands or desperately trying to ford the river. The whole time a battle raged around them on both sides of the river.
Russian strategy relies chiefly on bluffing. Now that there's a knock down fight, that posturing is revealing the true weaknesses of Russia's military. It is a paper tiger at best. There is no logistical supply chain and the equipment is inadequate and the training virtually nonexistent. The leadership is also either inept or too tied up on political constraints that they can't develop actual strategy due to being micromanaged by politicos.
