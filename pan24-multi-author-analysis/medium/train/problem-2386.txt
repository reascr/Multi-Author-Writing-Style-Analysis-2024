I have a friend that’s said we’ve accomplished our goals in Ukraine (US goals to cripple Russian military ability) and should stop funding their effort but push them towards a resolution that gives up land while I also tell them that they fail to understand that it’s not over and this conflict is going to be ongoing until Russia realizes that they can’t win it and just wants to restock/resupply its forces for another offensive. It’s annoying trying to explain the actual geopolitical implications if the West just pulls out while offering an appeasement style resolution for this war. They fail to understand Russia would just lick its wounds and try for more later while potentially having a better military that can’t be repulsed. Additionally while economies are being discoupled (they think the western market is the only one) would force Russia to abide by its commitments to deals it signs abroad while failing to understand they can do a deal with counties that make up a third of the overall population so they can figure out ways to skirt western sanctions. It’s annoying when you tell people the truth but fail to understand the big picture of how they are affected.
It's hard to remain relevant when you're essentially fighting a foe that has dedicated itself to a new strategy that is squatting there like some bankrupt beached whale.
