Article is hidden behind a paywall, but is there an explanation for why he did this? I had a buddy that used to take an ambien before boarding a transcon flight (LAX-JFK for example) because he would fall asleep while taxiing and wake up at landing feeling completely refreshed. He did this for a couple years until a bad instance of somnambulism (sleep walking) had his waking up to being taken down by an air marshal because he stood up in the aisle and started taking his clothes off. He was able to explain himself out of jail and an airline ban but was humiliating enough to swear him off from the practice since.
That said, I wonder if this was something similar: guy sleep walked going to the bathroom but missed the lavatory. I did some googling and they described him as "inebriated," but this smacks of bad drug/alcohol interaction to me. What's most infuriating is how poorly the poor passenger he peed on was treated by the airline. They had open seats in first class but kept trying to get her to go back to her business class seat that still reeked of piss. Whether it was their fault or not, that was a horrible situation that demanded some extra care and service from the airline and the crew.
This was, of course, after he'd signed her up for seven different accounts, issued four loans, already defaulted her on two, and started repossessing her house which she'd previously owned outright. None of which she was aware of and is won't find out about losing her house until she gets a no-trespass notice. 'Cause he was just another pissy Wells Fargo executive.
