Why would successful people who aren’t ancient goblins want that? These guys can get women who want to be with them, or guys if that’s their things, they don’t need some decrepit cryptkeeper sharing his hobby with them.
Because paid whores are professionals. They know exactly how to act, probably been with high profile clients before so they won't get starstruck, it's a profession so they won't do things to jeopardize future pay, and they just show up for a good time because someone else already paid for them. The athletes don't have to go looking for it.
I hate how these same guys (and society ig) confuse pro whores with escorts. Sure, escorts carry a bad rep now but not all are whores. Same thing with pole dancers. For men with power it's all the same thing, but I digress.
Because they've been with the ones that want to be with them and whores offer a quick fuck, you dont need to spend time trying to or making sure they are happy afterwards. its about the orgasm, not the relationship.
I think its amazing the stigma of using sex services has. these women are cleaner than 90% of the woman you see in the streets, most are beautifull and are professionals fuckers... and its quick no hassle.
Ofc they can, but they have to search for them, send them a message, gamble on if she will accept or not, because if not thats time wasted. imagine that times 20 or 30... they dont have girls lining up waiting for them lmao... a whore you call, fuck, leave.
Or a clean slate happens, like in the 1950s. Most people from Berlusconi's time will definitely not be here in the next 10 years.
I really doubt that Tiger Woods has the sort of name recognition you expect compared to premier footballers in most of the world.
Mbappe loves dating trans people (I hope he's not a chaser, I only know so much) and he's open about it. Good for him.
