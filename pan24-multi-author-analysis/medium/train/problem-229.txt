What is my perfect crime? I break into my neighbor at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the land. It's priceless. As I'm tanking it down, an army catches me. It tells me to stop. It's its father's land. She's Ukraine. I say no. We make war all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Ukraine to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never had another war. I don't care. I don't show up. Because I died horribly of pancreatic cancer wherever I was hiding a long time ago.
