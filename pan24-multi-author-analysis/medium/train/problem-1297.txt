The Bolt EUV is insanely cheap for a good quality EV with 250mi of range. The slow 55kW DC Fast charging is a bit of a drawback, but it's a $28,000 EV and how often do you really need DC Fast charge? The Equinox EV coming out next year will also have 250mi range but 150kW fast charging for $30,000. I think GM might become Tesla's biggest competitor due to how low the cost of their EVs are. Demand for the Bolt is really high right now.
Have you seen what he's doing now with Twitter's staff? Dude lives to exploit workers and make their lives worse. He's just a giant asshole and I'm 100% sure he enjoys being so and his life is an unending power trip.
Yeah, I think the dark truth is, people with his personality type actively enjoy making other people suffer. It's not something they just do in the course of business or look at as a harsh truth, they go out of their way to fuck people over. I've seen it my own life before, with people. And with people that didn't have 1/1 millionth of the power that he does.
