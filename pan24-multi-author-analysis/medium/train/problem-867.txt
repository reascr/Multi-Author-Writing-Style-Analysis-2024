The wealth gap and the power of dark money in politics means that the super rich can buy the politicians and outcomes they want.
The wealthy have been pushing to go back to the Gilded Age ever since the Roosevelts had the guts to fight for the middle and lower classes. It certainly wasn’t extreme, but even that got a visceral reaction out of the elites. If we want to keep things as they are or even improve things then you’re absolutely correct that money is rotting democracy out and we need to fight.
The Railroad Barons were corrupt as hell and bribery was pretty much EXPECTED in politics in the Gilded Age.
