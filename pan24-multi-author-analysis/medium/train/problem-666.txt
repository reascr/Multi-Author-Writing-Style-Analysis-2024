There are plenty of CENTERIST politicians from AZ that wouldn't have waited until the Georgia runoff to make their grand pronouncement that they are leaving the Democratic party right as the runoff election in Georgia ended.
The timing of her announcement is...interesting. Why would she announce this now, right when Democrats took an actual (not 50-50) majority in the Senate???
I live in Arizona. I was one of the voters who helped send her to the Senate. I am a center-left Democrat (voted for Hillary and Biden in the primaries, not Bernie). My thoughts:
It's because all she cares about is being the most important person in the room. She NEVER talks with the people she represents. She is out of state asking for money from billionaires for god-knows what. She seems to think that she knows what's best for Arizona and that anyone who disagrees with her is "too extreme".
