Yeah... Dead bodys everywhere I look here in Germany... You stumble over people that are starving and nobody can help them...
Ohh wait, we still have a functioning social system and it might have been just the drugs this news channel is on.
Can confirm. This morning alone on my way to university i witnessed two shoot outs with the police, had to climb over a pile of dead bodies and had to fight off a gang of homeless teenagers. Society has collapsed, its the apocalypse in Europe.
To put this into perspective for our European friends, this isn't just a major news organization. It's the biggest of them all, by viewership.
The old guard-types of the GOP, such as Mitch McConnell, have been consistent in their Ukrainian support. It's the new Christo-Fascist wing that tends to admire Putin and wants to halt Ukrainian support. They lost rather badly in the recent elections, however.
They're probably not saying this out of actual Russian support, but more just general Euro-bashing. They'll take every opportunity to point at anything over there that makes any of you look bad, as they like to associate European politics with sissy socialism and turn it into a boogeyman for their own gain.
