Are you high?? Yeah Putin has Napoleon's complex but he doesn't even compare to Napoleon's grandma in military genius. Napoleon took on most of Europe and won time and again.. it took multiple coalitios of almost all major European powers to defeat him. Even when he invaded Russia he made mince meat of the Russians and took Moscow before winter proved too much. Even after the defeat in Russia, and with mostly conscripts he trounced the allies in multiple battles, and one of his marshalls who defected told the allies they should retreat when he attacks and take on his commanders until he has no army left.
I watched a YouTube video that broke down the beginning of the war, and they posited that the reason why Russia didn't go for sure superiority at the outset was partially this: they weren't confident their air defense could tell friend from foe, so they had to decide whether to put lots of planes in the air or keep their air defense online, and they ended up going with option B.
He recently assumed control of the war iirc, and judging by how things have been going since it's kinda hard to conclude he's a 21st century Napoleon if you catch my drift.
