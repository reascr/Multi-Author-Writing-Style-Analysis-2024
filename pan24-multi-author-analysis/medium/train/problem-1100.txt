One side will want to do as crazies do, impeaching Biden, stopping legitimate investigations, starting investigations of perceived enemies, and tearing down the good things that we have achieved in the last 2 years.
Whatever your personal feelings are, it is a fact that Nancy Pelosi is one of the most skilled Speakers we have ever had. She negotiated ways to navigate the slim majority and every GOP attempt to obstruct sound legislation for 2 years.
The other side will want to actually pass bills that have a chance of getting past the Senate and Biden, so that they donâ€™t get fired in the next election.
Put aside all the Kevin McCarthy jokes about how he will use the gavel. He is no monkey, but he is also no Pelosi.

The remaining moderates are Democrats. The current GOP is a fascist anti-democratic party that caters to angry racists and fanatical religious zealots. There is no room in our government for that.
The Republican Party needs to fix itself from within to remain relevant, and the 2 sides eating themselves publically might just be the thing to purge the crazy.
I'd love to get back to 2 actual political parties, not what we have now - Democrats vs. QAnon/Fascist/Confederate revivalist/Big Lie spreading wolves in sheep's clothing.
