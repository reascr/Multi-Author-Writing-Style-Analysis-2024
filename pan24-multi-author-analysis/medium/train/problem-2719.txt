How? They committed ethnic cleansing after ethnic cleansing since the 19th century, culminating in genocide in the 90s. We gave them a veto in the parliament. We allow them to avoid paying taxes, bills, and shout how they want us Albanians to die and rot.
Isn't it better to incorporate this part of Kosovo where is Serbian majority to Serbia? And after that make albanian part fully independent state? Every other solution will eventually lead to war...
For one, there's no indication Serbia even wants such an agreement. The government's stance right now is that Kosovo is not a legitimate country and it's all Serbian land. But even if they can get coaxed into it, you now have to contend with every other ethnic group in the area who would ask for the exact same thing.
There's a really thin line between a state dominated by an ethnicity and an ethnostate, and if we officially cross that line, almost every border in the Balkans (and beyond) is going to get redrawn. And redrawing borders is typically a bloody process.
