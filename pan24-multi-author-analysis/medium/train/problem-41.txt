Assange clearly crossed a line from journalist with a confidential source to spy orchestrating the theft of classified material.
His former friends wrote about him only being motivated by greed, sitting on other leaks, only publishing leaks he could monetize, refusing to redact civilian names, endangering people, etc.
He will waste another year in prison when he could just go directly to the courts in the US and start making his case there.
Exactly, and I think the more he runs from this, the worse it's going to become anyway. He could end up spending the full 175 years in prison that they would like him to serve.
Sorry, but there are really no two ways about it. Once you actively give your source advice and guidance on how to defeat security and steal data, you stop being a journalist.
Honestly, I don't think the US Court wants to put him in prison forever. He's not a terrorist and they'd be willing to make a deal.
In the US he is a marked man and it would be harmful to the reputation for any judge or politician to show public sympathy for him. In Europe the same nationalistic resentment with regards to the NSA leaks, Snowden, Manning etc. are not there.
Realistically what do you think is the sentence he will receive? Considering the battery of charges even a lenient judgement could give him several decades.
