Final straw was losing the election yesterday. He doesn’t have enough useful idiots in the US Congress to cut off funding to ukraine so he can’t really wait it out now.
Kevin McCarthy is the GOP minority leader and he’ll probably be the speaker next session if the republicans win the house, which looks likely, but not by the landslide everyone was expecting, because MAGA is dumb and trump backed a slate of fucking morons (Herschel Walker, Oz, Mastriano, etc - qanon loons one and all).
By the day before Election Day McCarthy and others were openly talking about cutting off funding to ukraine. With the house and senate there’s a good chance they could have done that. Without both, no way.
True. But I feel it would've happened even under a republican victory. Most support supporting Ukraine. And most of the trump endorsed republicans didn't win either, so I feel this still would've happened, it just would've taken longer. So either way he was fucked.
Ukraine has received the lions share of its funding from the US. Something to the tune of like $27 billion I think, compared to $5billion or so from the UK, and comparative pennies on the dollar from everyone else. If that funding was in danger of being cut off, we’d be having a very different conversation today.
Don’t trust him zelensky - run those bastards out of your country entirely or we will just be repeating this again in 2024.
Edit: read the article. They’re actually not saying anything new or different. “We have always been prepared to negotiate” - it’s a delaying tactic. Moving on!
