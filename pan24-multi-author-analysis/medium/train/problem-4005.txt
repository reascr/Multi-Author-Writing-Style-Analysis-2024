I think we are dismissing the concerns of those we simply don't like or agree with. Instead of saying "I hear you, so how do we find a solution together" we accuse people of attacking democracy. In actuality Arizona could and needs to be better. 20% of the printers having issues causes a ripple effect of problems. People who had scheduled their time to vote now suddenly faced a situation where 1. They would have to go to a different location and this driving time alone may take up what time they did have or 2. Stand in longer lines which also requires time some didn't have. If you're going to go vote on a lunch break because it's the only free time you have, now you might have to consider not voting because you don't have the time to add an extra stop or stand in lines that have double or tripled in size. The unforeseen extra time alone caused potential votes to not be cast. Anytime people can't vote because of failure to ensure functionality we have an obligation to fix the problem in order to PROTECT democracy. It wasn't just Republicans that suffered from these printer issues but Democrats too. What's done is already done so the best thing moving forward is to simply use what happened as an opportunity to create new and better policy. Why not support a change in process that could allow for a more streamlined and timely outcome?
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
