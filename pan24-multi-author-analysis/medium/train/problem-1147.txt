If I were in the Kremlin I'd be a lot more worried about how very few of Russia's neighbors seem motivated to care about it's wellbeing than I would be over reforging the USSR of old.
They've bailed on Armenia, spooked Belarus, caused Kazakhstan to distance itself from them, convinced Sweden and Finland to join NATO and whatever Ukraine looks like after this conflict, they're almost certainly going to join as well.
They've never cared about Russia's wellbeing before, why start now? Russia can be useful to authoritarian dictators who need someone with a decent-sized army to kick the shit out of protesters, but other than that, it's like living next door to a flop house. If you're lucky, they'll just be noisy, if you're unlucky, the junkies next door will break into your house and steal your shit when you're not home, if you're really unlucky, they'll decide they like your house better than theirs and just move in. But at no point will you ever be glad that they're there, nor would you ever mourn their passing.
In their mind prolonging the war to (somehow) "win" is their tactic of motivating their neighbors to care.
