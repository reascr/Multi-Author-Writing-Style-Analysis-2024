At some point Democrat voters will need to reconcile themselves to the likelihood they were played by the FBI and Mueller. Firstly the FBI helped kill Clinton's campaign by supplying inside info to Giuliani and announcing an investigation into her at the last minute. Secondly, the Mueller Investigation was never a legitimate investigation into Trump's questionable business relationships with Russian oligarchs or foreign parties. That would have opened up too many cans of worms - like we are seeing now with McGonigal. Mueller very carefully skirted the line, ensuring nothing too murky was revealed and nothing that could have ended Trump's Presidency or resulted in an indictment. The SCO investigation was never intended to root out corruption with foreign players - because the FBI was neck deep itself in the same type of corruption. The FBI itself was intertwined with Russian/Ukrainian/Israeli oligarchs and organised crime - as was Trump. They didn't want to expose that. And I suspect senior Dems didn't want that exposed either. The more that gets revealed over time, the clearer it becomes that voters were played by US Intelligence. But it's human nature to want to rationalise the facts and reject the notion we were misled.
