Well the latest and most agreed upon theory about Stonehenges purpose was for use for rituals regarding death. It has over a 1000 year history of use so its use changed over time. Originally, the smaller blue stones marked cremation burials. Archeologists found piles of small pieces of burnt bone under the blue stones. Eventually the larger stones were erected into the arrangement we know today. It's speculated that people would feast and celebrate at nearby durrinon walls (they've found a huge henge monument made purely out of wood, wood = life, stone = death) Mass evidence of feasting and temporary camps have been found there. Next, the people would possibly carry their cremated dead from the processional avenue from durrinon walls down to the river Avon. Then follow it a few kms up toward Stonehenge. There they would turn up another grand processional way with 2 more smaller stone circles at the entrance, then the processional way was flanked with a few large megaliths on each side, and 2 ditches outlining the path. This led slightly up hill until you crested the hill where you could see stone henge in all its glory. You would commerate the dead as it was their time of the year (the shortest days = death) You'd mostly like go back to durrinon and do it all again the next day. This day you would give thanks that the sun rose and the days would grow longer. The world was still in balance and warmer days were to come.
If we can see the Big Dipper, we should be able to see the meteors! We live in Hawaii quite a ways away from any big lights so as long as the clouds stay away, we will bundle up and go lay on the beach and watch it.
