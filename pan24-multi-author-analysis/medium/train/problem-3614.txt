U forget the 300 to 400 billion in frozen russian assets that will likely go to ukraine as reparations, and the fact the free world is still happy to financially support Ukraine, with large pledges of money for reconstruction.
Tl;dr: Ukraine is a lot less likely to be flooded with postwar aid than you think, and this war will have long negative economic effects.
They want to join the EU, and I am sure the EU wants them when all of this is over for the reclaimed resources in Crimea and Donbas alone. So no they will get tons of help, you can bet on that.
Ehhhh. I wouldn’t count on any of that tbh. People in the US are bitching about the cost of aid, and this is during the conflict when it’s constantly on the news and when the aid is largely made in the US weapons that are killing Russians. Much harder to defend money to rebuild buildings in another country after the war is over. The EU is slow walking giving the aid they’ve committed already, and at a certain point some countries will probably start saying that giving homes to refugees was all the economic support they needed to provide or could afford. And there are lots of legal hurdles to getting the Russian money.
I don't think that's "likely". Perhabs if Russia is convicted in an international trial, otherwise I wouldn't count on those countries moving foreign assets to Ukraine just because they decided to do so.
