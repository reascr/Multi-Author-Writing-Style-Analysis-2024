Are you two kidding with each other? In this world everybody do shit it's just hidden Even the pandemic? don't tell me you hundred percent sure how it happened What the point is it is happened and it is possible to shut down the world Unfortunately there are mayor thinks which affects all of us and it doesn't matter what nation is wrong or right... maybe one day we wake up and we realize if we don't stick together to do changes we all going to die... fuck this stupid political bullshit... Half of it it's not even true and most of it post to be a lesson so we don't do it again we are not in control... it was used and it will be used to create full control... on US don't tell me only a few of us going to vote for it We already fighting like cats and dogs to prove a point which is man made Like... wepost to be the best How about we are all people here How about we want to leave peacefully Or maybe to be able to support our family and loved one I traveled all over and by doing that what I see we are all just people... we would all able to get along but we forced and educated to Pond on Our history, as a major background.... trust me we would all want to leave even in Sahara if that is the only place to survive Forget all this bullshit and hate... when you going to realize it's almost too late for everything... they only have one road to happiness... stick together with your brother and sister and find a common goal!
