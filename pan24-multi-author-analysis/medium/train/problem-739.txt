But this is more than that. This is putting the BOT in charge of hiring and they don't have to include faculty in their decision. Not sure if you know how the hiring process works for faculty members, but the norm is that faculty and the chair of the dept. decide what kind of research interests they want a new faculty member to have, they form a committee to review the applications, pick some to interview, have a couple rounds of interviews that usually (pre-covid) include flying the applicants in and socializing a bit (to see if they're a good fit for the dept) along with teaching presentations and research talks, then the committee makes selections and make an offer to their top candidate. All this ensures the dept. will have faculty who will be doing research the other faculty find important or that fills a gap in their current dept. research/teaching, and that they have colleagues they get along with and can work well/collaborate with. All of that goes away if the BOT get to make the decisions. You end of with departments full of unqualified people put there for political reasons and they can erode what is taught from within the department. It's like what they're doing to New College, just on a larger scale. The thing that gets overlooked is that universities don't just teach people - they do research. Professors biggest responsibility is their research, not teaching. What kinds of research - knowledge creation, are we going to have if the people in charge of it are put in their positions because of politics?
