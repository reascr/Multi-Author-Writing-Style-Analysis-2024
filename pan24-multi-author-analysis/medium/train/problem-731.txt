After all with how many Indian scam call centres exist you'd think they would begin focusing efforts at home. Which I know they are but perhaps more resources needs to go towards combating the home grown fraud first instead of just using it as a way to spite China.
They need to take stand against scam call centers, I've been getting a call from some BS "continuing education agency" but they aggressively wanted my full name first, DOB and social etc, I've blown them off but they've been relentlessly calling me this whole weekend and even dumb enough to leave a voice mail with the sounds of the call center in the back ground.
I've read about them rescuing people who were forced to scam people at scam call centres so they're doing something, but it's obviously not enough. I imagine it's much harder than it seems to put an end to it, or they just don't have the resources yet.
This week coming up though, buddy, we got a 0c day showing and I canâ€™t wait to get out in shorts and T for a skate on the river.
