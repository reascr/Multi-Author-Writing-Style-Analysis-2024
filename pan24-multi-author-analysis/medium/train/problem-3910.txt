It's generally financial bad advice to have 56 billion dollars in one basket. In March, Elon This allows him to both liquidate Tesla stock and do a pump and dump with twitter. He bought 73.5 million shares at a price between $33 and $38 per share, which comes to 2.4b-2.8b. He broke the news of buying those shares on April 4th and the price went up to $51 per share at the peak, or 3.8b. He just make a billion dollars in a couple weeks by having a high profile and that's it. A couple guys who have influence have made similar plays recently, ask r/wallstreetbets. He was following this easy social media trend to make $71 million dollars a day for 14 days of minor effort. And he's before, , and been reprimanded . I guarantee he was bragging to a couple people about his free billion dollars.
