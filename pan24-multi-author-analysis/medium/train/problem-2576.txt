It's very easy to claim neutrality when war won't effect your borders unless everything goes to shit.
Oh and by the way, war won't effect their borders because they are already fully allied with the west.
It’s not even neutral in this conflict. Switzerland has participated in 100% of existing sanctions. It’s also (as usual) taken a very large number of refugees relative to population.
The only thing it hasn’t done yet is make an exception for existing law on reexport of arms. There’s a political process required to make such changes. It’s orderly and takes time. It shouldn’t be rushed or overlooked - that’s the exact sort of behavior that leads to bureaucracies and governments falling into the corruption and authoritarian trap over time.
Exactly, and it’s one of the most heavily armed nations for its size. It has steadily increased its military spending each year. Switzerland has active conscription, an active force of 180K, and a potential reserve force of 2 million. The country has a nuclear blastshelter network that can house 110% of the population. Switzerland is a giant mountainous tar pit riddled with camouflaged anti-tank cannons, artillery, small arm caches, concrete tunnels, full underground field hospitals, and dynamite-laden tunnels. Even the Nazis didn’t want to deal with Switzerland.
