How far back are we going to go on this? The Ottomans are gone, and have been gone for a century. The people responsible are dead.
And before that there are other ancient local civilizations, literally the remnants of the first civ ever is in mesopotamia, people are biased as fuck LOL. When its their favourite empire they are so happy and think its the one that shouldve succeeded. Same shit with constantinople delusion smh.
Hardly. That region of the world has been continuously inhabited for the last 10.000 years at the minimum. In fact this is where permanent settlements got invented. In that historical landscape most the Greeks as a whole are a mere blip. In fact most of the people the west commonly perceives as Greeks were the enemies of the Greeks and probably would have given you a good trashing if you called them that. Prime example are the Trojans who could not stand the Greeks and would much rather see one dead than alive. The Byzantine empire on the other hand was a metropolitan empire like most empires are. The Greeks were just a minority in that empire.
