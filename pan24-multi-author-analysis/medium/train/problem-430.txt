The Chinese don't want the world to get used to helping a small army stand up to an invading army. They want to be able to take Taiwan without any backlash.
China is blind and dillusional to its own hypocrisy and propaganda. It desperately wants international respect and to be seen as good for the world order but cant work out why few side with it. So it tries to buy them, literally buy friendship or demand respect through intimidation. You're never dealing with China but with a personality cult Emperor and the Communist political autocratic regime that has imposed itself on the Chinese nation. Look at those who align with China, almost all are autocratic, dictatorships at war with their own people as much as anyone else. No one is going to listen to China when it sides with Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Belarus, Myanmar, Venezuela, and half the Stan's.
China: Working for world domination and global fascism , tortures millions of Muslims , kills all political rivals , spys on all countries and is enslaving Africa for profit.
