If the GQP ever decides to promote rational people again (or even nearly rational people) rather than outright lunatics America could be in even more trouble than it is right now.
Perhaps this is just semantics but "doomed" should result in a loss of far more than Walker lost by.
Walker was easily one of the worst candidates the GOP has tried to run and he still got 48.6% of the vote.
