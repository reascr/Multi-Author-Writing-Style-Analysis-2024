From Cusco. Rail in and then take the bus to the top of the hill. There are multiple tourist trains per day, each one carrying a couple hundred passengers.
Serious unrest in Peru, but the clear story here is that American tourists who needn't want to stay in Aguas Calientes and walk up the hill for an hour, are now trapped in their six star hotel.
It's a pretty steep hill and at high altitude. Trains to Macchu Picchu are equipped with portable oxygen equipment because tourists get sick just from being at that altitude, let alone doing strenuous activity. Problematic if you have health issues.
Things has died down most places. Iam in cusco right now and there havent been a sign of protests in 3 days, the train to machu pichu opnened today, and tommorrow iam heading there. Right now there is only turtubelence in very specific regions, that has always been dangerous, where the drug cartels operates.
Most people come to Macchu Pichu for a day trip as well, so didn't have local accommodation arranged.
