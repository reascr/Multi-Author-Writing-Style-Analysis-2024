Can't trust corporations any farther than you can throw them of course, but Disney actually has a pretty long history of standing up for LGBT issues, at least for the past 30 or 40 years. I remember when they were offering gays partner health insurance and life/death benefits back when every other large corporation was standing on the sidelines in the early 00's, and they continue to integrate minorities and LGBTQ into their storylines, their marketing and their theme parks (was just at California Adventures yesterday with my kids, so can speak on that first hand). Are they doing it to make money? Yep, they're a corporation - but I wouldn't really worry about them changing stances anytime soon.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
