If a protest isn’t on the news for burning something down or affecting rush hour traffic, you probably won’t hear about it unless you’re actively a part of the community or it happens on a road you drive down.
Those protesters got the hell beaten out of them by shithead cops and then politicians turned around and gave them bigger budgets.
I wouldn't use a word that sounds as final as "lost" does because who knows what will happen in the future, I'm just saying that given recent experience I can totally understand people concluding that protesting isn't a good way to get the changes they want.
