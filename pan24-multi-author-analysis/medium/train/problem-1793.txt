American nurses have a multitude of different unions depending on region/individual hospital. The US also has many hospitals whose nurses are not unionized. I would be surprised if it spills over in any large scale to the US.
True, I don’t know much about the specifics, just sounded like something that could happen in US too.
It does really depend though, I had a friend who worked in Florida and said they were always understaffed and had more patients per person than they were supposed to. He moved out to Cali and has said it is infinitely better.
Every European country has its own healthcare system, and the mainland tends to do it a lot better than the U.K. does.
I don't know why you're getting downvoted but yeah there are definitely problems with nurses in the US. My mom is a nurse and was working 12 hour shifts sometimes 5-6 days a week during peak covid because of staffing issues. Nurses rarely go on total strike because when you're in a field like medicine, that can have immediate and tangible negative consequences for your patients, and nurses generally don't enjoy putting their patients' health at risk.
Still though, the hospital where my mom worked still had a nurses strike at some point last year (can't quite remember the exact date) but it was over staffing and being overworked.
It’s not even a European thing, it’s a U.K. thing that the NHS is falling apart and almost everyone working for it gets paycut after paycut when inflation is taken into account.
