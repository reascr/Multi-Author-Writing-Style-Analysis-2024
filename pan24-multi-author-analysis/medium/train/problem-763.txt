Belarus is already, for all intents and purposes, a Russian oblast, so it might just remove the hypocrisy (along with denying Putin an additional UN vote).
The average citizen knows that expressing dissenting opinions will get them fired or sent to the front lines, so the average citizen is keeping their head down just to survive.
I was reading something about this the other day and their are people in Russia and outside that believe if Putin was to die today it would turn into a power struggled between the top politicians, Putin is the only one keeping them in line unless they would be at each others throats to gain power with no successor.
Russian imperialism won't stop when Putin dies. He's surrounded by men who think alike and one of them will be his successor. Russian imperialism will only end if Russia is getting crushed on the battlefield and at home (much like Germany after WW2).
If this is true, I'm not sure and not sure if I belive it myself but the fact that Putin is keeping the in line one way or another I do belive and if he were to die before this war is over Russia is going to be in a very bad situation internally, I do belive their isn't a successor either because Putin is known to be paranoid and he wouldn't want somebody who can challenge him to take over if he fucks up too badly like he has done in Ukraine.
