> Democrats' victories on Tuesday came after voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 to overhaul the state's redistricting process. Previously, lawmakers themselves had drawn the legislative district lines. But for the 2022 cycle, the maps were set by an independent citizens commission, which prioritized drawing competitive districts.
They won because redistricting was made non-partisan by voters in 2018. Before this year, a majority of Michiganders voted for Democrats to represent them, while Republicans won the majority of seats due to gerrymandering.
That's why the Ohio commission just ignored the Ohio Supreme Court rulings until the could elect a new justice who will side with them. Now, the Ohio redistricting committee will conspire with the Ohio Supreme Court to ignore the constitutional amendment the people of Ohio voted in.
