I wouldn't be surprised. They are okay with every single atrocity one can imagine. Just like red army "liberating" eastern Europe in 40's.
One might have thought that something has changed last 100 years, but russians are still barbarians. I don't mean any particular russian just as a whole shishow "country".
Pretty intense comment there, friend. I would discourage you from tarring an entire country of 143 million people with the same brush as you would their leadership. And I would encourage you to look beyond the headlines of “Russia does this” and “Russia does that” to see that it is the leadership doing “this” and “that” rather than the entire country as a whole.
It's leadership does not have enough stamina to account for all the rapes and stolen washing machines. Yes, not all Russians are barbarians (i know some amazing people from ru), but a very significant part of population is exactly like that, thus we can say country is basically composed of barbarians. Especially since most sane russians already left their country after all this nonsense. So do not put the blame on leaders, because ultimately leaders derive power from the people. There is always more people than police/army/leaders, there is always more power in hands of people. They just need to chose to exercise it and pay the price necessary for freedom.
