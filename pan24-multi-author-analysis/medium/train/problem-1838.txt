There is a good case for ignoring the Supreme Court. Admittedly for unjustifiable reasons, Andrew Jackson ignored the Court. What can the Court do if the other branches ignore it? The Supreme Court cannot enforce anything and only has legitimacy from a perception of being fair-minded in its Judgements. The Democrats only have something to lose if it somehow hurts them in elections. Very few Republicans will likely ignore Supreme Court rulings because they don’t want to hurt their political weapon. If the Democrats are not willing to add Judges (say having 20-40 Judges added over time who rotate so it’s doesn’t remain the kangaroo court it now is), they have little to lose by making a case that the Court has undermined its own legitimacy. Unless the Court is changed in its size, it will be a nakedly partisan branch of government for at least the next few decades.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
