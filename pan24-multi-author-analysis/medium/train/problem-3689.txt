When you see the politician mysteriously dead after Lukashenko said they would invade if “conditions” were met. So I don’t know that people are given a choice on the matter. Especially if it’s a mixture of Russian troops with the Belarusian ones. Russians have a tendency to kill their own for motivation.
I remember hearing the same sentiments in the US when returning from Iraq from those not affected. Now so many say who cares if they invade. They will lose. The people that die defeating them, the mental health of those who survive, the families broken care.
It's been 12 hours since his death was announced, and there is still zero information?? That's a little weird. Is it know if he was at home at the time, for instance? Where was his body found? Was he transferred to a hospital? Common Reddit, do some sleuthing.
Yes. But it could be a major blow to the main supply lines coming in the country. They could cut off the trains and roads coming across from the west.
It will be interesting to see what the west does if it happens. I have no faith in my (US) government to do anything other than sanctions. But I hope I’m wrong.
