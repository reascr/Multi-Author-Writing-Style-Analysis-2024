Think of how many new people you interacted with for the first time yesterday -- a clerk at a store you'd never been to, a classmate you hadn't sat near before, a cute stranger you chatted up on a bus. Or maybe nobody new - many days are probably like that, spent with family, friends, that barista who was there last month, someone working the checkout line that you don't even remember from 3 years ago. Figure an average of 1-2 new people at work/school, 2-3 people out and about afterwards, and an extra 1 for weekends, so an average of about 5 brand-new-to-you people that you directly interact with per day.
I remember in high school we'd demonstrate the numbers of casualties (from ww1 & ww2) amongst our classmates... our school was small about 300 people.
100k people... I can't even imagine that. A football stadium of people just turned to meat... 100k people like people I have met in my life. All of them.. the best... the worst... drug addicted... rich.. poor... and those just trying to live.
