All that stuff like a flight computer, windows, and wings are just optional extras Big Aircraft tacks on to inflate the purchase cost. Don't be a sucker, Putin, rip those optional extras out!
He is right, dudes on record saying he will pay this price 3x over. Just listen to some recent Fiona Hill interviews, you don’t have to wonder what vlad is thinking because he literally is out there saying he’s at war with the west. Should probably take him seriously on that.
Without coming out and saying it they are saying they are going to fly with broken parts. Which is fine if the coffee maker is broken. It’s not fine when the backup or safety system is broken. A fully functional airline, with no spare parts, would park some planes and strip them every time they need a coffee maker, lav pump, or backup generator. Russia is saying fly them all.
So if you’re Russia and you don’t care about a preventable plane crash or two per year (because let’s be honest Boeing and airbus planes are fucking incredible feats of engineering and won’t all crash the second redundancy is removed) then go for it.
