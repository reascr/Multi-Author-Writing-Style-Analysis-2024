Ya it wasn’t japans fault he wasn’t charge. In France they found him insane and unfit to stand trial and then sent him back to Japan from a mental institution there. France dropped the charges and that cause the files to be sealed so Japanese authorities couldn’t get them even after they declared that he was sane to stand trial and he didn’t commit the murder because he was insane but out of sexual perversion.
The Japanese criminal legal system is kinda fucked because it has something like a 99% conviction rate. They’ll drop charges for just about anything they can’t guarantee will result in a guilty verdict, but if they are sure they can falsely charge someone and get a guilty verdict they’ve done that too.
Here's the thing, that not exactly your choice, theychave really fucked up laws around interrogation. I don't remember the exact time, but I think they can hold you up to 48 hours without a lawyer where mild assault is basically condoned and they can deprive you of sleep. This probably isn't the average experience, but not without precedent.
