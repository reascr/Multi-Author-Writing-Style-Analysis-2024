> The judge’s ruling was founded on the basis that Russia’s actions in Ukraine could amount to terrorism as defined by UK law and that the activists were stopping an illegal activity – namely the funding of terrorism.
Well extraordinary rendition and torture would be considered terrorism, which would make our countries (USA and UK) terrorist states too. So by that precedent, anyone can blockade any US or UK cargo ship and this judge would rule that it’s ok?
Doesn’t that kind of set a precedent for them to stop a lot of things that are going on around the world though? Seems like it could turn into a grey area.
Edit: instead of downvoting, would anyone care to explain what I’ve got wrong here? Isn’t the legal system based on precedent?
“Whataboutism” is just a term people throw around when they want to get away with things. Nobody should get away with a crime just because someone else has also committed a crime, that’s just absurd.
If someone commits a crime and a court rules in a certain direction, then legally they should rule in that direction every time. As in this case, the judge has basically ruled that Greenpeace can blockade any (well, most) of the world’s ships without any repercussions. So what do we think will happen next?
I’m just pointing out that I don’t think people realise the slippery slope this judge has opened up.
