It’s the lunacy of granting access to classified material without an investigation simply because someone was elected President, but then again, there was never the concern before that the sitting or former president would share everything with a foreign power, particularly an adversary, let alone take it home at the end of their term for what may well be nefarious reasons. Biden made a decision not to continue to allow TFG access to any classified material or receive classified briefings once he left office, a privilege afforded other past presidents based on need.
Incidentally, the same no investigation access, albeit far more limited, is also afforded House and Senate members based on their election to office, although there may be at least one exception now with the newly elected fugitive from the Brazilian justice system who has a propensity to “embellish his resume” (his words, not mine).
