The fuck are you smoking? Just open a book on modern history covering the last twenty years. Russia's military has been hands down the single greatest military force assembled on earth when it comes to facing off against unarmed and unorganized civilians, taking the lead as toughest military against the weak from China who held the top spot in the 70s and 80s and into the 90s. An entire generation of paratroopers and elite special forces honed their combat abilities on college age adults and senior citizens, sharpening their skills to a razor edge. Most of them died in the first few months of the Ukrainian conflict, but there should still be enough of them hiding under beds wetting themselves to pull out of Ukraine and send to Iran to do what they do best.
I agree with this even more because before WWII, many people overestimated Italy's military capacity, similarly to how Russia's military was overestimated before this war. From what I've read, Mussolini's generals at least warned him that Italy was not ready, unlike Putin's generals who seemed to tell him everything was going to be easy.
