80% of what they stole was shitcoins from shitcoin casinos. Just went looking for a source on the numbers, and it seems like the media doesn't differentiate Bitcoin from "cryptocurrency".
And the traditional financial system is any better at preventing NK at stealing money from internet users using credit cards online and the world forum cares about your well-being... Oh you sweet summer child.
I know that you're being condescending because you think you've got some kind of gotcha on that poster, but yes, the traditional financial system is orders of magnitude better at that. Transactions with actual money are reversible in the event of mistake or malfeasance, the regulatory environment means it's harder to intentionally or accidentally send money to terrorist regimes before it can be clawed back, the security is substantially better in usable monetary accounts than crypto held in any useful usable format, and if you are scammed, your assets won't be worth some wildly different amount if you recover them or get an insurance payout. Ah, yeah, that's the other bit - there's actual insurance on depositor accounts with real money.
Crypto makes shit harder for legitimate use with no benefit to the end user, and the massively increased vulnerability to scams both in theory and practice is one of the many, many ways crypto is a bad idea.
