Since this is a Baba O’Reilly Joke, it’s made worse with the fact when your realise that Pete Townshend of The Who was arrested in 2003 for possession of Child Abuse materials. Which was probably why in The Simpsons he was voiced by his brother Paul.
Paul Townshend voiced Pete's character in season 12 - which aired 2000-2001, so how would that be related?
Also, Pete was cleared of all charges by the police because he was actually researching a book and the investigation showed he had never downloaded anything, just entered credit card information.
The story is he was doing research for a book on child exploitation, and looking into bank and credit company compliance with child pornography on the net. He went to a verification site, entered his information, and never actually visited any of the actual sites.
He does say "that during the searches, SBU officers allegedly forced him to undress and then took the pictures.
'At 7 a.m., we were woken up, the door was broken down, we were taken out of our rooms, everyone who was in the diocese was put against the wall, separated and, as it has turned out, photographed...' Nikita said in a video message.".
I mean, I'm not saying it didn't happen, but it also has the hallmarks of something more nefarious. And I think one of the easiest ways to get people to not support someone would be claiming they're pedophiles and whatnot.
I'm not familiar enough with Ukrainian politics to know if that's something that would happen there, though I would certainly expect it in Russia...
I feel like this doesn't help that, either: "Representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church allegedly demanded that the priests of the UOC–MP deny Russia's armed aggression, talk about the "oppression of the Moscow church" and other Russian propaganda narratives. The SBU has charged the diocese’s clergy with high treason.".
