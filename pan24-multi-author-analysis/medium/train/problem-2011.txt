Usually yes, but Senators are considered elder statesmen for a reason. The members elected to the House are generally more inexperienced in the nuances of political procedure and precedent and aren't elected via a statewide vote. Therefore they are more prone to being a little more sensational than their counterparts in the Senate. Think Jewish space lasers or pedophile cannibals. That shit certainly doesn't ever come up in the Senate, only the House.
Second, this is with Republican backing. They are starting to question sending aid, but so far all of it has had cross party support. There's about 45 billion put aside for packages next year.
The US would be perfectly capable of providing good public healthcare and still support Ukraine. The reason you can't pay for healthcare has nothing to do with Ukraine receiving aid.
Goes to show you that regardless if I'm being serious or not, healthcare in America is and will always be dog shit and no one can properly defend it besides throwing the ol' bootstraps remark in response.
