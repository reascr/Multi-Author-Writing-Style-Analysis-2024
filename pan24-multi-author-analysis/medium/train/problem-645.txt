Is it just me or does $1.5 Million seem a bit low of a fine for a company committing these types of violations?
I agree that is far too low to discourage this contractor. I think those big meat packing companies should no longer work with that contractor, at the very least.
That is unfortunately because of the cap on the amount they can be fined, which won't change unless the law is amended. At least they went after the maximum amount allowed by law.
But they won't. Subcontracting cleaning the abbatoir distances them from culpability from minors being injured at their facilities. As intended.
