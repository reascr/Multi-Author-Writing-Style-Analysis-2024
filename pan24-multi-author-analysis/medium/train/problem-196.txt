“Reading these arguments was, to quote the baseball sage Lawrence Peter (‘Yogi’) Berra, ‘Déjà vu all over again,’” the judge wrote.
“Sophisticated defense counsel should have known better,” the judge wrote, adding, “In its discretion this Court will not impose sanctions, which the Court believes are unnecessary, having made its point.”.
The judge also rejected the Trumps’ arguments that some of the alleged fraudulent conduct occurred beyond the statute of limitations allowed under the law.
Ivanka Trump, who left the business to go to the White House in 2017, argued that the claims against her were time-barred and that she didn’t personally falsify any business records. The judge said the attorney general’s office has alleged liability “sufficiently” on Trump to survive a motion to dismiss.
And specifically just the Judge's decision not to impose sanctions. Despite the positions raised being frivolous (as defined by the judge) and repetitive (again, as defined by the judge), it's a shitty legal system that punishes a defendant for attempting to defend themself.
The judge most likely got his point across: "the answer is no, now move on." Imposing sanctions on a defendant or the defendant's lawyers, for attempting to defend themselves puts the country on a dark path. We absolutely should hesitate a long time before taking the first step down that road.
