More technical term is ethnic cleansing in this case. Which can be identified as part of a larger genocide. So you're not wrong. Just felt the need to be a word stickler.
Good question: Genocide is a broad term used to refer to a series of actions or general intent to destroy a population.
Textbook ethnic cleansing. Then massive attacks on Ukraines civilian infrastructure / electrical grids as winter is setting in, just to cause death and suffering. Putin and the entire Russian state apparatus are genocidal Nazis.
However(and I know this is uncomfortable), ethnic cleansing was not always considered genocidal or even called that. It used to be a method of relocating ethnicities to be with others in an effort to "help" them "self determine". Usually it was the former colonial master countries that did this when overseeing decolonization. And despite how scummy that is by our standards now, it wasn't an outright malicious attempt to destroy or remove, but an ignorant solution to create a form of harmony(I know, I know. Reaaally dumb).
Let's just still agree this ethnic cleansing is an act of genocide, regardless. Because that IS what Russia wants. They want to destroy Ukrainian identity, culture, language and history.
So while it isn't inherently considered a genocide by itself, it is a frequent component of one. But the word also changed a lot and can be conflated with genocide anyway if you want(full circle, hope you don't feel you wasted your time reading this shit), making the original commenter technically also correct. Idk. I probably could have left it alone and the point wouldn't have changed. Lol.
Genocide is . Ethnic cleansing is . The term ethnic cleansing began as a euphemism and has spread in usage because it describes a wide range of malicious behavior without actually accusing someone of a specific crime.
