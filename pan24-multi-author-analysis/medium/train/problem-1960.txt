He killed almost 100k people for this nothingburger and no protetests on the horizon. Why returning to russia would be worse ? Just cook up some story of evil NATO ... regrouping ... need to work harder together ... our mission ...
If Ukraine surrenders it would not exist anymore and people would be at mercy of putina. If russia returns home nothing changes for any of the russians. Nobody wants their land. EU and US are perfectly fine to use them as subcontractors to get oil and gas from earth and sell for dollars and euros.
Thas exactly what I meant. He can cancel his war tomorrow and nobody would protest because of exact same reason. Duma will make a law that denying russia won means 20 years in prison and done.
Because it takes a critical mass of people all saying no at once to have any effect. Otherwise, anyone who protests can just be disappeared.
Hardly. If all the non-military people all said no, Putin would have 2 options, punish them all or give into them. If he punishes everyone society will collapse in Russia 100% guaranteed. There wouldn't be enough people to run the country. The only option would be to give into them.
And even when you have that critical mass, the first people to get captured are killed anyway. See what's happening in Iran.
