Yea, these are just 25 idiots with a half baked plan that could never have worked. Like who would have recognized them? I can claim to be emperor of germany and maybe storm a public building, and my 80 million countrymen would laugh me all the way to my cell.
Mind you, the category of "Conservatives" is not very useful, as you would have parties some consider conservative which are like this (like AfD) and parties some consider conservative which are definitely not (like CDU).
Conservatives of today have become radicalized by disinformation spread by right-wing media and conservative politicians, and they are a serious national security threat in many nations.
I don't know enough about USA, but having just two (relevant) parties might make things more complicated --- although one would still want to look inside those parties (and elsewhere, out of them).
I know this is about Germany I was just making a comment about USA conservatives. It has been twisted and turned into a party of white Christian nationalists and if you look at the proud boys and the other major paramilitary groups it's borderline fascism.
