7%, as per the OBR, this is the worst fall since records began. Furthermore, house prices are likely to drop by up to 9% over the next 2 years.
Why are falling house prices so grim? By all accounts wasn't housing massively overpriced and unaffordable? The same thing happens here in the US where the media cheerleads for high housing prices.
If it's anything like the US, it's that meme of the guy hiding behind the tree rubbing his hands, as the corporations salivate at all the money they'll make renting out single family homes. They're just waiting for a fire sale where people lose there jobs and are forced to sell at a reduced price.
They aren't going to sell if their not getting equal or more than they bought it for unless their desperate, so although prices drop would be great for buyers, the stock is going to massively reduce anyway. Then you get into supply and demand territory of the houses that do go to market will be outbid sky-high.
The point I'm more making is that everybody hails this as great for first time buyers etc, however, all that will happen is that the houses will be advertised as cheap, but the first time buyers will end up in biding wars they will invariably lose.
