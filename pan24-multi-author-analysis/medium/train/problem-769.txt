My own family had farms since the mid 19th century until recently. We just couldn’t do it anymore. It sucks paying high grocery bills but food costs money to grow. A lot. It is such an odd market arrangement; if there were some high tech wizardry that was as fundamentally critical to life itself we would gladly pay through the nose for it.
It’s funny… they blame “weather in EU” for veggies shortage… but some how, I have not noticed any shortage in EU… maybe it does have something to do with the fact that electricity cost makes it unprofitable for UK farmers to operate hothouses?
