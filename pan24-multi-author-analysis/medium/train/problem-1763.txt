In Libya NATO's main objective was imposing a no flight zone to prevent what's happening in Syria now: air raids killing civilians and rebels alike.
>Russian forces since October have intensified strikes on Ukraineâ€™s electrical grid and other critical infrastructure, repeatedly plunging Ukrainians into darkness and winter cold. Utility workers and others are scrambling during what have been nearly weekly barrages on infrastructure to restore electricity and heating.
I heard Gov Abbott sent some energy experts from Texas to do a preliminary exam of the system. They thought it looked okay. Said they wished the Texas grid was that good. /s.
Make Russia pay for these repairs please. Targeting civilian infrastructure that has no military value is a war crime according to international law and a deliberate act of terror so use frozen Russian assets to pay for rebuilding Ukraine's infrastructure.
In Serbia there's no proof NATO deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure to break the population into submission. That wasn't their aim anyways as they were after a dictator not occupation of the country like Russia in Ukraine.
