That was where I went to begin with, but it could also be any of a slew of other chemicals we’re regularly exposed to today, or even some combination.
For example, it could be related to the chemicals found in perfumes included in most detergents, absorbed by the testes from undergarments.
I wouldn't doubt it, but the way it reads also suggests there's other factors such as obesity which heavily contribute to detrimental health and evidently, low sperm count.
I know microplastics are the looming crisis on our horizon but my first guess is the prevalence of obesity and poor lifestyles. I don't have time to review the study but I'm curious if it accounted for BMI in its comparisons.
this is what ive always suspected. whenever possible, i try not to eat out of plastic containers or drink from plastic cups. it probably makes no difference but it makes me feel "safer".
I’ve heard that too, but likewise don’t have a source. And I wouldn’t think they’d survive the evaporation cycle. So it would mostly impact people whose water supply is down slope from someone else’s treatment plant.
"Obese men were 42 percent more likely to have a low sperm count than their normal-weight peers and 81 percent more likely to produce no sperm. ".
Have you been to a developing nation? They use plastic for fucking everything because it's cheap and laws are merely a suggestion sometimes, governments don't give a fuck about limiting plastic use and waste.
The study I referenced was only comparing BMI and fertility so it didn't account for other factors. In general, healthier life styles are associated with optimum fertility.
