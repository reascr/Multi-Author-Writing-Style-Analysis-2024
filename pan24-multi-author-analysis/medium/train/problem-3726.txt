You install one of your bodyguards as the new President as he is like super smart. The Duma passes a new law that can jail anybody who gets sick and complains about a lack of medication now because the new president of the pharmaceutical company fixed it. HE FIXED THE MEDICATION PROBLEM. In a completely unrelated turn of events, your army grows by an additional 250,000 soldiers.
Governments don't really matter because most people don't understand how supply trains actually work. They streamlined the precursors for alot of things out of China or India just like alot of countries do. Why? Because it was cheaper and faster then making an industry at home to source it or they didn't have enough companies local to meet demand. Then the pandemic hit and messed up the entire flow of materials and goods for EVERYTHING. People need to understand how much money and time the global economy as a whole spent making this smooth working tango of cargo ships and shipping schedules that make it possible to get that new kitchen blender you wanted. Then it got a massive heart attack because covid and it will take a decade to sort out.
Russia isn't immune to the same issues. They cant make the medicine or precursor at home so they buy from somewhere else the materials they need, just like everybody else does for the most part. Add in a war, a dash of sanctions, stir with a corrupt institutions and this what you get.
You plan to set a meeting with Sergey Komarov, a good friend and the president of the top pharmaceutical company in Russia to help the Russian people.
