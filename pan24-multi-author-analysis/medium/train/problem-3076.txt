Interesting, crickets are one of the few insects that are listed as "clean meat" in the dietary laws established in Judeo-Christianity.
I though, for the most part, all 3 Abrahamic religions had similar classifications of "Clean" vs "Unclean".
Considering that insects are neither Halal nor Kosher, I can only imagine the practical challenges in getting this garbage to market around the world.
So the 6.2 billion people in the world who aren't Jewish or Muslim are unable to eat food because the other 1.7 billion chose not to? Given that the food has to be clearly labeled it seems really easy to avoid if that's your choice.
What are the most lucrative markets and what are the practical challenges of serving them? Pork isn't halal or kosher but is still easy to get in many lucrative markets.
I don't get the why people are uneasy about the insects. Isn't it like meat but less hurtful bcs the insects have almost no pain and consciousness?
I grew up vegetarian and started eating meet with 18. For me it makes no difference. I would also eat cats and dogs if someone would serve them.
