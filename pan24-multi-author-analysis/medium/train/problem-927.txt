Maybe that is totally insane, but it would have the benefit of netting another senate seat while also being bipartisan.
A Warnock win would basically be Tester insurance for 2024. have zero vulnerable Republican seats, which puts Dems completely on the defensive. Jon Tester (Montana) is arguably the most vulnerable Dem seat in '24. Warnock winning this runoff would make a Tester '24 loss just a little more bearable.
The Warnock race still matters, too. Not just for short-term things like confirming judges and passing bills without Manchin/Sinema, but long-term as well.
I'm really curious how the Sinema primary plays out now. Most Dems want Sinema primaried and removed, but not at the expense of a general election victory. Republicans got a bunch of primary wins for candidates that the base loved but who got smacked in the general.

Not saying we shouldn't primary Sinema. But it must be done carefully and with the right challenger.
GA, VA, NV, and possibly AZ. That’s just off the top of my head. If any of those senators vacate their office, that governor can appoint their replacement.
And if any sitting Senator becomes unavailable to vote for some reason, that can cause problems. Diane Feinstien is basically a vegetable at this point. So this isn’t far fetched.
