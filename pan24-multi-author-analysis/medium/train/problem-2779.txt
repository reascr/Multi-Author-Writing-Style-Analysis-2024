A long and protracted war is only to the disadvantage of Ukraine. Though Russia is burning through material and men like wildfire, it’s still only a percentage of their total force. The lives of Ukrainians are invaluable, for Russia to even begin to trade at a worse value per Ukrainian death, the destruction of Ukrainian soldiers and civilian population is a permanent effect of what will be a temporary war for Russia. Russia simply cannot be allowed to recover from this war, even if it meant the achievement of Ukraines aims of reestablishing its 2014 borders. The disarmament of Russia, dissolution of the Federation so that each State is its own sovereign entity, and removal from international entities such as the UN are the only ways of establishing a long lasting peace- a peace that does not dissemble on the outside a ceasefire and in reality a period of rearmament and refitting to finish the war a second time.
Everyone: ‘so you’re going to pull all your troops out of Ukraine, help rebuild, return all the children you stole, and pay quite a bit of reparations?’.
