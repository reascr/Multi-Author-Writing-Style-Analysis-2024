Ah yeah. Give me more Germany bashing in the comments. Let us all forget that the Ukrainians can't hit a target with HIMARS without US confirmation or why the US haven't delivered long range rockets much ealier . /s off.
In the end I'm not suprised about the Germany bashing. Far right nationalist parties everywhere in power in Europe + the current discussion culture on the internet + the failures of the Schr√∂der/Merkel era.
You can't compare the superior US support for Ukraine with the German one because the US military budget + all their weapon systems they have left of the conflicts in the middle east and the all time overproduction isnt comparable with the state of the Bundeswehr. Germany has always struggled to meet its military NATO requirements.
BUT STILL Germany sent a lot of military and humanitarian stuff. Why did the outcry because of Switzerlands ammunition delivery denial for the Gepard stop? How hard must a genocide be to adapt your laws to the current situation? There are currently 30 Gepards in Ukraine defending their civilians from the genocial attacks from Russia and dozen more Gepards will follow. Now it's a race between its ammo depletion and the current plans to produce the ammo in Germany and Ukraine. I know Switzerland send a ton of humanitarian help but what could Switzerland fear if they would give up their neutrality? No one would ever invade them and no country would survive a nuclear holocaust...
You mean FAILED. For decades. Germany has not met its commitments. The strongest economy in Europe and they won't (not can't...won't) pay their debts.
Why can't countries with Leopard tanks just go ahead and send them to Ukraine without German approval (with the exception of the Netherlands since they don't actually own their tanks).
