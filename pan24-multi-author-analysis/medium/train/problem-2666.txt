Let’s stop pretending Joe and his entire family is anything but giant pieces of shit, and while it benefits us currently, he’s still a POS that is just on the side that benefits him currently, and if that changed he would flip 250 percent yes.
I do wish he'd actually vote for the climate change stuff and whatnot, but he's a thousand times better than a Republican.
He's in a state that is like 80% Trump supporters. I don't care what he calls himself as long as he keeps voting to confirm Biden's judges, keeps Dems as the majority party, and votes for all but the most ambitious Dem bills like he always does.
