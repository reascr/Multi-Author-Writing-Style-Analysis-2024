That's bullshit. Dishonorable discharge yes I know that . Not sure what it was but said to be valued at 10,000. He was head of a global security. Our government says that the charges are false and his imprisonment is political. That tells me that he was still working for the government. Oh and he was a marine. The only person that should rust away in prison is Victor aka merchant of death! Biden traded a bishop for a pawn. It was a black lesbian basketball player that has publicly showed disdain for our country and was locked up for a cannabis conviction. Putin couldn't of expected him to fall into this trap so easily. Now he gets to sit back and watch the idiots in our country bicker.... Jeez biden knows the left still have the media and a strong presence in both the house and senate, and control over fbi. He is untouchable no matter how obvious his actions are.
This swap was a brilliant move by Putin. He forced Biden's hand because it was either this deal or no deal, and Putin knew that it would further drive the culture war in America, and pit Americans against Americans. It is working.
