But the situation is really depressing. Nevertheless it's not too late to prevent the 3 degree raise.
1.5°C does also mean catastrophic consequences, but it's far better than 3°C of catastrophic consequences.. far sooner.
Not intending to make this personal, but I think it’s incredibly unethical to cling to one collective improvement in the midst of a mass extinction. I’ll avoid the science behind why this win was possible and others unlikely. Part of the reason we’re in this mess is that the electorate, once it found out it was systematically lied to in the 70s, is still far too tied to BAU.
We need to accept reality and press those in power with unrelenting pressure before political regression continues. If the actual message is that collective change is possible - but isn’t happening - aren’t the cynics right? What we do with that information is what matters: not denial or misplaced hope, not nihilism but remembering the collective will that workers used to actually grab a small slice of the pie and to employ it again before any hope of mitigation is lost.
