UK has a running trend of constant healthcare cuts, transportation cuts, military cuts, social worker cuts etc but lord knows where all the money is going because everything seems to be getting cut down.
And I’m not even going to try and be neutral and diplomatic about Brexit, it full on just put the country through the wringer.
They have been cutting spending on everything for years to try to push privatization. It is literally a textbook ring wing move. First they cut funding for a government service, like healthcare or postal services. They keep making cuts until the system starts to fail. Then they proclaim "See, government can't manage things We should let private sector take over cause private sector is a magic cure all that can do anything and everything perfectly".
They are trying to kill healthcare, education, and more. Likely, they are cutting defense spending to force more spending on private services and more equipment.
Tory rule for the past umptiumth years, & they just keep digging a deeper hole. I thought the US electorate were slow learners.
For a vote of no confidence to pass you need a 2/3 majority which the Tories can easily put down. They won’t allow a general election to be called because they know they will not be re-elected. They will milk this for all it’s worth until around 17th December 2024 when they are legally required to call an election.
