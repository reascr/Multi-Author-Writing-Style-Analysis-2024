I call it a sad irony because we know exactly what will happen: Republicans will blame the Biden Admin for open borders and weak security and whatnot incentivizing migrants, so Dems will be on the defensive and denying that thereâ€™s anything over which to be concerned. What will not happen is any sort of meaningful conversation much less policy regarding the actual drivers of migration at these levels.
Where does that fall on the most pressing republican agenda? Perhaps there needs to be a list to reference for the next election cycle to keep a scorecard on promises met. A montage of his accusations would be nice.

The sad irony here is that there is a major migration problem across the hemisphere. People are picking up in record numbers and taking unimaginable hardships and risks hust for the chance to end up here and live a life as an undocumented immigrant with painfully few options and opportunities available to them in comparison to those with some sort of immigrant status here.
