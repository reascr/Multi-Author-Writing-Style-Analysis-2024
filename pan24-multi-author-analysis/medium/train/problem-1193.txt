In seriousness, it's hard to think of prominent Americans who have done as much in the past 50 years to set a positive example as a human being. Maybe Fred Rogers and Dolly Parton. Among politicians it's even harder.
In Carter's 40+ years post-presidency, he could have made billions from consulting and speaking engagements, or had his fill of golf, fine dining, and exotic travel. Instead he built houses for the poor with Habitat for Humanity. Talk about a legacy of humble service.
This makes me inadvertently sad. He is so old but it feels like he shouldn't quite yet leave. I guess we can't just live forever. I hope he is comforted by the presence of his loved ones at this time. ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜¢.
Ah man, that makes me sad, but also 98 and on his own terms surrounded by family. Not to mention he'll pass with nothing but praise. Probably the best way to go if I'm being honest.
I'm shocked he didn't die while on a Habitat for Humanity build site. You may not like how he was in office but he was a decent caring person who devoted his life to giving back.
He's the exception to the adage that anyone who wants to be President is morally unsuited for it by the very fact of wanting a position with that much prestige and power.
