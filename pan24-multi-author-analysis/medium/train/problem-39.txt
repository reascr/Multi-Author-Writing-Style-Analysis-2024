Lula started the policies, continued by his successor, that put Brazil in the Lula presided over some of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of Brazil. Lula actively supported dictatorial regimes in the Americas (Nicaragua, Cuba, Venezuela, Honduras) and abroad (Iran, Russia, Angola). Lula reproduces Russian imperialist propaganda. Lula favored billionaires and big companies that were willing to finance PT's campaigns with public money and public contracts. Lula had some good welfare policies, but Brazil deserves a much, much, much better left wing than him. Fortunately, he has misguided himself into thinking that the growth of the 2000s was due to his innate talent (lol) and not to the commodities boom, and he is going to burn all of his legacy in the next 4 years. Let's hope our democracy survives and a better generation of politicians can come from the ashes.
I saw the thumbnail and had a fantastic joke to post. Now I'm fully convinced that I have never, nor will I ever, have an original thought in my life.
