Whining about Hunter Biden, whining about the DoJ and "two-tier justice systems," whining about Joe Biden, whining about the economy and inflation and gas prices and jobs, and sitting there diddling themselves while solving nothing and holding the country hostage in an endless game of brinksmanship regarding the debt ceiling?
It's gonna be a shitshow in the House, but they won't work on or get any sane legislation done. That will bite them in the ass big time come 2024. Do-nothing governance is a harder and harder sell. Also, if they fuck up on the debt ceiling they will certainly be toast.
Yup. Biden and co. Need to get Machiavellian here. The Dems seem more unified than ever, while the Cons are seeing cracks form within their Party. Biden needs to wedge a metaphorical crowbar into those cracks at widen them as far as they’ll go. Seeing as how piss-easy it is to rile Republicans up, it shouldn’t be too hard.
