So tech is not that complicated, automobiles are not that complicated. What is the complicated part that you can't figure out? You need a doctor? They're just going to give you antibiotics if you've got an infection. Tell me where it hurts. If you break your bone they're just going to set it the same way they did in previous centuries. You want an X-ray?
This take is overrated. Yeah, if you want to set up a semiconductor fab you're going to need some specialist knowledge but anybody can learn to build simple electronic circuits and how to program software. These are not really particularly difficult skills to master and yet many people are clueless about electronics and programming. That doesn't mean that they're really all that complicated, it's just that people are lazy.
