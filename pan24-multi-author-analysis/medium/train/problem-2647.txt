I have yet to find locate suitable work in rural Ohio (since moving just prior to covid). My wife took a job that advanced her career so we moved.

Interesting how the corporate MSM keeps failing to mention OHIO which has had one of the most aggressive, regressive Republican agendas under Dewine, and in several instances, even more regressive than Florida and Texas.
