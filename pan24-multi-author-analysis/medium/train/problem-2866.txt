Here in Washinon State it's colder than usual for this time of year. We usually don't have snow that sticks, until around Thanksgiving. We've had several inches on the ground for over a week now. The planets has been screwed up and it's going to get worse. Politicians just keep supporting industry without climate improvement being mandated. The rich will continue to do so, until their factories are affected and their families are dying. To them, it's a problem we can deal with later. The problem is. IT IS LATER!
ETA: Mates, I stopped reading too soon and drew the wrong conclusion about where this piece was going and have been corrected twice --- so far. My bad. I'm going have a nice glass of wine with my lovely wife now. Secure in the knowledge that what I wrote is true, none the less. And thank you to those here who recognized it also.
Not as extreme here but similar. I'm a gardener. Anyone who spends time out in Nature can see and feel the changes. Flowers that should have died back months ago are still blooming.
Because we are killing the earth; our home and the people who make money doing the things that kill it don't care.
