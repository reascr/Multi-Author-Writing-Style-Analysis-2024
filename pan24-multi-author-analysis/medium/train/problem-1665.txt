I'm nice so I'll explain myself to a loser troll. What I mean by "beyond left and right" is that one's political stance takes a back seat when 1) a terrorist organization passes a law legalizing the use of nukes to your country and 2) there exists a political party that is known to take money from said terrorists to create underground organizations as well as supporting policies that fund the Kim regime with tax payer money.
Hmm, a right-wing pro-corporate asshole gets elected president and all of a sudden federal agencies are raiding unions claiming they're working for North Korea. Nothing suspicious here, I'm sure.
things related to north korea are beyond right vs left. you don't know the relationship between the minjoo party and Kim's regime, so get your ignorant ass out of SK politics. NK spies have had free reign over the past 5 years because of a leftie president, NK defectors were forcefully deported back, and the left wing gave hundreds of millions to NK over the past 30 years under the "sunshine policy".
