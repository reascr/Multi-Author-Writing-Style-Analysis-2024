Recent government reports document how Medicare Advantage plans rake in billions of extra dollars from the federal government by describing their patients as sicker than they really are and by classifying certain conditions and treatments as more serious than they are. As a result of these and other egregious practices, Medicare Advantage costs the government about 3 percent more per person than traditional Medicare—more than $9 billion in aggregate in 2022—and that’s after the Affordable Care Act substantially reduced the level of overpayment to insurers.
If they were alive today, these presidents would be shocked to learn that nearly half of all seniors will enroll in private, not public, Medicare plans next year.
