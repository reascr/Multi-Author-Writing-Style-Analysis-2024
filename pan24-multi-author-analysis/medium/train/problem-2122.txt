It really isn't. Hazaras, Tajiks and other smaller groups are always in friction with the various Pashtun tribes, who form the powerbase of the Talis. Obviously it's not that black and white and there is a spillover between the camps but that's the basis of it. Tribal elders in the rural villages rule their tiny fiefdoms and they're also in friction with the urban areas who they tend to view as westernized and Haram. The urban areas tend to view the rural areas as backwards. Afghan in 125 or less words.
Nothing in the US gets even close to Taliban, and never will. If some group were to start detonating car bombs and gun down people at pride events, the government would go Waco on them.
Gotta keep a steady supply of young boys being born to conscript and indoctrinate into their warped ideology As well and girls to oppress and forcibly marry to men three times their age.
They should also ban everything guns, bombs, helicopters, tanks, luxury cars and accessories their leaders use cause those are also "Western conspiracies".
Doesn't negate the fact that allowing the Talis to do what they did while you had the weapons and equipment ready to rock shows me you were actually supporting their worldview for the women and children of Afghanistan or you were too much of a coward to step up for what was right. I have nothing but respect for the soldiers of the Panjshir Valley who stood their ground as a last stand of anti-Talis but alas, they were outnumbered and outgunned. True heroes in my opinion. The vast majority of the ANA and ANP ended up demonstrating they are nothing but contemptible cowards, which was the suspicion of the western trainers from the get-go.
