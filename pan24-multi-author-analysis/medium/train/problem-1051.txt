This is the reason the US refuses to give Ukraine ATACMS (very long range precision missiles that can be launched through the HIMARS platforms and hit inside Russia proper), due to the fear of escalating to nuclear weapons retaliation by Russia, in fact it was just revealed this week that the US somehow (not detailed yet) blocked the HIMARS platforms they sent from even being able to launch these missiles (as if they could have gotten them from elsewhere XD) so even if they did send them, unless it was a software update/flip of switch, they wouldn't be able to use them.
The stunningly idiotic Russian take is not that Ukrainians can't physically (due to lack of ability) attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine....it's the stated position that it is MORALLY WRONG for Ukraine to attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine. It is astounding. "Don't you DARE attack our missile launching jets that we are using to wreck you mutherfuckers, your mothers, your children, your schools and hospitals. You are morally obligated to let us kill you.".
