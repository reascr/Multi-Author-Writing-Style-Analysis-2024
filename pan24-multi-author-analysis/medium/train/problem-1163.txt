It’s not just his media background, he’s not just some puppet milling about he’s displayed true leadership, I’d argue the kind found once a decade. I sincerely hope that he either has or finds the wisdom to keep things going until the war ends and even past that, to forge a truly permeant new state.
I think it's valuable for us to remember how many young people are on here, some even interested in current events. They won't always have learned the proper academic definitions of things yet, and have to go by looser, more pop-culture understandings.
They don't want to be looked down on or talked down to, who wants that? But we still have to define our terms for them a lot, just to save ourselves the headaches of misunderstanding.
We're going to make much more progress as a species when we use our knowledge as a resource to share, instead perceiving it as something that makes us better than others.
Everyone is kinda free-wheeling like that when they're young, as people get older they usually get lazier about wanting to jump in and participate like that. Given how much free time most kids get, and how alluring the no-restrictions nature of online discourse can be at that age, I like my odds.
