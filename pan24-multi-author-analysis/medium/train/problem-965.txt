I want to know which senator gave tours pre January 6 and to whom, as well as who is responsible for disabling the emergency buttons in the Senate offices.

I still stand by the notion that had those nutjobs managed to kill Warren or AOC with that flagpole with a spear on it one of them fashioned up, the absolute nuclear outrage from everyone sane as a result of seeing an elected official skewered on the flag herself would have undoubtedly lead to open civil war. These moronic, racist, seditious fools are toeing the line on starting another civil war and I have no doubt they'll lose with a whimper in the same way the Confederate failures lost as well. Look at their squealing now when they're being charged in a court, they cosplay as some big bad wannabe but the moment they cross the line suddenly its all just a joke because they see how actions have consequences when its bearing down on them. If they want to behave like insolent children we need to treat them like insolent children and give them the time out (jail time) they deserve. They should not be welcome in civilized society.
