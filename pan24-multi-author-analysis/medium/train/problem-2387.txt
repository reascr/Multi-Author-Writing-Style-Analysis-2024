Simply because of the paper work and beaurocracy required to perform a clinical trial. Therefore the cosmetic industry run "volunteer studies". They still require ethics etc. but you can set up your own ethics committee and pass off your own experimental protocols.
The volunteers I worked with on some volunteer studies did get compensated. No where near the level of a clinical trial but some monetary value. The customer of one study I did required video diaries and provided cameras which the participants could keep if they completed the study.
in the phase I clinical trials of antidepressants where healthy people became suicidal, those studies were never published and antidepressant suicide were put as placebo suicide. These companies do some really messed up things.
In non-healthy trials i.e. those where the volunteer needs to have a certain condition, they're looking for a cure. I helped run an ance study where participants required a certain grade of acne (on the Leeds acne scale. Bristol got stool, Glasgow got coma, Liverpool had palleative care pathways. Leeds is known for acne.) The treatment was so successful for one candidate they really didn't want to return the device.
The non publication of adverse results or even results where nothing happened is a problem across science and engineering. How much research has been funded to look at something which has already been looked at?
Someone consenting to something is always better than someone being forced to do it, though. In this case at least, the human would want to do it. Your dogs probably wouldnâ€™t.
