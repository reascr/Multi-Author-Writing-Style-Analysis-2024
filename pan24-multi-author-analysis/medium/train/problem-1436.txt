In states they no longer have a majority they simply resort to and bizarre ideas like are contemplated.
On the other hand in North Carolina despite having gerrymandered a majority in the legislature and congressional districts they have bizarrely insisted on engaging in unnecessary , while in Florida they have bogus to confuse voters. Enough does not seem to be enough.
