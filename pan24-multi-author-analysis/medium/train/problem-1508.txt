Most folks didn't live next to Russia. I remember my dad telling me (and he had to serve in the Red Army back in the 80s. It was a fucking mess even back then. I can't stress it enough) some ten years ago that Russia's got a lot of shit, but most of it is old and rotting, and a good chunk of the rest of it is nonfunctional because of corruption, and that the Russian society and how they govern hasn't really changed much since then, so he has no reason to believe that their military's in a better shape than it was when he was a young draftee prison guard starving and freezing alongside the prisoners. At least they shaved their superior's dog and painted his horse green and nothing terrible came from it because their superior knew bloody well that there's only one of him in this shithole, and the drafted guards are many, and the vast majority of them are from annexed territories, so they like and trust each other much, much better than they like and fear him.
Just create 10 generations of psychologically fucked up dedovshchina'd russian men and watch the societal issues and generational trauma fucking devastate russian society.
