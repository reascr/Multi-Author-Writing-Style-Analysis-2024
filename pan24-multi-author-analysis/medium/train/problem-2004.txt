Hmm let’s see, should the Israelis that stole the homes 2 years ago leave, or should the Palestinians that have lived there for hundreds of years leave? That’s a tough one.
No. When people understand that a Jewish State is part of the Jewish identity that’s when they will fully understand the complexity of the situation. Not the occupiers nonsense that is spread by a hateful organization.
You know, you actually do make a good point though, Israel is a lot like Russia and the Palestinians are a lot like the Ukrainians. Just less white, so westerners don’t care about them as much.
The winning party don’t need no mediation. They just continue inflicting pain until the invading party leaves. And by the look of things, Russia won’t just need to leave anymore.
Did Ukraine capture any war criminals they can release in return for the privilege of negotiation, like Netanyahu did with PLO terrorists?
Like offering to mediate between israel and an invading neighbour, after Israel has established dominance obliterating the invader, but while the invader is still holding a chunk of israel.
They’ll need to repatriate hundreds of thousands of abductees, pay hundreds of billions of reparations, and chances are, won’t be allowed to continue existing as a regime after all this. Not because someone will invade them, but because when they’re imploding from the inside, there’ll be a shortage of people overseas to extend the regime a lifeline. On the contrary, everyone will be working to exacerbate the conditions making them crack, and pressuring Russias allies into withholding funding and aid.
