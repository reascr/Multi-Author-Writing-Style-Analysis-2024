I think the issue here is that quoting someone in titles is neutral language, with the implication that what is being quoted is an opinion that could potentially be incorrect or lying. It's a good tool to have, such as if you're quoting an argument made by a lawyer in a court case, but you're right that it's jarring here.
Can articles stop with the quotation marks already to refer to Russia's invasion, crimes and terrorism?
It's like there is still a debate going on whether Russia is doing something illegal or it's completely fine to invade your neighbor, expand own territories by force, level entire cities to the ground, kidnap children, forcibly relocate tens of thousands of people, bomb the crap out of civilian infrastructure etc. And these are just things Russia has admitted themselves.
Because they said "Crimes of Russian aggression" instead of "Russian crimes", and also using more than one set of quotation marks in a title is considered unwieldy.
Unnecessary neutrality is a really bad problem in journalism, even among reputable sources with good intentions. It gets used irritatingly often in articles about climate change.
