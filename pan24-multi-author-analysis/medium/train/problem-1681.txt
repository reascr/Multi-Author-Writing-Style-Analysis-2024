Because they consistently assume ancient peoples lacked the technology to build large, imposing, mathematically accurate and astrologically aligned super structures and the only explanation for their existence is 'Aliens'. When in many cases they could literally just talk to local peoples, study local legends or do some more archeological research to find out the clever ways ancient humans very much created these things themselves. Couple that with mostly white dudes insisting this nonsense because they can't fathom things being built without backhoes and it starts to smack of racism.
There are over a thousand moai on Easter Island as well as many, many unfinished ones. Many more are buried. It's interesting because people think there are only a handful but there are tons of them, they're everywhere. What blew me away was finding out that to transport them they likely "walked" them rocking side to side as they "walked" across the island. Apparently it wasn't a very safe method as the island is littered with broken moai along their transport routes.
