She was a member of the public in a police exclusion zone. Being from the media doesn't shield her from being detained for that. I don't think this will go well for her. Being held for three days seems unreasonable though.
So it was not police just doing whatever, it was a court ordered removal. If the court didn’t say ‘and let the media stay’, then ‘public’ means everyone. Not to mention that CGL had filed civil charges against her (later dropped) for being there during the injunction. Especially in BC, there’s no “we can trespass on your property and yell ‘media’” option.
A court ruling in NFLD has the extent of NFLD as its maximum, so it’s not a precedent. BC has its own courts, which they probably should have considered (or an SCC ruling) before pretending that part means anything.
If they wanted to relate, they could have pointed out that in 2021 (same year, different location in BC) the media asked a court to amend the court injunction around Fairy Creek to specify media was allowed in exclusion zones during the court injunctions.
