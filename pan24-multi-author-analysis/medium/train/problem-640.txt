>The closure of the Inca citadel that dates back to the 15th century and is often referred to as one of the new seven wonders of the world comes as protesters have descended on the capital Lima, largely from remote Andean regions, to demand the resignation of President Dina Boluarte.
Also, Congress and the Executive position have been for the last 3 presidencies divided; right wing and left wing respectively.
Christians, Elite, Military in support of Congress which is led by Fujimori's daughter, and the more modest, indigenous, left wing, extreme left wing elements of Peru supporting the party that has ran the last 3 executive appointments (and whose member, ex president Castillo, carried out the self-coup in Dec 2022).
It seems that the current Peruvian constitution has a clause that congress can impeach a president on the grounds of "moral incapacity" which its vagueness effectively allows Congress to push forward impeachments due to the subjectivity of the phrase. (Since the last 3 presidents have been impeached by Congress, the latter has effectively become more powerful than the presidency).
There's been two massacres of civilians by the state when they tried to take over an airport and another occasion.
The native Peruvians are within their rights to demand the constitution be changed so they can have their say.
The folks with the guns, the jet-setting criminal gang in Lima do not want the natives to have the means to improve their lives because they would become a powerful force against them.
As an archaeologist, I think the vast majority of these ancient sites need to strictly limit the number of tourists. Perhaps a lottery system to restrict numbers.
