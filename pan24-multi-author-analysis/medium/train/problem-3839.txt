This is the new bar for "minimal effort" journalism. Of course the typo IS dumb and hilarious, but I just put almost as much effort into typing this comment as the author put into the article. Writing a paragraph, then copying a dozen tweets and calling it a news story.

It's pretty embarrassing for any outlet trying to be a serious news source. Reporting on a typo is tabloid-level content. That's one of the reasons I stopped reading The Huffinon Post about ten years ago. It transitioned over to all low-effort clickbait articles with overly sensational headlines. They were always a rather biased site, but there was a time when they were trying to actually be a journalistic news source.
