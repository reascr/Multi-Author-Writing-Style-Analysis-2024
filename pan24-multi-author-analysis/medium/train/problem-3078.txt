Pretty sure they were facilitating FSB operations anyway. That's without taking in account, I assume, all the pro-Russian preaching in Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk.
The modern Russian Orthodox Church was literally created by the Soviet Union to push propaganda. They tried to destroy organized religion completely early on in the communist era. However, during WW2 they needed to find new ways to motivate their soldiers and religion does wonders when it comes to convincing men to die for a cause. Stalin installed the most compliant priest he could find as the grand patriarch and they've pretty much been tools of the government ever since then. There is no separation of church and state in Russia as the former exists solely to support the latter.
Russia is such a joke. The orthodox church is completely controlled by the FSB and the Russian government as a means of thought control and turning the population bloodthirsty and fascist. And in case there was any confusion as to their true intentions, Russian state media is calling Zelensky the antichrist, yet Russia has literally outlawed talking about Jesus Christ. Yes, really.
Wrong title. There is only one religious organization banned. After weapons, russian currency, russian propaganda, medals from russian government and so on were found in recent investigation. In one notable search one of priests was caught in the sex act with underage choirboy.
(Send that link to your "Christian" far-right Russian-supporting relatives and watch their heads explode).
There are accusations of correcting bombardment and hiding known terrorists and criminals also. Real snake pit, they have to be put on trial, not only banned.
