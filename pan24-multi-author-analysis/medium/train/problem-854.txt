I mean, hats off to the guy. As tempted as I was to make a few fake twitter accounts and raise hell, the prospect of legal exposure scared me away.
As long as the account was clearly labeled as parody and followed Twitter guidelines, I'm not sure they would have much of a case. They will probably just try to bury the person in slapp suits.
Yeah, it's the slapp suits I would be worried about. Maybe it's just so widespread right now that Twitter will be the sole target, but who really knows?
From a PR perspective I think that's the smarter thing to do at least. I mean, you can't deter every troll by filing slapp suits against one person unless you publicize it's happening. But admitting your corporation is filing basically frivolous lawsuits against an individual to crush them under legal costs is not a good look.
Filing against Twitter just makes the company look more risky to investors and can much more easily influence them to change rules about parody accounts. If they start censoring it, that would just make Musk look like an even bigger jackass too.
If your object is to quash any form of this kind of protest, they may go after the people who made the content as well.
I thought the dude pretending to by George W Bush saying I love killing Iraqi’s was great. Then he’s like the problem with the new verification system is that anyone can get it… is what I would say if I wasn’t the greatest president of all time.
I don't think anyone knows what anybody is going to do at this point. We're in some really weird waters.
