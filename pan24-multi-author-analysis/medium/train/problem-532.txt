I'm really sorry that happened to you. It is DEEPLY frustrating. I get really angry about it. I admit, I get VERY sarcastic when asked about it. "Yeah, my abuser didn't take any photos or videos of his acts, go figure And it's almost like he knew that raping a 6 year-old was wrong, because he did it in secret, and didn't even have the decency to invite any witnesses Like, wow, if he had just taken some photos, or written down his crimes it would have helped SO MUCH but jeez, he DIDN'T, it's almost like he knew he was committing a crime or something Weird He COULD have done it where everyone saw but he DIDN'T and wow, that just makes it my word against his I guess, and he says he DIDN'T do it, so I guess he goes free, huh?".
