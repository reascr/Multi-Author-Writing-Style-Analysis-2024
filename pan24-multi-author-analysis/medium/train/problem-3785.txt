I will share with you that when Mitch McConnell stopped President Obama from bringing forth his choice of Supreme court justice a major undermining of our democracy had happened. At that moment any agreed upon rules of behavior and checks and balances were tossed aside. This is what I felt. I thought we should be protesting out in the streets by the tens of thousands. Did we do anything? Did I do anything? The sad answer is no. That is the hard part knowing what to do. We live in a country where we will not be tossed out of windows or poisoned from jabs with an umbrella. How much harder it must be for Russian citizens then to find a voice. Like us they are fed disinformation. While you are not wrong finding the right strategy to remove someone like Putin who has the military , banking institutions, the backing of the oligarchy is tough. Blaming the regular russian citizen seems unfair in my opinion.
Russians are clearly afraid of Putin, since they would rather face a direct war, than to face Putin at home.
A sizeable chunk of Russians prefer holding onto some romanticized version of a glorious imperial past and for that they are willing to support a megalomaniac who led them into an unjust war, countless dead citizens and a destroyed economy.
