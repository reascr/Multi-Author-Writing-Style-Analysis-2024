My favourite Canadian Trump statistic: just before the 2020 US election, a major national magazine ran nationwide polling asking whether people would rather see Trump or Biden win. In our most conservative province, Alberta, often referred to as our version of Texas, Trump was twice as popular as in the rest of the country. Biden still beat him there by 68-32. Only a handful of states saw a margin like that on election day.
In the US we don’t do politics. It’s more like sports teams. You pick the team and color and then root for them no matter what they say or do. All that matters is your color wins. Fun right?
