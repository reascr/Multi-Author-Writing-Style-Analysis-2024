Mike "Interracial marriage should be left up to the states" Braun said he's likely to run for governor of Indiana rather than reelection to senate in 2024.
Governor is kind of a step down for a senator. A senator has a national platform, no one cares about the majority of governors outside of their state.
I've always felt like they're kinda lateral. A lot of political careers end at one or the other. Being a governor or a senator from a state like NJ is a bigger deal than like, wyoming though.
