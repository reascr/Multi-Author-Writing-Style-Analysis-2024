Nope. The EU as a whole has major tensions historical and current, and always will. That doesn't stop them working together when necessary but can be a little awkward. It's like an ex you've got serious history with - kids and shared property, say. Most of the time you're civil to each other, every so often it gets bitter and horrible for a while but you always manage to grit your teeth and get a working relationship going again because it'd just be disastrous if you didn't. Britain is currently sulking in the corner though sent some apology flowers to get everyone to help out their neighbour Ukraine. It's all fun and games until it turns vicious.
So long as I can order a vial of "research" chemicals from China I can order fentanyl. This is a problem with how the US makes it so easy to buy such chemicals and import them. If the government had any balls, they'd just restrict such imports entirely except to accredited institutions and licensed pharmacists. It'd shove it all into an underground black market, but it's already a grey market and it can start a discussion about decriminalizing possession and focusing on distribution instead.
I'm surprised more countries haven't gone the way the UK did and passed deeply flawed legislation against everything psychoactive (with exceptions for some preexisting stuff).
