With a new George Santos revelation seeming to drop every day, the congressman looks as if he’s trying to prevent at least one thing from leaking: his Spotify account.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The Daily Beast reached out to Santos multiple times this week asking if the account was his. Santos at first didn’t respond—and then denied having a Spotify at all.
Santos appears to have taken unusual countermeasures to conceal his Spotify—a seemingly innocuous piece of his digital footprint that would only disclose that he is a fan of Brazilian music, enjoys tunes by drag queens, and gives his playlists cringey names like “Vibes” and “Turn Up.”.
That wasn’t the only detail that made the connection between Santos and the account far more than a coincidence.
But within hours after the first contact through a voicemail on his cellphone, the account’s name was changed from “Mr. Dee”—a potential play off “Devolder,” one of his known surnames—to “ABC123.”.
