To people who didn't read the article, this is because Russia claims the mobilization has been completed meaning the Russians are no longer under threat (if their word is taken), so they must go back. Title slightly misleading because it implies mobilization hasn't ended yet, when the article says it has.
Edit: The Russian Defence Minister says the mobilisation is over, but Putin didn’t sign a decree to end it, so Putin can still ‘legally’ draft anyone at any time he wants.
And for everyone that didn't read the actual Dutch article, the asylum proces is postponed for 6 months in which noone will be deported but it signals Russians that seeking asylum for only a draft dodging reason is not enough. So all the people going crazy in this thread, read the article.
I feel like half the reason is because the general public doesn't trust Russian people, so if they "denounce Russia" and "prove their loyalty" would they be allowed in?
So I'm assuming if the Russian citizen can prove they're being directly targeted (kidnapping/rape/murder), the asylum will most likely be granted?
