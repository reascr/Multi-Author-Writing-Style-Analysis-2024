Yeah if there's anything to criticize china for, in my opinion, punishing billionaires like him is not a valid reason. Past administrations were very lenient on the tech sector and Xi's current trajectory is more of a correction.
As a person familiar with working conditions in his company. I LOL at this article. This article makes him sound like a hero haha.
He created a cult like work environment. Employees have to live a certain proximity to work. Alibaba would have mass wedding ceremonies. Work 6 days a week and be happy about it. He also worked his ass off, but it definitely looked culty.
He is well known to make his employees overwork, sleep in the office, etc. He famously said it is an honor to work overtime.
His Ant company is operating like a Bank without any Bank financial safety. With a very complex ownership structure. He asked the CCP to remove the borrowing collateral requirements for his company.
This would have no benefit, in fact it would greatly harm American interests. he’s putting ideology above pragmatism, it’s a huge problem in western society right now.
