They were already confirming his Judges though and there's not much else the Senate will be doing for the next two years with a Republican-controlled House.

The risk of a defection is real. Maybe Manchin or John Tester would do it. I wouldn’t put it past Sinema either. She could just defect and then retire in 2024. Based on the 2024 map, it’s unlikely Democrats can hold their seats in WV, MT, and OH. They will probably lose control then.
With split committees, the Rs could significantly slow the process. Now they can't, so they can push noms through much faster.
Also...we're talking 6 years here. And the map in 2024 is not great for Dems, so every seat is critical.
Oh, of course not. The House will be a shit show. But we also need to focus on the long game, and overall I'm still very glad to lock down this seat through 2028.
Big difference though is that committees won’t be evenly split. The judicial committee Republicans could slow the process considerably with tie votes. They can’t do that anymore. It matters a lot. Also, this gives Democrats a better Senate map in 2024, although they have a tough one regardless.
