That is not the case at all, inflation was high prior to Russias invasion. Regardless, inflation is high due mainly to two things. COVID caused supply chain issues, when supply drops but demand remains the same or rises, prices increase. On top of that COVID/lockdowns greatly changed consumer spending habits. People found themselves with more money than usual, partly due to stimulus checks and high unemployment payouts (both admins did this) and partly due to not having to pay for things like travel. Demand for many products increased as a result, thus increasing prices.
