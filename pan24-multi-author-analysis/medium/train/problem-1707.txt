You are confusing labor with capital. Capitalism is the evolution of feudalism in that it allows the rich to own the wealth that our labor produces without requiring that shareholders do any of the work themselves.
"It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor......Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration -Abe Lincoln , First Annual Message to the Senate and House of Representatives.
The bottom line is that when you retire, you start to cost society more than you contribute. And many countries now have ageing populations. And again, that’s not to speak ill of anyone who is retired or insist that increasing the retirement age is a good thing or the best course. It’s just a difficult situation. This is also why immigrants are very good for a country, they buff the working age population, and help alleviate these stresses.
Additionally, poor people are more likely to retire younger due to poorer health as they age. Which is the inverse of what you implied. To be clear, this isn’t their “fault”. And I hate the idea of making elderly individuals work for longer, especially in manual and industrial jobs. But I’m just trying to set the record so people can have a more informed discussion about the issue instead of brigading what looks on the surface like a simple social injustice.
However, this is a real problem that many developed nations are facing and it’s only going to get to worse. I know we like to shit on the government and “rich people” as if they’re doing this out of some sadistic intention. But that narrative is patently false. They’re doing it because they have very limited options and ideas on how to tackle a pretty insidious and worsening societal consequence of the excellence of modern healthcare.
