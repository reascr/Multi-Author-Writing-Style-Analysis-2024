My small business employer (a sign shop) declared himself an essential business and never shut down a day during Covid, teased those of us who believe Covid is real, got a big PPP loan, bragged about it, then promptly explained that we could take time off at our own expense (sick or vacation time), but we would not be paid for Covid leave. Then he opened a second business operating in the same location - and made us work for that business, too, for no compensation (because we were already being paid). Same dude is passionately against student loan forgiveness.
