The Republican voters fall into two categories: religious nuts who think our hardships are god's punishment for not killing gay people and agnostic bigots who are consumed by a nihilistic belief that nothing will be better so they just want to hurt and piss off the people they hate. The reason these two groups vote together is because they agree on hurting marginalized groups.

So Republican politicians offer nothing but grievance because that's what their voters want. Republican voters know their politicians are all on the take and corrupt as hell but they don't care as long as minorities are being hurt. Some of them believe that will make everything better and the rest want to hurt those they hate. Nothing else matters because there isn't anything else to them.
