Yeah that's fair enough, there's no chance Ukraine are getting F-35s at this point. Even if you could train the pilots, they wouldn't be able to handle the supply chain for maintenance.
A10s are a menace when you have air superiority. Ukraine will not have that. Every a10 sent would be shot down, they are not modern aircraft.
Would be nice to hear a few tanks get brrrrt'ed, but the a10 was obsolete 10 years ago. We were just using them on guerilla fighters.
Someone had the bright idea of making a gun based CAS plane and the best they could do as far as target acquisition was teaching pilots how to squint.
This is the main reason they've mostly been relegated as a missil and bomb platform these days, which most other planes can do better.
If you just need to carry a missil/bomb to a launch position and fire it, the A-10 can carry 7,300 kg and move at 740km/h while an F-16 can carry 7,500 kg and move at 2000 km/h.
Hell the F-111 Aardvark can carry 14'300 kg and fly at 2,655 km/h making it a better cas plane than an A-10.
But people had this rosy view of "Big gun go brr" that has been propagated by some people (cough cough reformers) that thinks the US spends too much on silly high tech stuff like radars or ejector seats.
Also speaking of that gun, fire test proved it could destroy an M47 patton "if it got lucky".. a tank that was obsolete in the fifties.
