I can see Late Stage Dark Brandon at one of these ground breaking ceremonies. Its late in his second term, he's fixing to ride off into the sunset and doesn't give a fuck, at all, about bi-partisanship, olive branches or any of that bullshit. He points at whatever GOP politician/lunatic is there and says" Look at this asshole right here, with his shit eating, media whoring grin. You know he voted against this project so he wouldn't be called a RINO by his brain dead, rambunctious, horse paste eating, snowflakes in MAGA clothing voters. But here he is, sucking up unearned credit, like the simpering, hypocritical dick head that he is. Lets give him a round of applause, because a Piece of Shit of that magnitude needs to be recognized." Then, he casually puts on his aviator sunglasses and digs the first shovel full of dirt, to thunderous applause and raucous laughter.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
