So SK sent a welcoming party, firing around 100 shots and ended up losing a plane themselves, without hitting anything? Doesn't sound too good :/.
It also indicates they were warning shots. Regardless, using kinetic ammunition against a small, agile aerial target is not easy. 100 shots is about 2 seconds worth of fire....if that. If they really needed to take these down, they would saturate the airspace with lead, or fire any form of ordinance with tracking.
Also, is the shots being fired a regular occurance vs the various provocations from NK? or is this something that doesn't happen? Were there shots fired the last time this happened in 2017?
Everyone is testing the waters right now. Many countries are under resource strain, public perception strain, and the world is focused on the situation with Russia and Ukraine. This is an opportunity for other bad actors to see what the response is to their behavior while the focus is turned elsewhere. Resource constraints specifically are likely to force countries to make resource grabs, or take this opportunity to shift their geopolitical influence.
Iâ€™m guessing this is part of a larger Chinese strategy to stress the American led geopolitical security system to the max. A war ir three on every continent and it is uncertain if America and its allied can hold it all together.
America has a 858 billion military budget set for 2023. I wouldn't be too worried about their absolute military supremacy. Isn't the first time either that America fought wars on multiple fronts.
