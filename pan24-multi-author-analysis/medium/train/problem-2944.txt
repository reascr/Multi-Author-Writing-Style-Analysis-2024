Probably the most polite the Russian pilots have been treated in years. "Excuse me sirs, we're your escorts. Please follow us and don't veer too far off, we don't want to turn you into moose juice. Have a great day!".
It's quite a bit different. I'm old enough to remember the 1995 / 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis. Without getting too deep in the woods, the United States sent an armada between Taiwan and China and China essentially went, "We're so far behind America we don't do a single god damn thing about it.".
What evidence do you have that China has caught up to American technology? China has been stealing the USA technology for decades and they still are just releasing military equipment the USA released decades ago.
About two decades later, China has caught up in technology, geopolitical clout, and military capability. Last Summer China didn't just go "Well, I guess we just have to sit here and take it because we are so hilariously outclassed." China conducted war games and even simulated a blockade of Taiwan.
But the bigger story is that there are coordinated efforts by authoritarian governments to challenge the rules based international order enforced by the American military. Chinese violations of Exclusive Economic Zones, intrusions by the PLA Navy into territorial waters, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, flouting of sanctions by the Chinese and Russians and others are all attempts to undermine that system.
