Basically, these children are being given to families in Russia as unpaid servants and manual labour to boost domestic support for the war and plug some element of the labour gap left behind by all the men who have been sent to the warfront. The Russians who receive these unpaid servants are quite happy to receive them and put them to work. So many people are playing the "sympathy for the devil" card and sating that every Russian except Putin is an unwilling participant in the war, but this is demonstrably untrue when people in Russia are so willing to accept stolen goods, free real estate, and literal child slave labour. This is a strong indicator of how out of whack the average Russian's moral compass truly is. There are Russian wives, girlfriends and mothers telling their men to "Rape lots of Ukranians," for God's sake.
More than that. It's another aspect of an ongoing genocide. Russia is trying to end Ukraine in totality, and abducting (and indoctrinating) children is a critical step in that process.
