I feel that your emotionally charged tirade dissuades us from the reality of the situation that there is a chance to correct the systems in place, but that it will take a long time and concentrated effort on our part. The fact that they are wanting to pull this stunt just like they did before, not including half the states in the Continental United States trying to do something similar currently, shows that they see there is a high possibility of those seats being filled by the liberal majority that is coming of age in this country and they are afraid. We just need to keep spreading this around and maintain a positive disposition and avoid expressions of hopelessness if we hope to make this country livable for us and our children.
I think our mistake is thinking that accusing them of being hypocrites will make them feel some sense of shame.
