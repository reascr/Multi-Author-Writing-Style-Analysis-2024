The comedy in this set of circumstances is unmistakable…Kanye West (Ye, lol) and Donald Trump, both running for president, have dinner with a white supremacist and a screaming match ensues. You cannot make this stuff up. Getting my popcorn….
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Nah, white supremacists always love making a big deal about having some 'good ones' in their ranks, so when they spew their hatred they can point out to their pets and say 'see? If all black people behaved like Ye we wouldn't need to send them to the camps, but they don't so they leave us no alternative'.
Trump also embraced white nationalism very loudly before this story even began, so I don't really see the point of acting like this is some smoking gun.
