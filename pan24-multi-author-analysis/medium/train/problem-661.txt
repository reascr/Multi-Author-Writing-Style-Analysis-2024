Hilary Clinton in 2011, while in Islamabad, while standing beside Pakistan's foreign minister said - "You can't breed snakes in your backyard and expect them to only bite your neighbors". When you look back now, that sentence makes so much sense.
The country has a good terrorist and bad terrorist policy. The terrorists, who Pakistan exports to Kashmir is a good terrorist. So, their fundamentalist groups got funded and weaponized. Now this is coming to bite them in the ass. The whole society is fed extremist propaganda from childhood. Ask a school child there and they will say Jews and Hindoos are the enemies. Hell, even Wikipedia got banned before a day or two.
I hope they see better days, but I can't think of a way they'd be a stable country in next 2 generations. Many \30yo Pakistanis on foreign soil I see have some extent of radical views on religion. Moderate Islam is not only discouraged but punished.
Reminds me of the viral video of that indoctrinated Pakistani kid who says when I grow up I will become an army and destroy India. Pakistani kids are taught to hate Indians, minorities and Israel from a young age, sadly that extremism comes home to roost and affects other civilian lives in Pakistan itself before it ever makes a mark on India or Israel.
The situation in Pakistan has all the makings of post WW 1 Germany. Wild inflation, minorities getting blamed and targeted - an Ahmadi shrine was targeted and demolished by ordinary people last week, hope this doesn't lead to yet another dictator rising up and taking power in Pakistan after the misdeeds of Generals Ayub, Yahya, Zia and Musharraf.
Pakistan has multiple provinces and Sindh is consider their main and gets majority of the fiscal budget allotted too. They got problems like this going in all their other provinces because of purposeful government neglect.
