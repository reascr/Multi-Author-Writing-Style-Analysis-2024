But regarding your point in the category of empirical evidence, I would say that people have been noting a tendency towards a grandiose and egocentric sense of self for a while now. Tony Attwood himself noted it in his (2007 being the latest print), date is important to the point and forgot to add it) book "Asperger's syndrome: A guide for parents and professionals" (this was before that syndrome got folded in to broader autism), though not a lot of reason is devoted towards why this occurs, if memory serves correctly (I haven't read the book in a while). I used my own personal experience to chart how the path looked for myself. Now, it is worth mentioning that book had a lot of problems with it, but I think that informs my next point.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
