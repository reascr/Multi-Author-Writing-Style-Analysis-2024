The next 4d chess move is to rename the CCP "Take down the CCP" and rename Xi "Take down Xi". That way it'll just appear like the protestors are chanting their names in support.
For people who are saying "oh protests happen all the time in China so this isn't a big deal", I cannot emphasis how unprecedented the current situation is.
Yes, there were small scale civil unrests and protests in China even before Zero-Covid, for all kinds of issues. But rarely do they get a lot of attention because.
2.	Whatever they are protesting for tend to be problems that only impact a relatively small group of people. For example a few thousand home buyers getting screwed in one city isn't that relatable to the rest of the country.
However major protests are happening in Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing right now, and all of them are protesting against a problem all 1.5 billion of Chinese citizens can deeply empathize with.
Those places almost never see civil disturbance in any large scale since they are wealthy cities filled with middle class Chinese people who are mostly satisfied with their lives. Just watch the Beijing video above and see how many Teslas and BMWs drive by the protesters honking.
But now people have reached their limit from Zero-Covid and emotions are high in all those usually pro-government places.
Then there is the foreign attention. Before Covid, you couldn't swing a cat in Shanghai or Beijing without hitting a foreigner. Even today there are still a ton of foreigners living/working in those cities, including many reporters. And most of them do them have methods that can bypass the Great Firewall.
A single protest in a major city like Shanghai would be more impactful than 100 of the small protests, let alone so many happening in so many major cities simultaneously.
What's happening in China right now is literally unprecedented. Even the 89 Tiananmen Massacre was limited to one area in one city.
