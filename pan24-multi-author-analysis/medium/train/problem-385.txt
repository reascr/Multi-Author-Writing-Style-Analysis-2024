If you never developed the critical thinking, analytical, and research skills demanded by quality higher education, you’re less equipped to recognize how idiotic and harmful the dreck put out by Hannity, Carlson, et al. is. And since Republicans tend to lack these abilities, the simpleminded black and white “thinking” of bigots is more digestible. This is all exacerbated and perpetuated by the GOP’s intentional and exploitative elevation of non-educated blue collar careers and simultaneous denigration of colleges and universities- particularly those offering “liBrUl aRtS” curricula. It’s 100% a culture war that the GOP is wanting to wage; they want angry, unthinking, resentful sheep who will scapegoat everyone else and hope for outdated, nationalistic policies that put whites before everyone else and make them feel more competitive in a narrow, simpleminded world.
Democrats are gaining with young voters (the future), educated voters (the future) while GOP gains with uneducated, whites who support white supremacy.
