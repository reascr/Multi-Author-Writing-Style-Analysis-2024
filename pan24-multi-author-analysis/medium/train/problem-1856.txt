It's also just putting pressure on other members (ie Germany) who are in NATO. It doesn't cost Poland anything to say it. It's great they're so staunch in their desire to support Ukraine, but not everything meets the eye with Poland. They have restarted historical grievances with Germany and have been battling the EU for at least a decade given their lurch to the right and introducing laws that weaken the walls between the judiciary and political branches there, to put the ruling party more firmly in control of the country. I'm not saying Poland is the same as Hungary in that regard, but there was a reason those two were supporting each other against the EU by vetoing this or that policy or regulation that would have an impact on their respective countries. All to say, I'm not seeing them throw this out there just because of them trying to be the force for good in Ukraine, even while acknowledging the huge cost and responsibility they've taken upon themselves hosting Ukrainian refugees and more since the invasion began.
