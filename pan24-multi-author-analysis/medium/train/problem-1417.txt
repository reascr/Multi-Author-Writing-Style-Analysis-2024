>McCarthy said it would be repealed as part of the must-pass $817 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, an annual bill setting policy for the Pentagon that is expected to pass the Senate and House of Representatives this month.
The only reason it is being considered is that McCarthy is threatening to hold up military funding if it isn't. And I can remember when every republican had a Support Our Troops! bumpersticker on their truck.
No shit, what kind of backwards idiocy is this? GOP threatening to defund the military to blackmail democrats? And they go for it? What a farce... why does anyone take this shitshow seriously? Aside from the fact that it has serious consequences to the lives of billions of people every day.
But under no circumstance should Biden or the democrats start allowing themselves to be bribed or blackmailed by the republicans. It will be a never-ending thing for the next 2 years if they do.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
He shouldn't consider these sort of games. If the republicans want to hold up funding the military, let them do it. Let them make an ass of themselves. It will be all over every news network.
Exactly, the region I live in is very highly dependent on military bases and their spending. I'm not sure there are enough paranoid anti-vax people left to justify the hit should the GOP screw up military pay for a while, since I assume Biden and the DoD (which supports the vaccines, of course) won't back down here.
