It's not misrepresenting the article. The title is summarizing it. It's not supposed to include the entire article. The point of a headline is to be short.
Yup. Imitation game is an excellent movie and for those of you in or visiting the UK, Bletchley park now has a lot about Alan. A true hero and father of modern computing.
Good. When the camps were liberated they took the people like me (LGBT - and German) and put them in prisons, thus prolonging their suffering. It's finally time to stand up to that. It's a very disgusting part of German history.
They were “liberated” from the concentration camps… only to be sent to prison, which, honestly, isn’t much different. After all, are prisons not places where we concentrate those that broke the law, even if that law makes no sense (like being unhoused or being “indecent”)?
Obviously the article is not trying to incite rage. It quotes several Jews approving of this. I think your comment is the rage bait. You're trying to incite rage against the author or the newspaper.
