Sounds relatable. The wappies I know personally are strong cases of and proudly portray themselves as "free thinking/not brainwashed by the system" with their whole "I do my own research" narrative. At first I considered them people who call themselves "woke", until I learned those people focus primarily on micro-aggressions, privileges and more politically left subjects instead of conspiracies. Very confusing sometimes.
We call them ''Wappies'' (crazy people) in the Netherlands. They think everything is a big conspiracy. Covid, WEF, The European Union, swapping the Gulden for the Euro, LGBT stuff, Immigration, downscaling of the Farmers industry.
Its exhausting to talk to these people... they never condemn Russia, they will say: BUT NaTO MaKeS bIg mONeY oVeR tHe wAr IN UKRAINE ITS NATO TO BLAME.
Even though I dont like these wappies, I dont trust the MIVD/AIVD either. The MIVD/AIVD will do anything to get more funding and power. They exploited the war on terror ( 9/11 ) to push laws that enabled them to harvest tons of data on Dutch civilians.
