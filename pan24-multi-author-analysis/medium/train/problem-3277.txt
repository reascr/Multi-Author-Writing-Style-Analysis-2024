Yep, the 3rd most powerful army, when it came to actual combat, has shown everyone that the glitzy tin soldier military parades in Red Square was all show pony propaganda. Now resorting to desperation, an incompetent mobilisation and an ill disciplined, poorly trained army only after 8 months of fighting a much smaller country and army.
This is what happens when a poor eastern European nation with help from daddy warbucks fights the king of slavshit in a soviet block city.
It's pretty obvious that Russia is hanging on by its fingernails. Just because they keep on delaying the inevitable by sending over more troops doesn't mean that they weren't about to lose the city without that backfilling.
Remember that the second battle of Fallujah took over a month and that was the USA's 2nd attempt at it. And the USA vs Iraq is way more imbalanced a conflict than Russia vs Ukraine.
It's all a ruse. Russia actually invaded Ukraine for its washing machines. Putin never wanted the land, just the washing machines, and this has been the plan the whole time. That's why he drove straight for urban centers--most washing machines. And while Ukrainian army was distracted by all the tanks and half empty BTRs, they took as many as they could get.
