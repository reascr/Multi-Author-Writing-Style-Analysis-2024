Edit: I'll clarify additionally. I've no issue with typing Türkiye; in fact, I'll copy paste it. I'm a little bit concerned about how it's pronounced, since I have no idea how ü is pronounced on it's own. I heard the pronunciation doesn't change, but then it's weird that it's still pronounced same as a turkey. What I'm more interested is the basis on which the decision was made at UN to accept the change. Was it ad hoc taking into account the specific situation, or are there regular guidelines as to which names can be used in official documents? The letter ü is not part of an English alphabet, as I have already pointed out. So why is it allowed? Is there a rule on which letters are allowed and how many of them or is it a case by case decision made by a specially appointed committee? Etc. This is a purely academic interest on my part regarding how it works.
Turkey undermined US sanctions against Iran. Since Erdo's SIL was personally involved, he tried to lobby Biden during the Ibama admin. Unsuccessful then, he got his way with the Trump admin.
