In very broad terms, this appears to be the political reality for the US (not to mention much of Western Europe). Trump is a symptom, not a cause. Losing the "working class" 40+ year old non college educated voters was a wakeup call for the Democrats.
One common theme of the current "nativist" era of modern society is the concern or outright loathing of immigration. Boris, Trump, Le Pen, Meloni, etc etc illustrate this seemingly broad trend.
