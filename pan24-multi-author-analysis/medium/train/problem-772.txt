McCarthy, in his bid for the Speakership, negotiated with these MAGA Republicans. And ran down to Mar-a-Lago to make a devils bargain. But there is no reasoning with politicians who want to burn the House down.
These politicians care more about clicks than unity and serving the American people. In this cult of personality, there is no path forward for the Republican Party.
In the end, itâ€™s embarrassing for McCarthy, who will most likely need to pack his bags and move out of the speakers office. It is also a sign of how Republicans will govern in the House.
