That's overly prescriptive. I don't doubt the findings you commented about, but we have no information to suggest this is the leading cause, only cause, or even a majority cause. Work like the study OP posted is important to help us understand what the real problem is. However I think we can both agree we should have started acting as soon as we understood it to be an issue, regardless of how big of a slice of the total pie it makes up.
It could count, but 40-50 years you could light a few different rivers in the US on fire, we burned leaded gasoline, there was lead paint and/or asbestos dust in our houses and workplaces, littering wasn't given a second thought, and factories belched out whatever they wanted without oversight. And on the topic of plastics, who knows what was in them back then that we've since learned are bad for you. "BPA-free" wasn't a thing until recently. The only upside is that I don't think plastic bottles got much use until the 80s, but TupperWare has been around since the 50s.
Diet, sedentary lifestyle, and plastics are imo top 3. Pollution I doubt because especially in the west it used to be incomprehensibly worse than it is now.
Stress is probably a big part of it. People in their 20s and 30s, prime family starting age, are more stressed out then ever. Climate change, one economic crash after another, working multiple gig jobs.
I'm in my 40s and my Gen-X friends are mostly fine but my Millennial friends in their 30s are all overworked basket cases. It's a weird divide.
