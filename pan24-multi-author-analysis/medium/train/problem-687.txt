(Just one anecdotal example...back in college, I helped a local progressive candidate beat a Democratic establishment candidate who was running for city council all the wrong reasons, and I did it just by showing up, knocking on a few doors, and telling my friends to go vote in the primary. The final margin was 2 votes. The progressive went on to secure better labor contracts for unions, then got elected to the state legislature and lead the fight to pass meaningful environmental legislation. It's been crazy watching all that play out, knowing me telling my college buddies to go vote in a random election literally made all the difference.).
