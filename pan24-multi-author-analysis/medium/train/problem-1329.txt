As a Michigander, I can tell y'all that the only reason the Democrats won BIG this midterm was because we passed a prop that has an independent body draw up the voting districts. This is the entire reason why for the first time in almost 40 years Michigan has a blue legislature.
We passed a similar prop in Utah but then the legislature ignored the maps drawn by the independent redistricting committee and just voted for their own maps anyways. That's what happens in a deep red state where there's a super majority in both houses.

Right. I recognize that but why wasn't it also the strategy in New York. Pllaying by rules that you that are only acknowledged by your own side is it fools game.
This was a Republican strategy. Same thing happened in Ohio and Florida where they rejected the proposed maps multiple times by Republican judges. Then they just let the clock run out and got to use those maps.
I posted that about 30 minutes in another thread. My guess is because if push comes to shove they know they have the supreme Court in their back pocket.
