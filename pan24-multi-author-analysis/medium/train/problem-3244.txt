Ignoring that the article says this isn't even gonna happen (which we knew anyway), I assume they would have kept Son regardless given that Jesu Christ was an actual human male.
You can argue until you're blue in the face about whether Jesus was the Son of God or the embodiment of the Holy Spirit or a reincarnated rubber duck or whatever you want, but there's little doubt among academics and historians that Jesus was in fact a real human male that existed at some point 2000 years ago and influenced a pretty large number of people.
There’s a lot more evidence for a historical Jesus than there is for a historical Socrates… I get your point, but if your standard for history is scientific observation… idk man, good luck.
But to your point: depends how you measure evidence. (These are rough numbers because it’s been a few years) There’s about 10-20 times as many surviving records of Jesus’s teachings than Socrates. There are about 5 times as many publishing disciples of jesus than of Socrates. The most important/favorite teachings of Jesus were found/recorded in the historical record much sooner after the death of jesus than in Socrates case (in fact, most historical records of jesus were never lost).
The easiest argument to make is this: Socrates never wrote a word down and most of the works involving him are written by Plato and Xenophon. Plato’s Socrates is clearly a literary figure used to say things Plato believed while deflecting blame. While I believe that Socrates taught most of what Plato records… I have no historical reason to. Jesus is a similar case, but his teachings were recorded and spread by hundreds of personal friends and at least 8 of his closest students.
I’m not trying to make some “case for Christ” but I might turn the question back to you: what is your standard for historical evidence…? Would you make the case that Socrates is better known by history than Jesus?
