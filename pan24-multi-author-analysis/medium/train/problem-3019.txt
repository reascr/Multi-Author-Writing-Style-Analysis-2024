My country(Romania)helped millions of refugees from Ukraine only for Zelensky to discriminate against half a million that are living in Ukraine.I know they have a war over there,but i lost respect to this guy.
Yes I don’t like the content because it’s manipulative and paints a false picture of what is actually happening, the so called “”authoritarian”” he signed is actually to help them integrate into the EU, you dumbass/troll got clickbaited.
It's a hyperpolitical war & he's banned the legality of any Political opposition to his rule. I didn't expect another European Hitler arch either, but here we are.
The true measure of a leader is not the powers they take, but when when they relinquish those powers.
As a romanian who whitnessed my country helped millions of refugees i have total disgust for this action.We have half a million of romanians in Ukraine that will suffer from this actions.
here is a detailed read from the most pro-ue anti russia newspaper from Romania.You can use google translate(if you still dont understand ill upgrade tommorow,im also a little bit busy right now with new year s eve party).
