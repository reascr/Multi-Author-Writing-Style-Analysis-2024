It was unanimous. This will hopefully keep Russia from getting the wrong message from comments by General Miley and others who suggested Ukraine should negotiate for peace now. It should also be a pretty good warning to Russia that war crimes tribunals are being earnestly proposed. Should Russia mess up and bring NATO into the war directly the outcome will lead to the prosecution of top Kremlin officials.
I mean you should always keep negotiating and diplomacy avenues available even if neither party is willing to participate in good faith. Also have a good idea what peace really means because you can say you want xyz but do you have the power to get it all or are you willing to negotiate the terms of defeat. Aka Ukraine can win all the land back but doesn't have the forces to make Moscow payfor the economic impact.
Moscow may not have a choice if the US and Europe agree that the frozen central bank funds of the Russian Federation (iirc $300billion) can be used for reparations to rebuild Ukraine.
This prepares for the EU parliament vote on the same question in two days, which in turn helps prepares for the US senate vote on the question. Terrorist designation will close some sanctions loopholes and trigger new sanctions, in addition to affecting public perception.
To add to u/foodishlove's comment it also has indirect economical effects where other states will be less likely to trade with Russia especially in the military industry sector.
