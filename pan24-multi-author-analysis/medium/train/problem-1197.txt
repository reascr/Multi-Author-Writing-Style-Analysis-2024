Try to do some research. Genes, discrimination and your biology in form of how well your bowels digest and absorb nutrients are way bigger factors than just calories.
I think I need a better understanding of what a "meal deal" is. I assumed they meant like a fast food 5 or something. But the article makes it seem like it's something else in Wales.
Quite often meal deals don't go with healthy options. The gas stations near my office I can get a juice atleast for the drink but the snack is always like crisps or chocolate bar (one of them has loose fruit but they aren't part of it) and I always have to get a sandwich.
It's a grouping of food items for lunch, usually one main meal item, side item (chocolate, cakes or crisps or whatever) and a drink. Bought together you get a total discount.
Stfu this is stupid. Let people be people and gfys. Calories are not the one and only thing leading to obesity.
I feel it's weird planning to ban meal deals because well reason is to get on the cheap so screws over people wanting that but often they just don't provide better options.
