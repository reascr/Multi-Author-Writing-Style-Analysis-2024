It is really tragic to see that the Russian population’s sufferings under a totalitarian regime gets denied by their descendants under the influence of another totalitarian.
Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal was a failed attempt, but collaterally killed an innocent woman, and severely injured a police officer (who inadvertently contaminated his home which his family have not since been able to return to).
But you're forgetting the Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. He took 3 weeks to die from radiation poisoning after drinking polonium in tea.
Doesn't look like, at least from what I saw in recently news articles in russian, related to him. No mentions of him leaving russia.
Let’s all hope he has left that totalitarian state. What country wouldn’t love to have a Nobel laureate in their universities and other institutions? Imagine what a great nation 1930s Nazi Free Germany would have been if their intellectuals had stayed.
I don’t really know much about Memorial, but I learnt about its existence in a Guardian article written by Timothy Snyder back in 2018.
