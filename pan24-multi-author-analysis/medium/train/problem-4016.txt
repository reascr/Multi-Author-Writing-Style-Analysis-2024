I think you're downplaying the impact. Manufacturing and supply chains are incredibly specialized and optimized. Any small changes throw them into convulsions. We're only just now fully recovering from Covid supply chain issues. The amount of time, money, and labor it would take to literally shift the work of millions of people, retrain them, relocate them, build trillions of dollars of new factories, build, ship, and install new manufacturing equipment, modify ports and shipping lanes, move trains and shipping containers, reprogram logistics algorithms, etc, etc, etc, would be like nothing we've ever seen. It's literally taken decades to get to where we are.
That's HBM2 memory, it's not for data centers or gaming. It's for machine learning and other computational applications. Universities and research labs will be the main buyers for these.
Single core power isn't just measured in Ghz, the IPC (instructions per clock) is a big factor. Its where a lot of performance increase has been gained the last 3-4 years. There are many other factors as well that have been pushing single core performance. A single core is probably closer to 12-13 ghz on the cpus from Crysis' era.
