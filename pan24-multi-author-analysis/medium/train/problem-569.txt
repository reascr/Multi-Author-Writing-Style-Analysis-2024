His shtick will work in traditional red states (including Ohio and Florida at this point, unfortunately), and possibly Georgia. But it won't work in Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin or Arizona -- swing states have shown a clear rejection of that kind of culture war strongman.
I think this culture warrior shtick he's playing is only going to get so far with a lot of people. Fighting wokeness doesn't help you pay your bills or save enough for a down payment on a house, for example.
