So I’ve always wondered, if we were to send it up Putin’s pooper, or anywhere on his body. What would be the political ramifications of that occurring long term.
Political assassinations, even in times of war, are pretty heavily frowned upon. The idea is that the political leadership should always be left alive so that they can negotiate a surrender or an end to hostilities.
Without that, you just have two armies smashing up against each other with nobody to tell them to stop.
russians are the ones performing atrocities en masse, i would think most of the world would just sigh in relief if the littledick in power of russia would go due to an organized and succesful attempt by the Ukrainians.
If Ukraine assassinated Putin, they'd find a lot of the foreign defence relationships that they've developed would cool quite a bit, particularly in Europe.
It might be worth it anyway, given the conduct of Russia and the undue level of suffering they're intentionally causing to Ukraine's civilians, and how it's unlikely that putin's successor would want to carry on a war that's already lost, but even so, a move like that would come with a longer term strategic consequence.
I find it weird that while Russia has apparently tried to assassinate Zelensky several times and have said in public they want Zelensky dead that it would frowned upon by the world if Ukraine would somehow manage to assassinate pootin instead.
In this case, i think the positives of such action would far outweigh the negatives... at least for a while till the next power hungry mafia boss would get to pose as a leader of russia.
