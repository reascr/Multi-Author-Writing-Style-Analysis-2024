3rd edit: I can tell that you're full of shit: I've watched your attached link...they're chanting "putin- huylo - lo lo lo lo lo," not, according to your "la la la." Which is a huge difference, that every russian and/or ukrainian will hear. Henceforth- you are, indeed, full of shit.
Putin leverages power using the oligarchs that act as mafia kingpins to keep himself afloat. They in turn benefit from his corrupt policies in a symbiotic relationship. Without his “kingpins” he doesn’t have control of the Russian population.
It’s all fun and games until you realize the conflict is dragging into its 2nd year and EU countries are still doing business with Russia: If the EU ceased all trade with Russia and jailed/ executed the oligarchs from his inner circle when they venture overseas, then the war would end within a month.
>A penis-headed statue of Vladimir Putin has been erected in a road named Bell End to commemorate him as “Bellend of the Year” in protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
