It's also worth noting that similar bugs were encountered for other countries. For instance, we see the United Arab Emirates was also missing in the first list.
Friendly reminder that Musk accepted $1.9 Billion in funding for Twitter from the Saudi Royal family. Prince Alwaleed is the second biggest shareholder.
Little different when it’s a publicly traded company. Not a whole lot anyone can do about saudis buying stock. When you bring them in as a business partner though….
Yea I get what they are saying lol that why I added directly or indirectly. His favorite mom and pop store might be selling him products backed indirectly by saudis lol.
Reddit instituted a new policy after his child got harassed by a stalker. If some nutjob like Nick Fuentes operated a similar twitter account focused on AOC or other women, reddit would go mental.
Jumping to the conclusion that this proves Elon want to hurt Ukraine (while still delivering starlink) is some QAnon level of delusion, if not worse.
Please note how the United Arab Emirates was also missing from the first list, so clearly other countries experienced a similar bug - possibly from a 3rd party service or as a temporary consequence of the massive organizational changes. The people who think this is a deliberate attempt to harm Ukrainians while Elon is still providing starlink are more deluded than the most fringe QAnons.
The journalists chose to violate the new anti-harassment rule, so they were banned. This is a good thing.
