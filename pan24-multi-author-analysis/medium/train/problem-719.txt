Ps. I’ll never understand why we change the noun such as a countries name. All counties imo should be called what they call it in their native tounge.
Just FYI the country is called “Ukraine” not “the Ukraine” in the official name of the country there is no “the” anywhere. While I’m sure this was not your intent “the Ukraine” refers to more of a geographic area and not a country and it’s frequently used by Russian sympathizers in order to imply that Ukraine is not a real sovereign country.
Well done, PM Fiala… this is the way it’s done when you want to apply pressure on Russia to stop its war against the Ukraine. You cut off the money supply, and that with sanctions will force Putin to the table and negotiate a peaceful resolution. no world leader can advance against another nation without having adequate steady, money supply.
Tell me one other country that has der, die or das in front? It’s no Der Deutchland. Same point applies. By putting the in front it’s playing into Russian propaganda from the 1920s. I know for the longest time people have said die Ukraine but it’s ok to adapt your understanding.
