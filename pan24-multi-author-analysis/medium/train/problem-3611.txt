My argument here is if Intel shows russia will seriously launch nukes everywhere if we get directly involved in any fashion. Basically tell them to respect our 1st strike doctrine at that point, since they already launched one in a war of aggression without cause, if Intel networks said russia will launch a their nukes world wide it would have to be done.
This warning from Putin's most powerful semi-ally should concentrate his mind if he was contemplating it. He would also lose India's support if he went ahead and be left only with fellow pariahs NK, Iran and Syria.
Xi is setting himself up to join in on the dogpiling Putin is going to receive if he launches one. Xi would love him some Siberia. And it's in their overall interests to keep global nuclear danger low, as they're focusing on modernizing and expanding their conventional anyway.
Building a bunch of extra nukes to protect in a nuke-happy world would just be a big extra pain in the ass for him, and he has enough on his plate at the moment.
