It started with us hiring a shit ton of part time seasonal employees before Thanksgiving and had them til March.
Then it slipped into hiring a few extra hands and being told we couldn't take vacation time or drop shifts.
I walked out one black Friday after taking one of the door buster 55" flat screens and checked my brother out with it, and handed in my walkie talkie and left.
Three fucking weeks later I went in to buy some socks and the bitch at HR saw me and said "you've been missing your shifts When are you coming back?". I just laughed and said never.
Dropped the minute I saw some shit you still had to pay for. The fuck am I paying a subscription for? Once folks realize its all shit this business will fail.
10k here, 5k there, 13k over there of actual employee's, then there are all the contractor layoffs that don't seem to be making as much noise.
I feel that give the scope and broad reach of recent tech layoffs, mortgage and finance related layoffs, many industries are shifting away from growth to maintenance and survival and well, shifting numbers on financial results because of these traditional moves by the executives and C-levels to meet business numbers and appease shareholders.
These numbers really seem to be starting to add up to a significant number of people who are likely going to tank or stall wages in the industry as they all seek new jobs.
Post a bunch of job postings with low pay/unrealistic requirements so they don't actually hire anyone.
