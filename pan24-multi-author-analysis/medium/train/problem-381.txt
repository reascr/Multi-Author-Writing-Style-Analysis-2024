That man has dead eyes. They're empty windows into a cold, desolate house devoid of warmth, and love, and empathy. I can't even sense hate in them, not the fiery type typical to tyrants, that provides some semblance of life. No, his is detached. Careless. Amoral. Good and evil mean nothing to men like Miller. They're arbitrary constraints to the pursuit of power over others, concepts reserved exclusively for 'little people' and 'weaklings.' If he even sees them as people at all, that is. Evil begins when you see people as things. And all this man has ever seen were things.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
