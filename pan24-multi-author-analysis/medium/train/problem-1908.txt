As the other poster wrote, there are types of lines you can build to reduce these losses which are already all over the western US. Eg, in the 80s they build the Intermountain Power Project, which is a big coal plant in the middle of the Utah desert that runs power lines to Los Angeles. I always wondered why they don't just cover the area with solar panels, since it's mostly desert scrub used for sheep and cattle grazing. However, after a quick wiki search, it looks like they are tearing down the coal plant and building a natural gas plant in its place that will (eventually) use solar to produce hydrogen for the plant to burn. That latter part could just be hogwash the company used to greenlight the natural gas plant, but they are building solar panels too, so hopefully that part will expand over time.
The wind turbines are easier to accept. The solar farms have the negative impact of taking up arable land and reducing food supply.
Iâ€™d be interested to hear more details about the planning for each of these. Land use (best alternatives), wind patterns, solar patterns, migratory bird patterns and so on. There are so many interesting factors around placing these things and they can have huge impacts on overall success or failure.
Yes but it's relatively little oil, compared to the energy that you get back. And as we decarbonise our grids that will take less and less oil.
