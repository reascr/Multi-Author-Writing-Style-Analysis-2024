The era when working class lads and lasses could just about manage whilst pursuing a career in music or acting is well and trully gone.
This day and age the talent pool has been reduced to mainly the scions of the wealthy and high-middle class were the Bank of Mommy & Daddy can pay the very expensive rent of a crummy place in any of the major cities whilst they try to "make it".
Don't expect the kind of boom in performing arts of the 70s and 80s when de facto the talent pool is 1/10 of what it was back then.
I think you're confusing overall GDP numbers produced using an inflation rate number that excludes housing with the actual real life experience of people who are too young to have bought their own place 20 years ago at a time when there are more and more working poor with almost no social safety net for them to fall back on.
For a young working class person who is now entering adulthood, Britain is way worse than back in the days when a single working class salary sufficed to feed and shelter a family of 5.
The "winners" of this era, boomers sitting on 3 decades of unearned "wealth" due to house price inflation, aren't the people that will fuel a flourishing of trendy new art.
And that due to the amplifying effects of Covid and Ukraine, the entire world is experiencing inflation and other ill economic effects.
