The modern Saudi monarchy has somewhat realized that being ultra strict both culturally and politically doesnt work so good in 2022. They have had a policy for a while now of giving up some cultural concessions, women driving being probably the most well known, in exchange for expanding their political power. Its an interesting play at least, also probably going to lead to a power struggle between the Royals and the Clergy.
Yeah but I suspect that this statement is made under the assumption that these women have a choice in whether or not they get impregnated.
I find this highly suspect. While infant and mother mortality would definitely increase, the probability is still low enough that on average youâ€™d see a large increase in birth rate (assuming women forgo education, begin having birth early, and continue to have birth through 20s).
Add onto this that fertility rates are much higher in less economically developed areas and I, personally, suspect that this and any further laws which oppress women will increase fertility rates.
