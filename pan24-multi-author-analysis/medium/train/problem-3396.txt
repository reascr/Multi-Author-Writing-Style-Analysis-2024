The problem with Putin's ministers is not that they're incompetent, but that he won't tolerate a minister that would dare to act on his own. So, even if the minister is capable of doing his job well and in good faith, he won't, if he wants to keep his job. Putin's ministers are cowards, even the most brilliant ones (like ), hanging on puppet strings. What those of them, not indiffirent to the state of the country, say to themselves, is something like: "If not me in this place, he'll find someone even worse".
His opinion was that if Russia wants to negotiate they know how to begin negotiations. Right now, Russia does not want to negotiate, they still want to win.
Probs because Ukraine will agree to nothing less than restoring its territorial integrity as well as join the EU and NATO. Giving russia concessions will only embolden them to attack again in the future.
Now they’re threatening Zelensky again. Russia is such a dishonest broker, I just wish the West would kick their ass. I realize the difficulty with escalation and I’m venting but I really wish we would kick Russia out of Ukraine.
