Rather than discussing and debating a platform that would state "this is what we are and how we want to govern" they opted to display complete contempt for their members and voters and basically say, right out loud, "nothing we say matters, vote for us because we're Republicans".
Honestly, itâ€™s a positive development for those supporting Republican rule too. 90% of them would benefit far more from liberal policies than conservative policies, and have been brainwashed to vote against their own self-interest.
The lack of self awareness from a guy who used him and protected him the entire way is just astounding.
