I doubt they’re thinking much at all. Some people just suck at putting things into context and, in this case, see “War=Bad” regardless of the circumstances; aggressor or defender, it doesn’t matter. The idea that letting Putin and other authoritarians run rough-shod through any country they want without hindrance could be dangerous to EVERYONE, themselves included, is too complicated and emotionally disheartening to them, so they go with the simplest answer they can find to save themselves the trouble. Either that or they’re paid shills/ actively wanting Russia to genocide Ukraine. But probably both….
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
