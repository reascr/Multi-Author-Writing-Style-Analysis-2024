Again you're just imposing your opinion on someone else's choice. It's none of your business what anyone spent on anything. You choose what to do with your money (whats important to you) and they'll decide what's important to them. You don't need to understand why they want it.
It's not just a religious book; it's historical. It's one of two known in existence and bridges the Dead Sea scrolls to the modern Bible. Doesn't that have meaning? Value?
Am not resenting people that have money. If anythingI am considered someone with “money” but i still find it to be an outrageous price for a book that doesn’t contribute (in my opinion) anything to society but the status quo.
It saddens me to think something like this might end up in the private collection of some one person, instead of being in a museum or synagogue. Additionally, it saddens me to see this fellow handling it without gloves.
I bet they spent so much on this religion book because it's important to them, the ones who spent the money.
Oh you just wanted to say what you'd do with the money if in theory it was yours to spend how you'd like, and wanted to say that they don't contribute to society but you do that. Catching a Karen vibe.
