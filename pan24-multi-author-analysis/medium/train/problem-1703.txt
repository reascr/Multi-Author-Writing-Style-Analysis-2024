Why should the current administration be blamed for deregulatory measures enacted by their predecessor? More importantly, what does the rail stike have to do with this at all seeing as how additional regulations re: safety were never part of the negotiations in the first place?
I wouldn’t argue with this idiot he’s literally pulling a what about BiDeN bullshit line these people use instead of focusing on this issue of deregulation by the people who are causing these problems. Regulate private business. This isn’t difficult.

This was always my belief. Biden doesn't even have to fix anything Trump did. Why on earth would they roll all of it back anyway if it's going to benefit them all so much?
Corporate America doesn't lose anything, and the citizens finally get someone who isn't trump. Win, win.
