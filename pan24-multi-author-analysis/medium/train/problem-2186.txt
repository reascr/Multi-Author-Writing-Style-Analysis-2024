Iâ€™m curious if he could even get majority votes for the speaker position, considering the house will be much closer to 50/50 than originally anticipated.
Allegiances are also bound to change, as people distance themselves from the orange spray tan man and his antics.
Even if the GOP gets the majority in the house, it'll be so razor thin that they won't have that definitive political mandate they would expect with a Democrat in the White House.
Not yet but once they get their messaging straight and their marching orders it will be a different story. They are always in disarray after a setback.

They're not. The fact that a majority (Dem or GOP) is this tight doesn't leave any room to maneuver...especially with the reality that the Senate may stay in Dem control. One would think that a slight Dem majority, post-midterms, in the House would mean the status quo like from 2021-now, however the electoral map would loom large in their plans, especially with the upcoming presidential elections sucking all the oxygen out of the room.
