I know what jokes you are talking about, and yes, these are probably quite inappropriate by now. But one thing foreigners in Germany always misunderstand is exactly this: German humour means to shit on everyone, Germans included, all the time. It's a basic value of a free society to most people here. Sure, some may use this to their advantage to spout their racist bullshit, but usually people who make those jokes are far from racist, it's simply what they understand humour to be. In fact, I'm fairly certain there's more 2nd generation immigrant comedians making jokes about their own culture by now than Germans and I don't think they're doing that as a coping mechanism, but rather because they are genuinely appalled by certain behaviors people of their own culture display. See Kaya Yanar, BÃ¼lent Ceylan, Tedros Teclebhran and there's no end to how many of them there are.
Didn't Poland have an election recently? It feels like just yesterday that asshole brigade barely won an election and started dismantling the Rule of Law in Poland.
