The potential upside to Boebert and Marj staying in the House is it reminds voters that MAGA is still very much a part of the GOP.
On the district level MAGA still has appeal in certain areas but nationally it’s disastrous for the Republican Party.
McCarthy or whoever becomes the next house majority leader will have to spend so much attention to prevent MAGA from fracturing the party going into 2024. Hopefully to no avail.
That’s like saying the upside to having a little bit of cancer is that it will remind you that you really don’t want cancer.
I think they secretly like the MAGA nutters because side by side, they make them look really ‘good’ in comparison.
I understand the sentiment but I’m not sure that’s the right analogy. It’s not like half our bodies want to get cancer.
They’re a double edged sword for sure, but there’s a good chance it cuts the GOP deeper than the Dems. You got Trump tearing into their 2024 candidate right now, so all their officials are going to start taking sides.
