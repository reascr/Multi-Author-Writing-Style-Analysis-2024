Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:
It's visual shorthand. Regardless of whether or not people actively use them in schools, they are ubiquitously tied to people's idea of what a school is.
Cartoon meant as a political message, the political message is tied to hate on teachers currently and the right lying about what they're teaching and their professionalism.
The audience for political cartoons is largely people who attended school when blackboards were still common, and so it's relatable to those readers even if it's a little anachronistic. It fits those people's mental image of what a normal classroom looks like. I'm not that old and we used blackboards. There are probably schools that still have blackboards.
1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.
This is great. Unfortunate that they didn't consult a teacher to make the board realistic though. Kind of plays into the stereotype of them being easily replaceable and not Professionals.
