SpaceX's next project Starship of course has a reusable first AND second stage so is 100% reusable. But of course the feasibility of this is as yet unproven.
says who ? And for deep space flight ? You sure about that ? Because last time i checked reusability dosnt make economic or Engineering sense if you want to go past Earths orbit because your first stage needs to be absolutly massiv to come back from those Velocities and angles.
For Blue Origin, South Korea, China, India their primary next rocket projects are all reusable. Even Europe's Arianespace has a reusable rocket project called 'SUSIE'.
Reusability does, of course, require larger rockets. But the cost of fuel is such a miniscule part of the cost of launching that it still makes economic sense.
For deep space, there is-orbit refueling. The contract NASA awarded to SpaceX for the lunar lander, actually required use of in-orbit refueling.
All musks starships are good for is local flight to the moon and back way too big to go to mars and back.
But the engine developed by the british which can take a boeing size aeroplane to space and back and possibly to the moon and back like a normal aeroplane does now is way beyond what spacex has right now or will ever have.
Develop the british rocket that can take an aeroplane to space and back in one go, with a payload much higher than spacex eventually. No landing of boosters just take of go to the moon and fly back and land on earth.
Hopefully spacex succeeds in their goals with starship if not then they can fall back on there falcon rockets.
But imagine a vehicle the size of a cargo plane being able to take of on a runway go to space and come back to land refuel and take off again like aeroplanes do now.
