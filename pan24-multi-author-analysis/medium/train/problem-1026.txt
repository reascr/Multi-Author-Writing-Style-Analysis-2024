Blue ID card means Israeli perminent resident and permission to go anywhere in Israel. It is very common practice (though not actually back up in law) that in low security checkpoints (like army checkpoints within the west bank) that most security personnel will let you by without a check if you flash a blue ID card as opposed to the Palestinian green ID card. It means they can work and live in Israel like any Israeli and generally really have equal rights (the right to vote requires citizenship, not just permanent residence, so a blue ID doesn't necessarily mean that they get to vote).
The Palestinian Authority administrates area A and B, while Israel manages COGAT, and also prevents the area from turning into yet another jihad terrorist shithole (like Gaza).
Al-aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the military branch of Fatah, praised the attack. Reminder that Fatah is the political party of Mahmood Abbas and the main party at the Palestinian Authority. This is why these people will never have a state.
