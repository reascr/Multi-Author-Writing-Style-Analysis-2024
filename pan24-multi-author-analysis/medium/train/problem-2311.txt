That means Democrats lost about 8 million votes while Republicans lost only about 1.5, a difference of 6.5 million votes due to voter apathy/disenfranchisement. Beto lost by about 1.2 million votes.
Those two things alone show how much oversized voting power rural counties have. It works out to 15% of the population living in 75% of the area.
In terms of local government, yes, and it will stay that way for as long as the GOP can gerrymander it to their favor. In statewide elections though, the day is coming when Texas becomes purple, then blue. Same thing happened in California in the 80s and really took hold in the 90s.
Whether they’re urban or rural, they each have one vote. The point in Texas is that educated white collar workers are moving from other (usually Democratic) states to work in finance & tech. On the other hand, much of Texas’ rural population is old and dying out. I honestly think Texas will be purple in 8-10 years.
