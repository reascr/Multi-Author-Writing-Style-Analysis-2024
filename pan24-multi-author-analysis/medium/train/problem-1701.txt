Having seen virtual markets in many MMOs, real people trying to flip things quickly for a buck are inconsistent with pricing. With the supposed ticket limits imposed on buyers, there should be hundreds of resellers setting their own prices in a scatter shot process, then refining downward in a competitive slide downward toward the original face value as the concert date gets closer. Instead, nearly instant relisting occurs at a very tight, constant price range of nearly 5-10 times the face price. The "anti bot" is all on the front end to prevent outsiders from getting in on the action and competing. When no one can scrape for price information, it's really hard to compile hard data on gouging.
Ticketmaster creates problems for everyone, then creates solutions that create additional problems for everyone that cost everyone additional money and time. Ticketmaster is protecting you from scalpers! But no. And there is no alternative. Everyone is at Tickmaster's mercy. Smells like racketeering.
