🔥 The Armed Forces struck a building with 500 occupiers in the Kherson region, 2 trucks with the dead were taken from there, - General Staff 🇺🇦 Ukraine.
56 seriously injured people were taken to the nearest hospital, of which 16 more people died soon after.
So you've been stuck poorly supplied for weeks, knowing you were going to retreat for over a week then a mad rush accross the river while being shelled. Your morale is likely already at rock bottom... then this happens... I'm sure the survivers will be thrilled to go back into combat!
Its not even hard to spin! A pro Russian grandma could still be overjoyed to see her "misguided" grandson is alive....
But no, must be faked because nobody in Ukraine could have a nicer house than in Russia and the soldier is a genetic supersoldier with a neck made out of black fleece despite his white hands...
You'd imagine if there were that many in one location it will be those who retreated from the right bank thst haven't been redistributed yet.
Barely matters. AWACS are mostly about air superiority combat, which is not terribly relevant to this conflict, especially in that part of the country.
No, and Ukraine is hesistant/unwilling to hit targets over belarus anyways because doing so might give luka the means to join the war, his people would rebel otherwise but potentially if Ukraine hit targets in Belarus he could make decent enough propaganda to justify it and not face open rebellion.
Mobilised deserters in Luhansk Oblast assaulted a 12-year-old girl, and in Donetsk, the same happened to a woman. This is evidenced by two intercepted calls published by the SBU. Callers complain they are not allowed to town because of this.
- Until they accept their fault, until they accept they are the occupiers on our land, until they stop killing our people - there's nothing to talk about.
Looks like the Russians didn't like at all the performance of the mobiks in the Moscow region who were threatening their officer. Many released condemnations, some even suggested to shoot the main guy Sasha for disobedience.
🇷🇺 SS "Wagner" mercenaries published an execution of a comrade named Yevgeny Nuzhin after he returned from a prisoner exchange. They accused him of treason bc he gave an interview to.
Rybar also likes to make up fake Ukrainian offensives, so they can then say they were crushed. It's a way of generating fake wins for the Russian side to feel satisfied with the war and feel like they have some form of success.
The Russians have most of their vehicles as “amphibious” but realistically they are not maintained enough to do so regularly. Yes the US does have amphibious assault craft and armed vehicles like the marines AAVP-7a1.
Do we really have better facilities than anywhere closer? / in such scale that it makes sense for other nations to train here too?
