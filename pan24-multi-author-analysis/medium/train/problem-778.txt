From what I know, one of the main reasons China banned Facebook, Google etc.. was because they didn't want Chinese citizen data held and controlled by a foreign power, and also terrorists on Facebook yada yada.
On this issue, it seems like a bit of an overreaction, it is only US officials that are being banned from having TikTok on their phones. TBH, I would rather that officials didn't have it, they might actually pay attention to their jobs then.
This attitude came much more recently, about a decade after these platforms were banned. They were still fine with Amazon and others holding Chinese user data until the end of the 2010s.
Google and Facebook were more likely pulled because both gave Chinese people access to see things China wanted censored, and both platforms reversed their initial agreement to blocking or filtering such info.
But also because Chinaâ€™s homegrown alternatives (Baidu and Renren) were growing at that point, and China wanted less competition for those.
Thats not entirely true, the main reason social media Google etc is banned is because the CCP can't censor information about Chinese government actions from its people, meaning it's much harder to propagate the 'everything is fine, the government loves you, just don't look out the window' rhetoric.
