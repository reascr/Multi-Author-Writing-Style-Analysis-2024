I don't know man, it kinda looks like the diet of our descendants may be looking pretty vegan. At least until economical lab meat and milk becomes a thing.
Lab milk is already pretty close. is available in grocery stores (at least on the East Coast US) and is made from milk proteins created through fermentation. I bought some recently and it's pretty dang close.
Yeah, but they have to add milk fat which is the expensive part. They can synthesize whey which is a big deal but the real target is the fats and that's still out of reach.
You will know when milk fat synthesis is a done deal because cheese prices will collapse. If you look at the price of cheese you can see that this has not happened.
Yeah, that's true, but what we eat is distinctly measurable and quantifiable. Even if something is made in a lab, if it's still just carbs, protein, and fats it's not too bad, right?
That being said, all powerful technologies can be abused by nefarious people. See Machine Learning, Rocketry, Printing Press, etc.
The crustaceans or arthropods in the ocean such as crabs and lobsters could easily eat all the animals on the land. They are the largest animal group on the planet in terms of biomass.
All of the multi-cellular animals in the world taken together are 1/27th of the mass of the bacteria.
All of the multi-cellular animals in the world taken together are less than 1/4th the mass of the fungal life.
There are less human beings than there are farm animals and the farm animals represent approximately the same biomass as the mollusks which includes sea snails, squid and octopus. They are more abundant than cows and pigs.
