We definitely do. Enough have been caught over the years that there must be more. Probably a very desirable posting for intelligence personnel from those countries.
If a kremlin plant views living in the US as desirable, it means they have some greed, vs pure ideology as their motivation. This would make that person more readily convertable to a double agent - after all, the amount of money and better life being offered by the US would be magnitudes greater. Esp. if the family can also move.
Aus. and The US (and others) share intel all the time, we are part of the Five Eyes Alliance, NSA/CIA/FBI are hooked into our communications just like their homeland, etc.
Of course, the kremlin knows this, therefore, it's highly likely that the kremlin plants that make it to the whitehouse are more likely to be ideologically driven than greed driven.
If there are Russian operatives in the Democratic Party, at least they’re still concerned about keeping it a secret.
Agreed… France Germany Hungary… Russia had been busy spreading their authoritarian agenda against democracy. I honestly don’t understand why people think they would be better off.
