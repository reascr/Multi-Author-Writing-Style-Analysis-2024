Are you insinuating that being attracted to trans people is perverse? I doubt it, but nonetheless your sentence frames it that way. But to your point, I think you're unhelpfully discounting what is actually a fairly important pattern in culture; closeted/unfulfilled people seeking access to the objects of their desires by indirect methods, because they don't feel like they can use direct methods. This often times manifests as becoming prominent social figures which allows them to compensate for their otherwise undesirable or dysfunctional personalities in order to get the things they want. Sexually abusive priests for instance. Do you honestly think it so unfathomable, that corrupt republicans would take advantage of their strangleholds in their territory to satiate sexual needs, regardless of the moral or legal aspects? This exact thing has happened many many times in this country already. And many times has a closeted Republican who is an outspoken bigot been outed in the midst of sexual deviancy.
