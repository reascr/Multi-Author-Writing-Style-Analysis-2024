I assume this is simply something McCarthy was forced to concede in the three-page secret document that allowed him to become Speaker. Some racist demanded this concession and McCarthy didnâ€™t oppose it.
Sure, he stepped down.. but the fact that a known lying Freshman Republican got a spot over others just shows they have absolutely nobody of good character or integrity elected to the House this cycle.
GOP are still taking victory laps for kicking Liz out of the House and replacing with a lunatic/loyal foot soldier.. something tells me Gaetz is super safe, and Santos leaves only if his district or NY GOP force him out.
At some point, the three pages of concessions will be exhausted, and then McCarthyâ€™s usefulness will cease to exist.
EDIT: McCarthy had to make additional concessions recently to get enough Republican voters to pass this. ðŸ˜‚.
