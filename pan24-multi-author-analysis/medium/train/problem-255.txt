The most interesting, yet unsurprising, part of this ruling is that although the product is not considered "meat", Orthodox Jews will still not eat it with dairy products (Orthodox Jews do not mix meat and dairy products). .
Well yes, but actually no. that's basically the point of what the Rabbi said (I've read it a few hours ago in Hebrew so I don't know what exactly was written in this article and what not).
For every example of Orthodox Jews being permissive due to a "loophole", there are ten examples of going above and beyond to impose extraneous restrictions. This is one of them.
And secondly - things can change with time. For example, 500 years ago if you wanted to drink or cook with almond-based replacement for milk (and yeah - I didn't know they had those but I literally read it from the Shulchan Aruch - which was written in Safed in the 16th century...), Anyway you had to put almonds with the milk or with the stew or whatever it is - so people would understand that it's not real milk.
He said that because of "Mar'it Ayin", it will be Parve in his idea if they'll market it as non-meat or meat-replacement.
But if they'll decide to market it as meat, which could very well happen because it's their agenda to make money by selling "real meat without the cruelty of killing an animal", thus making it not-Parve.
Though two things to mind here - first, while he's one of the main rabbis - he's certainly not alone, and this is still debated among many Rabbis.
It wasnâ€™t a complicated ruling, was it? The Torah is very clear about food cultivated from stem cells using 21st century synthetic biology.
The Torah has a written and an oral part. While one would be hard-pressed to find a ruling concerning synthetic meat in 2000 year old texts, fortunately, the oral part of the Torah has kept up to modern times.
