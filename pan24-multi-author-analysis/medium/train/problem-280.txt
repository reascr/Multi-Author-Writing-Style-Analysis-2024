Not to mention all the cherry picking he does in this video, like when talking about GDP figures and comparing for example Ivory Coast which was a commodity based economy (cocoa, whose prices crashed in the 1980s) and also in the midst of a brutal years-long civil war while neighboring Ghana experienced relative peace and stability. These types of facts matter when covering geo-political subjects. Or the fancy graphics showing the flow of money going from the CFA countries to France and completely lacking any kind of source info. Maybe he should have included actual import/export statistics and realize that the big majority of CFA nations commerce is with the US/Canada/China. Or which mining companies actually most benefit from the natural resources there (hint, they're not French). Anyhow.. this video reeked of clickbait and anti-French propaganda. I'll keep watching his videos for entertainment purposes but a good reminder to be keenly aware of his bias.
This strikes me as a similar move to England’s 1950’s Royal World Tour that the at-the-time Princess Elizabeth was embarking on. Imperial influence waning, time to do a show and tell with the locals. Pretty tone deaf.
