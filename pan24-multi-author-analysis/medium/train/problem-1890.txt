So, this is a very skewed look at things. You have one country who invaded that cannabilized their military and funneled all of the money to oligarchs, and the other that is 100% reliant on US weapons from the 80s.
Its not the grenades you worry about, its the artillery fire that follows. Best thing is with a drone you don't risk a spotter and you are able to lock in your target quicker.
I think youre thinking of the big felllas. Have you not seen the videos? They're literally DJI mavics with payload release mechanisms connected to the aux light channel dropping grenades.
Less consideration than a WW1 soldier. At least they actually tried to give the troops adequate support back then. Nowadays they can’t even do a damn rolling barrage.

People on reddit think war is like a video where you don't have to worry about supply lines, you can quickly rebuild any machines, and you don't have to worry about troop moral or downtime.
