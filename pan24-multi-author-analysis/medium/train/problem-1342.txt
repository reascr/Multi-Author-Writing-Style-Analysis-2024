Almost certainly the original plan was a weekend war. Steamroll Kyiv in 4 or 5 days, remove the "Nazis" and put some pro-Russian puppets in power, wait a month or two, have them run a "totally fair and in no way rigged" referendum about allowing the country to be annexed by great and glorious mother Russia, then absorb the country, and all the income generated by it's oilfields, farmland, and Black Sea ports. Basically the same playbook the used in Crimea and South Ossetia in Georgia over the last decade writ large.
While you're not wrong, the problem in a situation like this is that if a group of soldiers surrenders there's a very good chance that anyone else who saw it happen will follow suit. Equally true if you're in battle or as here with a group of soldiers just bolting from their positions outside of combat. Then while you're costing the enemy resources to take care of those surrendered troops, you've also lost pretty much an entire combat unit. And there's the risk that if other units of questionable morale hear about it they might follow suit, and then you don't have an army to fight your war any more.
Even in this they are stupid as hell, one soldier captured requires much more attention that one deceased, not only committing war crimes, but also saving resources to UA... dumbasses.
