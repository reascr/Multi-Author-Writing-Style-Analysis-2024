It's super fucked that they're explicitly targeting books that merely portray the lives of minorities and communities removed from their own. I'd say that, as someone who's planning on being a parent in a few years, I'd have my kids read some of these books on their own, outside of school, the problem is that there are some in these groups reaching the extreme to where they want to call it child abuse to expose kids to books and events they're actively against.
I'd love to see them explain Judges 19 to the end of the book, where God is directly involved, and instead of stopping the clusterfuck, pushes it into genocide territory. Also, there's the whole chopping up your dead concubine and fedexing her body parts around the country to stoke rage that she got raped to death, in your place.
Goes back to the black panthers in the sixties. Can’t be having black people waking around all armed, that’s dangerous but white men doing it is perfectly fine.
The last one is the nearly same as the story of Sodom and Gomorrah: Take the women of my house and rape them if you wish, but do not touch my houseguests!
The wife being turned into a pillar of salt was a big step up from being locked outside to be raped to death, shouted at for being dead, flung across a donkey, then being chopped up.
