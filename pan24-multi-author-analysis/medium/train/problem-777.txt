You only have two choices, any third option is a trick to get you to split your vote and elect the person you hate the most. Until we get tiered voting options, this is our system and we have to play by its rules or we're just hurting ourselves.
Dems not only need high voter turnout, they need their voters to not do split ticket voting in swing states.. if you are a Dem voter, this would be the worst possible time to do something like voting for Shapiro and Oz, or voting for Warnock and Kemp, or Kelly and Lake (sadly polls show many are leaning to vote that way).
The sooner everyone realizes that the system is rigged against third parties, the better. In America, you aren't voting for who you like the most, you're voting for who you dislike the least.
Yes and no. Primaries are the time you vote for who you like the most. The actual election is when you have to look at the bigger picture.
