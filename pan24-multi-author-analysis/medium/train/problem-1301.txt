On a long term yes, but Russia benefit from not giving a fuck about their own citizen's quality of life, while also being able to convince them of doing the sacrifice with their efficient propaganda.
They are also self sufficient for foods, and still have access to most of the market for raw material. It's unlikely Russia will go bankrupt in the near future, or at least, not in the sense that it would crash the regime.
We have seen in the examples of Cambodia, Mynanmar, and North Korea that a dictatorship can survive even when it forces its citizens to eat grass. Russia seems on a path to reach that point.
Sure, the pendulum has swung back to dictatorship. But when shit goes down in Russia, it goes down hard.
Fun fact: the 1917 revolution that dethroned the Tsar was started , on what was the the newly established International Women's Day.
Russia also has a history of the most violent and successful anarchists, Tsar-killlers, and revolutionaries.
Putin knows his history and is very attuned to historical precedent. In that respect it's worth noting that the Great Northern War, between Russia under Peter The Great and the Swedish Empire under Charles XII, ran from 1702 to 1721. Nineteen years.
