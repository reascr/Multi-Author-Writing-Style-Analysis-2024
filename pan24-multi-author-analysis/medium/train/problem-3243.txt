It's all just hollow gestures and publicity stunts at this point. The time to protest would have been when Qatar was awarded the World Cup.
Or when news first broke about the appalling work conditions and worker deaths building the stadiums. Or when Qatar started to back peddle on promises they made (it would be in the summer, they would allow beer sales, etc.).
Those were the times for FAs, national teams AND fans to stand up and make a difference. And nobody did.
You're missing what's happening. We value inclusiveness. Not FIFA. Did you forget Sepp Blatter? He's just the tip of the iceberg, and nothing changed with his replacement. FIFA is arguably the most corrupt sporting body in the world, corruption that transcends ordinary graft and crosses into major political corruption with many world elites in on it one way or another.
The politically corrupt elites (who are literally the opposite of Progressives) simply learned they can rainbowwash anything by saying the right words, and that the Progressives will eat it hook, line, and sinker. Even when called out, they stick to the script. Accuse them of supporting modern-day slavery, and they'll just turn the argument on its head and accuse the West of historic colonialism, which somehow absolves Qatar of what they're doing today. Whataboutism cranked to 11.
