It's so weird that mail in voting is available for the entire state but its usage always leans blue. I fucking love voting on my own time in front of a computer so I can read about who I'm voting for. Why are Republicans afraid of this?
Lol reporting is such shit. There are 400k mail in votes for Maricopa county still to be counted. They are going to be immensely blue.
Same with Nevada. There are almost 160k ballots still to come from both mail and drop boxes. They are likely going to go to dems by at least 2-1. CCM, who is a fucking garbage candidate btw, is going to win there too.
