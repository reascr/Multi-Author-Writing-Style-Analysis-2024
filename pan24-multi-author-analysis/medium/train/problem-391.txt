I had a professor in college that had a tendency to mention child porn. The second time I had class with him, I turned the person next to me and said "$5 says this guy mentions child porn on the first day of class". The person looked confused, but the inevitably understood when the guy actually started talking about it. He would also randomly bring up supposed practices in other countries that were adjacent to pedophilia. Like he loved talking about how in like Papua New Guinea or something there was a tradition where a young boy becomes a man by having essentially blowing the village elder. I never looked it up but he had multiple examples like this and I just assumed they were all nonsense. Supposedly he used to work for the NSA helping find people distributing child porn or something, but just about everything this guy said as well as most of his claimed qualifications and experience turned out to be mostly lies. He was a straight crazy person, his email signatures had a list of random acronyms after his name that were supposedly qualifications, and they changed all the time. He also seemed to have very little knowledge on the classes he actually taught as well, it was rather crazy.
So there is evidence she groomed and had sex with them, but the GOP protected her by essentially saying "she only had sex with them a little, so you shouldn't punish. Instead, let her run for office again.".
