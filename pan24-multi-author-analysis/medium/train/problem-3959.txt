Ukraine can expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from Western countries soon, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Sunday.
Kyiv has long pushed for heavier weaponry but Western nations have been fearful of becoming drawn into the war or provoking Russia.
"The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important - and I expect more in the near future," said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday.
These past 2 days were just horrible, as they usually are after a new missile strike happens. Here in Kharkiv the situation is stable right now. Yesterday we lost electricity around 3:40pm, but it was restored pretty fast, some places already had it back up after a couple of hours, for us specifically it took until 11pm, which is still very fast. By this morning the electricity was already restored everywhere in Kharkiv oblast, but there is still a big energy generation deficit in the system because Russians managed to hit 2 of our thermal power plants, so some cities will have longer blackouts for some time until those are fixed/rerouted.
While the electricity problems do suck, the missile strikes on civilians yesterday are much worse, and they hurt much more than sitting without electricity for a couple of hours. Itâ€™s not something that would ever break our spirit or make us surrender, but seeing innocent civilians killed by the fucking Russian terrorists is just enraging.
