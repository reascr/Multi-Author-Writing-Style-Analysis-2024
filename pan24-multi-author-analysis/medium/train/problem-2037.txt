Me neither, given recent reports saying Russia is stirring up the pot against US/UK/France over Chagos and Mayotte islands. I guess now we see which nonprofits that have become Russian tools.
It’s also in China’s best interest to stir up noise on this issue to. They have a string of military bases and friendly ports along the coast of the Indian Ocean, and Diego Garcia allows the Americans to project power onto China’s entire Indian Ocean trade network.
Diego Garcia was uninhabited until the late 18th century, and it never had an indigenous population as such to begin with.
What it did have and what ended up being called the Chagossians people were a mix of African, Indian and Malay people working the plantations there. (Admittedly, the Brits brought them there as slaves, but they were never local to the Islands as such.).
It's not a take, it's not an opinion, it's what's going on, which you'd know had you bothered to check any other news sources reporting on this.
Meh, it was a shitty thing to do at the time, but the only reason it's in the news now is because Putin is trying to embarrass the UK and France over Mayotte and the Chagos Islands.
Of course it was an atrocious act, and yes, it's an issue that's been bubbling for a few years and even had the UN ruled on it, but that doesn't mean that Putin isn't milking this for all it worth.
UK and US both have a history of forcibly removing locals from their land and subjecting them to genocide, just like how Russia is doing in Ukraine today.
Also, the Brits never conquered or annexed the Islands, they bought it from the at the time already independent Mauritius in 1965, and before that it was administered by Mauritius itself.
