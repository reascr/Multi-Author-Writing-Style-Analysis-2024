I believe the rumour that WFH was seen as a shiny bargaining chip the gov doesn't want to give away for free in lieu of something like an inflation adjustment. That and they can't allow departmental competition for more valued employees who can choose to leave for more flexible offices.
If they’re allowing in office work to be in a range (40-60% of the time) that subsequently means that all employees’ in office/wfh days won’t be the same. How does this increase productivity at all if there’s a chance you’ll be walking into a workplace and the rest of your colleagues might not even be there?
It’s just an excuse to slowly get people back in the offices and then make another declaration that they need to be there 100 percent of the time. This has nothing to do with productivity, it’s all about control, work crunch, maintaining impossible deadlines and being able to sexually harass women (I’m not joking on that last one, it’s so prevalent in some industries).
My office literally has more than twice as many employees as there are workspaces if we all go in to the office half of us literally couldn't work....
