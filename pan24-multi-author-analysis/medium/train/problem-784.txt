We live in a time where I'm upvoting your comment because it's in /r/politics. But this could have just as well been a legit statement - not even sarcasm - on /r/conservative.

Oh, yeah, next year we're going to see how close we get to defaulting on the dollar without going over.
I think we end up going over because the people in that "caucus" are nuts, but who knows? One thing I can say for sure--we're going to miss Pelosi.
Fun fact: Pelosi had the exact same majority last congress that the GOP will have this congress. Never hard a peep about her maintaining control.
I don't like the Republican's politics; I don't like what's happened in America in the last two years.
I can feel that, but living through an absence of change is dying, and that's what the MAGA, QAnon fight for.
Shit is weird, and we can't get off this ride just yet, and when we do, it'll be an entirely different ride than we had.
Believe it or not, the American people have made it clear that they would rather vote for moving forward than stagnating in animosity.
If republican house members want to keep getting re-elected - and dems too - a way forward needs to be found that doesn't involve the "Free: Dumb Cock us" or the progressive wing of the dem party (and I am a progressive dem).
