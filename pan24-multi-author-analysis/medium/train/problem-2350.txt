Nah the criminals are just cannon fodder. They are told to walk forward so Ukrainians can shoot at them, alerting their positions for the more experienced Russians to fire artillery at them. If they hesitate or walk back, Chechens and Wagernites shoot at them.
Like the origins of the French Foreign Legion. Started as cannon fodder and entirely made up of scum. It also offered citizenship for those that volunteered, much like russia is now doing.
A big difference is that I do not have any inkling that russia's military will last long enough in any sort of cohesion to survive, unlike the FFL did.
i think regardless of what happens in ukraine they are already fucked for the whole next generation. russia is a bully nation and now they have to show up to class with two broken legs. the entire way they operate is predicated on being able to back up their open and implied threats. also, nobody will want to buy any war equipment they make for the foreseeable future, cementing the west's supremacy and leaving room for others to grab market share which will probably be permanent.
