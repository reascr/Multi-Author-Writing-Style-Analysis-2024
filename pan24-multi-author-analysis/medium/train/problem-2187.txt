It's a pilot program, so it's still a new thing that may not even be offered in many schools anywhere let alone Florida. College Board put out a statement saying they have been working on updating the course for the past 11 months, and were set to release those changes next month, probably so schools can prepare for the 2023-24 school year. My guess is the new version of the course will be acceptable, despite being largely the same, to DeSantis and he takes 100% of the credit for the changes to show that he is tough on the woke crowd and look at this great thing he did to help America. Politically, DeSantis is far more calculating than Trump, and you see it with stuff like this. DeSantis, like most right wing politicians, couldn't care less about any of these culture war issues, from LGBTQ to abortion, that get the base worked up. Solving problems that don't exist serve as useful distractions while they pick your pocket on behalf of their corporate donors and cement their own power. It's all been done before.
