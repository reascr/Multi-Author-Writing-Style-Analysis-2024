That would be an abortion via C-section. I am amazed by people who don't understand that "aborting a pregnancy" means "ending a pregnancy." Only ignorant people and loons think that an emergency termination of a pregnancy at, say, 8 months and when the fetus is healthy and normally developed, is done as though it were at 12 weeks, or that it involves "killing" and "cutting up" the fetus. Or that "abort" refers to the embryo/fetus, rather than the pregnancy.
