The rise of social media has freed them of the confines of needing to have an actual point or argument or any knowledge on a particular matter. This is somewhat necessary to get your message across when you do it by good faith debate or talking with actual journalists. They have fully embraced "grievance politics", coincident with the evolution of social media algorithms which prioritize "engagement", along with their long time audience aging into these platforms (often with zero understanding of their inner workings). '90s 2000s MBAs would explosively jazz their pants at the level of pure synergy.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
