I am sure Zelensky is ready to receive your unconditional withdrawal from all of Ukraine including Crimea, and offer of full reparations, Putin. Not what you were going to offer? Too bad. Salami tactic is not working.
The US does exert a lot of influence all over the world. However, politicians and countries are free to decline (sometimes it would be stupid to, though). There are often big juicy carrots to be had, and not just for the elite.
This will vary by country, region, culture etc. IMHO Ukraine has the right geography and mentality to make a success of it, if they can make a sustainable break from russia.
And only once they are ready, and only once you've pulled out your troops from the whole country, and changed your laws to recognising all part of Ukraine belong to Ukraine no parts belong to Russia.
they're assuming that the US is doing the negotiating, and that Ukraine is merely a puppet. It's just unimaginable to a dictator that Ukraine is a sovereign entity and that no third party is really in control.
Regardless, it is 100% up to Ukraine to decide if and how to negotiate, and not the US or anyone else's call.
Any kind of peace settlement requires that the parties are able to trust each other. The russian news/propaganda says that Ukraine is untrustworthy, and the ukrainian news/propaganda says that russia is untrustworthy. No matter the truth, this is not a good basis for negotiations.
