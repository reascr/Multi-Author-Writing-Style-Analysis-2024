ancien régime isn't the beginning, the frankish people adopting roman administration and ruling western europe is a good genesis for the modern french polity.
France begins with the ancien régime - before the Capetians severed ties and began reorganising their fief into a French overlordship what is now France wasn't its own polity, it was a part of the wider Frankish Empire that included what is now Germany, Benelux, Switzerland, and Northern Italy. Whatever we label them (Western/Middle/Eastern) the Frankish Kingdoms, all were part of what the Frankish elite conceptualised as a single unit; to them the notions of these being their own separate entities would've been preposterous.
You can't first exclaim France begins with the Franks adopting Roman customs of rule and then deny you [I] can qualify the beginnings of the French polity when that line of thought is challenged.
there's no scientific way to delineate the chronology of polities. there are fair enough arguments that the beginnings of modern france predate even the frankish kingdoms, as administrative customs and conventions were adopted from the gallo-roman period.
I'll say it again - France begins with the ancien régime because before the Capetians and their severing of ties with and defence of their crown against the Carolingians ruling the remaining Frankish Empire, there was no extant "French" polity, only a non-distinct overlordship of the Western Frankish lands. A distinctly French political tradition only takes shape under the Capetians, and it would take hundreds of years before even the Capetians marked themselves as Kings of France, not Kings of Franks.
