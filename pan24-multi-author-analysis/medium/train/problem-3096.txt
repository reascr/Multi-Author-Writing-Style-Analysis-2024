What do I mean? Okay. Most everybody likes Social Security. Most everybody likes parks and conservation. Most everybody understands "infrastructure, good". But the problems is, there's very few things that Americans HATE more than taxes. Furiously, irrationally, destructively. In addition to that, most Americans over the age of 30 or so, have a VERY low tolerance for risk of street1\-violence. If someone gets hurt on the news, especially the kind of person who (fairly or unfairly) inspires mass sympathy - our brains shut down and we start asking our institutions to keep us safe and damn the cost.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
