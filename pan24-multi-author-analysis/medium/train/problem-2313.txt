The United Kingdom is somewhat of an oddity compared to the United States, the Russian Federation, India, and the PRC because practically the entirety of the UK's nuclear arsenal is concentrated in the form of SLBMs launched from submarines. Plus, stealth bombers can be used for non-nuclear purposes.
Also, if I recall, the RAF as it stands lacks actual dedicated long range bombers. Whether that's a pressing problem for British military doctrine I don't know but I'm pretty sure the last of the Avro Vulcans have been pulled out of service decades ago. Most air forces have moved towards using multi-role fighters.
The RAF doesn't need a long-range stealth bomber. Any threats posed to the UK and her interests are reachable with modern multirole fighter from the homeland, allied airbases or a carrier strike group. Large bombers have become largely superfluous with the advent of accurate long-range cruise missiles, and more recently drones.
It makes sense for the US to build large stealth bombers, but smaller countries like the UK are better off with missiles and drones because of the costs involved.
