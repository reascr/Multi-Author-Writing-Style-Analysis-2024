Kurzgesa have a video called optimistic nihilism, which explains a bit about their standpoints, even if they mainly try to keep a scientific and objective stance, it’s difficult to not put any value into it, and I think it makes sense the way they do it. If there is any blatant scientific misinformation that’s one thing, and if you have examples of that I would love to know.
What if tens/hundreds of thousands die over the next few years because of government inaction and expanding fossil fuel industries?
I recently watched the kurzgesa video about the meteor that killed the dinosaurs. The damage was roughly equivalent to basically blowing all of our nukes at once, and nearly killed everything on the surface of the earth. Couple of years went by (millions, which isn’t much on the grand scale) and here we are.
I’m pretty sure we’d have to work pretty god damn hard to entirely kill the planet for good, try as we might. The earth and sun will be here for many millions or billions of years to come, way after we’re gone.
