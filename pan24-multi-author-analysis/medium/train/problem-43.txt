Hi! Iâ€™m Persian. The more you post, comment, like, and engage with posts like these, the more attention our cause gains.
Since media is vastly ignoring us, all we can count on are users on social media platforms continuing to spread the news. ðŸ’—.
CSI ask how do you think the protests are going? Are the protests still gaining strenh or are they being pushed down? Do you think that a meaningful change can be made?
Honestly, BBC WS is one of the only news radio stations I can still stand listening to any more. Theyâ€™re professional and present the facts, instead of ranting and raving; they cover news from all over the world, which has made me more aware of geopolitics and events outside my country. Thatâ€™s how I learned about the recent end of the Tigray War, about the Sri Lanka President fleeing the country earlier this year, the unrest in South Africa, etc.
I think itâ€™s pretty important to be culturally aware, and not just marinate in oneâ€™s bubble in a small corner of the world. I think that more news sources should report things like this and spend less time bickering back and forth.
