I'll admit it, I'm among the 90% who don't read the article. I'm a headline, and top 2 comments kinda guy. Every now and then if I'm actually semi- interested I'll read the TLDR bot summary.
Edit: sheesh, what I seem to do is very polarizing apparently. You either agree with me or hate me ü§£ sorry my reddit habits are divisive.
Lmao exactly. Why in the fuck would AMERICAN defense company have any business relationship with China at all? Congress would sanction the shit out of them but more importantly stop giving them juicy juicy defense contracts.
Being added to the UEL allows China to legally confiscate any weapons Raytheon and Lockheed Martin intend to ship to Taiwan, confiscate the ships shipping these weapons and impose fines on all companies involved. It basically means that no company will ship weapons to Taiwan.
They did business with Taiwan which has that awkward status of being both officially recognized as part of China and also unofficially recognized as independent.
I‚Äôm telling you, based on geopolitics, recent history, and naval realities, there is no way that the US is going to stop providing weapons from these companies to Taiwan just because China is saying to. Not gonna happen.
On its face, your comment reads as a legitimate take. However, while they can try to stop weapons sales to Taiwan, the US naval escorts would probably take issue with any attempt. If Taiwan wants weapons from LM or Raytheon (and they do, have received, and will keep receiving), the US will make sure they arrive. This isn‚Äôt some normal maritime shipment, we‚Äôre talking about shipments of high tech western weapons‚Ä¶ c‚Äômon.
My first edition of that comment reply started with ‚Äúhaaaaaaaaaaaahaha,‚Äù but I removed it because I thought it might have come off as rude. But yes, ‚Äúlmfao‚Äù was first response.
