Did you personally create the problem? no. of course not. But you (and the players, and advertisers and fans) passively cosigned the behavior of the Qatari government by continuing on exactly how you would have if it was held anywhere else. We all (including me) to some degree passively support horrendous buisness practices ( eating meat supports factory farms, buying clothes from fast fashion retailers supports the inhuman conditions found in clothing factories in Indonesia/Bangladesh, the list is endless). But the negative effects of those are far more distanced from the end product for most consumers to really even know about it. The slaves used to build those facilities in Qatar are still there in inhumane work camps BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE. They will be forced to deconstruct those stadiums and a terrifyingly large number of them will not live through it.
Switzerland’s “armed neutrality” was openly hostile towards the third reich. It was all they could do to maintain their territorial integrity surrounded by axis powers. Spain had just had an utterly devastating civil war (though that doesn’t excuse their nazi sympathies - Franco was a real piece of shit) and Winston Churchill commented of Sweden that they “ignored the moral issues of the war and played both sides for profit”. I think my comment holds up.
