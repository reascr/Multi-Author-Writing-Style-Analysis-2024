Not looking forward to the Iron Harvest that will happen for decades after. There is a good reason most countries stopped using landmines. They rarely injure their targets and less so kill them. They more so usually maim farmers and kids, take a look at cambodia and vietnam. Kids constantly missing arms and legs.
A landmine that kicks up and goes off at knee / waist level for an adult, might be chest/head level for a child.
Anti-personnel landmines are designed to wound rather than kill, as a wounded casualty takes up many more resources than a dead body.
I haven't seen any bouncing mines in use in Ukraine, maybe some left from WW2 kicking around but doubt it.
The idea of them is less as a kill or harm tactic but area denial and in that they are extremely useful. Terrible weapons, but honestly if you are being invaded and that will buy you time, it makes sense. If it's likely you won't win and the other side will lose people for generations to them it makes more sense. War is hell, you do what you can to survive.
