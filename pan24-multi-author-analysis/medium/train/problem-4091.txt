Keep in mind that $60 was specifically chosen in order to give the Russians some profit even if they sold at price cap. Russian oil break even is estimated to be $40/barrel. This isn’t “well we don’t want to sell at a loss.” This is literally “we would take zero profit over less profit.”.
the kremlin is assuming that the oil purchases by those countries would be required by their economies, and that by not selling, it's pressure to not participate in the price cap.
It might work, but the fact that oil production is not completely monopolized by russia is a way out - the US has massive shale and tar sand projects, and if the price of oil rises a bit more, it'd be profitable to restart them. Not to mention that venezuela still have oil that has not been properly exploited due to their economic and political issues.
The US did ease up on Venezuela a bit recently for this reason. Can’t remember which one but some oil company was granted permission to operate there.
Don't worry though, one of the pipelines in Nordstream 2 is still intact. Purely by coincidence I'm sure, but it's nice that Europe can rely on the Russians for gas if they decide to approve NS2!
Especially not in such an obvious way If the US did it, it's more likely they would have done some very covert nonsense that couldn't even be confirmed to be sabotage (and they would have likely destroyed all 4 pipelines).
