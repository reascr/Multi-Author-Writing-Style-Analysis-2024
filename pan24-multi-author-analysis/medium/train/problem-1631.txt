I think it ultimately depends on what happens with Taiwan. Unless there's some isolationist in the White House, I can't see the US not coming to Taiwan's defense in the event of an invasion. Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan has substantial economic and geopolitical importance to the US.
Well it's either we just let China take Taiwan and sit back and watch OR standby Taiwan, if this is what Taiwan wants and assist where needed. Depends on what we want the world order to be. Russia, China, Iran will happily dictate their terms. They have no requirement for public support or have to worry about being voted out of government. They will take what they need. We can watch and never intervene and never have wars again, easy. these countries will do what they want or we stand up to them.
Shouldn't be quoting either of them. Every general will tell you we're moments away from war, no matter if it's true or not. It's part of their job to convince civilian politicians of an ever increasing need for more military funding and preparedness.
