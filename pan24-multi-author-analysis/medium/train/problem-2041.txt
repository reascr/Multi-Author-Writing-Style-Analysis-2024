Yeah a super slim majority with Dems vastly outperforming historical trends doesn't seem to me that people want nothing but revenge investigations and culture wars. Republicans can go for it, I just think it's going to blow up in their faces.
Call me crazy but after the last few years and how hard it's been for everyone I don't think people want a political party that's only agenda is revenge.
Investigating the investigations will require a replay of all the investigations’ findings and that’s a very stupid thing for the Republicans to do. But nothing stupid nor seditious has stopped the GOP for years. So here’s to them cutting their own throats once again.
