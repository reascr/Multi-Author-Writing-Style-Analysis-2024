Their economy is f'd long term from the loss of working age manpower and shrinking population. Who will buy real estate when there will be fewer people in the future to buy it and as a result will be much more likely to fall in price than gain? Fewer people to buy hard goods so the price of your business stock will likely fall., etc.
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Most people purchase homes with debt. Suddenly owing more on a mortgage than what the home can sell for on the market is problematic. Especially in the first several years, as a majority of the payments early on do little more than service interest costs while building very little equity. This is amplified in this current world of rapidly rising interest rates. Renewing an underwater mortgage can prove difficult to impossible. Selling the house won’t solve your problem there either. Need a bigger house, get a better job in another city, simply want to downsize and save money? Good luck! If you sell your current house and you still owe the bank money, you’re probably not buying another house. Need to borrow money against your home to do critical repairs, start a business, help family? Nope. Once a downward price spiral starts, it develops more and more momentum. And unlike the West with the 2008 GFC, Russia’s economy isn’t strong enough to implement meaningful TARP style rescue packages and helicopter money parades. Then you have the piggy bank problem. For most people, except the very wealthy, their home is their biggest or only asset. As more traditional pensions plans continue to disappear, the home is increasingly becoming not just a part of people’s retirement plan, but their actual retirement plan.
