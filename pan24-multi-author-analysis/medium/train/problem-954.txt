A college teacher once said in anthropology class: there are more people alive today than who have lived and died before us. I have always found that hard to believe but have wondered about it.
from -50000 to -10000 about 2 million people. Who live about 25 years average lifespans. Meaning 8 million will die every century for those 400 centuries. That's 3.2 billion.
from -10000 to -4000 about 5 million people, who live about the same, 26y. 19.2 million will die during those 60 centuries.. That's 1.2 billion.
from -4000 to -2000 about 15 million people on average, who live about 26 years. 57.6 million for 20 centuries. That's 1.2 billion people.
from -2000 to 0, about 100 million people on average, who live 26 years. That's 384 million for 20 centuries ; That's 7.7 billion people.
from 0 to 1000, 200 milllion people on average that live about 31 years. That's 646 million people for 10 centuries ; That's 6.5 billion people.
from 1000 to 1500, 410 million on average who live about 32 years, 1.3 billion people for 5 centuries ; That's 6.4 billion people.
from 1500 to 1700, 575 million people on average who live on average 34 years, 1.79 billion people for 2 centuries ; That's 3.6 billion people.
from 1700 to 1800, 825 million people on average, who live about 36 years ; That's 2.3 billion people.
from 2000 to 2022, 7.1 billion average people who live 70 years on average ; That's 2.2 billion people.
It gives me 50 billion people. But I don't know the rate at which humans were banging and replacing themselves, so my r is kind of let in the open. I'm assuming people in the neolithic and paleolithic were replacing rapidly. So it's at least 50 billion.
I don't know how these anthropologist find 117 billion, they must have guessed the replacement rate. but yeah it's a number that makes sense and didn't come out of nowhere. My point is, there are many more humans who died than who were alive today.
