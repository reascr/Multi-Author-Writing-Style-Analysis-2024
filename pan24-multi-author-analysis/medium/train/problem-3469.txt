51 now means its easier to stomach -1 next term, or makes a +1 gain in 2024 1 seat closer to being able to pass meaningfully progressive legislation.

does 51 means they don't have to give GOP any comitee chairs? because they shouldn't or only to ppl who voted guilty on jan 6 - uh are there any such gop senators?
It's more than that. The full Senate, in the first hours, hold a series of votes on the rules. Since the Constitution gives each chamber of the Congress the ability to create their own rules of decorum and procedure, the best time to change those rules is when the new session starts. Those changes to rules starting out would not be subject to the shenanigans like secret holds and the filibuster. They are straight yea/nay/abstain votes...and requires a simple majority to pass.
Its also important beyond this term. If the seat is there for taking, grab it.... its hard to know what the map will look like in 2024 and 2026.
