I want to add more, but I think everybody should just read the article to see the depths of his depravity and the complicity of his wife.
One of the things that really bugs me is that she reported the sexual abuse to counselors at a Christian Summer Camp and the camp counselors had her speak to a social services counselor but she got spooked by the idea that she could lose another family.
I have heard it argued that it was the Democratic party a little but most of my family seems to think that Disney is going to personally send over LGBTQ folks to your local school to teach them all about how to enjoy rough anal sex.
The sad reality is that much of what gets taught at an early age is how to watch out for sexual predators and to give children the tools to avoid, escape, and stand up to grooming and other forms of sexual abuse which honestly makes a hell of a lot more sense given that the religious right continue to defend sexual abuse reporting loopholes for the clergy.
