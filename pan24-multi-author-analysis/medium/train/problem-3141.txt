Ukraine has in the past targetted rail loading points, it looks like they will need to ramp this up.
I heard that russian missiles flying to Kiyv... Wouldn't it be fair that Ukrainians missiles would fly to Moscow?
FFS nuclear weapons is so Fucken cheating... Like literally Rashist can do what ever they want to Ukraine... For example try to destroy electricity, heating and etc... Meanwhile if Ukraine would try to do something like that to Russia, Ukraine probably would be nuked... This is bullshit... World should really do something about this issue... Or there should be some sort agreement that each non nuclear county must be protected with nukes by country having them (so more NATO type alliances, I guess), or then nukes for every country (which would be terrible)... And 3rd option is probably de nuke the world, what is not possible, because there is at least few countries which have nukes and won't give them by any cost...
Maybe someone has a hunch the russians can bring them down ( even If just 30%of the time or whatever) and therefore they will only hand them out when Russian anti air is out of the picture.
We've just seen how current US aid to Ukraine amounts to only 5.6% of the annual military budget... and the payoff is the utter destruction of Russia.
A single howitzer is not a valid target for HIMARS and Russians reorganized their logistics by pulling major ammo depots outside of the HIMARS range and placing air defenses along the attack vector. But they won't pull outside of the ATACMS range... (hint, hint).
Maybe maybe not. One ATACMS ist equal in money to a full pod of 6 or so of what they are curretly using.
Its longer in the air and bigger. And Ukraine does double or Triple Tap where they can to be Safe. Seems reasonable.
