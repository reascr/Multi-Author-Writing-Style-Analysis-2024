Get invaded by Russia now while Russia's occupied with Ukraine and the entire western world supporting it, or get invaded by Russia later when Russia can throw everything at you and people may not care as much.
It could take decades to rebuild their military, even assuming sanctions were returned to pre-2014 status after the complete liberation of Ukraine's recognized territory.
That's the best case scenario, because Russia is failing at the easy part right now: seizing control of all of Ukraine. The hard part would be occupying a nation of 40 million people while being under extreme sanctions, said people being virtually united against you, and having the resistance be armed by the West. The situation is hopeless for Putin, but he has been surrounded by too many yes-men to see it.
He could just go for the bald-faced lie: "I am pleased to announce that our objectives in Ukraine are complete. The Ukraine military has rooted out the Nazi influence in their country, and I am confident that ethnic Russians in Ukraine will now have their rights fully protected, so the mission has been a success. Our victorious soldiers will be returning home soon!".
