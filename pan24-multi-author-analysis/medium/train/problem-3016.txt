there are a lot of witness in the school saying they are rape. and also more than 5 are raped. theres no fucking way all these witness are lying and theres no way all these 5+ girls are stealing money.. and all these witness in the school are saying the official are gonna cover it up as they used to before this statement comes out. as vietnam society are confucian based. its all about image and the government are trying to cover it up. i dont see any reason whatsoever a girl would be screaming at the top of their lung over an accusation of money being stolen unless they are being raped. the official are obv bullshit.
At a military school in Vietnam, there was an allegation of rape. The school denies the allegation, and threatened anyone spreading the story with legal action.
The capitalization here made me think for a minute that the school was named "Try to Deny Rape", and my first two reactions were alternating between 1) "that's an odd name for a military school" and 2) "how did some translation app screw up a name this badly??".
