Funny enough, is that they are now "on par" with China, North Korea... And amazingly, this is denting eroding the wet dreams of the Xi Pooh Ping to create the "Silk Road Initiative"...
The best signal that Ruzzia is losing, is that Chinese officials are now calling Putler "crazy"... like one year late. Hopefully we make politicians remember this when they start making "friends" with China again.
So overall, Putin is more like a hobo's dick cheese. He is a walking, talking, stack of dumpster smegma.
Just curious, is it illegal in the constitution of russia to start a war and thats why it's called a SMO? In which case, as all the citizens know it's a war, putin is guilty and can be imprisoned?
Russian Constitution seems meaningless as the court system is completely corrupt. How else can you convict someone of "discrediting the army" by calling this massive war, a war? Or holding a blank piece of paper, or singing a Ukrainian song or even can you believe it wearing a blue jacket with yellow shoes. Someone recently arrested for putting flowers on a Ukraine monument in Russia after many innocent children killed in apartment bombing. Meanwhile they released murderers after 6 months service in illegal PMC Wagner. No justice in Russia. Laws just for show and suppression.
Annnd this is why women don't like being called cunts. They know what a bad day looks like. Not nice.
Russians are so blind. They are all prisoners soon to be recruited into the grinder for putins imperial ambitions.
Legalizing means state will take over their business, replace with corrupt management and bankrupt it.
Putin breaks own law for years and when his own people start to pay attention, just changes the law. Still did the crime.
