I like that the appeals court sent the case back to Cannon and ordered her to reverse her own decision, then also ruled that she never had jurisdiction anyway.
...and Trump is already appealing this to the Supreme Court, which most likely, the conservatives will put a hold on ANY documents the Justice Department needs to continue their investigation.
The Republicans are going to deny reality and hinder anybody who does any good for sure. But the justice department should have all the January 6th information transcripts video interviews everything. Also the justice department already has all the documents from the search warrant that Trump is appealing they just can't look at them until a judge says it's okay but they already have those documents. But yes anything else that comes out of the legislature branch will be withheld from the executive branch starting January 1.

They go into great lenh to discuss jurisdiction. Without which, it appears, there is nothing for a (federal) judge to do. They say she didn't have jurisdiction. Everything Judge Cannon did is for nothing. There is nothing to appeal (to SCOTUS) either.
