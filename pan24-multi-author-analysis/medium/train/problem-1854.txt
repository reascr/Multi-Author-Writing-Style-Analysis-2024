I got the news from this account in Ukraine that was tracking the missiles, so feel free to do some digging if need be, I'm not there myself so I wouldn't know the full details. Apologies if anything is wrong.
It is as of posting this 9:09 am Ukrainian time. Reports in of as of this far 4 volleys of missiles being launched from Russia, the Black Sea, and the Caspian Sea into Ukraine.
So on the anniversary of the start of the invasion, in which its forces became bogged down in mud, Russia will start another offensive in which it will be bogged down in mud.
British military intelligence believes the conditions of the battlefield are quickly turning against the Russians’ favor, as forecasts of warmer weather in the Donbas mean snows will melt and the ground will soften, making the swift movement of troops and heavy vehicles near impossible.
Those conditions are likely to be at their worst “with extremely muddy conditions, over mid-to-late March,” according to the latest intelligence assessment.
I don't know what's going to happen, but I think part of the Ukrainian playbook will be to strategically yield untenable positions and attempt to divert forces by threatening the land bridge to Crimea. The next big offensive push on the Ukrainian side may have to wait until they have the modern tanks, provided that they can keep the skies contested.
That's why the push is coming before mid March. The aim seems to be to occupy all of Donetsk/Luhansk. That gives them cover at home to claim "mission successfull".
