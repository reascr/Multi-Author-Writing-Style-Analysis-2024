>“We are disappointed, but still the decision has not been taken yet so we hope that the government in Berlin will take seriously all of the concerns they heard (on Friday) in Ramstein,” Melnyk added.
This guy was taken from his job as ambassador to Germany because his talks and opinions massively hurt the relations between the nations. And he very much played in the playbook of Russiophiles and Putin-fans.
There is to this day at first a hesitation most NATO states to send MBTs. Germany just getting the attention because the leopard II would be the best option of all tanks.
The issue is not Germany providing tanks, they are preventing others from doing so. Other countries (Poland, Spain, and others) have agreed to transfer their Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Problem is because there's an export control agreement with Germany, Germany has to give permission to the other countries to transfer their tanks.
US has a ton of M1 Abrams but logistics are more difficult due to them using turbine engines and running on jet fuel instead of diesel.
It might pose a logistical challenge, but why not offer them Abrams? Free tanks are better than no tanks even if a blitz offensive might be hard due to logistics. Or has Ukraine already turned them down?
Abrams tanks have turbine engines using a very different fuel than all of the other vehicles Ukraine is using. Essentially Jet Fuel vs Diesel fuel. Leopard 2 tanks use diesel.
