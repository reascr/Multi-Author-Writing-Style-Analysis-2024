Brother ukraine... whats more brotherly than sending a million soldiers, sending mercenary armies, anhilating cities, siezing ports, blockading trade, multi multi multiple attempts of assassination of leaders, kidnapping mass amounts of children, 'disappearing' mass amounts of adults, not to mention the widespread rape and torture of the civilian population and also the rape and torture of the ukrainian military too. Yeh sure, its a brother country. Can 1 russian please grow a pair of balls and kill this delusional psycho. Hot tip: Poison him like he does to people hes terrified of across the world... or atleast 'make him fall off a building accidentally' theres been more than alot of accidental falling incidents involving high profile russians in the passed 3 years. Nobodies gonna question 1 more, fuck even the UN might turn a blind eye to it. But now that i think of it i guess if trump gets in there would be a full enquiry into why his biggest ally randomly died, then an enquiry into how ukraine still exists under invasion from his fave army, who btw were only invading to annoy the bidens. Its fun as a jk lololl . .x.
Lol. I actually have vk and posted a photoshopped pic of putin getting buttscrewed by kadyrov. The didn't like it and i was drowned in a sea of swine pics.
