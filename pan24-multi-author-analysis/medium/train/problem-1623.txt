Can someone please explain green hydrogen? So much money is being invested in this tech when the tried and true (wind, solar, hydro) continues to become cheaper.
Not every industrial process can effectively utilize electricity for the heating or chemical processes it needs. In these cases utilizing hydrogen can replace a significant number of these processes.
Green hydrogen and ammonia can also be used for seasonal energy storage or in use cases where the energy density of batteries don't make sense (cargo ships).
But also it is the petrol industries last lifeline and they want to make it as big and important as possible so that they'll still have a way to make money. By making promises of green hydrogen in the future they can sell grey (natural gas derived) hydrogen now.
Some governments see it as a way to effectively become energy exporters and the next generation of energy superpowers but I don't think international shipping of green hydrogen will make economic sense without rebuilding every single natural gas pipeline.
