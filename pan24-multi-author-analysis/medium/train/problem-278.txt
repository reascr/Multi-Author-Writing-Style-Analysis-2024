1. Historical Russian Empire had parts of Poland, and Poland was part of the Eastern Bloc. Putin pretty clearly spent Covid pandemic fantasizing about the Russian empire and USSR.
A lot of üêî hawks are saying NATO should war with Russia, others are questioning if Ukraine is trying a false flag.
Shit happens when you're trigger happy. Not excusing it, but I see absolutely no reason for Russia to "attack" Poland, especially some farm with no strategic value. Also why the hell would Russia want to invade Poland?
Someone fucked up and got two innocent people killed is what happened. If they're Russian you can bet they're paying the price for it right now.
I agree with you that this wasnt intentional, but I did want to mention there's a number of reasons why Poland is desirable to Russia.
It would obviously mean war with NATO which they aren't going to do now. There's no reason for Russia to attack Poland now but Poland is 100% desirable to Russia.
Ok, so maybe Poland does have value to Russia BUT as you said, it would mean a war with NATO and I don't think it's that valuable to Russia, like at all.
