Not just "some". This is pretty much just factual information. Almost no one is supplying Ukraine with tanks, just other armored vehicles and weapons systems. That means Russia easily is the biggest tank supplier.
I can imagine Russia leaving quite a lot of their tanks behind to use for Ukrainians but I kinda doubt it would be like 20-25% of ALL that they sent. There's a reason why in every military aid chart Poland hovers between 2 and 3 (as in - it's comparable in scope to UK and by far first in EU).
Ukraine is simultaneously the most powerful and evil but also weak in Russias eyes. It’s fascism rearing it’s head.
Thus the "almost" part. I've seen some tanks make it over, but not a lot countries have big stockpiles of working soviet tanks that they don't need. Not compared to the immense amount that Russia leaves behind, anyway.
And somehow I think this is how the Russians take pride in this war against Ukraine… it’s almost like they are creating a national holy war of sorts. End of the line, defeat Ukraine and NATO or die. But they are causing all of it and gaslighting the world and themselves.
It is like a holy war to them. If I'm not mistaken both putin/Kremlin and Iran have mentioned a "new world order" or something, as if Iran/Russia/north Korea have any chance of becoming the dominant political powers.
