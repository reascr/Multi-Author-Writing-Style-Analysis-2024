Fwiw the US doesn’t sell their arms to any country willing to pay. It is a very serious obligation where you are essentially willing to advance US foreign policy goals. That is why so many countries choose to buy from Russia despite their shittier quality because Russia doesn’t give a fuck and buying from them comes with way fewer strings attached. However that doesn’t mean that the US doesn’t send it to people who my carry out war crimes, if those war crimes will contribute to US foreign policy goals.
The difference is that this is an official statement from the US gov't, which means they already have solid evidence and probably the entire supply chain mapped from the factory floor through shipping to detonation inside Ukraine.
This statement is intended for the Iranian regime, not the rest of us, and Iran would be wise to heed the implications.
Thought this was pretty much confirmed a few months ago already. I'm super sure there have been multiple headlines about iranian drones/weapons/missiles being somehow delivered to russia.
