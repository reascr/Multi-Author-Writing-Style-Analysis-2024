I sincerely hope that journalists keep track of what happens to these traitors- if they’re not all fired than residents of the jurisdictions in which they serve should sue for their departments for misconduct and negligence in having known criminals policing the community. I will look and see if any were from my area. If anyone knows that one of the treasonous “law enforcement” officers is from their area, it may also make sense to send a heads-up to your local legal aid society, public defenders’ office, and defense bar- they often keep databases of crooked cops in order to flag potential impeachment or other credibility issues for use on the stand. As we’ve all seen, the police often can’t be trusted to police themselves, let alone anyone else.
And there were many other members of police departments among the seditionists attacking the Capitol on January 6th. Anyone unlawfully on the Capitol premises that day should be dismissed and barred from ever working for the public again.

If you’re part of a group engaged in terrorism and sedition then you can’t be trusted to uphold the law.
