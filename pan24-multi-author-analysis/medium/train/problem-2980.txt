AFAIK it says there shan't be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and certainly no tariffs, but Ireland is in the EU and Northern Ireland is part of the UK so there has to be tariffs.
There's been multiple bombing threats the last two or three months from the British uvf against Irish government ministers.
There was a British army vet arrested last night with bombs and weapons with intents to cause harm.
I meant that tensions are higher than normal. There hasn't been a peep out any splinter of the IRA in a long time, the UVF have been pretty visible on the last year with threats and a couple of attempts supposedly halted at the last minute (source is the letter to the PSNI from the UVF last month, apparently an olive branch not to go through with it).
I know far less than the PSNI about what's happening, but I'd put that attack on the police car on Soaradh due to the potshotted and half arsed execution. I've a low opinion of any of IRA namesake but at least they would claim responsibility in the past. That other crowd of cowards have always shied away.
