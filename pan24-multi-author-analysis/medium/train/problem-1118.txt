To kill bacteria overall, is simple. They are complex, but have so many “moving parts” that it’s pretty easy to find one to disrupt that kill the cell. You could add something that is toxic to the cell to kill it, heat it up to denature it’s membrane proteins and kill it, add substances that pierce the cell wall, and so forth. In comparison prions are so simple and stable, that by their nature you have to denature them to destroy them, there is no alternative. They have no metabolism to effect and no other “moving parts” they rely to be infectious on other then their innate physical properties. So to stop them you have to alter their physics properties which in comparison is harder. This is mainly why they’re so much more difficult to destroy.
The issue back when this was killing people in the 80s was they were feeding the cows their own byproducts, like brains. That was causing it to spread so I assume this practice has stopped.
I mean let's be honest, prion infected cows shipped across the world and then splattered all over the countryside doesn't sound like a biologically safe solution.
