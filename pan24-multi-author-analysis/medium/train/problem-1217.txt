So all of the attacks and rockets and threats under the previous government, what are your thoughts on those? If Netanyahu is at fault for this "tension"?
The guy that responded to you said that peace cannot happen while Israel exists in its current state. You said that’s true; Netanyahu needs to be replaced, which implies that Netanyahu is the problem with Israel’s current existence. So I’m pointing out that Palestinians attacked Israelis long before, after, and in between Netanyahu’s tenures.
According to the article, this is over Israeli bulldozers and military forces being near a border fence. Apparently Israel is doing excavation work? I don’t know why, the article doesn’t provide context for that.
Kinda seems like it's the nature of being so close to the border itself too. I think even this article says 2 meters? Being off by two meters when talking international divides isn't a huge amount.
There was a big news article in Israel about a year back on the condition of the northen border fences and it showed they were basically falling apart. So the IDF is rebuilding and fixing all the fences and guard posts in the area.
