It's hilarious how many people thought this guy was dangerous. All those conservatives were like "we got a basketball player and they got the merchant of death!". He was in prison for like 20 fucking years. He's got no money, he's got no inventory, and his network doesn't exist anymore, like what's he going to do? Literally all he is, is an old man with a shitty past.
Yes half the people on reddit don't seem to understand the basic concept. He's not some legendary trader that is going to make inroads into other countries, new supply chains, and magically start providing arms for the entire RU army. He literally sold old soviet stock to the OTHER countries. That stock as we have has seen is rusted out garbage for the most part now and they need every last bit of it to even sniff a chance at fighting Ukraine.
A valid point BUT, they likely wouldnâ€™t buy their outdated, rusty ass hardware/munitions when they have several NATO countries more than willing to sell their modern arms.
Since he knows who he sold what to he is quite useful in an effort to buy the somewhat more functional weapons back. Since it does not seem like anyone will do legitimate business with Russia he is extremely useful. The people who purchased the weapons can probably get away with selling the weapons back under the excuse that they never knew the weapons were stolen and when the rightful owners offered to BUY them back how could they say no?
"hey I got arrested for stealing your gun and if you bail me out I will tell you who I sold it to so you can buy it back.".
(thinks for a moment about the fact that nobody would sell them a new gun to replace the one that was stolen).
