I've met someone who was super similar to George Santos many years ago. They lied relentlessly about EVERYTHING. They were failing a class, they'd go lie to the professor about their home life, probably(no evidence of this but honestly most likely scenario) sleep with them, and pass. They were dating some guy, but also dating some other guy hours away. The lies were completely pointless too, like "that really quiet guy who everyone likes tried to punch me!", and all sorts of crazy crap. After a few years pretty much everyone had caught on, but even after people tried talking too her about it, they got no where lol. They are now some big-wig manager in some tech. company and have absolutely no idea how to do anything but lie to get people to do work for them lol.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
