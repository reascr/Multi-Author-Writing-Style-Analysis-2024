Under the constantly shifting auspices of “de-nazification” or to “demilitarize” or to “protect the Russian speaking population” or to “combat NATO infiltrators”.
When it seems clearly to be neo-imperial aspirations and such entitlement to Ukrainian land/control that any overtures to a different axis of power (aka working with “the West”) is seen as an existential threat to all of Russian pride.
And then they just lie and lie and lie and lie and lie until those who hate “the West” for whatever reason are given a mental handhold to support this adventurism despite its justifications being shallow at best and a farcical absence at worst.
And, at the most shallow, you’ll see whataboutism towards western adventurism in the Middle East, but then conveniently refuse to turn the mental corner and forcefully condemn Russia’s behavior. To point towards the (well litigated, covered, and shamed) follies of western interventions as a cover to ignore current horrific atrocities is transparent misdirection.
could be , or simply better ICBM propulsion, still theres gonna be dead wagnerites with shittty DPRK weapons instead of dead wagnerites with sitty soviet weapons.
But that’s all these fuckers have. Misdirection and weak half-justifications. I’m glad Russia is losing, just like I was glad when USA + the coalition left the Middle East.
Stop the war. Go home Russia. Win Ukraine and your sphere of influence by providing genuine value to your neighbors instead of threats and actual violence.
The worse thing next to russia nuking themselves because they decided to launch an unmaintained icbm would be Russia giving nuclear capabilities to unstable regimes.
