There's one major change that screwed over their strategy.... they actually build nuclear weapons. In the past North Korea would threaten to start up its nuclear weapons program if the US/South Korea didn't capitulate to them and provide them with food. This food is provided via the UN as the vehicle and then every so many years there's population growth and the annual allotment that was agreed upon a few years back doesn't work anymore... so back to nuclear sabre rattling.
Well this time they've built nukes and they've build ICBMs and so now they can't sabre rattle anymore... they're actually the very threat that we felt we were stopping by giving them food.
Donald Trump was the last president to increase food aid to North Korea. The president got dicked around a lot and essentially North Korea got food for absolutely nothing. That event was so shameful it's reshaped US policy towards North Korea and it's unlikely that Biden will increase food aid to the country.
It's very possible that Russia will be the country bailing out North Korea this time around given their surplus grains.
There is talk of NK sending troops to fight in Ukraine with the Russians. We know they are supplying arms to the Russians, artillery etc. Now they have a problem and need to be subsidized AGAIN Time to stop that BS, NOW We are subsidizing and supporting a mafia government that is nothing but a cancer to this planet. You donâ€™t feed a cancer.
Like 500, but still. I haven't followed this story much, but a quick googgle search shows multiple sources.
