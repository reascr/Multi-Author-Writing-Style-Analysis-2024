Right wing platform’s spread misinformation on any and all topics they can because the people that make up their main base tend to be less educated, poorer, and crazy Christian nuts..the right wing politicians do and say whatever even if they don’t believe what they’re saying. They get votes from their base by stoking the illogical fears and fanning the flames of conspiracy because it works on their base. Their base is at its core, fueled by the ignorant belief that they themselves are victims of a liberal agenda that targets these right wing nuts and take away their jobs, want to indoctrinate kids into being gay or trans, to turn them into atheists, take their tax money to give to lazy liberal welfare moms and give thousands in free food stamps, and on and on.
Just a trip over in r/conservative will show that these conspiracies are alive. Not matter the stats on on Republican death rates due to non-vaccination, they still persist with thinking it’s crazy not getting the shot.
Right Wing platforms have always been spreading health myths. The cancer link with smoking was fought for years by the right. They fought ending smoking in public places. They fought AIDs education. They've fought against asbestos remediation and removing leaded paint and lead in gasolines.
Personally, I don’t care anymore. We tried dragging them over the line kicking and screaming before. I’m not wasting my effort with them anymore. I just hate that one of my coworker’s daughters is immuno-compromised and he believes it’s all government lies.
