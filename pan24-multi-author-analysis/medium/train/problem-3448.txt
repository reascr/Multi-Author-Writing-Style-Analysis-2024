This is expected but frustrating. Give the Ukrainians the ability to destructively hit the bases responsible for the attacks. The escalation ruse has been proven hollow again, and again, and again. Putin continues to escalate the civilian destruction while we send generators and blankets. NATO/US/Jake Sullivan need to stop believing that Russia will escalate more than they already have.
Don't forget that the Nazi Jewish leader of Ukraine needs to be de-Satanized, so they need to send a cruise missle into a train station full of people trying to flee.
Just keep striking like that for years and drive people out of the country while keeping potential investors at bay. After some time resistance will crumble simply due to exhaustion. Might actually work in long term.
Question. Wouldn't laser defenses weapons be the most ideal way to shoot down ballistic missiiles? Speed of light weapon. Adjust power output for distance. I recall hearing Israel wanting to put their laser iron dome on a satellite.
