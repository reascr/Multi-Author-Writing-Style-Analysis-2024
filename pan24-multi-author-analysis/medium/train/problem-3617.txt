The Russian people have sat by idly while their country, once again, falls into fascist despotism. If they want to live under such a government, fine, that's their prerogative, but now their shithole fascist nation wants to annex it's democratic neighbors, and expand its fascist shithole borders, while simultaneously committing acts of genocide and war crimes, while the Russian people continue to sit idly by. I'm sorry, I'm sure some Russians are decent, but we've hit a point where they must be broadly condemned for their idleness and apathy. Their actions, or rather lack thereof, have directly led to this situation. At this point, I have little sympathy for them. They had the opportunity to change, to move past their imperialist, authoritarian mindsets, but they've instead doubled down. As far as I'm concerned, being condemned and insulted by people on the internet is getting off extremely light compared to what their government is inflicting on the people of Ukraine.
English is my native language and our pronunciation still confounds me to no end. I can't even imagine how difficult it is for non native speakers to learn. Off topic I know but I mean seriously. English is like 5 different languages hiding under a trenchcoat.
I mean I don't think English is the absolute most difficult language to learn but I'm 100% confident in saying shit like that doesn't make it any easier.
