I think people forget that not every Nazi administered a death camp, yet they were still Nazis. Fasc is fasc and the agenda is always toned down right until it is too late. What most people consider to be the nut jobs have been getting nuttier and louder, but really I’d call them warning bells. They’re the ones dumb enough to say the quiet part out loud. We’re already seeing what these people are willing to do once they get control of a local or government, even while the Federal government is (barely) semi functioning. Give them a red Congress and White House and I think the quiet part is going to become the loud part.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
