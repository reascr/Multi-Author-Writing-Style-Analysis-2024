Seems like a step in the right direction, but it will rely as ever on how robust the system of proof is:
Pretty sure a substantial chunk of agricultural products from South America would have to end up on the list if they applied a strict interpretation of “deforestation free”.
So... My uneducated guess is that it will impact Nutella's bottom line, but not for the cocoa as you'd have expected, but for the palm oil.
Hmm kind of hard to say. The Italians can grow hazelnuts all by themselves obviously. But even though Nutella is marketed as 'chocolate and hazelnut' spread, apparently it's mostly sugar and palm oil. Which has it's own problems. There's a lot more awareness about deforestation as a result palm oil in the mainstream, especially in the last 10 years.
Malaysia and Indonesia also have deforestation issues as well, specially surrounding palm oil. So look out for reduces in those types of products.
They're not just foodstuffs either. We're talking about things like shampoo, soap, make-up and most interestingly bio-diesel.
The latter of which, the EU currently imports a lot of. Though it's actually worse than fossil fuels, so hopefully this puts a dent in that. One thing to note, is that the Ukraine War makes any big energy switches difficult at the moment. Interesting times ahead either way.
