No joke I think only one of our challenger 2 has been destroyed in combat, Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but it took 3 anti tank missiles and 14 Rpg rockets and was back in service after 12 hours of repair.
Challenger 2 is always called outdated by Russians. 4th Gen tank that was upgraded in 2008 and 2014. Ironic for the guys driving 1960s and 1970s tanks into battle.
Like The Chieftan and Mark Hertling said. It has the optics and thermals etc to be the first one to get off a shot. It's armour is more than capable of taking multiple 125mm shots and fighting on at 100% capability. The Russian armour will not be afforded the same luxury from it's 120mm.
Oh and it has a Rifle cannon with HESH for fucking up entrenched troops from afar. Russian armour due to losses has being used as makeshift howitzers which they struggle with. The Challenger 2 has it as part of its design.
It's not just the UK by any means. Russians talk down everything thats western military. I used to work with a former Soviet era attack helicopter pilot who ended up living as a refugee in Australia. Even 20 years after the end of the cold war, he would automatically talk down anything western, especially of course American. Phhht Abram's tank is rubbish, Russian tank... bla bla.it was kind of amusing. Believing their own propaganda has come back to bite them on the ass.
