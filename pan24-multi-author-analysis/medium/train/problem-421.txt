Many workplaces now expect you to BYOD and they install MDM on your personal device. My work still think I’m weird that I won’t give them admin control over my personal device….

I wonder how many of these devices are BYOD with some MDM installed to allow access to corporate apps. Had a friend camping out of service during the last tiktok ban, so he missed the “delete now” warnings. As soon as he got signal, the MDM wiped his personal device and he lost all his photos from the trip.
