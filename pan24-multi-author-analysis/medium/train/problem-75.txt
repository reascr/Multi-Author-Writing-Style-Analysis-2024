Because they implemented (more or less) the same safety procedures for ALL passengers arriving from china as China currently has for everyone.
Not to mention that China (for the vast part of the past 3 years) forced all arrivals to wear epidemic suits and put them for a week or two into isolation.
Chinese government needs to show bravado in front of its people. It's part of their schtick: "You may be poor and living a shitty life but your country's super amazing and beat the crap out of other countries." We are talking about a country whose state news agency's nightly news would update US covid death count each day just to show how how successful their zero covid policy has been. And will always repeat over and over how they have the 2nd highest GDP in the world.
They can claim that if they want but satellite imagery of night lights estimates their economy is overstated by 40 to 60 percent. And with US based manufacturers seriously rethinking and diversifying their supply lines, it's likely to fall further. I mean, 40-60% less would still have them in 2nd place. Barely.
Hopefully this year will be a good year. As 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were all poor. Mostly because of Trump's trade war.
Most educated Chinese care more about the stock market and property prices rather than GDP. You can't invest in the GDP. And salaries are still quite low, so investment is where people make their money.
Just because a country doesn't have restrictions doesn't mean others can't. And especially for China it's a bit hypocritical.
So when countries start demanding covid tests and quarantines, there has been a huge uproar that Chinese people are "getting bullied abroad" hence they need to make a statement by responding in kind. And this is it.
Edit. There where countless videos of ppl that had to stay or sit in front of a restaurant while their native family was eating inside the restaurant and brought them the food outside....
