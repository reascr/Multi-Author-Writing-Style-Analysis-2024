The IOC said they won’t allow athletes deemed to be in support of Russia in this war to compete. But I wonder what they’ll do if someone actually does this during the Olympics.
Almost half the medals Russia won at Tokyo Olympics were won by athletes "employed" by Russian military or police. It's a joke that they were allowed to compete by IOC AFTER the systematic doping/cheating scandal. Ban them and ban them all.
My point is from an individual level its easy. It just needs enough to join. Why are you discouraging it? Related cultural and sports boycotts ended the Apartheid regime in south africa for instance.
The only way I would even consider not boycotting the Olympics is if there was a requirement that any athlete from Belarus or Russia explicitly condemn the war in Ukraine and denounce Putin as a war criminal. Then they can compete as a non-aligned athlete under a neutral flag. And no, I don't expect any to do that. Substantially all their athletes are in the military.
Well technically, Tokyo Olympics were held after the original invasion in 2014. The elite athletes being employed by military/police/some parts of state is not out of the norm since USSR days.
Who’ll refuse to compete? The athletes from those countries who trained for years for this, or their governments who won’t allow the athletes to compete?
No I’m just pointing out that it won’t make an impact. There might even be more viewers in 2024 than the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (Covid, more streaming opportunities as countries develop, more controversy etc.).
If it’s something that can actually aid, arm and fund Ukraine, sure. But a boycott of the Olympics when the Russian national athletes already aren’t allowed to compete under a flag, anthem or representing Russia, isn’t going to accomplish anything.
Yeah I’m sure cancelling the Olympics, and throwing all those athletes’ years of work down the drain, will help the Ukrainians so much. Just like my thoughts and prayers will.
