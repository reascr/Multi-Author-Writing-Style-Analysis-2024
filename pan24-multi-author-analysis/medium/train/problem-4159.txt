I dont have the stomach to visit such subs, but I wish these brave soldiers get all they need to drive the barbarian russicists putin slaves back to the shithole they came from.
Even while holding out, they are sadly suffering very heavy losses if you look at the subreddits that allow footage from both sides. Hopefully the new IFVs and tanks arrive en masse quickly to drive back all of the invading forces.
But Russians are suffering more. If Western countries were supporting Ukraine more willingly, Ukraine wouldn't have lost this much manpower and they might have had some resources to launch a counter-offensive.

Truth is probably somewhere in between. Russia mentally accepted heavy losses. The problem is Ukraine's manpower is irreplaceable. Ukraine will probably hold since Ukraine has better technology and equipment but while doing so Ukraine sustains losses.
