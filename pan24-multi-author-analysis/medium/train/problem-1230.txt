Scrolling through Reddit and seeing a post about an old friend being killed in war is a very very disturbing feeling.
Rest In Peace Skyler and thank you for your service ❤️ you were an incredibly brave and selfless man ❤️.
Skyler James Greggs, a 23-year-old from Washinon state who was interviewed by The Daily Beast after being injured in the Ukraine war, has died, his father and one of his former commanders have revealed.
Skyler’s father, Steve, and the commander have both confirmed his death to The Daily Beast. The commander, who didn’t want to include his name, told The Daily Beast that Skyler died “a hero” and that he was “a very brave, big-hearted man.”.
The commander wouldn’t say where Skyler died due to operational security, and Ukraine’s International Legion hasn’t responded to comment requests from The Daily Beast about his death.
Another contact in the Ukrainian army, who also did not want his name published, told The Daily Beast that he heard Skyler died in northeastern Ukraine, when soldiers from the International Legion came under artillery fire in the last week of October. Several were wounded in the attack.
In recent months, Ukrainian forces have carried out a counter-offensive in the north-east regions, liberating more than 300 settlements during a rapid push in September.
