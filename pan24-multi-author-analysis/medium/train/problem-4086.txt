Congress isn’t forgetting to do their job, they’re doing exactly what they’ve been told to do by right wing billionaires. The Koch brothers and others have spent decades trying to influence the curriculum of high end business schools, law schools and other influential institutions…all with the idea that if they got enough like minded people in office then they could grind the mechanisms of government to a halt, erode trust in public institutions and eventually embark on the creation of a libertarian nation. Religious people were courted to give them a temporary boost in “grass roots” popularity and I think they somewhat lost control of that part of their plan. But at the end of the day, this is all going to plan, their plan.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
