Those Russian diplomats have to lick Putin's boots somehow or they could be thrown fall out a window. They be towing the party line and churning out propaganda ya know; for that you need to have zero creativity, no credibility and no sense of humor at all. Being that much of an asshat takes decades of training and practice. Mental gymnastics at such a high level must be exhausting.
We have been tearing down russian sculptures for awhile now. The anti-russia sentiment has been in our country since, you know, that one time they tried to delete our culture too.
UN Human rights committee got a complaint as if those sculptures were on graves, ie "Lithuania is trying to desecrate graves". The sculptures are not on graves which aren't going to be touched.
I don't give two shits what Russia says. Listening to Russian diplomacy is worth my time to exactly the same extent as listening to what I flush down the toilet after a bowl of high-fibre cereal that I eat for breakfast.
You know my family in Poland tells me about how in October of 1991 they sang and danced through the streets destroying and smashing Soviet statues and spat on Soviet flags as they came down for the last time before throwing them in the garbage unceremoniously.
Then that December 26th she toasted with her friends and jeered as the tv televised the Soviet flag coming down for the last time as she said “Ah but good riddance, what a great time to be alive!”.
Only question in my mind is this: Where do you want to dispose of the ugly lumps of Soviet rocks that the Russians left on your property? I say dump that shit in the Baltic and use it to form the base of a breakwater. Poetic justice.
