It reminds me of the American mob movies where you spend all of that time with money and power, paranoid af and never able to trust.
I genuinely do not understand why anyone would want to be in a “power” position in that region, where everyone jumps out of the window with two suicide bullets in their backs.

I would say the more accurate western name would be "Robert". It has a similar meaning and while it's not as popular, it's pretty far from uncommon. (Alexander would also probably work too).
IIRC "Ivan" is the Slavic variant of "John" (it makes more sense with the intended pronunciation of ee-vahn). "Vladimir" doesn't have any direct variation with a western name, but "Robert" is a somewhat decent analog since they have the same meaning.
