The Respect for Marriage Act requires all states recognize the validity of all marriages as long as they are considered valid in the state where they were performed.
The fact that this is even up for discussion demonstrates the sad state of affairs our government is in. This is the game that politicians play. Instead of dealing with real world problems, they discuss issues that have already been to put rest. This is how they scam us.
Sorry, I did not mean it's not a real world problem. I meant that this has already been settled. Same sex marriage is equal protection under the law. We don't need to rehash laws that have already been settled by SCOTUS.
