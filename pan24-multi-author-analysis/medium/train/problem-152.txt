Much of what we’ve tried to do since WW2 is create international norms and diplomatic / economic mechanisms that can be used instead of traditional all-out warfare between large nations. In many ways it has worked, but it often looks like it’s not working because we tend to expect things to operate transparently and be taken at face value. Consider how many UN resolutions seem to go nowhere. But all that effort isn’t just being lost in the ether.
They do want this land for themselves at the end of the day and irradiating it would be pretty counter intuitive.
They are saying Ukraine is sending small groups of soldiers or special forces in Kherson right now to check things out. Will see by tomorrow how it goes.
Don't forget that as scary as a dirty bomb sounds it would be complete Russian suicide. I get the impression that they want people to think they are capable of it, like nuclear weapons.
You do realise that Kherson provides clean drinking water to Crimea right? This would be next levels cutting off your nose to spite your face.
