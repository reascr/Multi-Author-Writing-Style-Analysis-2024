Conservatives on the internet are really telling on themselves and how quick they've moved to think this somehow exonerates all anti-lgbt hate speech over the years from people they like.
It's a trend among conservative politics: it's a game of power and seats in government by peddling hate then they clutch their pearls when the very real consequences of their words and actions emerges.
So it turns out, and this is shocking I know, terrorists lie. Especially lone actor terrorists coming out of chan culture where the line between truth and trolling is perpetually non-existent.

furthermore what does it matter? Are non-binary people immune from anti-lgbtq bigotry? Is the member of any group immune from bigotry against their group? The whole conservative argument reeks of "bio-truths"-esque stereotyping.
