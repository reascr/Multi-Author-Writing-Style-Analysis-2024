>The Government of Canada will continue to be guided by science as it takes additional measures toward its zero plastic waste goal. The Government is working with provinces, territories, and industry to set an ambitious collection target of 90 percent for recycling plastic beverage bottles. It is also developing regulations to require that certain plastic packaging contain at least 50 percent recycled content and to establish clear rules for labelling recyclable and compostable plastics. Draft regulations are targeted for publication as early as fall 2023. In addition, the Government is developing a plastic registry to hold plastic producers accountable for their plastic waste.
Canada has been going through a lot lately but this is the type of thing that makes me proud of this nation, yes more steps are need and there are some sectors like medical devices were this needs more sorting out but this is some great news.
The thing with us Canucks is that we have recently discovered some skeletons in our closet yes, but we aren't trying to take them out of the closet and sweep them under the rug.
This is not only awesome, but has frankly been crucial to implement each day of the last 30 years. Better late than never.
