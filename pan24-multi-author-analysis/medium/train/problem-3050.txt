The head of the immunology society in Australia, when an Australian Scientist proposed a new function of lymphocytes, and claimed there were two groups, B cells and T cells, said (wrongly, it turns out), that the only significance of the B and T cell theory was that they were the first and last letters of the word “bullshit”.
Neanderthals and modern humans are considered separate species by most scientists because of their physical differences (skull, body shape, all of which has distinct ranges for each species) as well as their differences in behaviour. Though there was some contact between modern humans and Neanderthals (as evident by the inbreeding) for the most part, both populations lived very separate lives, both with very different manners in which they lived (in terms of group size, dietary preferences, artifacts produced etc).
We're STILL finding new things about neanderthals for example. You'd think there would be a finite amount of footprint considering how long ago they used to populate this planet. But we are now finding out that they loved to add spices/flavor to their food. Which shows they were way more intelligent than we give them credit originally.
