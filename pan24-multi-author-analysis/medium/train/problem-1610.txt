Science rests on the fact that there is no stupid question that it canâ€™t answer. Whether COVID is lab made or just a natural mutation should be equally open to investigation.
imo, this was always considered as a possibility. However, also imo, the CDC and the NIH were focused on dealing with a pandemic of an unknown virus, especially after Trump's missteps. And so let the question of origin slide by while figuring out how best to handle transmission exposure.
On a scientific forum, there were Chinese scientists in Jan 2020 who posted about covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab. That post got quickly scrubbed. Even so, if I saw it then many other scientists saw it.
Which Chinese scientists? Are they in relevant positions/fields to make sound judgments about this or are you being relayed various degrees of hearsay? If they weren't identified by name, how did you know they actually were scientists? (compared to just random people making things up).
Which other scientists saw this post you are referencing? What made it stand out to them as important? (Frankly speaking: why does it matter that you specifically saw that specific forum post? Are you qualified to take a closer look into it than any other random person across the world?) That last bit (unfortunately) has some very real energy.
