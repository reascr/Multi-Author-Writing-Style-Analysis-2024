Yes, he is the one who negotiated the Pixar, LucasArts, Marvel, and 21st Century Fox mergers into Disney before he resigned. He also has decades of experience dealing with the politicians of the states where Disney operates. I suspect he was brought back in because the previous CEO, Chapek, was extremely weak in pushing back against DeSantis' "Don't Say Gay" legislation and the threats of stripping Disney of their special governance status.
