Federal judges should absolutely know the US Constitution well, even if all sections aren't completely relevant to their rulings. But asking generic questions like "Tell me about article V" is a bad question, intentionally asked to fluster someone in a high stakes situation. I don't expect anyone to need to know the numbering of sections of the Constitution. That's more like an English teacher asking "Tell me about paragraph 9".
Kennedy actually asked much better questions to an unqualified Trump pick a few years ago. So we know he's not acting in good faith.
