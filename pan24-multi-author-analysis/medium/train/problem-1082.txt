I am not sure it is within the UN mandate to recognize or not recognize any state as a legal successor of any other. As for the individual countries, the US specifically recognized Russia as USSR successor on Dec 25, 1991. If you specifically means succession within the UN structures, there wasn't a vote indeed. Instead, the CIS members (including Ukraine) formally agreed to this, and then corresponding request from Russia was circulated among the UN members and none of them challenged it. Ukraine by the way had been a full member since the UN foundation, so it was perfectly in position to do so if it wanted to. However it was deemed convenient to let Russia deal with Soviet shit in return for certain privileges in the UNSC (which Ukraine couldn't have anyway, even if they were denied to Russia).
Though this argument makes legalistic sense, something tells me, Putin will happily rename the country back into Soviet Union. UPD: the entire UN needs a major reform, otherwise it will continue being a farce.
