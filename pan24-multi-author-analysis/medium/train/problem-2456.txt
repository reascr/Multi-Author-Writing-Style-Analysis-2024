"The number of tanks [to be sent to Ukraine] cannot be large, since Finland borders on Russia and is not part of NATO.‚Äù.
But we will definitely send tanks as soon as someone Else is also doing that. We've prepared for the excact situation, where Ukraine is now, for decades.
It's True. We can not help Ukraine with large amounts but we do have great oppoturnity to provide training, maintenance training and huge training grounds not found In many European countries.
As Long as other countrys provide same tanks. Otherwise UA need To provide maintenance training and parts and crew training also to too many different equipment.
I think even a gesture of a couple of tanks is enough. Every little bit can count and Ukraine will be forever grateful to the West once this is all over.
Well said, luckily it's been confirmed today that we'll be sending Challenger 2 tanks from the UK. Hopefully that will enable others to send more, the Challengers are main battle tanks so should make a difference even if it's a small one.
