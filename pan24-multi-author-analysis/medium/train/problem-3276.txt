Your one link is a verified source for your claims? ROFLMAO. In the US there were significantly fewer mass shootings when we had the ban. If insurers were in the loop do you think they might notice when someone buys a ton of ammunition? Or maybe they will just ignore it and pay up when the shots fly. Perhaps you should actually compare US statistics to other countries then see what laws exist in those countries that work there and will work here. Or you can make all these claims for not trying something because not trying them in the past was ineffective. Not trying is always the preference of the GOP. And apparently a lot of others.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
