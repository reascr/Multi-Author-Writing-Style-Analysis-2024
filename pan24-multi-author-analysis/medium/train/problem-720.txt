Hi FawkesHeart. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
The ALL CAPS and 'Breaking' rule is applied even when the actual title of the article is in all caps or contains the word 'Breaking'. This rule may be applied to other single word declarative and/or sensational expressions, such as 'EXCLUSIVE:' or 'HOT:'.
Your headline must be comprised only of the exact copied and pasted headline of the article, with few exceptions - ) We recommend not using the Reddit 'suggest a title' as it may not give the exact title of the article.
You are welcome to resubmit your link, but please wait 10 minutes from the original post time and follow the submissions rules listed in the sidebar. Title specific rules can be found here.
That’s a very good question and I’d like to know the answers as well. Unfortunately you’ll get no straight answer here. Also the non-conforming title is going to get this removed, as you may not realize but it’s against the rules to post and change the title.

In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
