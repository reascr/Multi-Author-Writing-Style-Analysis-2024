And your comment is just as great, great job actually highlighting the relevant differences! The Unites States has acted and continues to act genocidally against indigenous people within and outside its borders, the United States has acted and continues to act genocidally against immigrants (putting them in concentration camps since the Obama administration at least), the United States has acted and continues to act genocidally against black people (in act of intentional cultural destruction going back to slavery's foundation and continuing with black mass incarceration). The United States is playing a dangerous military game trying to empower themselves against/over the world with NATO as this Russian invasion of Ukraine plays out, and we are seeing oligarchs vs oligarchs behind the scenes as so many of the rest of us (workers, the poor, LGBT+ folk) being used to fight their wars.
And what I love, this is the best part imo, is how many people believe the nation-states or citizenship mean anything to oligarchs. They and only they are true global citizens.
It worked really well in Canada when it was used properly. Investors had to drop money into a business and run it for five years, with the intent of creating new businesses and employment. in about 25 years the diner near me has passed through the hands of four Korean families and they keep 2-4 wait staff employed.
