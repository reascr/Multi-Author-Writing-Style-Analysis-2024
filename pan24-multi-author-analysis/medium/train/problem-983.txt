They oppose ACA… Don’t want to pay for health insurance while I’m healthy. I just want there to be a hospital and staff that exists because of other’s investments so that when I do get sick someday, is affordably priced. Because others have already paid for it.. It’s literally like saying “I just want to pay the incremental unit cost of a car. I don’t want to pay for any of the R&D, any of the dealer network, any of the factory cost. I want those liberal ‘suckas’ to get stuck with those costs, I just want to pay the direct manufacture cost of my car.”.
