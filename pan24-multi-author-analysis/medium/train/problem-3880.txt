While I see some businesses distancing themselves from the lower education standards, particularly in STEM and engineering, I can also see other companies and conservative organizations flooding in to prop up these institutions. Cutting off researchers from federal funding and removing protective measures like tenure can open up opportunities for political or private interests to try to step in and influence research and curricula when faculty are faced with losing their jobs or facing litigation for their work. Religious/conservative universities are already seeing booms in enrollment due to "anti-woke" public sentiments. These institutions can become a place to go to if you want some wonky science published or to pump out students who will go on to further perpetuate the ideas they are exposed to. Media can then spin controversy and mistrust to the masses. I'd imagine there are large incentives to turn captured accredited universities into PragerU and pump out more talking heads like Jordan Peterson.
