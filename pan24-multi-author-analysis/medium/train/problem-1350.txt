North Korea? They’re not doing shit for China invading Taiwan. If they attacked ROK to offer a distraction they might occupy the attention of the US Army, but a Chinese invasion force crossing the strait was never being stopped by them anyways. And I have to think if Kim Jong Un has a single functioning neuron in his brain, he must understand that if he winds up in a situation of actually having to use his nukes instead of threatening it’s all over for him and his regime. But even then that’s not WW3 shit unless they convince China somehow the Kim dynasty was worth killing themselves over. There’s every incentive to not rock the boat and the only counter is trying to remain in China’s good graces, which they already aren’t. DPRK is more like an annoying chore to China than a serious ally they’re so committed to.
All the sides will retreat into themselves for a long long time. That many dead will take years to bury, grieve and answer for. And that much military/navy hardware lost, years to replace.
