I don’t like being fetishized. I wish white dudes would stop. I’m not exotic sex meat. I’m just a person. Literally every group of people has beautiful people. I’m only half and (usually white) men still do this. It’s not just a generic “you’re pretty” either. It’s a whole host of comments that’s creepy Othering.
I also don’t appreciate the racist/condescending/white mans burden attitude of, “oh, well, I’ve met a few of these brown savages and they might not be quite so beastly. They might even have table manners Imagine”.
They were in an inflationary recession before the Ukrainian war anyway. Them helping russia has changed nothing they were already under full sanctions.
It's refreshing to see a comment like this. We've had years of greaseballs posting grainy pictures of women in short skirts in /pics/ and saying 'look at how fuckable Iranian women were before the Ayatollahs came' and then getting tons of upvotes.
I’m really tired of people commenting about Iran when they know absolutely nothing about it or its history, culture, or politics, and have zero desire to learn. They just fill in the gaps of their ignorance with random terrible news they’ve come across, Orientalist tropes from media, and sand n-word and are shocked to discover they’re in fact regular people. I swear at least 90% of Reddit comments regarding Iran are hot garbage.
