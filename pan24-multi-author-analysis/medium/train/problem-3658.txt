In 2015, the GOP primary field was incredibly crowded, with something like a dozen on the ballot in some of the important early states, and Trump was able to divide and conquer. He also had the advantage of being seen as a Washinon outsider, and having no real political record to defend. I don't think the Republicans will make the same mistake again regarding the primaries, and Trump will have to defend himself regarding hundreds of thousands of covid deaths that could have been prevented, that January 6 insurrection, the 2022 midterm losses, and so on.
I think you are right about the party but I do believe the base will still vote for him, and if he makes it through the primaries he’s king shit again. This is the party of anything is better than a democrat. They will back trump and fox news will tell us that it’s better than Biden who has a five point plan to deconstruct America.

Oh, neat. It's time for the "Republican leaders won't support Trump," stories before he wins the nomination bc the Republican base still likes him and the "leaders" all fall in line and suck his dick. Feels like 2015 all over again.
