I reached out to the author of the paper on Twitter for an explanation. I’ll let you know what he says. I think he is netting out the impact of the energy used to make all the wind turbines and solar panels. Like, if you get 10% of the energy from renewables but your using 1/2 of that energy just to make the solar panels and wind turbines then the net benefit would be 5%. But I’ll find out.

China controls more than 1/2 of the global supply for the metals required to manufacture and store clean energy. 10% of the worlds energy supply comes from burning wood. 3% comes from wind/solar. We haven’t even been able to replace wood.
