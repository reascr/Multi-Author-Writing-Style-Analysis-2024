It's hard to get a straight answer on Russian manufacturing capabilities. Seen a bunch of back and forth on credible defense. There's an argument that small arms and ammo isn't a problem, even tanks and integrated circuits up to 80's standards. But there's other arguments saying they lost domestic capabilities they had in the Cold War, started sourcing critical parts from foreign sources, including critical manufacturing equipment so they could no longer produce domestically. Not much dissimilar to how we used to have a ton of semiconductor manufacturing here in the States and then willingly offshored the work and are now bringing it back the hard way. Also, the special sauce in advanced weapons is electronics and computers. A modern tank without the electronics is next to useless. There's also the difference of going from prototype to production. That's why they have T-14's for parades but you aren't seeing them deployed in useful numbers.
“Officers” should be a category on the daily and total losses pictographs a couple sources publish. Right next to “helicopters” and “special equipment”.
