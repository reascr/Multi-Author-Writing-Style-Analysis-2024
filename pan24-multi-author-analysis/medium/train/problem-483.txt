Did you know that the US sent 20 HIMARS to Ukraine, but according to Russia they have destroyed them all at least 6 or 7 times!
Russian Commander: "To show you the love of our dear leader, Putin himself has authorized you to use newest Russian offensive and defensive wonder weapons to fight HIMARS and Patriot system!".
LoL yup... A lot of people don't realize how old some of this tech actually is. Even though it's all been upgraded over the years, none of this stuff is from the top shelf.
The HIMARS system was developed in the mid 90's for christ's sake, and the ruzzians still have no answer for it.
It's not only that ruzzia is so far behind, it's also that our military and the rest of NATO is just so damn far ahead.
It almost seems as if ruzzians aren't fully aware of NATO's actual capabilities, but there's no way that can be the case, right? There's no way putin can be THAT deluded and his intelligence apparatus THAT incompetent... But if they are aware, then why on earth would they think they'd even have a chance in hell fighting against the west? Someone make it make sense.
