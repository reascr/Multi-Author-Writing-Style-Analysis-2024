Yeah, UNSC Army Reserves should be called up to deal with the mess. Deployment of a Spartan team would be a gross misallocation of valuable resources, some disagree though.
Exactly, NK has always been a Russian/Chinese vassal state ever since the Korean War. NK does not have the capability to manufacture the missile systems that they are demonstrating. Its a demonstration of Chinese capabilities in a way that avoids criticism of China on the world stage.
Some South Koreans do (particularly the older ones who may have family in the North, obviously), some don't... North Koreans probably do (we don't know but can assume) due to indoctrination.
But unification is opposed by all "relevant" countries (that have signed the armistice, i.e. North Korea, China, Russia, the US). Japan also opposes it (already enough competition from South Korea). They prefer a weaker divided nation and keep the status quo. Otherwise they would have let unification happen already; it's an international issue beyond the Koreas because of the agreement.
Reuniting west and east Germany was costly and there are still economical differences between east and west. Reunifying Korea will be a shitshow and could probably bankrupt better Korea.
