Honestly this was a horrible bill that allowed cops to dictate who was able to carry and how they behaved during the BLM protests this is most certainly another thing theyâ€™d abuse to oppress and arrest POCs.
I don't like the idea of police deciding who gets a permit. Seems like a spot for stupid shenanigans or racism to leak through.

I'm liberal for 2008 standards, probably considered left leaning in 2023. I reside in Oregon. I own guns. I don't like the 3 day loop hole. But they passed 114 with nothing in place. Youre required to get a permit.... I'm fine with that, but there's no permit in place or process. Ending every single gun purchase in the state for the foreseeable future. "Including to law enforcement agencies" but I doubt that...
They need to continue with the standard federal background check and not back log it. It's at 30 day wait for the background check, it used to be max 1 hour tops. Until they have the new system ready to roll.
