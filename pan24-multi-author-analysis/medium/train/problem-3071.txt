I don’t think those sorts of generalisations help anything. Yes weed should be legal, but it doesn’t have to be a competition with alcohol. Let’s just appropriately use both being aware of the risks.
i am for legalization and i have enjoyed weed sporadically. it's not a crime in my country for decades now and i supported the decision then. i disagree with the culture of "X makes everything better and if you think that life is enjoyable enough without it, it sounds like you need some".
what my comment "comes off as" is dictated more by what _weed culture_ has taught its public than by the content of my words. i would guess the response to be different if the same was said about alcohol or any other drug.
Fun fact! The purchase, possession, and consumption of cannabis in a public place in Spain is only a misdemeanour. you can get a fine and/or have it taken away. No criminal penalties. But you can legally grow your own and smoke your own in private as long as you're not growing it for sale. And in a lot of areas it's very tolerated and cops won't do shit even if you're smoking in public.
