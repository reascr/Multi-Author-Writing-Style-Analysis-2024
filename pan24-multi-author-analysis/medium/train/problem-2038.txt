One of the things I love about Democratic wave elections, and I have real difficulty finding the words to convey the sentiment, is all the first times and records we see in the headlines immediately afterwards.
I've always hoped I could get this many women excited to sit in on my big caucus, but they all say it's not the size of the caucus, it's the motion of the body.
"First gay man elected here," "First transgender woman elected there," "First Native American," "First woman of color," "First Black governor of the state," as a White guy I can't relate first hand to these victories, White folks have been represented in politics since the invention of politics, so for me this stuff is all gravy and icing, it's a cherry on top, it's a subtle sign that we're moving in the right direction, albeit not as quickly as anyone would like.
It's difficult for me to explain how I feel, it comes across sounding like I saying, to quote someone else, "I'm a woman, vote for me!" and I'm not; I care about qualifications far more than I care about skin color or wardrobe, reading the headlines about first this and first that are just add-on benefits for me, like buying a car with the highest impact safety rating and it also has that new-car smell.
