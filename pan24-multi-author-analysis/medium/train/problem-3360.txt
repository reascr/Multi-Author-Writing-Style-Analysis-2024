Feel like the world has been sliding deeper and deeper into world war since 2014. After Russia annexed Crimea, nothing in global geopolitics was the same. China became frostier and colder towards the US and the west in general and supported Russia more and more. North Korea continued testing nukes. India grew closer and closer to Russia. Donald Trump was elected President in 2016, and with the uncovering of the Russian social interference, and then TikTok, it showed how both Russia and China were and are using their technology to manipulate and attack their rivals without having to use a single soldier. Sad thing is is that it worked, the US continues to remain a polarized country that grows more and more polarized every day (fucking MTG suggested conservative states needed to ‘break away’), Democrats put Biden in power with no real plan with what to do after his time is up, etc. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the last step before a global war between powers. Scary thing is is that all of the major contenders have functioning, high-yield, hypersonic nuclear weapons (Russia, China, US, India, UK, France, and Pakistan) that will crush society in a single day.
Of course Russia has tons of resources to fuel Chinese factories, but what use would they have if China alienates its two largest customers (Europe and the US)? The Netherlands alone imported nearly twice as many Chinese goods as did all of Russia last year.
