Republicans are slimey and will try to pass some variation of a law that doesn't explicitly say "you must be 21 to vote", but will try to put in some kind of rule or something that seriously restricts anyone under 21 from voting.
Then, you'll start to see various laws similar to it pop up in republican-controlled battleground states, in hopes that any challenges will extend after the 2024 election.
Perfect example: GA's "Vigilante challenger" law they passed a year ago that allows someone to challenge a voter's eligibility without cause. It worked. 149k voters, primarily black and young, were challenged. That would have given Warnock 50%.

It sure is, but it doesn't stop Republicans from coming up with creative ways of muddying it up. I promise you, Heritage Foundation and other right-wing think tanks are coming up with ways to limit voting, or challenge the validity of youth vote.
