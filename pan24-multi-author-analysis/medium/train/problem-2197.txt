Imagine if FDR could choose the candidates for electoral institutions when he had over 60 percent approval.
Furthermore, he wants to significantly cut public funding for political parties - which favour established parties and those with money and resources. Lastly, he wants to cut media time for political parties - again favouring the parties with a lot of money and resources.
Long story short; He wants to do three things. The biggest is that he wants to abolish the non-partisan body that oversees the elections and ensure that they are free and fair. He wants this body replaced with an elected body with the same function, which would in reality put upholding the fairness of elections in his own hands.
Mexico is in the middle of a serious democratic backslide, and these electoral reforms, when passed, will in reality make Mexico into a dictatorship in all but name. In the vein of Hungary.
If there is a popular party or president they would support the candidates. Liberal democracy requires independent institutions to maintain unbiased elections.
