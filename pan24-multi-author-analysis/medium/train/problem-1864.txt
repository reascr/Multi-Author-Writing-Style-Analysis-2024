I don't really buy this. There is zero chance that Russia will start anything with China as they'd get absolutely murdered and lose half of Eastern Russia assuming things didn't escalate into something nuclear. Their only hope against in a land war against China would be if India and the US supported them.
People just simply don't care enough what's going on half way across the world if it doesn't affect them.
Currently in Thailand for the past few months and there are thousands of Russian people here. Not sure they even have any thought about what's happening in Ukraine or if there even full aware of what's going on.
Most of the usual suspects have stayed neutral, but a weird outlier has been Cambodia. While they have been considered in the Russian sphere of influence, their long-term dictator has denounced the war and has supported Ukraine with humanitarian aid including mine removal specialists. It looks like they want to keep their distance from Russia. If anyone knows what genocide is, it's Cambodia.
