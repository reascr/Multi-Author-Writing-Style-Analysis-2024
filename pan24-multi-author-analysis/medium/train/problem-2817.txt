Against Ukraine, Vietnam, Korea, and Britain, military infrastructure was not targeted. For Ukraine, Vietnam, and Korea, the issue was that the native forces wisely kept their materials moving, hidden, and far from the enemies reach. Russia would love to destroy a ton of Ukraine armor assets buuuut they can't find them or can't hit them in the window between finding and their leaving. Britain was Hitler making the bad decision that targeting civilians would result in a loss of willingness to fight. They ignored RAF bases and allowed England to recover from the heavy losses at the start. Had Germany pummeled and destroyed every airbase in England, the war would have gone very differently.
They've been pushing the narrative that it's really NATO and the US that's driving the war, not the people of Ukraine. This is a 'gotcha' moment in their eyes, even though no one is denying our involvement.
Basically it's jingoist saber rattling to drive propaganda back home. "See? See? Our eternal enemy is once again interfering with us Come Join the war effort and support Putin! He's the only one that can put them in their place".
