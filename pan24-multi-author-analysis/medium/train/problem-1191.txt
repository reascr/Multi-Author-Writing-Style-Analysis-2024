long answer: by design. The employers who rely on their labor use lobbyists to fight against immigration reform. If people were naturalized efficiently and fairly we wouldn't have desperate exploitable labor.
2) When we do set up a base, we leverage the labor of the people who are going to be housed there. Our troops are able bodied adults that have had training in following orders, are literate and have skillsets that are documented and catelogued. As a group, the migrants are nothing like that. So we'd have to truck in (and temporarily house) our own troops just to get the "migrant base" constructed.
