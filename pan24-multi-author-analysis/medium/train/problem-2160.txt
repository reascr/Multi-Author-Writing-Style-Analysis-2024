Private schools, just like religious TV networks TBN, Christian Broadcasting Network, etc get special treatment.
In the state of Arizona, the right wing legislature recently voted to give private schools public money without any oversight.
As far as the networks go they are supposed to stay out of politics but they don't and recommend people vote for people and propositions all the time.
So while you're wondering why Public Schools don't have money and the right wing is so strong, it's because your tax dollars are underwriting divisiveness.
