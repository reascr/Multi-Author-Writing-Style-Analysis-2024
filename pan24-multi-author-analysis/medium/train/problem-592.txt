Shame on France for allowing this. You just know they could do something about this but they won't, and choose to turn a blind eye. Much like illegal immigrants being employed in harsh work conditions in the Southern US.
no one is "allowing this", no one is "turning a blind eye", wtf are you talking about. Read the article (reported by a french state sponsored public news station). Also props to @OP for editorialising the title.

What's happening here in France is basically an immigration issue: people illegally cross borders into France, and end up in poor conditions, having to take jobs wherever they can, "under the table". France does not condone this, and is both actively checking worksites to combat this practice, and even the unions want these people to be regularized and paid proper wages (because if it were too easy, it would take jobs away from French people who would be outcompeted for being too pricey to employ).
