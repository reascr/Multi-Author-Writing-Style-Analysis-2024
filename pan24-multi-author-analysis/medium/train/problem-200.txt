As for blackmail, Trump apparently initiated the whole thing. Had Daniels threatened to talk unless Trump paid her, that'd be a different story--but instead, Trump offered to pay her on condition that she didn't talk. Since Trump initiated it and Daniels didn't threaten him, it's not blackmail.

The issue here is that that payment was a campaign contribution, because it was explicitly intended to prevent Daniels from saying something that could damage Trump's campaign. As a campaign contribution, Trump needed to declare it (and it was too large for an individual to contribute to a campaign anyway), and he did not.
