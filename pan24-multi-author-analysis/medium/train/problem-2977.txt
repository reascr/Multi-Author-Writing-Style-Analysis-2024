Edit: Reminder that they got Rubio to vote against his own immigration bill, that's how much they don't want anything but a stick.
As the piece notes, every time congress gets close to a deal the GOP kills it. They're purposely more interested in complaining about the broken system than taking constructive steps toward fixing it.
Very true, but even Reagan was more reasonable on immigrants than the modern party is, like with amnesty. The post 2000 crop likes to focus on hate of those "dirty foreigners" to tap those fear buttons like a gerbil on meth.

Agreed. They used to be happy using agitprop to get the rubes to votes for them, like Reagan wasn't interested in banning abortions just using it for votes, but now they have the tiger by the tail with a large base that Fox and friends keeps gaslighting. Trump even got slapped down for thinking of working with the Dems side of the isle.
Weirdly (tho not surprisingly) the fear gets stronger the further away their voters get from actually running into immigrants.
