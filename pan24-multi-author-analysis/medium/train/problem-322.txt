Or for example when Trump cleared those protesters for his little Bible photo op? Those are clear examples of violations of free speech even by their standards but that's really the thing isn't it? The right-wing/conservative/fascist view rights as things they get to wield exclusively. Even to the point of quite often pursuing agendas that pits two sides freedom against one another resulting in turning the very concept of freedom into a political battle that if one side wins over another it sets a precedent for the kind of double standards they seek. E.g The right sort of people get to have those rights and the wrong sort of people do not. There have been many examples of this throughout US history yet it is rarely ever acknowledged because to acknowledge it would mean accepting that the entire foundation is a house of cards waiting to collapse and if the right-wing feel sufficiently threatened in their dominance over power they will use what power they have left to collapse it, oh wait... they already are. Trump inciting people to an insurrection, literally saying out loud that the Constitution can essentially be overridden over false claims of fraud.
They both understand the First Amendment but nevertheless use the topic for their own political and criminal goals. That is worse.
