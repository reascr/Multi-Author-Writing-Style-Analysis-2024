Purely anecdotal, but I signed up for that email notification service that tells you what is coming that day (actually sends you a photo of the front of the envelope). It used to be 99% accurate - so 4 pieces of mail in the email, those 4 would come that day (maybe one extra piece of junk mail like a postcard or something). In the last 2 years or so, it has dropped to less than 50%. Mostly something is supposed to come and it doesn't for a few days. In the last month there has been a half dozen days where we received no mail - even though something was supposed to be delivered (as per the email). I don't really need anything (meds, etc.) and only a handful of non-regular bills come in paper form.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Issue is likely labor related I would think - and I don't think they have the flexibility to adjust pay quickly to meet market conditions.
