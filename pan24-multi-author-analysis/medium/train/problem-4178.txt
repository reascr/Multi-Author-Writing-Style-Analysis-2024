People resist because there's a cost: people have to buy insurance to get a mortgage, and it's easier to deny a problem than deal with it. At least until you flood.
Climate change is real. People can refuse to acknowledge it all they want, but I have zero sympathy for property losses due to plain stupidity.
So they're gambling, basically. Save a few bucks in the short run, or lose it all if flood damage makes the residence a total loss. That's a gamble I wouldn't take.
It's a policy which makes sense as a builder: you stop being invested in the community once you sell. Not so much as a lender, which will take losses down the road.
The article says communities are pushing FEMA to not list them as flood-risk areas, it's unclear who is speaking for these communities. Would not surprise me to learn that home builders and mortgage companies are pushing these policies.
