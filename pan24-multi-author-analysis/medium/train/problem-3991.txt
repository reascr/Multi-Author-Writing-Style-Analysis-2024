The history of individual city states (including Tenochitlan) that constituted the Aztec state was much older than 1428. But the Aztec state existed for only 93 years and it was in reality a federation between three city states (the Triple Alliance) ruled by the Mexica people rather than a centralized empire.
The Aztec Empire formed in 1428, so that was the same time Cosimo de Mexico's Florence and 107 years after the death of Dante. It was conquered and dissolved in 1521 by Cort√©s.
Same with the Incas. The Incan Empire, also a decentralized confederacy, formed in 1438 and was invaded by the Spanish in 1532, with last remnant of the Incan state conquered in 1572. The Sapa Incas first ruled Cusco starting from the early 13th century and then gradually expanded their territories until the Kingdom of Cusco gained dominance over surrounding kingdoms.
The Spanish arrived at a very interesting in history, when states were beginning to expand their borders and their adminstrative apparatuses. They were incorporating more ethnicities into their states and new cultural identities were being formed.
