The odd part being, none of Erdogan's requirements are in the actual membership requirements of NATO, which Finland and Sweden both already do meet.
Sweden has had diplomatic relations with Turkey since the 1730s. Sweden has been present in Istanbul at the same place as today since 1757. Sweden opened an embassy in Ankara in October 1934. In October 1934, Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf, Louise and Princess Ingrid visited Turkey.
Or maybe people here in Sweden just don't like wars and shit and it's worked for 200+ years, even during WW2?
Yes but I am just saying that I would be fine with it. Finland would be protected by NATO and Sweden would be Switzerland 2.0, that is surrounded by NATO countries. Someone would even need to conduct a sea or air invasion to get to Sweden (even a sea invasion may not be possible considering that Estonia and Finland could practically close the petersburg entrance into the Baltic Sea).
Sweden trained resistance fighters from Denmark, Finland and Norway during WW2, it served as a base for those to train and infiltrate back into occupied territories for sabotage missions, harassment of the Nazi armed forces, etc.
Being neutral also avoid stupidities like joining a warmonger nation into invading Afghanistan and Iraq, ask the Brits how much they enjoy having sent their youth to die for American lies .
Why don't you shut up in your complete ignorance of basic history, please? Does it hurt to be this dumb or you take pleasure in it?
