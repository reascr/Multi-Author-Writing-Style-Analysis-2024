If MAGA voters can't figure out that MAGA loses general elections, then it's hard for me to complain.
2020 Republicans picked up 14 House seats, and it can be argued that they lost the Senate thanks to the Tremendous Orange Bloviator going on, and on, and on about the stolen election; also, Trump lost the presidency all on his own, and no possible RNC chair could have made him change anything he did. Republicans maintained majorities in enough state legislatures for redistricting that you just can't call 2020 a disaster.
2022 should have been a huge win, but it wasn't, and the reason for that is more Trump than McDaniel. Without a doubt, McDaniel, McConnell and McCarthy should have done a lot more to keep Trump way the heck out of the way, but they feared Trump would tell his most avid supporters not to vote for Republican nominees in the general election. The GOP now NEEDS the MAGA vote, and they have to do whatever needs doing to keep Trump happy enough.

At this point it's probably just part of the plausibility denial game. Get the Nazi vote, don't have to be associated with the Nazi vote, all stories telling the Nazis who to vote for.
