They are just following the US lead. The US has abandon free trade years ago when American companies weren’t willing to compete any longer. And now the protectionist policy of Trump and Biden.
There’s literally thousand of Tarifs imposed on goods from outside of the euro-zone. The customs duty from goods imported into the EU makes up around 14% of the total EU budget.
Hahahaha… there’s not a single US made car that makes it into the top-15 over most sold cars. Your best bet is Tesla, but those cars come from Berlin and Shanghai.
You’re kidding right? Most of the products on the European market are American. Ford, GM, Jeep, and others have Hugh markets in Europe. P&G owns the consumer market not to mention all the tech is American. The only thing EU protects is farming and for good reason but we still import a lot more American farm products than we ship to the US.
GM exited the European market entirely in 2017 with the sale of its money-losing European business to French carmaker PSA Group.
Exactly 117.030 units sold by Ford in Germany 2022 (Jan-nov) which gives them a staggering market share of 5%.
