Ok so your maybe not the smartest person but I’ll try to explain this to you. So by the “right” I guess you lump us all into one unit that all have the same opinions. Well that’s wrong, and why do you say blame conservatives for a lunatic that kills people. You didn’t see a bunch of conservatives blaming Bernie sanders for the congressional baseball shooting even the guy said he didn’t it for the left. Also you didn’t see conservatives blame Obama for all his hate filled anti-police rhetoric when he contributed to the psychopath who killed the six Dallas police officers. So why does the left always blame conservatives when someone who probably isn’t conservative and is just a hate filled pos kills a bunch of people. It’s not right. Your wrong. Also the guy didnt have a automatic rifle. I bet you can’t even tell me the difference between full and semi auto. The point is that if you don’t have any idea what your talking about then maybe don’t say anything.
