tl;dr: he is over 60, when he was 19, where german males would have been conscripted, more or less all males actually served their year of mandatory service.
- Strict on internal security (nothing known about foreign policy, because he only served as interior minister).
While the percentage of actually serving constricts dropped significantly over the years (only around 20% of eligable males served their year of "mandatory" service) due to ease of refual (wich wich case you would serve in civil service instead) and low actual constriton rate (less than half were judged "able to serve"), Pistorius is from a generation when more or less all males would have actually served their mandatory military service, so this is not very notable.
until 1983 a conscientious objectior would have to give a written application to conscientious objection, and would have been called in personally to explain yout Objection in person and would have to "prove" that military service was incompatible with your concience and/or religion. There was a brief period in 1977 to 1978 where it was easer, and you had only to have a contract for civily service, bat the law enabling that, was ruled unconstitional.
