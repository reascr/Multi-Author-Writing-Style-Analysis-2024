Correct. It's basically impossible that something larger than a baseball and closer than halfway to the Moon can enter US airspace without our knowledge. And heck, that's probably wrong because that is based on public information from 20 years ago, so we can probably count the hairs on a gnat by now. No way 3 busses worth of balloon flying over missile silos is anything other than tracked all to hell and back.
There's about a zero chance that this information was withheld from the former president. The unwritten part of the chain of command is the "tag, you're it" portion. If you don't kick the information to the next higher rung on the command chain (and document it copiously), then if the s&\t hits the fan then you're the one left without a raincoat. So it was comically funny that all the GOP wannabe talking heads on the Sunday new shows (Sen. Rubio stands out here) who in their rush to put on makeup had not idea of the balloon incursions (multiple) during the prior administration, and were left looking like the dopes that they are.
