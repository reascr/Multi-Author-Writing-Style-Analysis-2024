The margin was actually only 13% opposed to resignation, which I suspect is a combination of blind party loyalty (his seat really does matter to the republican bottom line, which is why the leadership hasn’t turned against him), him still conning some people as a flawed sympathetic figure, some people probably liking that he plays dirty and isn’t afraid to lie, like a Trumpian thing…and some good old fashioned cognitive dissonance—when painful reality contradicts comforting belief, people can and do just choose to ignore reality, and will instead believe in whatever made up versions of reality support their beliefs. The point isn’t what exactly they’re thinking, it’s that they will arbitrarily just change their belief system to prevent it from collapsing, to the point of becoming detached from reality, rather than just being able to accept that they were a fool. We’ve seen it once or twice. Part of me is surprised it’s not higher than 13%, but this guy is pathological. He’s absolutely buried in his own lies and the poll found that the margins are fairly extreme now.
When that's your basis basically nothing is going to convince you otherwise. Every bit of evidence you are shown is just going to become more evidence of "THE LIBERAL CONSPIRACY!".
