Oh boy you haven't heard of Black Mesa! You better get it now and play it then. The levels within the Black Mesa Research Facility are amazing enough already, but then you have the complete remake of Xen which feels like a completely different game altogether, and actually makes Xen feel like a real, living world.
I will second that recommendation and add that they did a wonderful job expanding many areas of the original game while still being faithful to the story.
If you can play Half-Life 2, you can play Black Mesa. It's basically a remake on the Source engine but definitely prettier and with a bit of modification, I don't know the details.
Well HL isn't a game with motion blur settings iirc. And I've tried the fov. Games like Borderlands has fov adjustment which has been a godsend, allowing me to play for about an hour at a time without hurling.
There seems to be a discrepancy in the main flow indicators. No problem, but the power is steadily reaching unsafe levels. I hope we don't fuck this up.
Yeah but I couldn't figure out which way to go. Had to break that vent cover with the crowbar and crawl out?
It took me forever even to realize I could follow the coloured bands on the wall to get to where to go for the test chamber and such.
