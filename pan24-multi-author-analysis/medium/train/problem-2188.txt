What do you think all of the Republicans in Wash DC telegraphed the last 7 years when let Trump dissolve the Constitution & Democracy from the White House, bowing to every dictator out there and they were right next to him copying every move We are here with all of these dictators pulling wars, coups, flyby over our allies precisely because of their fanboy/fangirl behavior over every dictator on the planet Allowing everything they did including including bounties on our soldiers, attacking our allies (Kurds), attacking every non-white, LGBTQ+ group and carrying out their own coup upon their own Capitol (which directly violates the Constitution, their oath on a Bible and the 14th Amendment)! Do not come screeching here about telegraph Mr. Cancun, I let Trump trash my wife, etc. When have you ever telegraphed anything positive, helpful or heartfelt. 🇺🇸🗽⚖️🏡🗳🌍.
