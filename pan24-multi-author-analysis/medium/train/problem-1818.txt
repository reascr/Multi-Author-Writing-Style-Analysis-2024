Southern Conservatives (i.e. the GOP base) voted in nearly 100 years of Jim Crow before the left forced them to stop. The same way they were forced to stop discriminating against gay people and forced to follow all the other civil rights that have happened. If they ever had a fig leaf at all, it's the one we gave them when they started calling themselves Republicans. It's like we practically gave them a 'do-over' for rebranding themselves and we had to relearn all over again that "Wow, these really are some racist treasonous assholes." Well, like, yeah. They don't keep their Confederate flags around for nothing.
