We're no longer in a state of Pax Americana, you can only sit comfortable at the number 1 spot in the world for so long, but when rivals and enemies states start to see the cracks, they will try to set themselves up to take that spot when the opportunity shows. That why you're seeing China build up infrastructure in Africa (to exploit resources, and to, and to win African nation favor over western), and eyeing Taiwan (silicon manufacturing). That's also probably a reason for Russia's invasion which is failing hilariously, for a so called superpower (Ukraine resources, and geographical buffer zone from NATO). As for being an actual competing force against America? Not in 50 years at least, even if all opposing nations were to team up. But history repeats itself, and if America is not diligent, if will go away like all other great empires before it, but that's still decades away.
AND I DOOOOOONNNNNNT WANNNNT THE WORLD TO SEEEEE MEEEEEEEEEE CAUSE I DONT THINK THAT THEYYYYD UNDERSTANNNNNND.
China and India view each other as key threats. The minor extent China and Russia support each other is because they'd rather the US/EU aren't the only game in town. South Africa isn't a notable military power at all.
