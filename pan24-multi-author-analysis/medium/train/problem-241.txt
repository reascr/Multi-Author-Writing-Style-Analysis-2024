Absolutely. While its important to set precedent based on what he did it would at best slightly deter someone else from trying it but to think it will solve all our issues is foolish. You are correct that corruption is blatant in all our forms of government even small government. My wife thinks im nuts for thinking this but as it is so obviously bad and beyond repair in my opinion id happily see it all torn down and rebuilt. This country is only out to help the wealthy and corporations at this time and has been for a long time. It isn't and hasn't been a country by and for the people its a country by and for wealth and big business. Ill surely get hate for this but with all the bad done by the wealthy due to influences on government as well as forcing profit through corporations by gouging people for commodities Id be happy to see them all lose everything and to be honest the damage they cause due to greed is deserving of severe painful consequences.
All the people insisting that Trump will face consequences and then we will elect the right people who will fix this country are just being naive.
