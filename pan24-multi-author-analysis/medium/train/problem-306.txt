Russia/Wagner are again trying to intimidate their canon fodder from surrending to Ukrainian forces by making them think that Russia has people in Ukrainian cities to abduct and kill Russian "traitors".
Dmitry Yakushchenko surrendered to Ukrainian forces and was returned to Russian forces in a POW exchange on December 1, 2022. There are videos of him in that POW exchange so we know whatever happened to him must have happened in Russia or in parts of Ukraine under Russian occupation.
Now there is a video of Dmitry saying he was abducted in an Ukrainian city before he gets killed with a sledgehammer. We literally have video evidence of him being returned to Russia in a POW exchange so his killers forced him to lie about being abducted in an Ukrainian city.
If Russia proposing to return Ukrainian prisoners for them why do you think Ukrainians should care more about some criminal mercenaries over their own people?
And this question is irrelevant really because main premise of Russian lie is that wagnerite was abducted from Ukrainian-controlled territory (like someone would give him permission to be outside of prison or hospital before the POW exchange).
