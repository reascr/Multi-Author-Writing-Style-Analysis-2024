I actually did two summer study courses with U.S. Supreme Court Justices during law school that were incredibly interesting, so I can attest firsthand to the value of something like that; however, I also have been to lots of paid speaking engagement events with Justices or other government officials that are advertised, paid, and (hopefully) taxed as paid speaking engagements where the person gives a little 20 minute speech about whatever their particular 'schtick' is. Justice Scalia literally used to start his speeches with something like "I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about separation of powers, which is kind of my schtick." He taught one of my summer classes, and I saw him at a bunch of speaking events later as well. They look VERY similar to the law school lectures that he gave, and both had little meet-and-greet social events after where you had a few minutes to say hello to the Justice and introduce yourself. They really are the same event, but just the difference in venue and attendees from 'Law Students enrolled in the program' to 'the public at large' allows for a certain element of pay for access. It's a pretty interesting, nuanced issue honestly.

The ability to pay for access to a Supreme Court Justice isn't new, and is unlikely to go away any time soon. You'd have to outlaw any paid speaking engagement as well, because they do an absolute ton of those.
