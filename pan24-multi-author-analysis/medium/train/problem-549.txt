That being said, I feel that the Bruen decision was objectively a good decision. "May-issue" systems like New York's are broken by design, and have the effect of largely restricting ownership to the wealthy and/or well-connected. I'm all in favor of requiring a license or some kind of registration to carry a firearm in public, but if the system for issuance of that license depends on non-objective criteria then you've effectively stopped otherwise-eligible people from exercising their constitutional rights. For instance, say there's a drag queen who wants to protect themselves because of the current satanic panic over drag. In a "may-issue" state, their application may end up on the desk of an official who feels that drag is an abomination against their religion, and deny it. For another example, what if the spouse of a police officer escapes their marriage after being violently abused by their partner, and wants a firearm to protect themselves. If the permit flows through their abusers department, do you really feel that the victim will get a fair evaulation?
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
