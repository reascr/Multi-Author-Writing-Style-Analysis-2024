To use an analogy, if a ship is sinking, it is due to water flowing in. That is us, planet earth, and the water flowing in is CO2. Now, the water is flowing in through millions of dentures, some big, some so small you can not even see through. Our captain ordered us, the sailors, to start closing the smallest ones that are all over the place, big ones are to be ignored for now and the admirality shall decide how those shall be treated later on. You keep running from one to the other, while the ship needs attendance in the engine room, on the deck, the kitchen,… At the same time, group of sailors (fill any a country of your own choosing) agreed they will look like they are fixing the small ones, but at the same time, they started to rupture the ship´s hull with huge ones when having a wild party, the water is coming in so fast, it is not slightly wet in some parts of the ship anymore, but a full on titanic.
There’s no need for non-polluting alternatives to be feasible, it’s just a matter of adding an additional cost to bring pollution down to an “economically efficient” level and compensate the people. That cost is the remedy in standard legal and economic thought, as it fully internalizes all costs.
