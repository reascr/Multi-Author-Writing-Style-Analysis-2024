To me this has the same energy as group project in college, where you always have that one kid that just sits around and does nothing to contribute to the topic and then complains when people ignore him.
I found the most enlightening PBS Frontline interviews to be with Julia Ioffe. I've also seen videos of her speaking on the subject of Russia and Putin at various talks and events. You can find them on YouTube too. She writes for Puck news as well.
Bad joke aside. In German, ice = Eis. And we have an .. adult toys etc. website whose name shortened is Eis. So they went with Eis.de as website. Obviously they don’t make TV commercials promoting dildos but make some rather dual-meaning commercials and play around with the name ice (cream).
For most younger people it’s obvious what they sell because of the fun name. But pre-90 people often don’t know it and whenever my dad sees the commercial he actually gets himself some ice cream from the freezer completely unaware that they don’t even sell ice cream.
