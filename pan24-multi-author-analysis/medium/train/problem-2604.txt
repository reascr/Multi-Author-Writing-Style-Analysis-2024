From what I've read, chemical castration doesn't really lower the chance of reoffending. Rapists want power, not sexual gratification, so they will resort to objects for rape.
(I saw one documentary where a prisoner showed how women were raped with a "strap on" made from a belt and some markers or other object attached to the belt).
Edit: If you go to prison is because u stopped respecting society. Why would society keep respecting you?
Why do you say that like it's any worse to get raped if you're trans vs. not? They are not special enough to be exempt. Complain about the prison system all you want, he'll I'm there with you. But being trans doesn't make your experience with the subject any more important than everyone else.
Putting someone who identifies as a woman but has male genitalia in a male prison is the same. It's worse to pit one with a male genitalia in a woman's prison. Or do you think that they're saints and would never sin because they're trans?
Okay? There is no gaslighting. My argument is that they should go to where their genitals are. If you read to comprehend instead of argue you'd know that.
