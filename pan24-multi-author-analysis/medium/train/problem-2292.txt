The Russian dead reached about 1000 per day recently. That means 4000-5000 per day casualties (or maybe only 3000 if you trust Ukraine about how bad Russian medicine is). This is before Russia begins any big attack which would open them to casualties much much bigger than the Ukrainian ones, so it means that we may reach 10k per day within weeks or months. Even if Russia goes for a maximal 10million mobilization, that puts them at 30% total casualty rate of their young men within a year and within two would basically end the Russian nation.
There is a reason why Russia has resorted to desperate tactics - admitting openly that they interfered in the US Elections, war crimes of bombarding civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and a desperate push for all their "useful idiots" in the west to keep talking about negotiations.
If you wanna see the real numbers of casualties, you can check out Kyiv Independent on Twitter. They post Russia's daily losses everyday. Highest loss (dead or unable to fight) was at 950 () on October 30, 2022.
