This is something we only wish for Sweden. I think we still have have the highest death count of heroin addicts in the EU. Drug laws here are ridiculous. You could get sentenced to 6 month in prison for having smoked weed. No possession or anything, just being high. It's up to the courts to decide. The police can also force you to produce a urine sample or take a blood sample from you upon suspicion. The clinics you describe most probably do not exist here. You may think Sweden is progressive, and liberal, but when it comes to drug laws we live in the dark ages still.
That headline misses the “new” part of the news. Vancouver not charging people for possessing personal amounts of drugs is already how it’s worked for a long time so there’s no change there. The new thing that starts tomorrow is that the Federal government has now decriminalized this for the entire Province of British Columbia. So it’s every police force in BC other than Vancouver that’s embarking on something new.
Yes and for Vancouver too it is newly de jure decriminalized in the eyes of the law whereas yesterday was de facto decriminalized as in tolerated, not prosecuted, "blind eye turned.".
