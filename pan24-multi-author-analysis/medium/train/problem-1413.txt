He stole from the poor, and from people who also stole from the poor. So if you think about it, all that money was stolen from the poor in one way or another. Fuckin yay America.
He stole from rich ppl… thats the only time they usually care. The lesson learned from bernie madoff and from the ensuing years especially the trump years was to steal steal from the working class and poor. Unfortunately for sam bankman fried it seems that stealing from poor people still affected the rich by screwing up the market… so jail.
That was prosecuted as a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, although most of that was just the fake reported value of the hedge fund. Investors had only actually given him $18 billion and all but $4 billion was recovered.
But that was also a much more straightforward Ponzi scheme. Madoff admitted fault right away and pleaded guilty to everything with no plea deal, probably so he wouldn’t have to testify against any associates.
Still, these fraudsters rarely get the maximum sentence because they are willing to cooperate with investigators. Jordan Belfort (whose memoir was the basis for The WolfOf Wall Street) for instance only got 22 months in prison and a $110 million fine.
