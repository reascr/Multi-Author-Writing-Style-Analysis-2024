Russia collapsing would end this war easily, and might be one of the best possible outcomes in the long term. For everyone alive today this may not be the most peaceful outcome.
The USSR collapsed and ended the Cold War. This led to several wars, and there are still violent consequences today. This doesn't mean it was a bad thing, but positive change often requires a lot of pain.
Russia collapsing would be a good thing, but presents us with some very complicated challenges, and also great opportunity.
If the Russian Federation collapses what will be the borders of all the new states that could form? How do you deal with people from different ethnic groups who will find themselves on the wrong side of those borders? What are the implications for all countries currently aligned with Russia? What happens to all the nuclear/chemical weapons inside of Russia? It's impossible to know the answers to some of these questions, as well as many others that would arise.
This is not directed at anybody in particular, but some people seem to think this war will end and all will return to normal. No matter how this war ends, we are not going back to normal, so I would just urge caution.
As someone who was born in Russia, I really hope that the Russian state falls apart. They robbed their citizenry of welfare, education, and science. Now they are killing innocent Ukrainians — a truly unimaginable crime. I don’t think they will ever recover from this.
