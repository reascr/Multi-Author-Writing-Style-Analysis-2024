100% especially considering how much hospitals actually make too, it’s sad that these people with 4 year degrees are barely making more than they would working in the service industry, and I busty butt but not like those ladies and when I slack off people don’t die, so the fact that most of the time I’m making more than them is sad, (especially considering how underpaid we are as well). I finally had to call it quits after 15 years working in the restaurant business once tips dried up.

I dunno what became of it besides the dude obviously went to jail and a few people tested for it after they had to hunt everyone they could down to test them. I’m not sure but I think you can cure it once, but if it comes back your ducked? So I think everyone was fine since no one had been infected before.(I might be saying the wrong hep period I know it was the one that can be cured once though whichever that is).
