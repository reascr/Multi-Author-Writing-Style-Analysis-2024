It is an amazing sign of compassion but we can not ask Ukraine for this. I think the search and rescue teams of Ukraine are more needed where they are.
It would be another matter if Ukraine troops were coming over for some sort of training, which they can put to use immediately after return. As devastated as we are we will continue aiding Ukraine.
While it is true that Ukraine probably needs rescue workers more (not saying Turkey doesn't need rescue workers of course), Ukraine is only considering sending a fairly low number. It's more a token to demonstrate Ukrainian goodwill towards Turkey to improve/maintain relations than anything else I think.
Agreed, surely this is the occasion to show compassion towards your neighbours. Also, Ukrainian rescue units have gained valuable knowledge in digging out innocent human beings from rubble lately.
An earthquake of this magnitude is quite biblical in a way. Hopefully this pushes Erdogans hand into accepting Sweden into Nato so that we can all get the world back into a more peaceful place.
