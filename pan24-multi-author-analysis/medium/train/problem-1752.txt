It's really hard to say whether putin will accept a minor victory, just keeping the land he has now. But its definitely the case that he wants to punish Ukraine for defying him and hurting his image even if he doesn't end up taking the territory. If putin keeps any territory then you should fully expect the genocide of any Ukrainians left on that territory. It's already started with forcefully drafting Ukrainians to fight on the front lines, kidnapping children, and executing dissidents and whole villages.
I'm not sure Russia knows Russia's endgame anymore. Their original plan failed and they're now stuck in a much different war than they had anticipated.
I still don’t understand Russia’s endgame here. They’re destroying Ukraine’s electric grid so they can win the war and take the land. But then wouldn’t they have to invest a ton of resources to rebuild all the shit they’re destroying?
Their goal now may simply be to save face by not losing, weakening and destabilizing Ukraine, demonstrating Russia's ability to project military power on it's neighbors, and having some Ukrainian territory to show for it all in the end.
