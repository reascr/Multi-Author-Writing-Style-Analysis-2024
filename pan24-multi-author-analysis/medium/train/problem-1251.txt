What democrats need to be doing right now (well maybe last month) is to level with us about the future/economy and have a plan to make it better. I don’t even know if they have a plan they’re trying to sell and I pay some attention to politics. It’s just so…predictable. Things are bad, so try and deflect it on something bad about other party did.
Most Americans want to put this sedation thing behind them. It’s just like anything negative. Bringing back something shitty from the past has never won elections. Especially from democrats.
In general I agree, I think we do need to relentlessly shit on Republicans for their borderline(?) criminality, but their supporters are probably already convinced that Obama and Biden are somehow involved in some kind of baby-eating cult or something, so this messaging isn't going to get through to them anyway.
