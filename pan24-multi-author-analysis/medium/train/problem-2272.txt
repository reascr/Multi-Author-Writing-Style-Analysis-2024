The GOP and Fox News and their white supremacist Christian followers are protesting science facts, historical facts, economic facts.
All the facts of life disagree with the GOP white supremacist Christian ideology from global warming science to abortion to medical science.
I think the GOP and Fox is as full of horseshit as you are, blindly painting large swathes of human individuals with such a broad brush. The public school system is an absolute joke, and the dept of edu has succeeded in the dumbing down of our youth who otherwise might have had a bright future.
Yes, they just act entirely of their own volition, have certainly not been directed by the executive nor had budgets fucked with by the legislative, just 'dumbing down youth' on their own, never any Republicans involved in trying to destroy the entire concept of a public education system.
