It's just so weird to me... Russians think that Ukraine has always been a part of Russia, but it was only annexed by Lenin in 1922. And if you go back far enough, the Rus people are from contemporary Ukraine (Kiev). Russia exists because of Ukraine and not the other way around. Their current justification is that Ukraine has a lot of ethnic Russians who want the territory they live in to be controlled by Russia again, but the only reason why that is is because Russia committed genocide and sent ethnic Russians there to replace Ukrainians. And by some of the same methods we are seeing now, annex territory and kill civilians, kidnap the population (especially the children) and send them to Russia to be adopted, and send the adults to Siberia. I can theoretically understand their issue with NATO expansion, but their government is the one to blame for it.
I got my hopes up that I had missed a headline about Putin tragically falling down multiple flights of stairs and then shooting himself three times in the back of the head.
