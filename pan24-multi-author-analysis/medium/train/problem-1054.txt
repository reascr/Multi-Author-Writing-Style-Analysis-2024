This dispute is a good thing. The inflation reduction act is a massive investment in decarbonizing the U.S. economy with long term goals. As part of those investments many of the subsidies require materials to be sourced or produced within the US. This has made lots of eu companies interested in investing in the us to take advantage of those subsidies.
Eu leaders are worried that this will result in losses in domestic production. It’s not eu companies losing out that leaders are worried about, it’s eu workers. In a better world the eu would also pass a directive followed by national governments to match us domestic investments. Then we would get a boost everywhere in technology to decabonize around the western world.
It’s really not that weird that the us subsidies like this contain local production requirements. That is wildly common around the world.
The US can do what they want. And the EU can also do what they want. In this case the EU tells the US that they would respond with also protecting their own economy against American products.
However maybe the US reconsiders if they make an exception for the EU in return for the EU also not sanctioning American products. Would be beneficial for both sides. There are surprisingly few real democracies in the world. Maybe they should stick together. Otherwise the winner would be the dictatorships of the world.
It simply is a warning. The US can do what they want. Germany is simply warning the US that the EU will implement counter measures against the US. It is entirely up to the US if they want to do it anyway.
