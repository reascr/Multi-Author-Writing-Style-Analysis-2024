If you can afford to, reinforce your door frame with 6" screws to the studs and buy a beefy deadbolt for all of your exterior doors. Think about upgrading your exterior and fallback bedroom door to a steel security door. Consider installing a security system. Get a couple weeks worth of non-perishable food and clean water together (1 gallon per day per person in your home). Talk to your like minded neighbors about mutual aid for all sorts of potential hard times like storms, power outages, or wildfires; Know your neighbor's names and develop a friendly rapport with them. This is also just good for life in a country with so many natural disasters.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
