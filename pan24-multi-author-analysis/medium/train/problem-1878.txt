if this level was maintained for 12 months, Russia would have 300 billion dollars budget deficit ,or around 16% of GDP.
that's a higher share than the US goverment deficit during the 2020 corona pandemic,and that was an exceptional year.
Assuming the current level of deficit spending continues they’ll either have to raise taxes or print money. Both options are very bad for the Russian economy.
They can just start paying the population in bread, lard and 100g of vodka a day to produce war machines. Everyone who still remains in Russia will totally be ok with it. Not many people in the west can really grasp this fact.
How long will they keep support Putin when his war is causing them to suffer? When they could be called to the front lines at any time?
For how long? Ukraine was supposed to be a pipsqueak that would be conquered in a 3-day “special military operation”. If you forgot to check the news over a weekend, it would be over before you knew anything had even happened.
Now it turns out to be a major quagmire that is causing forced mobilisations and significantly reduced living standards for those who remain. It’s a completely different proposition.
