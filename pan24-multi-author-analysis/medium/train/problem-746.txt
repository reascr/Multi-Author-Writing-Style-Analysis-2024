Had the kids cough meds just a few days ago with Indian manufacturers using anti freeze to safe a penny or so per dose. Those pennies add up but so do the dead kids.
I don't understand this. If you want to be a complete piece of human garbage and water down medicine...
Indian needs to absolutely police it's drug industry better. If it gets a reputation for poor quality it will go the way of Chinese baby formula companies.
In this specific case, the onus of enforcement was on FDA in US as the company in question only had an export license and did not produce in the Indian market, leading to it not being checked by Indian authorities (medical ones especially).
At the end of the day it will only take a few more of these cases and India can forget ever exporting drugs to the west.
What the solution should be instead is that US drug agencies should investigate incoming drugs from India.
They already do have factory compliance and investigations here from US agencies (at least those companies which go by the book).
India exports drugs to the world, it's not just the USA. Lots of smaller poorer nations can't afford to test every drug and its not j6st a once off.
The previous case just a few days ago was children cough medicine using anti freeze killing kids across many countries.
