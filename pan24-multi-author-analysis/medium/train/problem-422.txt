It did matter... We needed Congress to pass the Authorization to use Military Force in Iraq to go after Saddam and Iraq. The US military intervention in Libya was authorized by a UN Security Council resolution and a Senate ratification of the intervention, and compliance with the War Powers Act.
Because if MBS is denied immunity, the family of Khashoggi will get a money judgment against him and then be able to use the US Marshals or local law enforcement to seize assets owned by MBS, force him to attend depositions, and subject him to contempt and jail if he refuses to participate in the US Courts. If this is allowed to happen, this single private US citizen/resident US is restricting the US Government to engage in diplomacy with Saudi Arabia.
The family deserves justice, money, a finding of guilt, all of it, but they can't have it here through the US Courts. Its harsh, but they're just not as important as maintaining direct diplomacy between the US government and other sovereigns.
