I know of some places in Australia that in my lifetime where in 10 years of drought with 1 year of good rain with another 8-10 years of drought.
I saw a climate model that predicted ungodly amounts of lake effect snow due to climate change. Like what happened in Buffalo this year will be the new norm. Especially when the great lakes dont freeze over.
Southern Ontario checking in. We still have no snow on the ground. Rain tomorrow. Itâ€™s like full winter got cancelled in favour of a long late autumn.
Where I live in Canada, this time of year we're usually enduring temperatures of around -30C (-22F). The last few days has been hovering around -10C (14F).
That's not drought, that's one wetter than normal year, with rainfall that is probably either the new norm or the norm that we just got statistically lucky with wetter years for a while when we settled.
100% climate change is increasing variability . Where I live every year is hotter, but every weather event seems to be a once in a lifetime event.
There was a study of old growth tree rings that were found in Australia that suggests we are in a wetter than normal period. Which is scary considering they seem to be always talking about drought. There have been periods where droughts lasted 30 years.
The definition of drought is a period of below average rainfall...so in reality the long term average rainfall is just a lot lower than they thought.
