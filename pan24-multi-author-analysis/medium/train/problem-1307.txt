The people who are coming out against Trump now are showing us who they really are. They stood by him through the lies and nepotism of the early days of his administration. They defended him after the Muller report was released and after he tried to pressure President Zelenskyy into a launching a bogus investigation into Hunter Biden. They failed to raise the alarm as he completely botched the COVID-19 response at the cost of countless American lives. They failed to take action when he was poltting to overthrough the government right in front of them. Finall, they defended him again after his attempted coup failed. What made them change their minds was not all of the terrible and dangerous things he did. It was that he is no longer as useful for gaining and holding onto power. They don't care about us or the country. They just care about power.
