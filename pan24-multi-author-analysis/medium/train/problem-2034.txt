This isn’t the first time she’s talked about the 5-year voting ban thing. Aside from it being super dumb and very unconstitutional, is there any evidence of red states/cities starting to vote blue because of influx of people from blue states? Like, didn’t Florida get an influx of people over the past couple years and now it’s more red than before? Isn’t it true that some people are attracted to move to a certain state in part because the state’s politics? It just seems like a meaningless “let’s stick it to people” thing rather than having any clear goal. Really seems like she isn’t thinking this one through (as if she had a functioning brain at all).
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
