The unfortunate truth is that once you feel desperate enough, you and your countrymen will see/feel that such prices are worth the cost of change. I don’t say that to dismiss how incredibly unjust and evil the forcing of such a decision is, but I do say it to emphasize how this conflict is not going to stop until the Russian people decide to do put an end to it. If you truly care about your family and the future of your community (which I genuinely believe you, as most if not all Russians, do) I would suggest seriously doing absolutely everything you can to convince people that things are going to get exponentially worse for the people of the country and to stop the journey on the path your country is going down. The only other option is to flee what is quickly proving itself to be a failed state. If neither of those options are “possible” for you, then I suppose you can just resign yourself to your fate and accept whatever comes from either the regime or some other group of fascist bullies that push people, like yourself, around.
When Russia purposefully kidnaps children and has them rush adopted by Russian people(among other atrocities), yeah I’d say that’s a pretty apt comparison.
I feel like a lot of people excuse that as just the sort of thing that happens during war while conveniently ignoring the fact that one side can stop whenever they want and the other can't.
