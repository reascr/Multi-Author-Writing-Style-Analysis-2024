“In order for a Constitutional Convention to be approved, 34 states would need to back the measure. Currently, 19 GOP states have joined the conservative movement headed by the nonprofit Convention of States, with four of those joining in 2022 alone.”.
A constitutional convention has nothing to do with either house. It requires 2/3 of state legislatures to call for a convention.
I don’t think you understand that the requirement for the 2/3 majority of both houses is nullified when a constitutional convention is held. Per the constitution, the OTHER way to pass an amendment is to have a convention of states (know as a second constitutional convention). Then each state’s legislature can vote up or down amendments directly or the constitutional convention can call for state conventions to vote up or down amendments. So the states can vote on amendments directly, thus bypassing the US House and US Senate’s need for approval.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Being a representative of the state is in the Constitution. A state cannot make additional requirements on US representatives.
And another thing to keep in mind is that the last time we had a constitutional convention we just wrote a new governing document and went from using the the Articles of Confederation to writing and using the new Constitution.
