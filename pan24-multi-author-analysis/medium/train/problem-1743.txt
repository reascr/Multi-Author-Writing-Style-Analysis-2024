Remember: Bad faith is the entire purpose of public Russian discourse right now. That's the whole point. The statements made are specifically intended to be outrageous. It's a tactic that Russia, and those who've been coopted by Russia, have been using for a while now -- it's a diversionary tactic designed to steal your attention from what's actually happening and getting you to focus on the absurd positions they take and defend. It's a strategy designed to be infuriating and exhausting and fatiguing; like a river of shit that slowly wears down a stone.
Including those who voted for cowardly fucking Republicans who have been trying to hamstring USA help for Ukraine. They have access to military intelligence and KNOW what Russia is doing.
Part of what grates my nerves is that you are capable of realizing that and are just brushing off genocide as an inconvenience to your life.
Everyone human being, every president, and every dictator should be held to account for their actions.
They’re all equally corrupt and monstrous. And the main drive in the US today to support Ukraine is not borne out of purely egalitarian or moral reasons. But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s important support that’s being given to a people in desperate need.
