On the attack, besieging the civilian city is low and a last resort. On defense when the city is mostly empty of civilians and is the chosen encampment of the enemy, siege is how you both win and protect your own forces. Starve them out and accept their surrender.
This could be a bind for Ukraine, since the most logical approach would be to starve the Russians out once they dig in - but if Ukraine does this, they'd also be starving out their own civilians remaining in the area. From what I understand, most of Russia's remaining "good" army units (desant, marines, etc) are in or near Kherson, so this could be a "battle of the dead-enders." OTOH the Russians have also plowed mobiks into the Kherson front, and it may well be these bullet sponges that the Russians plan to sacrifice in order to let their remaining elite units get out.
Thunder run needs a massive advantage in quality and quantity of armor, so not gonna work here. It worked in kharkiv oblast because there was a lot of open terrain and low density of russian soldiers.
It appeared as though you were talking about kherson itself. Which would not work. Kherson oblast would still not work as well as it did in the east, but would be theoretically possible.
