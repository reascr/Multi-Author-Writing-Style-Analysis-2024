Careful and objective reporting on their own case would confuse the shit out of their viewers and potentially alienate them. Sober and rational thinking is not FoxNews' brand image and what their viewers have become accustomed to. It's also really bad news for Fox, so why tarnish the image even further or position themselves into even greater legal jeopardy?
This Fox decision just shows that the Fox network KNOWS it's reportorial reputation isn't worth shit.
Honestly, avoidance on this one is their best strategy. If this anchor wants to demonstrate some journalistic integrity, too late and time to move along.
I wanna shit on Fox, but "don't fucking talk about the lawsuit you're named in" is 100% appropriate.
