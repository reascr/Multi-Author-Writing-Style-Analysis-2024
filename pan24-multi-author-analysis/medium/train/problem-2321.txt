In general that's true but my impression for several months now has been that even the other oligarchs want the war to stop at this point. I could be misunderstanding but lately it sounds like nobody in Russia, not even the government, is still all in on this bullshit. I had assumed that was why people kept falling down stairs and shit.
IMO the most likely outcome is that someone kills Putin just to stop this nonsense. I'm actually surprised it hasn't happened yet.
I mean one person can't run a gov't. Like he has to have some connect to the rest of the world somehow. I know he's got a bunker he stays in sometimes but someone has to at least bring him food. As time has gone on the side that agrees with him has gotten smaller and the side that thinks he's a fucking moron keeps getting bigger. What happens when the guy who puts gas in his diesel generator finally decides he's as stupid as everyone thinks?
You'd be suprised how depoliticized the general russian population is. They're only now slowly start to wake up now that their fathers and husbands are being conscripted to die in a war they didn't ask for.
