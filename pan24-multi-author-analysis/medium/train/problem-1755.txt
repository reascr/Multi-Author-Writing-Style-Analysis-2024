Its either that or shutoff wells.. and thats a much worse alternative. so sell at a steep discount. The problem is that the infrastructure is skewed to EU. so RU is stuck putting this oil on boats.. there arent enough boats in the world for them to ship the volumes they were piping into EU. So its more expensive to move AND cheaper to buy from them.. Theyre getting fucked; plus the cost cap now (which may still be subject to discounts) which is being enforced on the insurance side, basically you cant dock your ship because its not insured so you cant offload the oil unless you can prove that it was at the cost cap. No one wants to risk an ExxonValdez with no insurance, risk is too high.
It’s not semantics. If you want to get oil from the Gulf, you are probably going to get a tanker out of Jabail. That’s 400km and a trip through the strait of Hormuz. That’s certainly a bit more than “next to”, don’t you think.
Either you sell to me at a significant discount, or I'll go buy elsewhere too, leaving you broke and unable to afford food.
If your livelihood relies on the sale of one product, and all your other customers are now refusing to purchase from you, then that puts me into a great bargaining position.
