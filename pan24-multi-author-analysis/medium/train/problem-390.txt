I call the republicans a communist cult. Liberals like to tell me I’m wrong.Every week another piece of information drops showing the republicans and commie Russia working in lock step. While republicans turn our country into Russia liberals will still be saying but Russia isn’t communist The republicans aren’t communists I need to be nice to actual communists on the left. Fuck you I call them commies. They are a modern communist cult. It’s messaging that works. I’ve tried on republicans to their face. It shuts down so much of their bullshit. Calling them fascists does not work. They don’t even know what the word means. Calling them Nazis seems like an over reach right now and people thing you are over exaggerating. Commies. Nice short sweet Americans fear it and it happens to be true.
