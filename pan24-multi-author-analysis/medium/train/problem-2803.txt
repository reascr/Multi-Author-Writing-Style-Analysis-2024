Honestly, them sending this material via mail with apparently no precautions is more a damning indictment of her own staff's incompetence than evidence of any nefarious plot cooked up by their own fevered imaginations.
I have to assume that this is a manufactured outrage. Otherwise, why would they be sending contributions and sensitive donor information via mail rather than electronically which is both easier and, more importantly, much more secure?
What is it a handful of postal workers only targeting her and sitting in the warehouse someplace ripping open a few hundred envelops with only her name on it?... bs...
I'm sure it was those rascally Dems. They both incompetent and all powerful at the same time I hear.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
So two donors (maybe a few more) sent 20K to her? Thought there was a limit us peon's (not wealthy) can donate to a campaign. Say on average these could have been $1,000 donations (20 of them). That would mean 20 idiots sent large amounts of untraceable cash (or cashier checks) through the mail... instead of paypal, vimeo or cred card payments??? What a bunch of morons....
This smells funny beyond belief - the math does not add up. That number of people all sending checks in the nail. And they said it was 4-5 times with 3 of them happening in a single occurrence.
