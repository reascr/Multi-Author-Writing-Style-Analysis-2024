The second group tends to suffer more from the psychology and poison of ethnonationalism I mentioned above; they are usually first generation immigrants or grew up in a very culturally conservative family. These people tend to identify much more with their country of origin, and in some cases not just culturally, but politically as well. Unlike the first group, the people in the second group tend to be less culturally assimilated, and care about different issues. On surface, they also complain about issues such as racism and not being able to fit in, but the specific issues they concern themselves with and particular positions they take can be very different from the first group. I know Chinese Americans who are very supportive of PRC/CCP while being very anti Taiwanese independence and Hong Kong autonomy, and they consume most of their news from Chinese sources. Their values range from skepticism to outright rejection of the civic and culture values of the US, and are much sympathetic towards the narrative and political positions of the PRC. When they decry racism and intolerance, they are mostly affected by the fact that they live in a country that doesn't fit thier worldview and value system.
Maybe some of these students need a crash course in basic rights and rule of law before being allowed entry in to any Western country for any reason.
