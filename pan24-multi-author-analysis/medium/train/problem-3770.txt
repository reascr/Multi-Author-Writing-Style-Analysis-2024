What makes you think that the NHS chose your option. It does not say that they did it at the expense of helping the many. It also states that the NHS worked out a substantial discount on the meds so it could be used for other kids like the one mentioned. The deal is the NHS is not US medical care. It serves ALL their people, not just the rich or those who can afford it. This was not done at the expense of the many.
That was a rough read. I can not imagine what that must feel like for those parents, and I'm so sorry and happy for them at the same time.
May the UK thrive and prosper for it's National Health Service to it's people. I hope it's not too long before the US gets with the program. Without our health, we are next to nothing.
Yay for the NHS! I read about this earlier, didn't they negotiate with the company to provide it at a discount?
Screening for this condition should be routine now that a one-dose fix exists, especially since we know the window in which it needs to be administered. Nobody should have to lose a child this way. That's absolutely heartbreaking!
