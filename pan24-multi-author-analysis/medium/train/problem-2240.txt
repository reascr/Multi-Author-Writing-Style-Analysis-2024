the amount of money that actually gets back to them is miniscule, you're basically saying that you're going to cut off the money those people make which they kinda need to buy food and pay rent and utilities possibly resulting in them starving to death is a small price to pay for russia's political leaders to get slightly less money, the only money that russia can get from those funds would be in taxes, or the slight amount of money that they get from purchases of like fucking bread at the local market run by political leaders in their own country, thats so miniscule. and the whole reason we're doing this is because somebody had a slightly political view on a war. let people have their opinions without having funds cut from them.
I don't even care. My MIL was saying recently how nice St. Petersburg is and that once this is all over I have to go there, but honestly I have absoulely no desire whatsoever to have anything to do with russia. There are enough other nice places in the world.
Good! The amount of obvious spam Chinese accounts praising Putin is insane. China doesn't help Russia's military over the war in Ukraine but it does conduct propaganda campaigns for Russia.
