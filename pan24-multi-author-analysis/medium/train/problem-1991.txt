But it's also true a lot of homes are being flipped or held as speculative investments, with estimates showing as many as 1 out of 5 homes is an investment property, and I'd be willing to bet a lot of those are concentrated in the cities where we see foreign students with zero income somehow owning multi-million dollar homes.
definitely how much free supply is available for purchase is a factor for house prices which pushes up rents since the two figures are corollated. However, supply is still the big culprit since even if investors owned all the supply, more supply would mean more competition in the rental market and investors would be forced to take a lower rent per unit. so at the end of the day the make up of the investor vs owner occupier is still less of a price pressure on rents than number of units.
Many investors don't rent. Renting is really risky and managing a rental property is a lot of work. They will just buy a home that's much larger than what they need or buy a second home and stick a family member in it.
