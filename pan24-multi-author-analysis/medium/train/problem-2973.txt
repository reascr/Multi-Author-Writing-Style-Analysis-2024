Reparations for the next generation of Ukrainians. Denuclearization. Demilitarized zone along the border with Ukraine. Overhaul of Russian education system. Return of kidnapped children.

Before anyone can look past Russia's atrocities and move on, Russia will have to develop a civilized society that respects freedom and life. This alone will take many generations and that's even if they can buck the trend of going from tyrannic regime to tyrannic regime, which is unlikely.
So... the parts where most of the wealth is concentrated and thus where most of the geopolitical power is concentrated? Seems close enough to a "the world" to me in that regard since that group is generally who controls where the world goes.
Yes, china, japan, Korea, Brazil and many other countries exist and have wealth and influence on the world. I said most, not all. It would be hard to argue north America and Europe don't dominate the world's geopolitical sphere though.
