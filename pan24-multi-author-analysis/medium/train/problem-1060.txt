No it's the classic pot meets kettle.It would be a deflection if I was arguing for China to be not held accountable.
The US is the one criticizing China here. So it's fair to examine the US in a similar context. An equivalent of what's happening here would be Russia/China/Iran criticizing human rights violations in a country, someone criticizing R/C/I for the hypocrisy and then someone saying ah the classic 'BUT THE R/C/I' deflection.
US makes claim about Chinese fishing vessels invading territorial waters of other countries and do bottom trawling.
US invades other countries on false pretences and loots resources, while killing hundreds of thousands of innocent citizens.
Hypocrisy is the practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for which one criticizes another or the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform. In moral psychology, it is the failure to follow one's own expressed moral rules and principles. - from Wikipedia.
Not meant to justify or excuse it. But no way should US criticise and not expect some justification for their actions as well. As a matter of fact, the best thing the US could do is stop playing world police, accept some accountability for its own actions also for once and become a signatory of the ICC so the victims of its war crimes/resource lootings can be given justice.
If you think criticism should only be levied by someone who has an entirely clean slate, then we'd have no criticism of anything anywhere.
And your specific point being? The USA has invaded territories under false pretences and stole their oil, wreaking total havoc far worse than some fisherman bottom trawling the whole place. US companies have littered space with their satellites, which hinder astronomy everywhere. And then has the gall to sanction countries.
