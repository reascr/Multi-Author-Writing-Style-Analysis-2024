I strongly suspect Option A. I've seen reports that there was an unnamed "political advisor" present at this dinner who Trump claimed to not have really interacted with in years. So an old school (presumably) GOP operative is present - most likely the fixer of this meeting.. why? Fuentes didn't just show up like Trump said. Trump might not have known the exact details of Kanye's +1, but he's still a recent former POTUS, a declared 2024 presidential candidate, and is within an inch of being indicted on federal and state charges. No fucking chance the Secret Service isn't screening who's allowed near him well in advance, and also no chance the FBI isn't surveilling Trump, his family and their closest cronies. In fact I swear I read a NYT piece that one of the informants in the classified papers raids was a Secret Service agent on his detail.
