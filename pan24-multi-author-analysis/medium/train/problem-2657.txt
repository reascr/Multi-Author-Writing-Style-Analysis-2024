The anti-abortion movement was never pro-life, and always at its rotten roots about racism, misogyny, and white supremacy. Now, having finally succeeded in repealing Roe, it cannot survive its own broken logic.
Why don't the red states just get honest and include a stoning arena as part of local rodeos? "Silenced" conservatives addicted to bottomless rage can cleanse God's fave country of these demonic Jezebels up close and in person if they are so upset by a potential baby never being born to take government handouts and steal their hard-earned tax dollars. Eat a corn dog, watch the bull rides, and kill a witch with the whole family!
