Look…yes, Santos is a liar, and most of the GOP are horrible. They are only about political theater and brand exposure. They say shocking things because it garners a reaction from both sides. They don’t care to pass any meaningful legislation, & are solely beholden to their campaign financera…Sorry, if I wish the Dems didn’t stoop to their level of performative politics, ignore the ridiculous antics, and just focused on crafting a proper message to resonate with the people. This tit for tat BS does absolutely nothing and is only for twitter & tik tok views.
