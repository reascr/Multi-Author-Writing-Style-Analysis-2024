In the long (actually, even short-to-medium) term, this creates a debt spiral and further contributes to runaway inflation (because more and more borrowed cash is competing for the same investment resources, driving up their prices.).
As painful as rate hikes are, how can it be sustainable for fed rates to be below inflation? Doesn't that create an incentive for people (and corporations) to borrow money and invest it in absolutely anything they can, because they know they'll pay less in borrowing costs than whatever they invested in grew by, even if it only grew at inflation rates (making it a virtually zero-risk investment?).
1. Interest rates don't need to be above to current inflation rate to drop inflation. This is a myth that is for whatever reason still pushed by some economists.
Technically inflation in the US hasn’t been dropping, but the RATE of inflation has been dropping. This seems like semantics but it’s a very important difference.
Raising rates slows investment which can throw you into a recession if taken too far. How far is too far? If you can figure that out then publish and retire wealthy. The economy isn't a simple predictable machine and only politicians try to talk as if it is.
