That's cool of Heinz and all, but after having spent a month lost at sea surviving on ketchup, he probably wants a new boat about as bad as he wants another bottle of ketchup.
I believe when they offered him a boat he told them to "shove it up their ass" as he is never getting on a boat again. It almost killed him the last time.
Maybe I’m being pedantic...but I’m pretty sure he didn’t survive because of the condiments (saying he survived on them implies this). He would have been starving since the condiments would not be enough to sustain him, people can go a month without food, it just happened he had condiments which gave him a small thing to consume while he was starving. So, the ketchup company is just using this as marketing opportunity. This guy survived on his own and they are spinning it as their product is the reason he survived.
I don’t think you can get all the hydration you require from condiments. If so, this guy was sailing with a lot of condiments and sure I could see that amount sustaining him if that’s actually how much that was on board.
He had to get water from somewhere and unless he had a way to desalinate sea water and they failed to report other beverages he consumed, it seems logical.
