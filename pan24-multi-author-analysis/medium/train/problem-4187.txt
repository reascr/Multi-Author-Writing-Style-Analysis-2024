There are not enough people that realize this. Go on right wing media, the radio waves, etc and you will hear that for DECADES this has been the case. Where do people think "both sides" even came from, it's why the message gets pushed to begin with. It shields their viewers, party and voters from accepting criminal activity from their group because they have been conditioned to believe that criminal activity is equal on the opposite side of the political aisle. So when they see only their side being punished, well to them that's not something they have to accept at all, if it's not happening to the Liberals, then that's a coup!
