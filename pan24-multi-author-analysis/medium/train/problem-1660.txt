I would assume the point of excluding Biden from the "planning" would be to conceal the absolute lack of planning from people who actually know what they're doing.
I remember reading about it at the time, it continued through the transition and significantly delayed Biden’s Covid team. People were livid about it. It wasn’t just meetings, they weren’t allowing any communication between incoming and outgoing staff. It was chaos taking over blind.
That’s right. I think the Trump admin also said there were reserves but when the Biden team finally took over they discovered there were no federal vaccine reserves left and there had been no plan to replenish them.
Also, once they got access, they discovered a chaotic inadequate system for distributing vaccines,if I remember correctly, which Trump had been lying about.
