The problem I see though, is that no country is going to realistically want to feed into mass hysteria and escalate a nuclear war into doomsday, even after a nuclear strike was made. Putin isn't willing to start a nuclear war with the West, he'd be ended for sure, but are you sure he isn't willing to strike Ukraine and catch the West on a bluff that they'd end life as we know it over a single incident? If things get bad enough then that may be the only card he'd have left to try and turn things around with.
The nazis failed for much the same reason. Not enough supply to keep offensive pressure, which allowed the russians to collect power and strike back. The Soviets also hugely outproduced the nazis, meaning the war became more and more lopsided after barbarossa stalled.
Napoleon's invasion failed in large part because he didn't have the supply lines to support his invasion and the russians fought a smart war, burning land behind them as they drew back and let napoleon's initially superior force give chase. They also engaged in partisan warfare and harried foraging parties.
