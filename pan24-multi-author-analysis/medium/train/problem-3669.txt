My point is that his constituents are out there making an effort. I live in the district directly south of Santos’s, and I wrote to my own rep (also Republican) asking him to denounce Santos and his lies, his criminal history, and his behavior since being elected. I did not vote for him, but at least I can say my rep was an NYPD detective, so he has actually personally been affected by 9/11, or at least knows a lot of people who have. I imagine he’s not too impressed by Santos, and the people of Nassau County deserve to hear that he is against antisemitism, white supremacy, and the rest of Santos’s bullshit.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
