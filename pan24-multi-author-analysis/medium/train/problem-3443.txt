For instance, I am watching a show called FBI which started out pretty interesting but now almost every episode is about LEFT wing extremists threatening right wing politicians or threatening to blow up buildings etc. Or how they PRETEND to be right wing but are actually LEFT wing extremists. It is ALL fantasy. The numbers show that most extremists are right wing and yet tv shows are continuing the propaganda.
