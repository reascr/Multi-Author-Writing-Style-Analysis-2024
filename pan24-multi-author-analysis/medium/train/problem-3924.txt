I honestly doubt you would actually skip it. I mean if you even remotely follow football, you’ll eventually be overwhelmed and give in because everyone’s gonna be hyped and talking about it. You’re seriously gonna miss it because it’s winter? I understand trying to stand up against corruption but it’s futile in this case.
The fact that both 2018 and 2022 competitions were awarded at the same time also made it possible for them to cooperate. Russia's sphere of influence voted on Qatar and vice versa.
I wonder how long time it will take for the World Cup to recuperate from this. Football is hugely conservative and the fact that it's now played during winter have really decimated the interest as far as I can tell. Also hardly any fans can get there, the atmosphere will surely be terrible.
The World Cup will be popular no matter what. The audience is just too large. You have millions and millions of people desperately trying to get tickets. This is why FIFA can do whatever they want and still not lose support from fans. This is also Messi and Ronaldo’s last World Cup.
At the end of the day, people don’t really care about this shit otherwise Fifa would’ve died years ago. No cares if it’s corrupt as long as they provide entertainment to fans.
