Long story short... Our latest Prime minister is an oligarch worth £750m who, despite having no history in politics, got the candidacy one of the safest conservative seats in the UK (been conservative, or their precursor 'unionist party' for almost 200 years straight) just 7 years ago after making a big donation to the party. He became an undersecretary within 2 years, then chancellor of the exchequer just over 2 years after that, and then prime minister just over two years after that (despite his wife living here full time and abusing a "non-domiciled" tax loophole to dodge £20m tax while he was in charge of the economy).
Given that we've had 30% of our post WW2 prime ministers in just the last 6 years, I'm not much surprised that foreigners don't know what's happening... It's a shitshow.
those prisoners dont' want to leave though, they are fine with living like bums and raping and torturing neighbours. even russians living abroad and are safe, to show that russia is not all like that, never once protested with russian flag against genocide of ukrainians.
'Soviet prisoners' didn't want to leave that prison too, but it anyway collapsed and perished. Russia is just a shred of that big prison, so its collapse is just a matter of time, you know.
