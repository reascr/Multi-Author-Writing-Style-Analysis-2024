Just based on name recognition I think it's probably still a tossup between Porter and Schiff, but who the state will ultimately favor, hard to say. If I had to wager money on it, I'd probably take the slightly safer bet and go Schiff.

3 great candidates mean that each one will be weaker and 2 great reps will be jobless. This is a bad move. If the other challengers are strong, youre just kicking up mud.
"It's not fair that someone is running against my candidate! WAAAAA" get out of here with that garbage. Lee has been fighting progressive battles since before it was popular to do so, but sure lets just sweep her aside. Maybe Katie Porter should step aside? this is just dumb logic, like whoever is the first to announce gets the seat? How stupid.
Really, you've never heard of Schiff? That dude ran the first impeachment investigation against Trump. He's like a polished standard-issue Democrat. Ex-lawyer, seems like he wants to help people...also seems disinterested in rocking the boat too much. I'd describe him as "principled, yet safe". That'll help him with inter-party politics at least, I don't know how well it goes over with the public. He just gives off "company man" vibes if you know what I mean. A democrat's democrat. Probably more popular with the center left crowd than the firebrands.
