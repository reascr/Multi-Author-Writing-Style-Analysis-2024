3 provinces are not covered by "historical" treaties, Newfoundland, Quebec and BC, while all of the other provinces have to contend with treaties that date back to the 18th and 19th centuries.
In the case of Newfoundland, Quebec and BC, most of their land is covered by "Modern" treaties, treaties that have been negotiated sometime during the past 60 years.
The difference is: Historical treaties establish a relationship between the Indigenous people and the British Crown, Canada inherited those treaties.
Modern treaties have been passed between the Indigenous people, the provinces and the Federal government where the federal government acts as a guarantor of good faith since indigenous people live under federal regime.
The good thing about modern treaties is that they establish a direct relationship between the Indigenous people and the government of the province, which simplifies talks and allows one Indigenous group of one province to have its "own" deal with the province, different from the "deals" in other provinces. Modern treaties add a lot of flexibility and create partnerships.
So in the case of Newfoundland, Quebec and BC, province getting more power from Ottawa is unlikely to cause a confrontation with their Indigenous people. The other provinces are a different case since they will have to tackle a situation that never existed before in their provinces.
This isn't true, at least in the case of BC, I'm not as familiar with the other provinces. BC has only in the last 20 years really had any progress with treaties and in that time only a handful have been completed. At the same time several court decisions have been made that make the treaty process in it's current from undesirable for First Nations to persue. Because of this the vast majority of land in British Columbia remains unceeded.
