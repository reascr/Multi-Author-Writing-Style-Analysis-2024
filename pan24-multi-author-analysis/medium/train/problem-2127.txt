Yes, please! The 50 plus years of embargo has accomplished nothing. The Cuban leadership still kowtows to the Russian and Chinese governments. Perhaps a change in US policy will improve the relations between Cuba and the US and make Cuba more amenable to a democratic government.
Companies have already been given special exemptions to do business in Cuba, but Cuba wants them subject to Cuban authority, and nobody sane is going to go to a Cuban court to resolve anything.
Let's not forget, Cuba is an authoritarian government, and that isn't exactly a kind of government generous to potential political enemies: even China got companies de-listed from the US stock exchange because they wouldn't follow US rules, and Cuba isn't going to get an even better deal when it's in no position to demand anything.
The GOP won't do it because they'd lose Florida, with all of its anti-Castro Cubans. The Dems won't do it because they'd be accused of being communist, which would sway centrists they rely on to win still.
