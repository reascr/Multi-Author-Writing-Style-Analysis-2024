Looks like Morocco and EU are on a collision course over the allegation on usage of Pegasus spyware.
Its been 18 months and no evidence was provided.. and since then, haaretz revealed that 10+ EU countries had deals with NSO, but Morocco wasn't on their list.
The EU/Morocco thing is mainly led by France, since they're worried about Morocco making deals in Africa (their presumed back yard), and also getting closer to the US/Israel which costs France money.
The main deal is the new high speed rails projects in Morocco, france/alstom wants a cut but they're not getting any if things keep going as they are, the price France has to pay for getting closer with algeria.
That said, they just fucked with algeria too on that dual citizen doctor, so idk wtf macron is doing.
Maroccos statements make me think they did it. If they are so sure they are innocent, it wouldnâ€™t have bothered them so much.
But since they claim EU is trying to destabilize the entire country by looking in to spyware on politicians phones, they look really guilty.
To be honest with ya, Morocco is one of the loyal clients of NSO group. And on the of that we can confirme this back in the time when morocco bought a load of spyware from the hacking team in Italy.
Amnesty International announced findings of forensic analyses confirming that Pegasus had been used on the phone of at least two Moroccan journalists in 2019-2020. Do you think Amnesty is trying to destabilize Morocco as well?
They do it because Morocco violated international laws regarding human rights. You can see the debate since EU is a democracy and everything is available.
