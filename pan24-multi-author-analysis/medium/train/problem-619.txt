Hey, Georgia moderates: there's.really no decision to make here. One, Warnock, is a grownup while the other, Walker, is a brain-damaged, wannabe-werewolf man-child who doesn't live in your state, and whose party wants to take us back to the Civil War.
I doubt anyone even thinking of voting for Walker is a true "moderate." That word implies that they can do some form of rudimentary situational analysis, and that would instantly mean voting for Warnock.

I agree and if you have a friend in Georgia who votes for Warnock they might need to be aware that and this also contributes to why Walker must be defeated on Tuesday. To save American Democracy vote, Sen Warnock, over Walker who is a Trump ally since the day he played for Trump's USFL team NY Generals.
Correct and one must factor in that Provided the following occurs Walker is elected over Warnock and a Trump 2024 win by pulling a Grover Cleveland on Biden.
You are absolutely correct and furthermore MAGA Republican goal is an Americanized Russian autocracy combined with the repeal of Roe versus Wade and chipping away Rights Act of 1964.
