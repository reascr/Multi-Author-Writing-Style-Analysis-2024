This is likely true but let’s not cast stones here since Democrats have spent considerable energy over the last six years or so investigating Trump without much to show for it. Since I am sure someone will bring up Russian collusion and the results of the Jan 6 committee…he is still completed his term (beat two impeachments by the way) and is still threatening to run for office again so to date none of that effort has produced much except cost for the taxpayer and pages of documents that half of the county doesn’t care about.
