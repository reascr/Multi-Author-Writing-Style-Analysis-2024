They won't. Russia itself can still manufacture them even with sanctions (they have produced 400 since the start of the war) and Iran is now supplying them with missiles too. So it's safe to say Russia can hit Ukraine as often as it wants.
No point in destroying air bases since, like Ukraine shows, runways can be restored relatively quickly. Planes themselves aren't manufactured anymore, so it will be much harder to repair them.
I think they are trying to create more civilian refugees. To a xenophobic leader like Putin he's using the most powerful weapon available to him. His goal is to make supporting Ukraine unpopular in the countries that are accepting refugees. He knows that he cannot beat the Ukrainian army as long they have outside support. He's basically trying to attack Ukrainian supporters by using human beings as ammunition.
Maybe Putin and Russian high command are so surrounded by yes men that they keep thinking that they are close to breaking Ukraine's spirit? Senseless dumbassery.
