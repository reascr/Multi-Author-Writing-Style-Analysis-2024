"The country’s industrial firms are facing major problems replacing Western technology, leading the automobile company AvtoVAZ – manufacturer of the Lada vehicle brand – to first halt production earlier this year and then move to producing some vehicles without basic electronic features like air bags and anti-lock braking systems.".
Back in the day, A man goes into the old national auto store to buy a car. The salesperson asked what model he wants? “Lada”. Ok, two door or four? “Four please” Ok. What colour? “Grey please”. Ooookay. Here we are- yes ok that will be available for pickup….. what day is it today? November 24? Ok- available for pickup November 30- six years from now. Any questions? “Hmm November 30 in six years? … hmm… do I need to come in the morning or is it ok if I come.
I’m the afternoon?” The sales person is a bit taken aback. What kind of question is that?!? “We’ll, I just need to plan my day because the plumber is supposed to come that morning”.
The Hungarian word for can/box/chest is “Láda”. During the Cold War when it was one of only a few brand of automobile was available (and Russians were generally hated by many- though not openly of course) the nickname for the car was “Szemét Lada” or garbage can.
There will be shipments of new cars coming from khazakstan and china very soon. They have the money to buy them.
Putin and his gang are making billions from oil sales though. Its not like the russians havent dealt with adversity before.
