The plate boundary is where two giant slabs of earth are moving past each other. They are always moving because at the subduction zone a very massive chunk of that plate is actively sinking into the mantle and that pulls the entire plate along with it. The only thing that 'stops' is where the two plates rub against each other and in that case it's like two peices of very heavy rubber pulling against each other. The contact friction will cause elastic deformation of the material and that pressure will build and build and build until some part of it gives way. But the point of contact isn't just one spot, its an entire plate boundary hundreds or thousands of kilometers long and possibly even hundreds of kilometers thick. So when one point gives all it does is transfer that pressure outwards to the nearby points of contact. And when that happens those points either take on that extra pressure or they are overwhelmed and give themselves. And it will keep going back and forth and back and forth transferring the pressure back and forth and outward until enough pressure has been relieved that the points of contact can handle the pressure and get a good grip on each other. Until that happens you will have dozens or hundreds of smaller earth quakes as the pressure is redistributed.
Looking at that data it makes it seem like the earthquake never stopped. There has been lots of 4.0-5.0s almost everyday since the big one. Am I just unaware how common earthquakes are or is this abnormal?
