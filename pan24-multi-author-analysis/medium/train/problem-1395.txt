Let's see, Trump appointed three of them, and they voted 9-0 against him here, well, they seem to have some slight amount of character left, I was sure Thomas would dissent.
Trump thinks he was using the religious conservatives and that they are all in his pocket, when in reality they were using him as a tool the whole time.
The Federalists are all done squeezing every last drop of use out of him. They want him to be indicted at this point...they get rid of him and some of the magas in Congress.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The federalists/gop playing to get their party back...but, no matter, there are many maga gop voters...not sure how they're going to reel them in.
Yeah, he appointed three of them, so much for that "best people" and "great judge of character" stuff he used to spout. And when you look at it, anything he tries to run on will be hit with that question, and the perception of him as a loser will just be hit home even harder. He didn't build a wall, he didn't lock her up, he did nothing for the national debt except grow it by the largest amounts in history, and that was before the pandemic, or healthcare or anything you can think of.
