That's because he's greedy, and insane. They say he's supposed to be smart. If that was true, why is his country so shitty? Here's hoping his own people get sick of and get rid of him, soon.
I've met a lot of intelligent people that are also dumb as fuck. I rarely meet people who are both wise and intelligent at the same time. I've only once had the displeasure of knowing a person who's both intelligent and evil.
It’s easy to make that assumption but be making the classic mistake of underestimating the opponent, dramatically. He has blundered recently, yes, but look at how successful he has been in meddling in US politics. Not to mention his beginnings as a KGB agent, rising through the ranks, and how long he’s been able to stay in power. You don’t get to and stay in his position in a nation with such ruthless politics by sheer dumb luck and cruelty.
That being said, I do believe he is undergoing cognitive decline and probably started ten or so years ago. But he still is capable of shrewd play and the US cannot afford to underestimate his ability to implement his designs, despite completely showing his ass in Ukraine.
