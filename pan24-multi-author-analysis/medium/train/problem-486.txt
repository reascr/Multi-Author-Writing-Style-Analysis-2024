Probably illegal in many countries. I guess in Korea, people think it's fair for companies to know if someone they are thinking of hiring may end up quitting earlier than other candidates, or will need to take off a lot of time at one point.
Thatâ€™s not ignorant, hormonal birth control is something that the doctor has proposed but we need to do more tests to confirm like see if I have PCOS per example. She proposed IUD for my situation which has me very nervous especially when I said Iâ€™d want pain management for the insertion and she said it wouldnâ€™t be necessary. I told her I know exactly what happens in the insertion procedure and if she has to stabilize my cervix, it is insanely painful according to a lot of testimonies. She said it wasnâ€™t for herself. She was kind but a bit tone deaf in that moment like yeah thatâ€™s cool it wasnâ€™t for you but do I want to take that risk and you knowâ€¦ find out when itâ€™s too late already and Iâ€™m in horrible pain? Ugh the medical misogyny to this day even when coming from a well intentioned doctor ðŸ˜“.
