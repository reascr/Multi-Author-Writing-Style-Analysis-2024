Well the article doesn't mention it, but the impression is that NATO is trying to cover up that at least one was a russian missile, and the second was likely the ukrainian AA chasing it, because people have found out that coordinates for the strike match up with the presidential palace in Kyiv and an air field in Lviv, as if they were taken and mixed up. Furthermore, Ukrainian AA is supposed to self-destruct if it misses.
Yes, Russia is conducting a horrendous invasion of a sovereign nation, but we can't let our emotions lead to a nuclear conflict just because we are upset and want to believe everything that goes wrong was an intentional act.
Edit: I'm having a bit of trouble verifying the polish tractor coordinate in the comment, it's definitely extremely close, 1 or 2 kilometers away from other sources I'm seeing, but I can't find those exact numbers. Initially it was also reported that there might have been multiple missiles.
If Zelensky and the early press releases were to be believed we could be looking at a huge increase in the war with much more death and suffering. All for what? A misfiring of missile defense systems? We can't lose our heads in these trying times.
No, for enforcing the world order that does not allow for genocide -- which is what we are already dealing with. Your whole "all this war? for what?" is really misguided. We are already in this situation. And if things get out of control, it is squarely the fault of Russia who is constantly threatening to use nukes.
Also if Russia attacks Poland, it is not Ukraine's fault at all, in fact all of the blame for all of this belongs solely to Russia.
Poland is the first country who claimed the missile was Russian. Still seems like the most obvious answer.
