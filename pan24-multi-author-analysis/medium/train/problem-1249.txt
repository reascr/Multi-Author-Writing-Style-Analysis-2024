Not a bad idea for defense. A bad idea for astronomy and low orbit garbage. If every country/company starts doing this it'll get congested real quick.
yeah, but it's gonna happen, telescopes are going to have to move to space, just like a century ago they had to move away from cities due to city lights and smog.
if you have economic progress or national defense like in this case vs astronomy, astronomy will always lose.
In the event of war with China I think Musk would fall in line. His assets in China would likely be nationalized and he would have to choose the US or China. I think it’s pretty clear that while he needs China to make money, he doesn’t want to live there.
All Musk has to do is ensure starlink isn't useful about 3 weeks. Once China has blockaded the island they can choke it out. Musk doesn't have to side to lose his factories he just has to make sure its not useful during the critical first few days while Taiwan is on its own mostly and getting surrounded.
However would you place the survival of your country/ family / own life in the hands of someone who would support China invading if not for international pressure.
He did try to backout starlink support for Ukraine after he collected the PR credit for what the US paid for. I think he would have ensured Starlink wasn't viable if there wasn't the pressure but also he admires Putin but XI has Musk by the balls in a way Putin doesn't.
Also, the US military is a customer of Starlink. I’m sure they would strong arm SpaceX, and if not they would just provide access through the military contract.
Good in Taiwan because in the end when the shit hits the fan they really only have themselves to rely on for certain and certainly will be the first few days.
