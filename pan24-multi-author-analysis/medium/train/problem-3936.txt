One interview I saw indicated that the committee was only focused on bringing to light the details of what happened and identifying the ring leaders. They indicated there were far more crimes and criminals, but this was only a starting point for the DOJ. I.e. it is up to them to identify all the players and related crimes, the committee doesn't have the man power or resources to go after the smaller fish.
I think it is critically important that this committee did the hard work to create a historical record. Now there is a source with evidence that people can see without a bunch of bullshit.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
And this is also a good thing. Remember that the recommendations are symbolic and for the purpose of recorded history. The commitee has given the DOJ tons to look at, but the DOJ needs to be the ones to decide based on legal criteria (and hopefully they will get successful convictions in the future). I would never want a Congress with the power to indicite (just imagine the abuse of that power if the GOP could use it).
