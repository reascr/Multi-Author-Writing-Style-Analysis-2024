The source of that quote is the same German government which has made it abundantly clear in press announcements previously that they did not endorse the delivery of MBTs, and even rebuked a country for suggesting their provision without asking (Spain). There is little reason to believe they have not privately rejected or shot down any such requests, considering they had no qualms doing it publicly. And they have been caught obfuscating such things in the past during this conflict. They also publicly stated they don't care that the UK was sending Challengers, they want the US to take the initiative and send tanks (notably a goalpost shift from their previous policy of just not being first, to again avoid having to send tanks). But sure, Germany really just wants to provide them, and no one has asked Darn shame How convenient it aligns with current German policy on the matter though. Go figure.
Either way, real leadership we're seeing. I'm glad the German government made all those speeches about stepping up, being a military leader for Europe, and grabbing the bull by the horns on this matter. Really ringing true with the policy of "we won't do anything unless you do." /s.
You're listening to something RÃ¶ttgen says, which is already the first mistake. He's an opposition politician from Merkel's party with no special insight into what the government actually does or thinks beyond what is stated publicly. He has a vested interest in talking bad about the current government and he tends to do that a lot.
