I'm a German and my strong gut instincts tell me that these are only stalling tactic and Scholz ultimately will say 'No'. Maybe Scholz tries to stall the process only until our new secretary of defense has taken his oath and afterwards Scholz will blame him for saying 'No'. Or maybe he thinks the war will stop soon or any other nonsense, I don't know. I really hate this rat on the throne!
Edit: Well, well, well, this weasel really found a way to shift the responsibility upon someone else again Scholz is such a disgusting and honourless pest.
Rheinmetall already accelerated their process to get Leopards in working order, and can only deliver 15! in the third quarter of this year.
He won't say no, he is stalling for time. Because there are not enough tanks in working order to give and/or working infrastructure to maintain them.
The most likely scenario is that some Leopards that are currently in maintenance (about 30) for Slovakia/Czech Republic are going to Ukraine.
The Bundeswehr really does not have many Tanks, something around 260, and not even half of them are in working order.
I hope that makes it clear why Scholz is stalling for time. The tanks have to be repaired/build first.
Habeck said yesterday that other countries can give Ukraine their tanks, but they are waiting for a green light from the Americans.
Former StUffz here, you are only partly right. Rheinmetall is telling the german Government they need that long. KMW, the main manufacturer of the Leopard, already said that they would need less than a month to get a Brigade Size Force of Leopards ready for transfer. Its a big lobbyism work and deals between Rheinmetall and the German Government. Germany could send around 60-80 tanks for sure, but only if new expensive contracts are signed again in Rheinmetall's Favor. The whole German Defense Apparat is a clusterfuck.
