The TSA was so honest and transparent about backscatter x-ray machines, the amount of radiation they expose passengers to, and how the images are displayed and stored. I have complete trust and confidence that they will continue to operate with the utmost integrity when it comes to facial recognition and other biometrics.

I got a new passport about 5 years ago. Layover in Mexico City. Had security walk up to me and ask why my passport had a different number that the last time I was there. All was good. No problem. But they know shit about you that you think they donâ€™t.
Oh for fucks sake. The fact they won't release the data for false positives, something that's been documented as a big problem for facial recognition programs with POC's because of inherent biases in the algorithms created by non-POC's, is concerning to say the least.
Looking forward to being racially profiled yet again, and for others just more, because the TSA sucks.
