In 1970-71 I was an ATC at H201 (which apparently no longer exists), the VIP helipad for 8^th Army HQ at Yongsan. It was the most constricted facility I ever worked. To the west was officer country -- houses, officers' club, etc -- to the east there was a hill with an elementary(?) school on top, to the south there were 144' power lines.
And to the north was the Blue House (SK equivalent of our White House) Exclusion Zone -- ground to unlimited. If you strayed into that area, there were quad-50's on Namsan (South Mountain) that would open up on you. They even did this to a JAL commercial flight, although in that case they "just" put tracers across the flight path.
So having an NK drone penetrate the Blue House airspace is a Big Deal. Stay tuned, things may be about to get really spicy.
And they are here to stay. Drones at various levels of complexity will continue to play a bigger and bigger part of modern warfare. They’re generally cheaper and more effective. There will be advances in anti-drone warfare no doubt, but we’ll see the rise of swarms of cheap suicide drones. We will also see more advanced drones, highly networked with more advanced conventional aircraft like the B-21 and F-35. There’s even the ones that we know exist but have not been officially acknowledged like the RQ-180 (the real name is unknown).
