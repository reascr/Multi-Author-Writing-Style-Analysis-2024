I can only infer from election data that Alaska isn't like Oklahoma. As in, there'd be no chance in Hell Lisa Murkowski would now be about to begin her 4th term in the Senate if she ran in Oklahoma or 20-odd other Republican-dominated states. Among all the lower 48 states it's impossible to think of a single Republican who seems to have developed the good will of Native Americans anywhere close to the degree Murkowski has in Alaska.

FWIW, both of Alaska's Republican senators voted Yea, and I doubt any borough's Republican committee will censure them.
