We’ve gone over this so many times over the last 6-7 years. It’s infuriating. He’s not a new person in politics. He’s exactly like all the other rich aholes that get involved in politics. He double speaks, lies, and often gas lights you over what he said or meant, but the thing is he’s not that good over it because he flip flops even in the same interview! So frustrating when dealing with people who have tied their identity to him, so they can see how their cult leader might be wrong.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Based off of what I’ve seen, a more accurate headline would be: “Trumps call to terminate the constitution sparks Republicans twisting into pretzels to suggest Trump didn’t say what he said”.
