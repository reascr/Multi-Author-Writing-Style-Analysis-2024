So sick of ignorant romantic libertarianism from the middle class because cable news and AM radio has been pumping wealth propaganda at us for 50+.
It's a national embarassment that we have such bad labor protections and poor social safety nets. The wealthy have us working for pennies with no help while they reap the rewards, all because they've convinced enough of us that every other successful and happy country on earth is wrong or lying.
We could have fully healthcare, free school, better wages, guaranteed vacation and sick time, and more... But we have people afraid the government is going to ake the other dollar the corporation can get away with paying you so they all fight over killing the one thing that literally exists for their benefit.
The point: the government stepped in to provide these meals when the food cost less. Now the food is more expensive and they are not providing assistance to the families. Even if those parents kept their pre-pandemic jobs, wages haven’t kept up with the increase in the grocery bill.
I am a teacher and my students are coming to school hungry. In the past few months I have had to find snacks for students who were weak and shaky from not eating. Families in my school’s attendance zone are moving to remote areas to find affordable housing. Many more families that we know need their kids to have breakfast and lunch at school.
