You have that wrong buddy: the majority of the rail union workers voted against ratifying the agreement on the table. Once the agreement was rejected, the rail refused to negotiate further forcing the adoption of the rejected contract. That's why this strike was proposed. The main thing that the workers fought for was a few days of unpaid sick leave.
There are plenty of democrats that work on the railroad. Regardless, we know the Republicans were going to be against unions. Democrats showed they aren't much better.
Not sure where you're getting this idea that majority of the workers preferred the agreement on the table but that is not how unions work.
If the railroad workers’ work is so important they can’t go on strike or else there are national consequences, they should get adequately compensated for their work, including vacation days. The railway owners can hold off on buying another yacht and cry into their hoard of money.
