Out of curiosity to what extent think Israel would intervene militarily of they felt Iran was very close to attaining nuclear weapons. From what I’m seeing it seems like they are more than will to do targeted drone strikes as it is, but do you think Israel would ever escalate further than that if they felt Iran was very close.
Instead of supplying arms to Ukraine, Israel went ahead and bombed a drone manufacturing facility. Why supply arms when you can simply disturb the enemy's source of weaponry?
I suspected as much though it wasn’t hard to figure out. Anyway as someone who’s not too in tune with Israeli and Iranian relations other than surface level stuff, can someone explain how Israel is able to do this without repercussions. I would imaging drone striking another country is a pretty brazen violation of sovereignty. Is it the case that everyone knows it’s Israel but it’s not official that gives Israel enough plausible deniability to not have any consequences,idk. Maybe someone more informed on the matter can explain.
