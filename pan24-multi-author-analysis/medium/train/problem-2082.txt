The battle for Bakhmut is a war within a war. Some of the fiercest fighting of the invasion has happened here. And now the Kremlin's forces are gaining ground, metre by metre, body by body. Wave after wave of mercenaries from the notorious Wagner group have been sent into battle here. There are reports of fields of Russian corpses.
This is how Russia fights wars. They throw bodies at it. Don't expect Russia to give in until there's 500,000 casualties on their side.
Thing is since WW1 machine guns, artillery, and aircraft, the latter being supplemented by cheap drones, should have put an end to the uncoordinated attack.
Both sides are hoping the other runs out of supplies and equipment, but the Russians are hampered by their rigid command system plus a bit of not enough training, troop specific of course.
With conscription, it could be argued that the Russian “mobilizees” and even prisoners promised freedom had some training in the past, but they probably got rushed for political purposes. Not that Russia is unique in that, but they failed to realize even the Ukrainian civilian volunteers are highly motivated. Russia is basically fighting an increasingly high tech Ukrainian army that also has the tenacity of the Viet Cong.
There are signs the Russian army is learning somewhat by hard experiences, but most Western analysts still say they have major problems coordinating. Watching a video of a tank column in the open being blown up.
