Which makes me think about how an individual drug may have a prominent effect on one country, but be irrelevant to another. It seems to add a unique layer to the complexity of every country restricting, or not restricting certain drugs. It seems like there needs to be a data driven analysis in each country about the specific drugs that are the most prevalent and cause the most deaths/damage to the citizenry. With this information there could be a lot more targeted drug enforcement which would also lighten the load on law enforcement, which would lead to significantly less effort/money spent on arresting low level offenders that consume non-targeted drugs, and there would also be a significant budget surplus to provide way more training to police officers that were basically all detectives that could effectively pursue the “real” crimes while also adding a significant workforce of mental health advocates and advisors that would reduce the overall workload of an individual police officer.
Yea it'll be some police specific "de-escalation" class where they teach you the fastest way to de-escalate a situation is to cuff, beat or shoot everyone involved.
