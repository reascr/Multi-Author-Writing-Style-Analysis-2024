The growth of our national deficit under Trump ranks as the third-biggest increase, relative to the size of the economy, of any US President in American history per the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. And unlike George W. Bush and Abraham Lincoln, who oversaw larger increases in deficits, Trump did not launch two foreign conflicts or have to pay for a civil war. No, Trump just spent into oblivion and cut corporate taxes for the rich.
Just an FYI, Republicans voted to increase the debt ceiling during Trumpâ€™s presidency. They are now holding our economy hostage for their wet dream of cutting safety nets for senior citizens, Social Security and Medicare.
PS: the majority of Trump covid spending was set up to be fraudulently stolen by the rich PPP. No need to give Trump and his party any fig leaves.
