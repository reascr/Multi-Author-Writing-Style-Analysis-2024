Are they ever going to look at the shortcomings of the healthcare industry, is it prepared for the next pandemic or will they have again to ration PPE's? Will they continue to close hospitals and have less beds in the name of profit?
That was my point...we keep blaming Trump, with good reason, but we never looked at the healthcare industry which has closed many hospitals and beds in the name of profit, which did not even have enough PPE's for healthcare workers as they went with "Just in Time" management to make more profit while we pay twice as much as most other industrialized country...if there was a time for universal healthcare, this was it...but we prefer going after an easy target instead...
Looking to the DoD or CIA or any other intelligence org to be the source of pandemic intelligence other than from a defense angle is a not their primary role.
Intelligence agencies aren't spying about pandemics folks. The world has many interacting medical based organizations that monitor pandemics all the time.
