True, but unlike Turkey, their military drills are within their air/water/land borders or in allied and pre-agreed borders(well, with the exception being when Turkey wants to have a big dk contest and they have to reciprocate or being declared a weak country and risk a war). Turkey on the other hand has been constantly violating other nations sovereignty left right and center.... literally. Greece, Cyprus, Israel, Syria, Iraq, Lybia, Armenia and pretty much pissed off all their neighbours on their borders and around them. If it was just an issue between just Greece, Cyprus and Turkey then one could easily dispute putting the blame on any one country and say "oh it was an accident" or "Oh well, they're both just not cooperating" but no. When a nation has issues with all its neighbours, then something is wrong with that nation in particular. Hopefully the Sultan-wannabe loses the election this time around and better, more reasonable, people take helm of Turkey.
It is just more lies fron Turkey. If Finland somehow agreed with Turkey it is almost certain Turkey would again betray their world. Nothing Turkey says or promises can be trusted.
