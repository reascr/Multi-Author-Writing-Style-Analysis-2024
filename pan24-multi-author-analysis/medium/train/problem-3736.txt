Could, but simultaneously if his money is from Russia, their immediate concern is to make the US look as much a laughing stock as they are to the world failing to stomp all over Ukraine. Spy is likely but also secondary for the immediate moment.

A spy would be more covert. He may be being paid to just disrupt Congress and the government in general. Not sure what the correct term for someone like that is other than professional asshole.
Eh, what more covert way to hide you're a spy than act like a complete wild card? Everyone will be more worried about what you're next dumb move is to pay attention to any of your boring stuff....Don't actually think he is, but one can never know for sure lol.
I mean from what I've seen, it looks like he was sent in with the mysterious backed funding to just continue to sow discord in American government. His "ill resign if 142k ask me to" is obviously bs. You can tell he purposely flash the okay hate symbol to get people riled up online on both sides. If they don't force him out, I am 100% sure he is going to be like mtg and Dumbart doing anything and everything to get his name in the news.
I haven't seen any information if he is genuinely a smart guy that 100% knows what he is doing to a t or if he's just a useful pawn.
