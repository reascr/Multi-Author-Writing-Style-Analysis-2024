Youre correct, and it still is a complete unmitigated shitshow. Important notes are that 1.) Florida began developing as a state well after most other states in the union did (1960’s was when it really began), and most of that development has been tourist-centric. In the lingo of international development, economists and political scientists would be asking why we never bothered to diversify our economy whatsoever.
In that vein, I would recommend looking into the few key economic interests and industries that decide all facets of our political system here. Florida as an electorate has not been republican until this year, and a lot of that is connected to our feckless and collapsing Democratic Party. On top of that, Floridians simply cannot compete for political influence against the likes of Publix, Big Sugar, the cattle industry north of Lake O and now our dictator governor who was propped up by trump in his first campaign in 2018. I’ve lived here my whole life and in several regions; I can tell you a majority of Floridians do not hold the same views as our elected leaders, and most do not support them outside of recent arrivals. But with the way the political system operates here, we have very little agency.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
