> As an initial matter, it is important to note that no party here disputes Santucci’s allegations that (1) he affirmatively answered Question 11 of the Firearm Application Questionnaire, which relates to whether he has ever been diagnosed as having a behavioral, emotional, or mental disorder, and (2) the only reason Santucci was asked to provide a letter from a doctor stating that he was no longer affected by such a disorder was due to his affirmative answer to Question 11. With those two undisputed facts in mind, there is no basis in the record for Santucci to have been asked to provide the doctor’s letter or even, at least under Section 134-7, for Santucci to have been told to turn over his firearms. The reason is simple: pursuant to Section 134-7, an affirmative answer to Question 11 does not render Santucci ineligible for gun registration or ownership. And no one really disputes that. See Dkt. No. 26 at 8-9 (Honolulu noting that Question 11 misses “critical language” from Section 134-7); Dkt. No. 28 at 14 (Attorney General agreeing that an applicant “would not be disqualified” unless he has been diagnosed as having a significant behavioral, emotional, or mental disorder). Therefore, given that Santucci’s affirmative answer is undisputedly the sole reason he was asked to provide the doctor’s letter, that request cannot stand.
