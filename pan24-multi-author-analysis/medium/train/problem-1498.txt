Historically, they used the name of their fiefdom. Chinese nobles were often known by their territorial titles instead of names just like Western nobles (e.g. Gilbert du Motier being known as the Marquis de Lafayette, the House of Hanover being named after where their ancestral holding, etc). This was effectively a second last name in a way. The Qin dynasty was founded by the King of Qin, the Han Dynasty was founded by the King of Han, the Sui Dynasty was founded by the King of Sui and the Tang dynasty was founded by the Duke of Tang. The Song founder didn't have the title king or duke but he was the general of an army stationed at Song prefecture.
You should have supported them when China broke all agreements and imprisoned the opposition and installed their own political leaders. Now, they have no chance of coming back.
Not you, personally, but the British as a nation. You had gotten guarantees from China, and had sort of promised Hongkong - but then the UK was so busy and weakened with Brexit, the pandemic and Tory infighting, that they just stood by when China assimilated Hongkong. I heard that their new school textbooks don't even mention the time of the British occupation anymore - it's just another part of effing China now.
