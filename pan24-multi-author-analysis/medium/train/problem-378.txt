Yup. Sorta skimmed through but using densely populated countries where people live in poverty and don't consume as much isn't the most convincing argument. Our goal has generally been to raise the standard of living in developing countries. Can only reasonably reduce per capita consumption by so much.
Actually what I've read is a huge concern is shortage of phosphates for commercial farming. That's a problem that is directly related to population and not easy to reduce per capita.
Sustainable farming can feed 1/2 billion people. When the petroleum runs out and we can't make chemical fertilizer anymore, then the population will be 1/2 billion.
It is probably to late to start an orderly transition from 8 billion to .5 billion, so expect more wars to control what's left.
"Kenya, which is suffering through a devastating drought, has 55 million people, about 95 times more than the population of Wyoming. But Wyoming emits 3.7 times the carbon dioxide as Kenya. Africa as whole has 16.7% of the world’s population but historically emits only 3% of the global carbon pollution, while the United States has 4.5% of the planet’s people but since 1959 has put out 21.5% of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide.".
