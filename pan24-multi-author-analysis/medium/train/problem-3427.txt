The point is that varying levels of margins are an inherent part of different industries, regardless of how well run the business is. And it’s easy to say “Well, you shouldn’t do the crime” and sure, they shouldn’t, but then you’ve effectively formulated a system where some industries have an easier time shouldering fines than others. You’ll have low margin industries where any fine at all is effectively just shutting down the business and high margin industries where the fine barely matters, both for the same violations.
It does make it difficult to tailor the severity of the fines, though. Some businesses and industries have very high margins and some have very low margins.
I've been saying for a while now: 0.05xn! in which x is their yearly revenue and n is a running count of every fine they receive. First fine, 5% of yearly revenue. Third fine 30%. Fourth 120%. Fifth fine is 6x what they bring in a year. Knock 1 off of n every 50-100 years to account for changes in management due to various reasons like deaths or resignations.
5% of gross revenue might be a dent in annual profit for one business but wipe out 10 years of profit for another and send them under completely.
