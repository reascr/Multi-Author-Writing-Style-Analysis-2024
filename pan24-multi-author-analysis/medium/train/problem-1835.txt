Welcome to reddit, where you're either part of the left-wing or you must be a right-wing MAGA, QAnon supporting conservative.
There is a logical trap in completely unregulated free speech that leads to erosive ideologies taking advantage of a society and using it’s own freedoms to destroy it.
theres politically left leaning people like myself that call themselves centrists too. despite being a lifelong (since i could register to vote i mean) democrat and never once voting for anything republican. jusssayin... it's broad politcally. just because someone is a centrist doesn't make them a libertarian or right wing necessarily.
Also, you must hold either completely left-wing or completely right-wing views on all matters across both the economical and social axis.
It's quite funny for a European, considering our right-wing parties are like centrists in the American political spectrum.
I was only pointing out that unfortunately free speech can be used against itself and somehow I am having labels thrown at me. I didn’t advocate or support any ideas or course of action. My personal views completely in line with your first statement.
