If one looks at his net worth each year for the last 20 years, his total net worth of between 20 and 40 million developed while he was the 8th FIFA president, during 1998 to 2015.
You know it's going to be a real celebration of football when you're kind of ashamed that your national team is even going instead of boycotting this bullshit.
How is it a red line for you that a sport doesn't take any steps to prevent its players from injuries but literal slavery isn't?
That is the key issue. I’ve moved from US football to being a global football fan, over the last 15 years. There is so much money in sports, of course they are corrupt. US football died for me on its disregard for players brain injuries (they can’t be prevented, the game can’t function without them. For global football…. Yup, there’s too much money. Yes it’s corrupt. But fifa ignoring the death toll around building the venues and the general draconic approach to human rights in Qatar, makes it a hard watch. I’ll tune in, but I’m mostly interested in the return to regular play, where I can ignore the uncomfortable bits.
I am not trying to say that either is good, nor that you should never watch football again. But at least skip this world Cup, if you care about the morals of the sport you are supporting.
