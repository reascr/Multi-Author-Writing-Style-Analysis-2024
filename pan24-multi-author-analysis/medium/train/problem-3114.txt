Naturally. As he needs to wait for new unauthorized settlements to be established first. Once that has progressed enough, they get authorized. Rinse and repeat.
There are plenty of unauthorized construction done all the time. But usually the IDF comes tearing it down or disperses people before they can really make progress on anything.
Since Israel has its own bureaucracy and system of layers of regulation, it cannot react immediately to every action taken by settlers. This creates a situation in which there are, at any time, unauthorized settlements existing somewhere (usually a few makeshift huts).
Due to recent terror attacks in which 9 Israelis were murdered over the course of less than a week, plus ongoing public criticism about lack of deterrence against terror attacks, the government decided to legalize 9 previously unauthorized settlements, symbolic of the 9 victims, in retaliation.
If you refer to several hundred thousand people over hundreds of cities and towns as settlers and settlements respectively, then that's also quite inaccurate. Many of these "settlements" existed before Israel itself, some even for thousands of years. The vast majority of the "settlers" are actually just residents of Jerusalem.
However 1 settlement for 1 life is just insane. Given how that "rule" only applies to one side. As I've mentioned in another post civilian losses are a lot higher among Palestine. These are large.
I do agree with you on the first part. Most of the settlements works against both Israel and Palestine interests. In West Banks alone there are currently 100 to 200 settlements with roughly 450 thousands settlers. None of them internationally recognized as belonging to Israel. Only Israel claims this.
