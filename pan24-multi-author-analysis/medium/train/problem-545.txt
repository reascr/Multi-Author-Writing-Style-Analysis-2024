This is about the right time to start raising money and accumulating insider support and senior staff for a statewide primary challenge + a very competitive general election.
Does he even have to primary Sinema since she resigned from the party? I imagine she will sneakily wait until near the deadline to decide whether to reregister as a Dem or run as an independent.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I doubt sheâ€™d file as a dem especially now. Majority of the party dislike her. Her only chance to retain her seat would be to pull votes from the right as an independent.
Calling Sinema's bluff. If she did indeed leave the party as a threat to split the vote should the dems run someone against her, this is the call to action. She knew she'd lose a primary face off, so she quit the party. Now she gets to prove to the world that she would rather allow a republican to take her seat than lose a primary against someone with a modicum of decency.
