Cool. But the reason all those people were on staff is so complex. Frankly, elon has proved himself to be kinda a simpleton in terms of his actual understanding of business. Those employees might seem extraneous. But then since that's happened Twitter has had a MAJOR data breach, they've had issues like the one in this thread, they've had internal complaints and frustrations. They had a scandle where they had to ask employees to bring their own toilet paper to work?? This is all disastrous for a billion + dollar company.
Well more likely they have contracts mandating they rent for a certain number of years in these offices as many expensive office districts do.
Skipping rent is likely a loophole that allows them to get kicked out and only pay for legal costs or whatever are involved in that which by their calculations works out cheaper than staying till end of contract.
Elon is doing stuff with billions of dollars that's equivalent to poor desperate people who max out a credit card to buy a toy like a giant offroad truck that they can't afford.
