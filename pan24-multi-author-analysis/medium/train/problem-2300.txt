Newsflash: it wasn’t “his people”, it was Falun Gong cult propaganda. Do you think it’s a coincidence they chose a yellow character? And I think you’ll find these claims of “fascism” and anti-democracy comes from the same place.
North Korea is UN member, Taiwan is not, Even with the Taiwan constitution, the name Taiwan is not a country, unlike Ukraine which is a fully sovereign state.
China’s official stance is that Chinese territorial integrity counts both mainland and Taiwan. This is actually more in line with their interests since they can spin it as “everyone stay out of our internal dispute” if they try to take Taiwan.
Falun Gong has very dubious international connections (see Donald trump) The religion itself isn’t indigenous to China, and has only been in existence since the early 90s. It’s quite well known to attract scam artists and criminals. Very similar to say, the church of Scientology. The mention of ethnic sinoism is in reference to the “Winnie the Pooh is Xi” memes that come directly from racist memes spread by Falun Gong. Falun Gong enjoys a wide range of international promotion for their claims of “persecution”; they are in reality a puppet cult for clandestine orgs like the CIA.
