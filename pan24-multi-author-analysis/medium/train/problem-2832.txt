Since these are combat units that need to be ready to move at a moment's notice, destroy equipment if they're about to be overrun, etc, you need dedicated folks operating those trucks, maintenance crew, etc. That's already tens of people just for the basics before you even get to the specialists operating each of those pieces of specialized equipment.
It probably takes a fraction of those to operate and the rest to also maintain it. It's an older and likely overly complex system and the longer range these things are the more careful you have to be to not shoot down the wrong targets.
"One of the main concerns about sending the Patriot to Ukrainian forces is the logistics of being able to operate the system. Just one Patriot battery would require 90 soldiers to operate and it comes with computers, a phased array radar, a control system and power generating equipment, according to the U.S. Army".
in detail explanation of the system, system parts (launchers, comms, command etc.), required training, repairs. And even an a resimulation of attack in Saudi Arabia. Super good explanation.
