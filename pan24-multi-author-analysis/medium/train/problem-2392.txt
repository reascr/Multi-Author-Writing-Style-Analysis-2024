No China is just censoring free speech all across the globe. Remember that time a single NBA manager (Daryl Morey) was criticizing China on Twitter and the entire NBA had to apologize? Or that time when a French museum called Genghis Khan a Mongol and since it doesn't fit in China's (rewritten) historical narrative?
If you include all the territories of the former empires, no. The European nations controlled large swathes of every single continent at the turn of the 19th century up until the second world war.
If you don't, then it depends on the strenh of the USD, as the EU as a block has the largest GDP before Brexit, so when you are talking about the European nations, it is competitive with the US in terms of total GDP.
Currently the US is about 1/4 of the entire world's GDP, China is next at about 1/6 world gdp. Germany has the highest GDP in Europe with a little less than 1/20 of the world GDP.
Before Brexit, the EU economies edge out the US in terms of GDP. So in terms of the 'former empires' the GDP is not that far off.
