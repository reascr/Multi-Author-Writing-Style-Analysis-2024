I don't discount the threat of nuclear war, but I don't think playing soft with Russia makes nuclear war any less likely in the long run. This entire thing is a test of how far he can go with nuclear as a backup threat. The answer has to be "no further" or it becomes "as far as you want". Unless we are to be held hostage to Russia, we will have to stand and risk nuclear war. We shouldn't invade Russia or anything, but I do believe we should use absolutely everything we have to hold them to their borders. We played it soft the last few times and they're only getting more bold.
Ukrainians have not forgotten how easily Russia has stabbed them in the back and they won't fall for it again.
Some of those long range missles that are being fired by Russia into Ukraine were handed over to Russia by Ukraine in exchange for security guarantees that their territorial integrity wouldn't be threatened.
I sort of hope they don't, just to see who comes weaseling out trying to get their governments to pressure Ukraine into doing so.
