Although her yes vote is appreciated, she launched into a tirade about how religious people are allegedly targeted and victimized by LGBT people and their allies. It offers some insight into the warped Republican mindset. Nobody -- I repeat nobody \-- gives one singular, solitary fuck about whether someone else's church performs a gay marriage. They care about whether said church leverages their power to take civil rights away from others. For this reason, you don't see the Amish or Jehovah's Witnesses being vilified in the same way that the Southern Baptists are. The former two stay out of legislating their religious beliefs; the latter obsess over it. It's as simple as that.
