You're joking, but that's exactly their excuse right now. The bolsonaristas are saying that the terrorists aren't protesting in favor of Bolsonaro, they are protesting against the current president.
In a laughing attempt to avoid Bolsonaro connection to this protests and trying to give it legitimate.
What’s Bolsonaro’s game? He doesn’t exactly concede, but tells them to avoid violence. Violence breaks out and there is still no comment from him from Florida. Does he really think he can return to power? It’s not going to happen. What a jerk.
You have to understand the he is hopeless and is dumb, so he is trying something that could make no sense.
Also, just amazing so many minions will fight for the interests of a few powerful moneyed elites. Such fools but so common. Always happens.
Of course they never get actual riot treatment from the police. Not even a whiff of teargas or formal state interdiction.
He knows that he can't return to the power without some support, either from the army or through the people. The goal is to make the country such a mess that he has a chance to return somehow.
