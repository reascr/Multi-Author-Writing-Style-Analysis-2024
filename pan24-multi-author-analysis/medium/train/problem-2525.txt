"Literally everyone" here means journalists and foreign governments. Within Germany, it is still a bit of a controversial decision - there's those that still fear escalation, of course, but mostly it's about the fact that it is a bit paradoxical that Germany is giving away a lot of its military stock (and unlike others, not from surplus, largely), while the Bundeswehr is already in a pretty bad state, and lots of money are being pumped into it as a result. Last known numbers (which are, admittedly a few weeks old) showed a relatively slim (somewhere around 55% - 65%, IIRC) majority for sending, but having a stable majority here is actually relatively new.
But he has to make a statement, if what the other guy said in the comments is true, the population in Germany is split on this decision, so politically he has to say something.
the biggest newspaper in germany had already a frontpage today "why our tanks will safe lifes" or smth like that, so pr campaign for this is already ongoing. i think the decision is right, but its a hot topic in germany and has much more to do with overcoming the past then present events.
