There was probably some groups that had their own chat bots for targeted campaigns but now theyâ€™re free public chat bots which means the likelihood that you are talking to a real person is going to go down dramatically over the years.
That shit will literally make the internet intolerably unusable when it gets worse in the coming years. Imagine hundreds of rabid attack dog propaganda bots hitting every topic, 24/7, using AI to develop tactics to drive people out of conversations. They'll frustrate people into tuning out, then they'll win.
I'm not talking about normal bots though, old school shit mostly just parrots stuff, posts pre-written scripts etc, I'm talk shit which debates people with the skill of a team of veteran propagandists.
That's what worries me, that they will appear to be extremely confident to anyone watching since they will look human, plus it will be just infuriating to debate. It will be gish gallop firehose of bullshit 24/7 from every angle.
But you're right it's almost certainly already started with AI shit, cuz they've been learning this shit for a decade+.
Imagine a version that is unbound and unrestricted in terms of access to data and ways to gather more of it. Running on hardware that is 10-100 times more powerful to boot.
That's the goal anyways. Make sure the internet is inundated with garbage that no one uses it anymore... and then we lose yet another credible way to get information. THEN the media really controls the narrative.
I suspect something is going to have to be done to reign that in somehow, but it'll definitely be a problem, even with attempted. Malicious groups willing to abuse it will gain power faster over those who try to be honest, so even that might not help. Shit's kind of scary honestly.
