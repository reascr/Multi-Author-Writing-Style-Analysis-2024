I believe the NHS workers are telling the truth about their wages not keeping up with inflation, especially with the 10% increase of inflation. They are being asked to work harder than ever.
That's a shame because they are responsible for saving lives. My neighbor was critically ill here in the US and the male nurse he had didn't leave his room almost the whole day, 12 hours.
edit: I mean if it isn't medically necessary, nurses don't sit 12 hours in a room to comfort or keep someone company.
That's interesting because I've always thought that it was common. He was older, in his sixties and had an emergency bypass after something went wrong when he was getting stents. I'm not sure if he was in a recovery room or ICU but there was a window to watch.
The nurse was checking him and writing the whole time and that was his only patient. Anyway I was very impressed and wrote a nice spiel to the hospital administration which was probably worth nothing.
He also got some kind of temporary mental problem and told me during the night the operating room was bringing in horses for operations. He wanted to get out of the hospital because he thought they were going to kill him. Even when he got home he was mentally off for about a week, but came back to normal.
And nice to know about the postoperative deliriium. It was the strangest thing. I told him to talk to his doctor about the horses but he wouldn't because he thought it was a secret and they would kill him. When we got him home a neighbor made a tent on his bed and that made him feel more secure.
