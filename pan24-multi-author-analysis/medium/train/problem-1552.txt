The hardest part is likely that a lot of people are going to die from this. CCP sucks donkey dick, but not because of their zero COVID policy. Like a lot of people were dying under the zero COVID policy so I’m afraid to see what happens now. CCP just needed to do a much better job with their zero COVID policy and support when isolated.
Their government is a lot of the Soviets. People shit in capitalism, but it is human nature to innovate for their personal gain. The key is just balancing it with helping everybody. And the CCP doesn’t know how to do this.
Their socialism is just “keep the CCP in power. China 1” and not “the people own the means” Or “help the people”.

So much for central planning. Certainly it would have been smarter to relax restrictions in the summer rather than in the middle of flu/covid season. They clearly didn't plan anything and are being forced into this. What a bunch of morons.
