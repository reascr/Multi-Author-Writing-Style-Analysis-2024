Russia lost a substantial number of armored units during the First Chechen War as well, these issues have been endemic to their equipment since the beginning, and their tactics haven't adapted to account for it either the way that modern US tank battalions operate. All you have to do is look at the Gulf War during the massive tank battle that took place, to see the disparity. The US had 23 M1A1 Abrams tanks that were either damaged or destroyed, and of the 9 that were destroyed, two of them were intentionally scuttled by their crew to prevent capture, and the other 7 were blue on blue incidents. In comparison, the Iraqis lost hundreds of T72s, T62s, etc... IDK the numbers for how the M60 performed, since it also saw tank on tank combat during that war, but my memory is that it also performed extremely well, in large part due to the use of the same tactics, where you only expose yourself visibly to the enemy when you move into view to fire, before pulling back behind terrain cover. Iraqis were not doing this in comparison, and so it was easy to just pick them off one by one, with combined direct tank fire and ballistic artillery strikes.
Hitler ultimately blamed his own downfall on the German people, and I expect Putin will eventually the same to the Russian people (if he hasn't already).
Yeah but this time Medvedev hopes to capture it. The next news update will be “A heavily armed Medvedev was seen crossing the border into Ukraine after a long montage of him strapping knives everywhere and tying a red bandanna around his forehead. Upon reaching the border he commented ‘Aa Ukraine, I’m your worst nightmare’ and immediately charged into the brush.”.
