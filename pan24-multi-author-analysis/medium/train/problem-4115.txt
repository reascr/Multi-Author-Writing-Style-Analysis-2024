MMRCA 2.0 will be last purchase, with orders for most probably Rafale F4s with ISEs. Now the numbers can vary. Also they will bought via Make In India route. So the planes would be manufactured in India with ToT.
MiG-29K is what they're already using, and they loathe it. Rafale is literally too big to fit on the elevators of the carrier. F/A-18E fits with its wings folded up.
Vikrant's elevator is 10M wide (and you can measure it yourself on Google Maps). Rafale M doesn't have folding wings, and has a 10.9M wingspan. F/A-18E wingspan when folded is just over 9M. Rafale literally doesn't fit.
If you talk about Fighter, most probably this is the last purchase. We will be going Indigenous. Maybe still buy tankers and transports but fighters are pretty much done.
General guess is that Dassault will just say "remove the winip launchers and you'll be fine", but then you're cutting off 2 of its 14 total munitions points, and the only 2 that can carry the Magic II, which is still a primary IR missile for India.
