Yeah they gonna be raped. Most of these woman are probably already sexual assault survivors it'll just be a little more terror and indignity before they escape, are murdered or die on the front lines.
I don't really want to think about what's going to happen when these new "snipers" arrive among 40,000 male convicts and the rapiest army in the modern world.
"Snipers", right. You can't just take a random woman, or man, out of a cellblock, give them a rifle and expect them to operate as snipers. Snipers need talent and training. Wagner knows that.
I know. I didn't say women can't be snipers. I'm saying you can't put a rifle in a random convict's hands and make them an effective sniper. That's more true today than it was in the old days.
It's an absurd plan. Maybe Wagner is just doing it for PR to harken back to the Great Patriotic War. But even if that is the intent of the decision makers, these women are going to get raped. Unless the whole thing is a lie and there are no women. That's really the best case scenario.
You really think they would let these women be out and alone? Theyâ€™ll be partnered with the veterans on the front lines and expected to share the same sleeping bag.
