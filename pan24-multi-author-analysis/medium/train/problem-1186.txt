I try to avoid remembering any details regarding the Trump presidency, but it's worth noting here. The reason they were bad for the country wasn't just malice, or hatred, or any of the other shit they did. They were flat-out incompetent by almost every possible measure. They could accidentally explode things that didn't need touched, regularly.

And sadly that same incompetence was also the closest thing they had to a redeeming trait. Because that incompetence kept them from doing so much more horrible shit.
