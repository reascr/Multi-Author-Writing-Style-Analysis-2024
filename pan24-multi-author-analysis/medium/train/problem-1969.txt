Health insurance makes their highest margin on healthy people who are priced out of getting checkups and when they do get sick don’t have the resources to contest claim denials. Having people sick doesn’t make them money.

We are running out of things to consume with 9billion people on the planet. It will inevitably be each other.

Apologies in advance. Whiskey is hitting hard.
