I know for a fact the military was not thinking the balloon is filled with bioweapons. The military knows exactly what the balloon is for, and where it originated. FYI- it's for atmospheric mapping for a project China has been working on for years, basically for simulating military communication loss over water (Advanced Refractive Effects Prediction System). They've been sending these balloons around China's Eastern theater a lot recently. It freaked out Taiwan last year and made the news. We've been doing stratospheric balloon monitoring/spying tests,most recently in New Zealand. Today, it came out that Chinese balloons have crossed our hemisphere 4 times in the last few years. The military consensus is they aren't a danger, in the crazy way you are thinking. They are likely for spying and psychological ops (see how we react). The biggest imminent danger is one rapidly deflating and hitting a populated area, because of their size.
I think the general opinion at the time was that it should of been blown out of the sky over Billings, Montana while there was nothing of value below.
I have the news on in the background, toggled between CNN, MSNBC, and Fox (I like seeing what the gamut is covering) while I'm working, plus peruse Reddit semi often, and haven't yet come across anything mentioning that.
