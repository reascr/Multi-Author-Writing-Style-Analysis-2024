Yes but like I said, you would expect pretty serious symptoms, such as is the case with Turner syndrome. 1 X chromosome in females is deleted leading to heart and kidney defects, slowed growth, etc.
Article says the cat is "tabby-and-white" which likely means it it's a which are almost exclusively genetically female due to . Those that are not female probably have whatever the cat equivalent to is and are therefore still subject to X-inactivation.
I guess it would just be XX or XY like normal. Deletion of a chromosome / major mutations would most likely be lethal to the animal and it wouldn’t have been born in the first place, or would have additional health problems. So I expect some mutations across the genome.
It’s the same as if a man or woman were born without an arm, they would still be genetically man or woman despite the failure of a limb to develop.
Edit: As someone else mentioned, there could have been a chromosome duplication event. You would probably expect more side effects in this too, however.
