I’m not trying to be one sided here, but if you look at the actions of each side in this conflict it’s pretty clear which one is the aggressor and which one is the defender. Even with your perspective, thinking that Russias actions are on some kind of moral equivalency is beyond ridiculous. There is no justification for the way they have conducted themselves in this conflict.
Look at the size of exports from the Russian economy compared to the US and China. Russia is grouped together with that of Spain, Italy, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil.
United States, China, Germany and Japan have come to play and Russia is in another class entirely. This is why you'll see these 4 dominating the news cycles right now.
If you think about it from a playground perspective and imagine these countries as individual children.. it really is a funny image. Just one angry child with 4 other calmer kids being like "dude chill it's just yu-gi-oh" and the angry kids like "BUT I WANT EXODIA AAAHHHH" then rages.
