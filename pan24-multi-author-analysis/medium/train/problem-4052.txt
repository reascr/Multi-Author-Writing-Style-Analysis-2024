We learned in the Navy that someone found a radium pencil-shaped object used for taking x-rays of steam pipes, put it in their pocket ad brought it home and put it in the silverware drawer. This was maybe in the 60s.
Grandma died, then grandpa, then the kids, the mom. The dad who found it got his butt melted off from where he had transported it in his back pocket. Then he died.
It was not at a scrapyard. One of the thieves brought the capsule home , they perforated it and saw a glowing material inside, behing stupid morons they invited other people to take a shot at cracking the capsule open thinking the stuff inside was valuable. They made a mess and a 6yo kid smeared some dust on themselves. Kid died mom died fucking idiot dad survived.
I guess I'm just commenting to say if it weren't for education, there's probably a decent number of us who would do it. It would be so cool until the burns, sickness and dying.
I love things that glow. Fortunately I have learned better and if I saw glowing dust and didn't know what it was, I wouldn't touch it. If I was younger though, I would've slathered myself in glowing dust or liquid with gusto! Not my face, because then I couldn't see it, but my arms, my clothes, etc.
Minor correction... You will be dead in awhile, a painful while. Far too much of awhile for anyone to be comfortable with. But definitely start thinking about who gets the house/money/cars.
It was military confidential at the time I learned it, which was around 1987. Details are honestly a bit fuzzy, but the story was tame compared to many other incidents they taught us, some of which are heavily documented. So I've no reason to doubt it, other than my recollection.
