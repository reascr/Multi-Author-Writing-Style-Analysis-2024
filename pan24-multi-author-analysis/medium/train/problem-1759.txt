More than that, Western countries and their allies need to band together against Chinese bullying. They have played a successful game of picking off individual countries to punish them for various "transgressions" (visit by Dalai Lama, Taiwan, etc.). We need some kind of economic NATO against China to counter that behavior and make it more costly to China. And urgently, reduce our reliance for manufacturing on them. It was a mistake to let them in the WTO. I'd rather have respect for human rights and international law and norms than cheap trinkets from that shit country (which it is under Xi).
Xi Jinping, as we see in this video and hear im his quivering voice, is a very weak man. I feel sorry for his constituents and hope his health improves. However, even if he regains his health (which is very poor from the looks of it), his leadership will still remain weak and powerless.
Nah canada is a leading country when it comes time to dealing with chinas shit. They are a trading partner but we have laws in place that stop other countries to do to us what china is doing to europe and the US. CHINA cant hold canada by the balls and they hate it.
