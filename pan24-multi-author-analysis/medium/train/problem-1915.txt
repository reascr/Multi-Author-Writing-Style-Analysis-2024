Zelenskyy on the Day of Dignity and Freedom: "No one has succeeded and will never succeed to take our freedom away. I said these words in the same place on the same day exactly one year ago. What has changed?  A lot. Craters on our land. Roadblocks, anti-tank hedgehogs. Cold in our homes. But these have not changed the most important thing. Ukrainians are not used to surrendering. They have dignity. And therefore - freedom We will overcome everything. Endure. Survive. Prevail".
"Everyone saw what defenders we have. For the last eight years. What our civilians are capable of. How they go to rallies under the occupation and stop enemy tanks with bare hands. What kind of children we have. How they sell drawings, collecting money for the Armed Forces. How a girl with shot legs drives a car for 15 km to take out wounded adults.".
