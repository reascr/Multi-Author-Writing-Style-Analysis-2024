The TCJA had several provisions that have already expired (Some of those happened in 2021 and 2022). At least one more will expire in 2023 (HTF) and most of the rest are done when the TCJA will fully expire in 2025 (23 provisions IIRC). The TCJA was made to expire the years after a presidential election. Now my belief of them doing this was to be able to point to increased taxes after a non-republican president and convince as many independents as possible that it was the new president's fault for the increased taxes. Do I have proof of this? No, but my empirical evidence hasn't been proven wrong yet.
