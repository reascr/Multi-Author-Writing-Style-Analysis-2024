This calls out one of my big issues with contemporary media. Journalists coming out of school no longer cut their teeth on city council meetings or any other slew of local issues. Journalism students, and journalism in general, used to be way more blue collar. Grind it out for the stories, you know? Now it’s much more of an Ivy League, ivory tower profession. The graduating students want to be the next Woodward so they use mommy and daddy connections to get placed at the Times or other big outlets because those are the only ones that get views and because, well, local news is beneath them. There’s been a noticeable downturn in investigative journalism which has caused a rise in local corruption around the country because there just isn’t enough of a media presence to hold elected officials accountable. And then that translates to the country at large. It’s not the cause of our current predicament, but it’s certainly a factor.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
