In 2019, trump demanded an extra $8 billion for his border wall at the last minute, after a deal over the debt ceiling was already agreed. Democrats would of given the extra $8 billion to him if the Republicans had just asked for it at the start. But because trump wanted to make a show about it, Democrats pushed back and let the government go into a shutdown. The government was shut down for about 30 days. I was on a trip during that time and we couldn't go to any national park we had planned to go to. Also all the poor airport security staff weren't getting paid during that time, all because the president didn't get his way and had a temper tantrum.
