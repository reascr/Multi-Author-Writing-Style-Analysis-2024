This is just a regurgitation of an interview with Evening Moscow, a blatant Russian propaganda attempt.
>"Until the very last moment I hoped that Miss Russia would come up to me and say sorry, but she only came up to me to get a selfie for what I think were propaganda purposes," Apanesenko told the Daily Beast. "Miss Russia did not say a word about the war. People told me it would be dangerous for her.".
it's besides the point anyway. a gesture of solidarity would be nice, but an expectation of an apology is uncalled for.
wouldn't it be really awkward if you were in an international competition and someone came up and apologized to you because your countries are at war, idk.
edit: to clarify, I think a display of solidarity would have been a great gesture, and I think it's fucked up if Miss Russia is using the seemingly innocuous selfies to push some propaganda back home, just saying that expecting an apology from someone who's ostensibly your coworker for their government's actions that they had nothing to do with is ridiculous.
idk man, it's weird, I don't expect American or British athletes to fall over themselves going around apologizing to everyone from a country their country has fucked with, it would take ages for one thing.
UK is still occupying part of Ireland, continues to sit on stolen African wealth, and how many countries is the USA actively bombing?
y'all are grasping at air trying to defend this Russian propaganda actor because Miss Ukraine said she didn't even show show sympathy before trying to take a selfie with her.
doesn't say a word about oh, idk THE WAR THEIR COUNTRY IS WAGING, let's just ignore that and take selfies together definitely not for propaganda!
I don't think it's necessary to present Russia in a better or kinder light, and it certainly wouldn't be that woman's responsibility. it's a beauty pageant.
