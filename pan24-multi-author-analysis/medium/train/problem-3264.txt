I never understood why news or even fucking treaties in some cases need to emphasize that. Of course a missile is nuclear capable as long as it isn't the one of those little hobby-rockets. Anything that can carry a certain minimal load is nuclear capable. The missile just transports the bomb; the bomb doesn't care how it arrives at the target.
I once read this fan theory that Road Runner was a reality warping being and Coyote was immortal. It made a lot of sense, even if the end result is really just "THEY ARE CARTOONS!".
The truth is that the roadrunner Coyote dynamic was a metaphor for the constant struggle between good and evil. I donâ€™t even think coyote was necessarily the evil one here. Roadrunner could very well have been the devil while god kept trying to stop his trickery. And that is what I scream through the bars of every kindergarten schoolyard I walk by during recess.
Tbf there was a few times where Wile E was freaked out by the Roadrunner doing a MEEP behind him, leading to the Roadrunner being an indirect cause for his accidents sometimes.
