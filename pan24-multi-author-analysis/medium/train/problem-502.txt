But, Jerome Powell said himself they need downward pressure on wages and increased unemployment. If you keep wage growth pegged to the ideal inflation of 2% wages never grow for those on the bottom rung. Wages for the lowest earners have remained effectively stagnant while C suite pay packages explode. I understand that rate hikes in stated purpose are to slow the economy by making borrowing more expensive but there are also other effects intended. Especially when you pretend the only cause of inflation is too much money and too much demand. Which from the beginning was not the case with this inflation. It was started by massive supply chain issues compounded by Russiaâ€™s invasion and profiteering. CEOs have been crowing about it in earnings calls.
