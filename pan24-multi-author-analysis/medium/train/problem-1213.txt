"Wait, wait, we can't do anything We need to flip the LITTLE FISH first We can't just go arresting criminals That's not how ANY of this works Yeah yeah we know who did it and how they did it, blah blah blah. That doesn't MATTER. you know what matters? Flipping FISH. Look, you can have the President on camera stealing documents. You know he did it, everyone knows. But you gotta interrogate from the bottom UP. Just interrogate every American, to flip every little fish. you don't just arrest the criminal who did it, that's... you know. That's easy. You have to flip the little fish!
