If RNC moves their primary to SC first as well, Nancy Mace actually has a really good shot. While we do have a truly embarrassing and terrifying amount of Trump support here, there are enough moderates/primary jumpers who would rather her be the candidate than Trump, for whatever reason. (SC has open primaries you do not have to be registered with a party to vote in their primary, but you can only vote in one party primary per election year. That's for the state at least. I haven't lived here long enough to know how the federal election primary works - there was no R primary in 2020 at the federal level.).
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
