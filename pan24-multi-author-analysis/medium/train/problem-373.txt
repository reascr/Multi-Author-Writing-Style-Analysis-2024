Obviously often not the brightest people, but often it was also a language problem or inexperienced travellers. They'd often gone to a travel agency, who'd not told them the plane left at Charleroi. They'd assumed it was Brussels.
Worked at actual Brussels airport years ago. Sometimes had people turn up for Brussels South aka Charleroi.
To everybody not in the know, this is not their biggest country airport, it is one smaller one in Hahn. I flew there in mid 2010s and I was wondering why it is called Frankfurt-Hahn and not just Hahn airport.
Two hours in advance, it's still basically impossible to travel from Brussels to Charleroi and still catch your plane.
Yeah, never mind the money lost, but it must be so heartbreaking to promise your kids some amazing foreign holiday, probably talk about it for months and drive all the way to the airport, only to learn you fucked up and confused the airports. It's only a third-hand anecdote and my heart goes out to those people, I hope they're happy.
So you get some relatively poor family, going on their first holiday in a while. They arrive, suitcases and all, excited to go on a holiday. And then they learn they're at the wrong airport and that their holiday is cancelled.
