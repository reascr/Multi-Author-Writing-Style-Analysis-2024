The oil and gas industries will be around for at least another hundred years, likely longer. Coal is currently still being used worldwide at a record pace. The decrease in fossil fuels will happen, but a lot slower than everyone thinks. Civilization would grind to a halt without them, for the time being.
Of course they are. They see the writing on the wall, the age of fossil fuels will come to an end. They still have time, however, to grab up as much money as possible, squeeze every last drop they can, try to become too big to fail and too integrated to replace so they can draw out their last gasp.
Oil and gas aren't going to completely disappear in any of our lifetimes, but the landscape of that entire industry is going to dramatically change long before it disappears completely, and it won't have to change much before their current models and practices stop yielding the sorts of wild profits they're accustomed to. That's what they're clinging on to.
Being around is a far cry from their current industrial dominance. The horse-drawn buggy industry is "still around," but it's hardly a major force.
