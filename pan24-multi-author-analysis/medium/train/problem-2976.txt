- I don't even own a bed so even if I could afford an apartment idk where do I get the money to buy a bed and whatever.
- can't afford a car(check out the insurance rates for a migrant with g2 and no local driving experience living in Brampton lol) and the crazy zoning makes everything far away so just buying some milk would take me an hour.
On the bright side I lost 10 kilos since coming here(being poor af and walking 5+KMs a day has it's benefits lol).
And regarding you question - no worries! There's plenty of rooms, attics, basements, sheds and other "accomodations" that the locals can rent out to us migrants for a crazy high price üëç.
Five family members in a one bedroom apartment is still better than a bombed out concrete shell with no running water or electricity.
He didn't ask how we were going to pay for it, we know damn well the government's money printer is going brrrr, he asked WHERE will they live, because there is already a shortage of rental units and houses, and we plan on adding 500.000 migrants every year for the next three years. Rent prices are already rising by 12%/year.
Mmmh no I didn't say that, but I'm pretty sure you can fix the lack of housing by uuhh building more public housing, among other things. Are you suggesting they should nothing and pretend it helps?
