Lies. The system should have been go bankrupted 40 years ago. In the 60's, 6 workers used to pay for 1 retired person. The pension was small but that was not enough. With time, pensions became bigger. The ratio became 5-1 in the 80's, 4-1 in the 90's. Today, it's 2-1. In 5 years, it's going to be 1-1. The French system is still working because the French government guarantees all pensions even if there is no money. The cost is about 20 billions of euros/year, right now, 40 billions in 5 years, all paid by the Government. This is why the French government does not want to spend any more money, to reduce their own deficit. Meanwhile, the communists still want to work less and retire earlier, age 50 for some, will full benefits, at least 2000€/month because they claimed they deserve it. I learned that a retired couple is earning 3600€/month in Normandy, spend 900€ in food for the 2 of them, and is still claiming that's not enough for them to live, when most couples WITH children do not even make 3000€/month.
I mean the French people famously are known for quitely accepting massive changes to their social entitlements. He has \A lot\ to lose, especially if this emboldens other parties and can cause issues in a few years.
