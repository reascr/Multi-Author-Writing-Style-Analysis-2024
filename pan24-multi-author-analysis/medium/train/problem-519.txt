Just to give a little bit of context, the group that organized this vigil is an anti-government group that has been holding anti-government rallies even last week. Most of these people don't care about the deaths and they're just using the disaster and the victims to push their political agenda which is quite frankly, disgusting. Calling this protest "South Korea Demands" is akin to calling Qanon protesters "United States protests".
This caused strain on police forces in this district. On top of that, the new president, here after i will call Yoonie loves to have unofficial party with his pals. Resulting in further shortage of the police to keep order.
Yoonie also replaced regular polices with undercover cops looking for illicit drug use. Since the assohole figured that if uniformed cops around the druggies won't be around so he reduced poluce presence.
As a youngster, Yoonie kept failing the bar exam but he persisted because of this spiritual advisor. He finally passed after taking the test 10 times.
