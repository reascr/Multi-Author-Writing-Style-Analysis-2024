I guess we just need a cost projection analysis vs the cost of crediting accounts when people claim a problem.
although that'd make it a hell of easier to be like, "i had three drinks, the driver gave me none" and nobody wants to accept responsibility for where things went missing. but photo could also really backlog a restaurant, too, as a lot of places are just trying to rush things out the door.

Reading r/doordash i've seen that several chains have the driver get the drinks. which is ridiculous to me. every time it comes up, they're all making jokes about how they don't ever select pickups from those places once they learn.
depends on what kind of liability parties agree to. half the time my missing items are not because of the driver but wherever i ordered from was out of something, and just decided instead of a substitution, it'd be better to just not to give me anything at all. or worse, they substitute a product without even contacting me.
i'm cool with restaurants offering and demanding better protections but they also have a lot of responsibility on shit, too. i feel like they often shift all the blame to the driver and it's like... i'm pretty sure when all my drinks are missing that's not just on the driver.
