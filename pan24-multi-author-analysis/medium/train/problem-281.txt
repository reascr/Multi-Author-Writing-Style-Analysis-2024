Campaigning in a single state is much more affordable, and offers the low budget candidate a chance to make a good showing, build support and leverage that into a national campaign.
Such an approach would heavily favor the candidate who has the most money up-front, and disadvantage any less well funded candidate as they would not be able to use early showings to build momentum.

One frequent use of campaign funds is to purchase books that the candidate has written. This effectively launders the money.
Having all the primaries on one day effectually cedes the nomination to one of the biggest money candidates.
I'm in favor of serious campaign finance reform including public financing of campaigns, but very wary of having a single primary day across the nation.
