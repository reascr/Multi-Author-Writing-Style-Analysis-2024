>One of the last remaining slums, the village is a symbol of inequality in Asia's fourth-largest economy just next to the flashy, affluent district of Gangnam.
What makes this even more remarkable is that South Korea doesn’t exactly have a bunch of asylum seekers or immigrants down on their luck like places in North America or Europe, so the vast majority of these people are probably their own citizens. In addition, drug use and availability in South Korea is also a fraction of what it is in the West, so it’s not like these are methed-out crazies or needle-poking zombies like you might see in Vancouver, Berlin or Los Angeles — these are probably mostly just normal people facing hard times. It’s crazy and sad, but South Korea was poorer than colonial Congo within living memory as late as the 60s so I guess it makes sense a part of it is still a festering shithole. I guess when you look closer their economy is pretty much just Samsung, K-Pop, and cheap cars that knockoff Western and Japanese models.
