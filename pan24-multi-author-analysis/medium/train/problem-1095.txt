The most horrifying part is that no matter what side or what reasoning, the girls and women involved are just used as tools in these ongoing battles. Their autonomy and consent is never part of the equation. At the end of the day, the abortions at the hands of the military was more about the destruction of insurgents than it was about doing "right" by these girls and women. In every single case, they threatened more violence unto the women they were "protecting" from their kidnappers who brought the same violence into these girls and women's lives. They threatened them if they did not comply with the military's procedures. It's so damn disturbing what these girls and women went through by Boko Haram and the nightmare didn't end just because their own military held them.
To be fair, everybody in the equation is a complete pawn suffering untold horrors at the mercy of anyone with the tiniest amount of money/power. This is why the region gets destabilized so easily over and over.
The vast vast majority of these women were captured and forcibly "married" to BH insurgents, who regularly beat and raped them. They are now doubly traumatised for the crime of being women in the middle of a brutal fundamentalist conflict.
It's hard to underestimate how conservative and pious the northeasterners are. These allegations will result in entire communities rejecting the authority of the Nigerian state - which, in the northeast, is almost exclusively represented by the army outside of the major cities/state capitals. An extremely counterproductive move that will weaken Abuja's attempts to win the trust and consent to govern from the northeast population.
