Did the judge rubber stamp the warrant or did he have valid probable cause to sign it, based on what the cops said to him?
True.. the false narratives you bought into, & signed off on got an innocent woman killed, people remembered. & THAT, my dear fuck stick, is what lost you your re-election bid. So, yes, technically the truth. The long way around.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

If I'm missing any parts that would make the judge just as guilty, then can someone chime in? Not really defending the judge as much as wanting a fuller picture of what the judge may had done that was wrong.
