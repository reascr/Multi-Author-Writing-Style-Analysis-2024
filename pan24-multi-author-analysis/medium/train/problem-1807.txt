Please show examples of Iranian protesters calling for America to invade. Just because they dislike their government doesn’t mean they’d support a foreign army invading their country. Half the US population was very unhappy with the last US administration, nobody called for Canada to invade. You have a very simplistic view of the world if you think armed invasion is the answer to civil issues in a sovereign nation.
Not invasion but help the people. Or should we just keep letting them execute protesters? It’s like your angry that I’m angry that innocent people are dying. They are being killed for unjust reasons. Therefore, it makes sense to me to offer whatever help they feel they need. Be it military economic or political. What’s wrong with that? I’m not saying rule over them. I’m saying find out how we can assist them in ruling over themselves.
I’m going to refer you to your own comment where you said “why in tf don’t we go topple the regime ourselves”. Please don’t move the goalposts. We tried helping Iraq rule over itself too, and how did that work out for us. We have zero political sway over the current Iranian government and any military assistance we provide would feed into the implication that the west is behind the protests. Unfortunately, this fight is one Iranians need to fight alone.
