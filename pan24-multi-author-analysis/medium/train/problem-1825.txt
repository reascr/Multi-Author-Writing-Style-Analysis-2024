Authoritarian followers are true believers who think they’re right and good on a metaphysical level. To them, the rest of us don’t deserve honesty because we’re all deluded commies or (since most are Christian zealots) outright servants of Satan.
Now they openly criticize the military. It is too woke, it is worthless, it is a corrupt machine, etc. They repeat Russian and Timothy McVeigh talking points and think they are entertaining new ideas.
These are the same people saying how strong Russia's army is because they reject "wokeness" and are big tough manly men. Funny how incredibly horribly wrong that turned out to be, but of course they would never admit to that.
Calling out hypocrisy in authoritarians is pointless. They know they’re hypocrites; they don’t care. If anything, they enjoy being hypocritical because it annoys the rest of us.
Authoritarian leaders don’t care about hypocrisy because they know that the only thing that matters is power. Honesty, integrity, legality, logic … all of these things are irrelevant.
