The Republican want total control of the process to determine elections in states and use culture wars to get it. They've been doing this for 50 years, so really, it's not shortsighted.
i still remember when republicans had full control of Congress under trump and had the biggest shutdown of all time. it showed that they can't even negotiate amongst themselves (which we continue to see), and they're willing to let the whole thing crash and burn.
