I was in Vegas on the strip this summer on vacation, and just walking around I witnessed two crimes in the middle of the day around noon. One lady had her purse snatched, and a homeless guy dressed as a clown was assaulted by a black tourist passing by who just didn't like him for some reason. Police were no where to be found, never saw them at all on the strip. I know this is just a personal anecdote, but if the strip is this unsafe during the day I can only imagine how bad it is at night. I went to my hotel room after 9 PM.
