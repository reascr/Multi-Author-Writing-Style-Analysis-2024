Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) dished on her fateful bathroom confrontation with fellow right-wing firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) Wednesday, telling conservative radio host Dana Loesch that she felt her counterpart was being “nasty” during the party’s contentious voting process to elect a House speaker.
