Wanting an explanation doesn't mean I'm going to agree with any explanation given. What if you responded saying: "The reason Americans are so obsessed with guns is actually because Julie Andrews is secretly the leader of the Illuminati and it heavily influences people at all levels to champion gun rights in order to overthrow the government.".

As a Brit, I honestly do not understand why the American right's obsession with guns is so significant that they'd be willing to take it this far. In virtually any other country, regardless of political position, this would seem like an obviously bad idea.
