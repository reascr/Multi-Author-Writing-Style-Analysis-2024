I would be willing to bet that a large portion of those who identify as Christians are not religious -- a vestige of an upbringing that they never really latched onto but kept around as an identifier. But I'm in (probably) the least religious area of the country, so I just don't run into many loud and proud cult-y types.
I live in the south and it was more than a bit of a culture shock moving here. The vast majority of my coworkers have mentioned church going activities on Sundays, work lunches or picnics involve a blessing before you eat, in small towns all the shops and restaurants are closed on Sunday.
True, you can question all you want, but at some point the answers start coming back that you simply must "have faith". Which isn't something we should have in politics.
Ill take it. My wife will sew the funky robes. We will matter of factly state obvious ways to be nice to people. Our holy book will be the stuff we tell our children. Dont steal, be generous...
Step 1. I'm a materialist through and through. Bricks and mortar, petrie dishes, law of thermodynamics. I still could invoke God, but only within the confines of the divine order of the universe. Life is the universe observing itself. An indivisible whole. You and I are divine, as is every moment in time, grain of sand, and tear shed.
While I would describe them as proud, it's not overly in your face. I haven't been to church in over a decade and while I don't broadcast that (it's not important to me either way but it clearly is to many of them), I also don't find it to be overly cult-y and loud. I haven't been pressed on the fact that I don't join in those discussions.
That's fine. Religion is engrained into so many as something you don't question, just have faith, basically from birth. Connecting faith and politics is always dangerous as you should always be questioning those with or seeking power.
