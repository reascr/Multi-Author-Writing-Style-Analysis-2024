A rather interesting way to react to losing an election in a landslide.... Can you imagine if that maniac actually won?

After leaving prison, Peña had his voting rights restored but not his firearms rights. And his lawsuit is why a felony conviction doesn't disqualify someone from seeking elected office in New Mexico.
We know that two were arrested at one address, so that's the "father and son with their own criminal histories". CNN identified them as Dimitrio and José Trujillo. José was driving Peña's car, with some guns and fentanyl in his possession, when arrested about 40 minutes after one of the shootings. He's being prosecuted separately on arising from that arrest.
It will be interesting to see in the course of political history what Peña's case does to the cause of civil rights advocacy for former felons.
