Trying to be a “seer” with the law and judicial system is awful. If SCOTUS declined to hear it as is; TX judge wins. Very unlikely as it sets a precedent that any small business in 2020 can sue for not being qualified for PPP loans. My belief is that it will be picked up by another circuit court that will say the standings in this decision do not hold on their own and the precedent would be too shaky. Judge or plaintiff appeals THAT ruling and Scotus declines to hear? Tx judge loses. I think his ruling will not stand, it’s just a matter of who will cut the cord.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
