Arguments against mandatory sentencing include: (1) sentences are often greatly disproportionate to the severity of the offense; (2) the focus on particular kinds of offenses has tended to have a major negative impact upon certain categories of offenders and particular social groups; (3) removing discretion from judges shifts it toward the police and prosecution; (4) the severity of punishment under mandatory sentencing may lead offenders to actively contest charges against them, leading to increased workloads for courts and creating major drains on legal aid services; (5) it may cause erosion of natural justice as part of the plea bargaining process; (6) punishment is not particularly effective as a general deterrent, or even as a deterrent for specific offenders; (7) putting people in prison is expensive; (8) there is little evidence that the policy reduces crime; (9) it does little if anything for victims; and (10) there are less expensive and more effective alternatives to prison.
