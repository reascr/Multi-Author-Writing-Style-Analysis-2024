The real question should not be about how Democrats won, but how the fuck did a candidate like Walker pose a real threat to a candidate like Warnock. How did America get fucking dumb? Has America finally reached Terminal Stupidity? Barely scraping out a win against Herschel Walker is like a grown man barely beating an infant in a Greco-Roman wrestling match.
Joe B has been doing this for 50 years so he deserves some credit but thank God it was Reverend Warnock in the special election. Instead of Ossoff. I think he's much stronger candidate.
Serious question: could a werewolf eat zombies and be fine? Or would we get werezombies? I’m pretty sure vampires wouldn’t be able to feed on a zombie, but I’m not sure about werewolves.
And there is no shortages of profoundly dumb people in many,many States who call the GOP home. It’s not that the Dems found any kind of strategy other than to throw $130million at the race.

Yeah, that’s kind of what I was thinking. Vampires wouldn’t be harmed by zombies, they just wouldn’t wouldn’t have any nutritional benefits for them.
Wolves in the wild will eat rotting carcasses, so it stands to reason they could feed on a zombie. However, if the werewolf in question has, say a cut in it’s mouth or gets some zombie juice in it’s eye (like 28 days later), I think you might get a werezombie.
So, I think werezombies are rare, but possible, just like a Democrat winning an election in Georgia.
