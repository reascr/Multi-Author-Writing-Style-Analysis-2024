It is hard to find the right balance of how much explaining you need to do to people who aren't interested in understanding. Having spent multiple years trying to answer fools according to their folly, I think it is high time that people stop pretending that these arguments are being made in good faith and that there is any possibility of reasoning people out of something that they did not recent themselves into.
It feels as though most of the people who repeat these arguments ad nauseam our intentionally trying to distract from the origins of the First Amendment is related to John Milton's Areopagitica in which it was argued that bad books should be allowed to be printed for the purposes of seeing that Witch is wrong and being able to find that which is right by observing that which is not right. He also made these arguments with the specific intent that authors and Publishers should be held accountable for mischievous or libelous works that they produce.
