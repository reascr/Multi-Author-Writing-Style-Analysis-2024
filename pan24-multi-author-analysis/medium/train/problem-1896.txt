Legitimate republics. There are no democracies on the planet. People don't vote for rules and laws. Switzerland comes close with regular referendums.
no... democractic governments are referred to as democracies... because theyre democratic, you see? yes, even if they are republics.
My point was more that India was ruled by non Indian powers for quite a few centuries so the not well "received part" has a pretty multi faceted aspect about it. Both in earnest and more ironically.
There were ganas that were republics. And a large percentage of them had widespread franchise for the citizenry. It was before the advent of kingdoms like that of Ajatshatru or Mahapadmananda so you might have forgotten about them.
However little, the difference has to be made or the words lose their meaning and you end up with the Democratic peoples republic of Korea.
i have to explain it to you like youre 5 because your belief that dictatorships can be democratic demonstrates a near-zero understanding of what a democracy means. it does not mean "one or more humans voted at some point".
It does not mean the whole population has to participate for it to count, so yes 2 votes is enough. Nor does there have to be a choice, just votes.
