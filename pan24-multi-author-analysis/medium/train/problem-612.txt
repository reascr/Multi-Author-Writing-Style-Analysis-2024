...where large companies gradually take over governments with their own police force, army, legislative institution, lobby or rather direct influence that effectively controls politicians, and so on.
What you sometimes get (and let's say there's some debate about where America is on this spectrum), are situations where the government and companies are TRULY separate entities and are pulling away from each other as they compete for power within a society and government finds itself increasingly unable to control a company.
If you want to think about it like an org chart, if Biden woke up today and said, "you know what, screw Apple, I want the CEO gone, I want them to move all their production to America, I want my face to come pre-loaded as the lock screen image" can he pull that off? No, not a chance. If Putin wanted the equivalent from Gazprom? One phone call and every barrel of oil will have his face on the side and the CEO will fall out of a window onto seven bullets that just so happened to have been laying on the cement facing up exactly where he fell.
My point was rather, they could decide and dictate something rather radical and unexpected, and they would "make it work", because otherwise you end up in prison or worse.
Yesterday I thought about the advantages that e.g. China and Russia have in terms of one-party systems, censorship, etc. (basically controlling or at least heavily overreaching into personal life and business).
If Russia this seems quite similar, the advantage those systems have is that if for example their leader would be very much into environmental protection or far better nutrition for all their people (I mean healthier people) they would just be able to make this a government priority and everyone's issue by law.
