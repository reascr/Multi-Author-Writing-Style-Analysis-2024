The UN already drowns under a blanket, too many nations think shared world rules don’t apply to them because they are big or special or whatever.
It’s sort of a natural consequence of how the UN operates in regards to Israel. They spend a lot of time and energy passing resolutions condemning Israel, far more than any other country, and for at least a few years now more than all other countries combined. You can criticize Israel and still think that’s nuts, and still understand why Israel would stop listening to the UN.
Ikr If you deny them them the ability to address their grievances through the proper channel you are just going to encourage them to address their grievances through improper channels.
When the UN continuously singles out a country and demands it act against its interests it should shock no one when they are taking less seriously by that country with each bad faith action. This is freshman level politics. And the UN is flunking out.
The UN’s only power is persuasion. They have no enforcement capabilities. Empty demands make them look weak. And looking weak is being weak. Diplomacy 101.
This isn’t just about Israel. The UN is increasingly reflecting a growing authoritarian trend in the world. That’s not in the world’s interest.
