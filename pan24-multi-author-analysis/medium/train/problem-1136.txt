Most Presidential prospects delay filing as long as they can because they're under much stricter rules for fundraising and reporting once they're official candidates.
He has the implied media support of both the party and conservative media behind him causing such a furore that the DOJ may well determine that it just isn't worth the effort until he either loses or drops out (or worse, wins and stops being president after one or even two terms...).
He's safe as long as he has political clout to throw around, and certain charges will have statutes of limitation that he may be able to run out while we wait.

Couldn't agree more. Personally I think Trump only declared so early because it would afford him a degree of protection from prosecution. Dragging a retired golf cart warmer into court is one thing, dragging an active presidential candidate is quite another.
He's not serious, no touring or rallies, no hobnobbing with Kingmakers, he hasn't even hired any campaign staff yet.
Compare that to his last run which I still believe he didn't want to win either and there's no work happening. He gambled and lost by winning a presidency he never wanted and now he needs the same political clout that keeps Matt Gaetz out of jail (while getting his co-conspirator convicted).
