The father of the 22 year old karate champion that the regime champion recently went to the judge and begged him to change his decision as his son was innocent. The judge just responded with “Are you asking me to overturn gods judgement?!”.
It may not be much, but if the people can force them to change a decision, that means there's blood in the water. It shows the regime is not all powerful and protests and riots and civil action works.
They went ahead and hanged him along with a 39 year volunteer martial arts coach who taught poor kids.
Keep in mind Iran has, by far and away, more reported executions every year than any other country. They have normalized executions as an everyday occurrence for so long they are all sick in their heads.
I don’t think there are words in the English language for me to describe my hatred for the Iranian regime.
I assume they are using apostasy as a blanket to cover all protesters, except protesting against something the Quran does not require is not apostasy. Essentially the Quran says women need to cover their head not their face. So the Iranian regime is making up bullshit to justify all the executions.
Even worse is they use cranes and drop floors so the people being executed suffer more. Like how fucking sick are these people?
