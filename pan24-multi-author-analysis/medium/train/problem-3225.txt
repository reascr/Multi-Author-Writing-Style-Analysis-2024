Nurses in the UK make an average of about 17gbp or $23 per hour. As a US nurse I'd never stay in the profession for such low pay. Hope it works out for them.
Nah, nurses do not pay “through the nose” for health insurance and a lot of people don’t either. Many employer plans are pretty damn good, and as a nurse I pretty much get free healthcare.
For Registered Nurses and not LPN - Minnesota $29-$40ish in a nursing home, $37-65 in a hospital. Not sure about home care but probably similar to nursing home. MN is fairly high on average for the US. Cali and some higher COL areas you may see $50-60 as the average, with as low as $25 in other states. Source - RN sitting at work in a major hospital.
Have to take into account that Americans pay through the nose for health insurance and other costs. Realistically you need to mentally half or do 2/3rds of any US wage you see to compare to a European.
I take home about 77% of my pre-tax earnings. I really think it depends on where you work but I personally do not pay anything out of pocket for my health insurance. This of course is not the same for everyone in the U.S.
So when you turn 65 in the US you get government healthcare called Medicare which is quite good. So that being said, 65 is the normal retirement age for most people.
Also, employers aren’t the only place to get health insurance. You can also purchase insurance from the government which varies in quality but is generally ok.
If you develop a chronic illness usually there are long term disinhibition or illness health plans that you can opt into from your employer, they usually aren’t expensive at all and provide decent coverage.
If you develop a chronic illness or disease you can still get insurance, insurance companies cannot refuse you insurance.
