I don't know why this is surprising to people. Most people across Africa have a deep distrust for the "West" and would rather support our enemy's enemy. It certainly didn't help public perception when Obama threatened to place sanctions on South Africa back in 2015. Also, for most South Africans, the Ukraine conflict is just one of many far away conflicts going on in this world and is barely even covered on the news or media in SA. There's already too much drama in SA for most people to concern themselves about something happening 5000 miles away in another continent.
The South African government is more than aware that Russia is run by gangsters and mafias who could easily cripple the country's already frail power grid.
Nothing of note were signed during yesterday's meeting between Sergei Lavrov and his South African counterpart.
Somewhere a South African politician is telling is citizens that the power infrastructure is fine and is definitely good for another 10 years. He then drives off back to Pretoria to meet with some concerned lobbyists about real problems plaguing their country, which is them not having enough profits.
I have work mates in SA who seem to think those in power are on the take in a massive way. I have no clue how true that is but they are quite upset at them.
