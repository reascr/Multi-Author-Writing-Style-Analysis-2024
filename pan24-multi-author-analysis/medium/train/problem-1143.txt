I'd expect that all the defense company lobbyists have been talking the ears off of anyone in Congress about how important it is to keep supporting Ukraine.
This war has be double-Christmas in July for the military industrial complex in the USA. They've been getting to try out all their latest weapon systems in a war against a peer-level adversary. (Though Russia hasn't given nearly as good a showing as we would have expected in 2021.) I judge this for many reasons, not the least of which I keep getting contacts from various defense industry recruiters.
I'm sure all the generals in the Pentagon feel the same way as the defense companies, they want to give out as much as they can to see what it will really do.
So there is likely a lot of, maybe not "pressure", but "influence" to keep the war going behind the scenes.
However, they can use the data on how Russia deals with these 20+ year old weapons systems to make modern US weapon systems even more efficient and lethal, without ever showing the Russians the capability of our newest systems. It is effectively a one way information exchange.
I’m sure the republicans are more than happy to let the other side go to war. They will be criticizing them for it in the news for the next several months.
McCarthy has already said there would be no more Ukrainian aid when he’s speaker. Now he’s too weak to actually enforce that in his caucus but support for Ukraine is not a mainstream bipartisan issue.
