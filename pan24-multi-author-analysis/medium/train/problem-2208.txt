The cult is The People of Praise, a secretive Christian faith group that counts the conservative supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett as a member, considered women's obedience and subservience to men as one of its central early teachings, according to leaked remarks and writings of the wife of one of the group's founders.
Barrett has never tried a case to verdict or argued an appeal in any court, nor has she ever performed any notable pro bono work, even during law school.
She didn’t make the list of potential Supreme Court candidates his campaign released during the 2016 campaign, probably because she’d never been a judge. The president fixed that problem in 2017, when he nominated her for a seat on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.

She was given a unqualified rating by the bar. She was a Trump appointed (Federalist society) activist judge from Cuba. She was groomed by Marco Rubio.. Very little experience, but not as little as Amy Coney Barret who literally never once presided over a case before she was installed as a supreme court justice.
(That was the whole point... all of trump's lawsuits are delaying tactics, by design. His belief is that all his lawsuits can be delayed until after his death.).
Bruh, I hate AmyCB too, but that’s false. She’s been a part of at least 600 cases in the 7th and 8th circuit court, and has written over 100 opinion court decisions.
