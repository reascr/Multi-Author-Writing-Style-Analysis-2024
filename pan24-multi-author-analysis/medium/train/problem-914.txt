No, it's that if the war would last a week or two, then they couldn't have sent support. People needed training a few months just to use himars and the howitzers.
Some ask: "how long can the west keep supporting Ukraine?". It's not just Ukraine they're supporting, they're defending themselves by keeping Russia at bay as strategically as possible. If Ukraine loses, the whole of Europe and US loses. It's not about if they can keep affording to fund and support Ukraine, it's that they can't afford NOT TO.
I mean purely to snub Russia we would've helped them some regardless assuming we didnt think they would just lose all of the equipment into Russian hands. However seeing Russia acting aggressive, someone we already consider a threat, but also being held back by Ukraine the West is feeling more and more confident giving them bigger toys to play with. They dont see it as likely for them to lose them to the Russians, they get to see how well those Toys work on Russian equipment, and they get to watch their enemy get beat up for some pocket change.
