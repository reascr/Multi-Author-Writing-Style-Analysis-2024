I wonder if the HFC started with less numbers and then began to switch sides as a way to create the appearance that he was losing votes when he probably never had them.
Yep one of the republicans voted present (basically abstaining). I think she got to leave for the day though, so she's the smartest republican apparently.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Just a few more abstains and we have Mr. Jeffries as SOH. (I know that's incredibly unlikely. But a girl can dream for however long it takes the GQP to figure their shit out.).
Because it's not clear who everyone will vote for. Most aren't putting their hands up because the next two years are going to be a shitshow. They want to be SOH with a Republican President so they can run the table for their greatest items on the wishlist. That is where the power lies. Not in the circus all the committees are about to become until 2024.
