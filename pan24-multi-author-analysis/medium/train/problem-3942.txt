Neta was always doomed to fail. It's an already limited market. First your audience is limited to the number of people who have computers strong enough to run the software and hardware, which is not all computers. Then you are limited to the people who own a VR headset. It is estimated that a total of 16.4M VR headsets have been sold world wide. Factoring in that some of those headsets may be replacements or upgrades, and that means that market is catering to like under 15M people, compared to the broader PC market of 1.5B people. So VR games really have to stand out. And even if they got every single PC VR gamer to play this game, they would each have to spend on average over a thousand dollars in the metaverse to make it break even, if the 15B dollar cost I heard is accurate.
The chat room is not really what the metaverse is intended to be. The companies that back the concept aim to profit from not just data mining, but creating a pervasive tracking environment where data is freely exchanged between companies for cross promotion and advertising. The social functions are just a justification to try to get people into the ecosystem to be datamined.
