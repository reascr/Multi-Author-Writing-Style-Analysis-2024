I’d say even more. Having grown up in the south with eligibility to join the Daughters of the Confederacy, most people who flew it 20 years ago didn’t even think of racism. It was pride for where they came from and mourning the general loss of the thin veneer of “Southern genteel life” fantasized about in days gone by. It literally didn’t occur to them that it could be seen as racist. Some people only got a clue when a Black person told them what that flag meant to them. Some people still don’t get it. Usually because they’re morons who don’t get a lot of things. And, yeah, some are outright racist, just as our Confederate ancestors intended.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
