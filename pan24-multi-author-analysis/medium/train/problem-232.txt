How on earth does China get to take all of the only mine of it's type in Canada and ship it back home. Isn't this considered a strategic resource? Shouldn't foreign ownership be limited to "friendly" counties who respect our intellectual property laws and human rights?
Afaik, Canada does not have a particularly large EV or battery industry, so we don't have a domestic need for a ton of lithium.
Chile mines a ton of lithium too, and I don't hear anyone complaining that they ship it to other countries for processing.
Here's something to consider: Canada is one of largest producers of Aluminum in the world, but we don't mine any bauxite. We import the ore and refine it into aluminum, but I don't hear anyone complaining that Australia sells us ore.
This is called a global economy, and you can fuck right off with your misinformation and attempt to discredit Canada.
I think the issue is China owns the mine and sends all the benefits back to the mothership. Last time I checked Canadians could not do the same in China.
