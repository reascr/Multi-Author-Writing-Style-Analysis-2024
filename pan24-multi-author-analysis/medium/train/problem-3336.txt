No, this was her announced plan from the beginning. She still denies the election results. She just knows that this only hurts her preferred candidates, as her county is solidly red, and she was delaying the inclusion of their ballots in the official tallies for multiple races. She was never planning to do anything that would potentially prevent her own red county's votes from being counted. This was done as a performative temper tantrum against election results she doesn't like. She hasn't changed her mind at all; she just finished her performance.
