It's finally Friday! That means it's time to sit back, watch some low-stakes streaming comedy in the background, argue about the best variety of brassica oleracea (I'm partial to brussels sprouts), and talk about whatever your heart desires.

So, I’m here to say do not ignore that check engine light for several months. Just spent 2,000$ to fix crap that could’ve been fine had I not put off getting the oil changed.
I am not sure why but it seems like there are no Levi’s jeans that are not made of stretch material out there anymore. Whenever I’ve gone on the website for a specific type, 527 slim boot cuts, it’s always stretch fabric, which loosens so much, and I don’t think they make the good ones anymore, it’s irritating, and the times I have tried to get some on sites like Poshmark, the sellers never respond or are dead accounts that don’t mail them. I don’t know, just feel wound up all of a sudden, want the workday over, feel like packing up my bags for a trip I am taking in late March already. Edit, did listen to Chulahoma by the Black Keys on headphones, that helped.
