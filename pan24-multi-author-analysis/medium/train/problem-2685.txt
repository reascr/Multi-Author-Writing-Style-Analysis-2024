The key to limiting homelessness is to measure it by the number of people who don’t return to homelessness after they are provided resources. This bill targets the elderly, people of color, veterans and children. These groups should be the focus for measuring to the effectiveness of these kinds of initiatives. In other words, of the people who enroll in the program, how many will return to homelessness after a year?
I hope the city can eventually show the stats like “this policy allowed x% of veterans to be permanently housed within the year,” because it could shift the public’s narrative to a more compassionate approach.
