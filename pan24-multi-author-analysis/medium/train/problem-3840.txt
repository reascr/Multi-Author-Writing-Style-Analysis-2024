The regime has guns, the protesters do not. End of the story. Even if those people hate the regime the only thing they see is kids getting killed by them for speaking up. They’ll just stay silent and stay alive. Fear is one of the strongest things a human can feel.
Which is super bad news for the regime. These people know they're likely signing away their lives...which means they literally have no reason left NOT to overthrow the government.
They won’t overthrow it. The protesters are just a few brave young people who have had enough of the government’s shit. They’ll get executed or beaten into submission and then everyone goes back the way it used to be. The majority of the country doesn’t hate the regime as much as they do. It’s sad but it is the truth.
Are you gonna bring an actual argument, like giving me a single reason to feel optimistic? Because throwing insults at people (even if they have a shitty unfunny username like me) isn’t going to convince anyone.
I wouldn’t mind changing my mind if there was any reason to feel optimistic. There isn’t and people are much more eager to laugh at my admittedly shitty and unfunny username than to actually give me one.
