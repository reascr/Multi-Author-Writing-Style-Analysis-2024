> In early July, 2021 – eight weeks before election day – one consular official at an unnamed Chinese diplomatic mission in Canada said Beijing “likes it when the parties in Parliament are fighting with each other, whereas if there is a majority, the party in power can easily implement policies that do not favour the PRC.”.
Personally, I think he has the type of personality and influence that could have actually achieved things on a global stage but he chose not to take hard lines on things and as a result I'm incredibly annoyed at his disappointing leadership. (Although a minority government makes it hard to get anything done, if he had a spine and teamed up with the ndp more then he could have gotten a lot more done).
A lot of people think of him as an acceptable evil in a room full of giant turds. He's ineffectual without being incompetent. Rides the fence as much as possible which just ends up pissing off both sides (the liberal party in canada is centre left btw). Most people think it was better him than a conservative government but would prefer it if he actually did something instead of vague promises.
