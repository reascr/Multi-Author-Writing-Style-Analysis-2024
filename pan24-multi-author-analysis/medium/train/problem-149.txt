Their voters never find out. I started checking Fox News's website most days for a few minutes back at the height of BLM/Pandemic and still do. They live in a false news chamber. It's basically the National Enquirer for liberal blame. They just throw abusive headline after abusive headline. Find a Firefighter that doesnt like Biden? Get a quote and create a headline "Arizona firefighters blast Biden over immigration policy". Doesn't matter that the firefighter couldn't name any policy of Biden's, he watches Fox and knows Biden and liberals are to blame for the open border because they just want the free votes. Which Fox also tells them is happening because a few towns in California decided to let locals vote in local elections if they owned property there whether they were citizens or not. That gets taken out of context so that illegals are voting in our elections state/federal elections when they're not. Over and over.....
We used to have side-by-side coverage of CNN and FOX in our break room at work. Every single Fox headline, every single Fox cover story, was spun to attack the left or to praise conservatives as persecuted heroes. Every. Single. Story.
It's not news. It's laundering propaganda and conspiracy theories through a legitimate-looking front.
