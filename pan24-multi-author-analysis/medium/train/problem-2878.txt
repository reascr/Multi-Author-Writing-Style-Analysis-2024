How about, literally nothing the GOP ever talks about has anything even tangentially related to solutions to the challenges being faced by the vast majority of Americans?
It's not even that they have bad solutions or solutions I disagree with. They have nothing in their platform that might even be generously catalogued as a solution for anything. It's 100% grievance politics and culture war nonsense. Blame the democrats for everything bad (while offering absolutely no solutions of their own) and keep their base riled up about the "other" of the month. I guess right now it's drag queens? Make sure you bring up your fantasy "war on Christmas" every December and make believe that the magical solution to every problem utterly depends upon your unfettered access to high-powered automatic weapons.
