It's a complicated alliance, for sure. Chinese recognize that their government was derived from Leninism. But I can't imagine china has been impressed with Russias performance on the free market post collapse of USSR. They see Russia as a precautionary tale of what NOT to do. Which is China's opinion was denounce Stalin after his death, which they could never do with Mao. And of course the collapse of the USSR, which the CCP knows it can't show weakness.
"China has reportedly banned the export of its own Loongson processors to Russia. The decision was made after the Chinese government recognised the technology as strategically important for its use in the country’s military-industrial complex, Russian officials were cited by local agencies as saying (...).
The Chinese government’s decision to ban exports is a step towards China’s long-term goal of achieving semiconductor self-sufficiency, particularly its use in military tech. Loongson’s next-generation Godson CPU, the 3A6000, is expected to sample with customers in the first half of 2023, with a potential launch later in the year.".
