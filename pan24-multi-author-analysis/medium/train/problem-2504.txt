And this apologetic statement that total war would become more likely, if there are no economic ties, is outrageous. The Russians have escalated to the maximum, did provoke with threats of which we now know that they are empty (we fight in supposed Russian territory, which they swore to defend even if it would be with nukes; the local governors must feel betrayed, but who could have expected that, right?!). It sounds like this tale old German social democrats tell each other to rationalise their delusions about Putins Russia. We now know that none of the things that come out of the mouth of these people can be trusted and there will always be someone that will remind us about that, because it is possible and because it's right. Even the last "optimist", that Russia under the current leadership could be anything remotely trustworthy again, has been educated for the better.
>Pevkur also suggested Russia would learn from what it has experienced in Ukraine. "We have no reason to believe that the threat from Russia is somehow reduced or that the threat to NATO is reduced.".
