And I'm guessing this comes from other perhaps more established immigrants who don't want "their community" to "look bad".
I think this mean caste discrimination is being enforced by some immigrants behind the scenes so to speak. This is like organized crime that prey on "their own" immigrant communities, knowing the people are vulnerable and afraid to seek assistance.
Which doesn't really make any sense since the vast, vast majority of Indian immigrants to the USA are 'higher caste'. There are likely no 'lower-caste' people to discriminate against.
There's also no guarantee that a person from one state knows the caste hierarchy of another state. There's also no guarantee that a person's surname is the one that has always been in their family. In some parts of India, some castes have been threatened by ruling powers and have has different surnames for decades.
You, like many who comment on this issue, know next to nothing about the profile of Indian immigrants to the USA, the views of second gen Indians and their relationship with caste.
There ought to be a way to simply outlaw discrimination of any kind for reasons unrelated to the activity under consideration, instead of listing a finite number of protected classes. Every once in a while a situation arises when someone is discriminated against because of some reason that has nothing to do with what they want to buy or where they want to work, and they have no recourse since they are not part of a protected group.
