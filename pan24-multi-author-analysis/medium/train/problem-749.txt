Seems like Putin is trying to solve multiple things at once: diminish Wagner by cutting off ammo and new prisoner recruits, while also using them to soak up Ukranian bullets.
This looks to me like the same Wagner vs Russian MoD rivalry we've seen the whole way through the war.
Putin could see that part of the reason Russia was doing so badly in Ukraine was because of the duplicated command structures and political infighting to secure favour.
He ordered everything brought together under one unified command structure like in a big-boy military, but now that that's happened, it hasn't stopped the infighting, it's just created situations like this one.
Correct, but a side effect of that duplication of authority and competing interests is that it makes for a very ineffective military.
It's a massive task coordinating something like that amongst militaries that trust each other (e.g., NATO) but it's impossible when the commanders of your separate militaries hate each other more than the enemy they're fighting.
Putin has presumably only combined everything under one roof temporarily so that he can try to squeeze some more cohesion out of his military for the sake of a war that's gone badly BADLY wrong for him.
I thought the Wagner/MoD rivalry was because of Putin though? Autocrats need multiple competing power structures under them to prevent a viable rival from becoming powerful enough to oppose them. The infighting is an important feature designed to protect Putin.
It won't be a permanent state if affairs, and it's really not that much of a risk for him in the short term compared to the much greater risk of losing the war.
