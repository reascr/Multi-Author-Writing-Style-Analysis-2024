Saw a post earlier with the NYPost drooling over the DeSantis win and Fox News all but declaring Trump is history and DeSantis is the future.
Pence bravely did his job, but has since dodged the Jan 6th committee and is trying to sell a book and redeem his image after 4 years being Trumpâ€™s toad.
That "good thing" he did was to save his own ass. You can bet that if he knew he was going to get away with it he would've done it in a heartbeat. Had years to stand up to trump or anyone else and just sat there doing fuck all.
