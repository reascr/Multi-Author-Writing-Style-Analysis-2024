BJP has won many elections including UP elections, Goa, Manipur. In Delhi despite loosing they have increased vote share. Plus they won few bypolls in Bihar, UP, Harayana this year. Even in Himachal where Congress and BJP exchange Governments alternately BJP and Congress vote share difference is less than 1 percent. And coming to latest bypolls they lost the seats that were very hard to win and despite that they have performed nicely.
There is no alternative. Either Congress needs to magically revive itself or become irrelevant fast. APP can't go beyond certain states. Indian Society has moved towards the right, it's a reaction of not doing much about terrorism from Pakistan in the past few decades.
BJP has not been great but it has been pragmatic enough to change from intial mistakes like demonetisation.The country is transforming demographically, which will only make more right wing parties to grow.
Centre and Left wing parties will be in decline until there is a major mistep in the current government. For all the "donations" from corporates, BJP and MODI especially has been able to keep a clean face in terms of governance.
