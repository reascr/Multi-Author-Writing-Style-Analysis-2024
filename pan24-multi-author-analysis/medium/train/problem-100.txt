Satellites can only spend a couple of minutes over a target because they're moving at 17,500mph, and they're generally hundreds of miles up at least in order to avoid the worst of atmospheric drag. The truss and boom on this balloon was larger than anything in orbit except ISS, and being at 12 miles altitude while moving at a couple hundred miles an hour means it could stay over a target area for an hour or more and gather a whole lot more intel than any spy satellite.
> Officials have said the debris field is approximately the size of 15 football fields by 15 football fields and that the balloon had propellers and a rudder.
Those balloons fly at 20km. Lowest satellite ever was stabilized at 164km high, but most spy satellites are twice that height. This x16 difference means you can skip on high end camera, and use something much cheaper. And the cost of launch (balloon vs rocket) is night and day as well. Not to mention if you can land it in international water, you can actually salvage it back. This could be cost effective over satellite, or an alternative to satellite.
There is also radio wave that bounce at 100km on the ionosphere. Flying under it might make it easier to pick up certain signal, but who knows what they had on that balloons.
