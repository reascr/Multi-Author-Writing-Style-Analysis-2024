I honestly don't know if I can face another Trump Presidency. Even though horrible shit is still happening at the hands of far-right republicans...a lot of that was set into motion by Trump-appointed judges, and Trump showed Republicans that there was literally no taking things too far, that Republican voters don't even believe in the peaceful transfer of power, that their allegiance to Trump was stronger than their allegiance to the basic founding principles of our democracy. Yeah. I'm scared shitless of what will happen if Trump is re-elected.
