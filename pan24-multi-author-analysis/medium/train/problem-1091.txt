there are no trophies for any of this, we absolutely just die at the end of the run. Social media, consumerism keeps people trapped in a dopamine loop indoctrinated from birth to do and say things that no matter what will keep the system running just fine throughout their lifecycle. The koolaid works long enough for most but theres oodles of folks that saw from early on the hypocrisy. Those at the top know this and work tirelessly to maintain the balance of the illusion that we need the system, creating divides and problems only remedied by it. Technology has outpaced it, the pandemic exposed the cracks, and climate change will catalyze the needed changes much faster. We react, react, react. When do we proact? The unfortunate truth is that the next 10 years are going to fucking suck and we always had the option to do something different but decided not to.
