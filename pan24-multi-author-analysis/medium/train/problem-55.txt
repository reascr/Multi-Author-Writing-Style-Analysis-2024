As someone who lives in tumbleweed country, please, no! I hate tumbleweeds enough already. They’re prickly, can combine into one giant one that can cover your house, and there’s no way to really dispose of them other than move them away from your house and send them down the road.
They have shiny new toys, but very little operational experience. Particularly with their Navy. It takes years (decades even) to generate the institutional experience required to effectively operate in task groups, especially carrier groups. Then again, having lots of decent equipment and an unlimited supply of expendable troops, and the industrial capacity to keep them equipped can absolutely be a winning strategy.
The whole western world, which relies heavily on US defense gear, knows exactly how reliable that gear can be.
What’s the Chinese military like? Are they anything like the Russian military at this point or do they have something on their side besides the “drown em in dudes” strategy.
That is a useful side effect, but it has more to do with geopolitics then anything. Ultimately, might makes right in international politics, and the US military has the capacity to slap down just about anyone they want to. If the biggest tool in the toolbox is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.
