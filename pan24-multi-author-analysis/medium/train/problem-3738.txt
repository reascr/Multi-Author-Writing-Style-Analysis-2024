I know it's easier said than done, but strike. If these countries are able to take part, don't attend and don't allow national coverage of it.
Create a different event that only countries that participate in the strike are allowed to attend. Give that the national coverage instead.
Both boycott and strike can be used interchangeably in this scenario. Boycott being nations refuse to deal with the Olympics. Strike being nations refusing to work (play in the games).
Well theres the political angle, but theres also the fact that Russia has been caught cheating on a massive scale which was why they werent allowed in the last one under their own flag.
because last time, the Russians competed with Kamila Valieva, even though she was caught doping a few weeks previously. (That is, she failed her test from a few weeks before. She didn't test positive at the Olympics, I think. She should never have been allowed to compete.).
I know one thing?? Putin (and all if us i think...) Underestimated Zelensky That man is an incredible leader. The likes the world hasn't seen in 80 years or more.
But who cares, am I right? We're all a bunch of Russophobic Nazis for suggesting that Russia should have to compete without drugs! Now rise for the Russian National Anthem.
The Russian team won gold for the team event, but her performance should have disqualified her. They've refused to hand back their team medal. A few weeks ago, the Russian doping agency announced that they've looked into the matter, and that yes, Valieva was doping, but no biggie - she was entitled to keep competing.
If the Russians are disqualified, that means the US team should get the gold, Canada would move up to silver, and Japan, the bronze.
Oh, did I forget to mention that Russia wasn't supposed to be competing as a Russian team? Right, that really showed them, didn't it. To hell with Russia & the IOC!
