ATACMS is the only viable option to keep Russians from being able to fortify the eastern part of the Kherson Oblast. Ukraine needs to be given every advantage to maintain fire superiority over the winter so that the spring offensives can be quick and efficient, minimizing Ukrainian losses.
>The MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is a surface-to-surface missile (SSM) manufactured by the U.S. defense company Lockheed Martin. It has a range of up to 190 miles (300 km), with solid propellant, and is 13 feet (4.0 m) high and 24 inches (610 mm) in diameter. The ATACMS can be fired from the tracked M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), and the wheeled M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).
Probably a bit longer than that, but at some point the lack of western technology will begin to become a huge issue.
I’m afraid of the future even if they take back everything. I doubt Russia is just not going to do anything and will probably keep shelling Ukraine out of spite. That would either force them to retalliate and give Russia “justification” to maybe even use nukes, or just take the hits.
Things need maintenance, and when that stops all over society it will slowly erode the Russian infrastructure, it's death by a million tiny cuts.
