This legal “theory” and I use the term loosely would bar state courts from stopping the state legislators from passing unconstitutional state laws which go against state constitutions regarding election laws. I can’t believe that this is being brought to the Supreme Court, because the theory has no legal weight to justify its presentation to the Supreme Court especially since North Carolina wants to argue that they can be trusted in self enforcing the elections and super promise not to be bigoted in passing election laws which would violate minority rights and deny them their rights to vote. Smh.
More Doom-n-Gloom, courtesy of the media. The thing about these legal arguments is that the judges are supposed to find flaws.
>I guess I don’t understand how you can cut the state constitution out of the equation when it is giving the state legislature authority to exercise the legislative power.
If you walked into the Supreme Court and all 9 Justices said, "We all agree!" that would be horrifying. It's their job to pick things apart and look at things from every angle. And that's why the SCOTUS needs diversity in the first place--more than just Conservative/Liberal diversity.
So expand the court and add more perspectives to the bench. Even so, in reading this article I don't see any cause for alarm. The Liberals picked at it from their angle, and the Conservatives picked at it from theirs. This is just what they do.
