The Louis Theroux documentary really shows this whole right wing influencer set (Fuentes, Baked Alaska, the beard-themed guy with a patchy beard whose name is cant recall) for a group of half witted emotionally stunted weirdos with horrendous and poorly thought out reactionary views. It's shocking to me that any adult takes them seriously. Their worldview is insane and prejudicial in the extreme, and that's enough, but i think it's underrated the extent to which their implied policy would wreck the American economy for at least a generation.
