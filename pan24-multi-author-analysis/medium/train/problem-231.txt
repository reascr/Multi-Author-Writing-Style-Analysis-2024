Pretty wild to see Justice Gorsuch (rightly) call out his conservative colleagues for acting as “policy makers of last resort” by dictating migration restrictions at the behest of angry red states.
I always find it funny when these conservative chuckle-fucks randomly find the line they don't want to cross, even though they have been doing much worse of the same kind of bullshit.
Hey Gorsuch, nice to see you finally woke the fuck up from your power nap. Welcome to reality where the Supreme Court can't be trusted anymore to do the right thing. Moronic judges can't even obey the law and sure as fuck don't think it applies to them or their treason backing wives.
