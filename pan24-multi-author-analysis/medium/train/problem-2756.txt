I think there is still way more for men to gain from marriage than women and in some societies all caretaking expectations fall on women. So there is way more women not wanting to be married than men. This explains the incel movement. Men angry women donâ€™t want to marry them.
Why would Chinese women want to marry? They will be slaves to both their own parents and their in laws. Probably even all the grandparents. With no siblings for generations and men not eager to do any caretaking marriage will just double the amount of expected caretaking if she marries.
That being said, I'm not surprised - the fallout from China's one child policy is the gift that keeps on giving. Massive gender imbalance, women that have no interest in marrying and/or having children because they fear it would threaten their career, and China's elderly literally suing their children over neglect because the traditional stay-at-home daughter (in law) is no longer there.
The last part may or may not be getting even better since (from my understanding) many Chinese pension plans are heavily dependent on the local property market/construction market. Which is set to see more than just one Evergrande.
