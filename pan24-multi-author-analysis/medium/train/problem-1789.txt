That’s what I hate about the argument we’re just giving Ukraine a $40 billion+ blank check. We’re not. We’re either buying everything on behalf of Ukraine from American weapons manufacturers (hello American jobs and Lockheed stock prices), or European countries donating old jets and tanks and we buy new American weapons for our existing nato allies. I honestly don’t think Ukraine is getting any actual cash, and if they are, it’s very little. As in just to pay their soldiers and stabilize their central bank. We give pallets of cash to corrupt shitholes were warlords and dictators and no one bats an eye.
His real priority is to sound tough so he doesn’t fall out of a window. He’s not talking to Americans saying this stuff….his real audience is right next to him.
That's true for pretty much any statement made by the Russians towards other countries. People react to those with snark and sarcasm, but those statements are never intended to influence foreign public opinion. It's all just grandstanding for their own domestic news cycle.
