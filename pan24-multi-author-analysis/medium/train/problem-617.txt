Thanks for the reply. I'm not really familiar with the various sects of Judaism and which ones are more or less conservative. I only know that there are progressive secular Jews, many of whom I consider cultural and political heroes, and religious Jews, which I assume to be right wing, mostly due to the highly successful propaganda efforts of groups like AIPAC and the hasbara that jumps into any online discussion of Israel/Palestine/Zionism. Even J-Street, who seem to be basically pretty decent folks, call themselves "pro Israel" and call for a "de-militarized state of Palestine", which seems kind of patronizing towards the Palestinians. A true, independent state must be able to 100% fully exist just like any other state, with, among other things, a navy, airforce and army, and the legal right to defend themselves from Israeli agression.
