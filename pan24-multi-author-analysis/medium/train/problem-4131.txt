Average. And i thought this is even lower. Still, it includes all the alcoholics and other victims of Russian society. That average tells us something about the general population, but nothing about individuals, particularly individuals of the so called "elite".
Seems very likely to me he does have a severe health issue (or perhaps just old age frailty) and because showing weakness invites being overthrown, he has greatly reduced his public appearances.
Putin has some medical issue that prevents him from doing all the propaganda videos that he has been famous for over 20 years, at a time that they are needed the most.
Putin isn't old enough for real old age frailty. If he is frail, then this must be the result of a disease.
He will no doubt be receiving the best healthcare money can buy until he dies. Even through sanctions, Iâ€™m sure he has a personal stockpile of everything needed to keep him limping along for years. I wonder if he can trust all of his physicians, though?
It wasn't so much that no doctor would treat Stalin, more that he had killed all doctors who could treat him. He had one of them executed because he dared to suggest that Stalin rests more often.
