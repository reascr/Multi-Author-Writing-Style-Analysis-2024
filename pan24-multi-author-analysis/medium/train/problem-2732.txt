But lets not start with stupid ideas like Degrowth, if you're not making that growth then someone else will, and it won't be the countries you like.
I don't think you know what degrowth is..? it's not going back to the monke, or even the pre-industrial revolution, it's simply cutting on the unnecessary. its about how you should be wearing two folds instead of burning fossil fuels in your house while you are at war with a country that sells you those fossil fuels.
I know perfectly well what Degrowth entails, and anyone even remotely aware of how economics works would tell you that shrinking down the entire economy, irrespective of domestic consumption, is a bad idea.
Its only viable if every single country does it, which they won't, so we're stuck with growth-based economies like we are with Nuclear weapons.
Degrowth, doesn’t mean we need to go back to the Stone Age. Just that we need to adjust our growth based economy to circular/doughnut economy that’s healthy for Earth and we could do things within Earth’s limits/boundaries.
I think they are one step ahead of you- they have invested billions in solar already. Aqua power are a giant utility firm from Saudi and have huge amounts of solar around Africa and the Middle East. Other countries in the region have created huge solar projects around this area.
