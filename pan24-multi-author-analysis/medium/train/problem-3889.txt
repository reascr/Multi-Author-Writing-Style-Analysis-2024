The fact that he won in 2016 doesn't mean that he has a good chance to win in 2024. 2016 was a perfect storm for Trump. He was a complete unknown having never held political office. He was up against an unpopular candidate that the Republican party had spent decades smearing, so much so that many people when asked couldn't say why they didn't like her just that they didn't like her. He was up against a Democrat who was running after a two term Democratic president, that is historically difficult for that party. Every single thing that a republican candidate needed to be in place for them to win was in place. Trump couldn't have won in 2016 without independents voting for him by a decent margin. There's no reason to expect those independents to vote for him in 2024, after showing what an awful president he is in his first term. He was so awful that he was a one term president which is incredibly rare. It's not impossible for him to win, but don't use 2016 as a reason to think that it's likely. The advantages that he had in 2016 are not going to be there for him in 2024.
