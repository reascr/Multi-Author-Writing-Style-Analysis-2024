Russian pilots flying Russian jet fighters shot down hundreds of American aircraft during the Korean war and it didn't start WW3. They did similar in Vietnam, with Russian soldiers operating advanced Russian antiaircraft systems.
Technically this was done in a semi-covert manner, so if we deploy squadrons of F-35 to Ukraine we'd need to send the pilots and crew with buckets of Blue & Yellow paint.
I know this might sound really stupid, but I remember playing Black ops 1 and they had flashbacks to Vietnam and there were Soviet helicopters and spies and bunkers. Is that stuff at least partly true?
If only they would stop fighting, then you could all be safe. This, of course, is exactly how Russian propagandists want you to reason. And it is wrong.
People in the west should be ashamed of discussions of nuclear war, but not the main one. Your nuclear talk is a way to claim victimhood, and then to blame the actual victims. Once you turn your attention to a hypothetical exchange of missiles, you get to imagine that you are the victims. Suddenly the actual war no longer seems to matter, since your lives (you imagine) are at risk.
They did provide aircraft (not sure on helicopters) and after the fall of the Soviet Union they admitted that there had been thousands of Soviet troops within Vietnam during the Vietnam war.
The Soviet Union supplied the North Vietnamese with tons of military equipment, including providing advanced antiaircraft systems along with Soviet troops to operate them and train the Vietnamese in their use.
Russia keeps claiming they're fighting NATO because they're getting their asses kicked all over the place, but NATO hasn't even shown up yet. Imagine how bad it will be for Russia if NATO does show up!
