Regardless of the politics of Donald Trump or the current political climate, I’m just tired of presidential election seasons getting longer and longer. It’s two fucking years away.
Agreed it's definitely heating up. I still wouldn't be surprised if we're a few months away from a charging decision. Although I wouldn't be mad if that notion was wrong.
DOJ is still working witnesses and evidence, and are mulling a special prosecutor. I'd welcome a November indictment, but I feel it's going to be a while still.

I'm guessing Fulton/Georgia charges first (maybe by January). A state prosecution might be the better hope of accountability anyway. Less executive defense hoops to jump through, no pardon worries, potentially better witnesses and evidence, and a more narrow case.
