Considering that this is mobilization and that any Crimeans who wanted to fight Ukraine would already be fighting in the Russian Armed Forces, I'm sure all drafted men will be unwilling on some level.
Most crucially, the Ukrainians have enough people and organisation now that they can rotate their troops away from the front periodically. Not only are the Ukrainians better equipped, better organised and more motivated, they’re actually getting to rest and recover after big engagements. This has a huge effect on the morale and combat-effectiveness of the troops at the front.
The Russians are just being sent to the trenches and are expected to fight until they die. And they’re not even getting paid.
You knew they would. Russians probably support it too. curious what’s the punishment mechanism to prevent this kind of behavior? How do you punish when china and India buy oil.
Right now Russian forces are hiding behind the impassable marshes, but when they freeze over, they'll get a reminder that frozen ground works both ways.
