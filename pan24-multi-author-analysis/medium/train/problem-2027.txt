I don't really know enough about how Biden feels about Saudi Arabia or the court case you are discussing to make any useful arguments either way. I do want to say that Trump's nicknames are usually just childish, the nickname Mr. Bonesaw is true. The Saudi Arabian Prince had Khashoggi killed and chopped up with a bonesaw. It is like calling Brock (Allen) Turner, Rapist Brock (Allen) Turner. It is a good way to remind people of awful atrocities that were committed. The Saudi Arabian Prince would love for us to completely forget about his cover up. The nickname is our way to never let anyone forget. Same with Brock Turner. He tried to get away with his crime and has been going by Allen to avoid the consequences of his actions. We must never forget injustices like these, otherwise we are complicit.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
