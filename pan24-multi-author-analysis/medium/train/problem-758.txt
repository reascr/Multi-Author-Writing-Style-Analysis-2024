But sometime less than halfway between now and then, probably around mid spring, we will hit the debt ceiling. If Congress doesn’t act at that point, we go into basically a slow motion financial collapse. First the government starts pulling out of its investments, which immediately destabilizes the financial system. Soon you can’t redeem US Treasury bonds anymore, which means the banking system grinds to a halt. Meanwhile the value of the dollar craters and ships start staying in China. It’s not far from that to widespread famine and starvation, a straight up depression. That’s late spring. By the end of summer, it’s all over and literally nothing prevents a foreign power from just landing troops and taking over.
