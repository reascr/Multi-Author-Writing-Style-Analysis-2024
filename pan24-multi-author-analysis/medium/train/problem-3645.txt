Agreed wholeheartedly. From experience, sometimes you’ll get the more extroverted individuals who toss out politically-charged jokes without knowing the listener’s affiliation, but in the vast majority of cases, they just assume your have similar beliefs as they do, and in the off chance they find out you don’t, the usual response is a bit of awkward silence followed by changing of topic, or some self-deprecating joke as a follow up.
But if you believe the cases often shared on social media, you’d think there are raving hordes of maniacs shouting political slogans and jumping at the chance to debate anyone who disagrees with them.
It’s pretty disturbing when you look at where a lot of the culture war types get funding. It’s always Russia China saudis through well established American companies/political groups. Our enemies will not fight us in a conventional war, why would they. They are winning the war when it comes to radicalizing and dividing us while they stack our media/political organizations with sympathizers. It’s crazy to see this play out at the same time in different parts of the world, like a coordinated attack. I want moderates back but I think that ship has sailed now that these cunts are all in positions of power.
