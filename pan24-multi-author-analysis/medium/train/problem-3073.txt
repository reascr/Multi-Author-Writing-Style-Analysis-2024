I’m guessing these weather/surveillance balloons are actually extremely common since they’re probably a lot cheaper and easier than any other type of surveillance. These stories are just generating clicks and interest lately so we’re hearing about them more often.
That and they're easily deniable as weather balloons. They're also cheaper than, and don't risk personnel like a spy plane. But can carry microphones and other sensors you can't use from space.
Those tend to be referred to as "observation balloons" and they were fully visible to opposing forces. Usually tethered in place.
In the 1920s the US experimented with flying aircraft carriers. They built two Zeppelins that could launch and land fighter planes. They were called the USS Macon and the USS Akron.
Rammed both of them into massive storms. It's such a shame. Zeppelins could see submarines at periscope depth, so not one ship was ever attacked by a sub while in sight of an airship or balloon. A couple of those flying aircraft carriers would have been real useful in the Atlantic during the early stages of World War II. And you know that airships would have gotten tons of investment over the 30s and 40s. Don't know if they would have survived jets and radar, but I am sad that I'm not in the timeline with badass flying aircraft carriers in World War II.
It's not quite the same idea as drifting an out of sight balloon over enemy territory. Though some of the more modern spy balloons have been manned. Or at least manned prototypes were tested.
Well we'll put it this way. Apparently 3 moved through US airspace during Trump's term. Without anyone detecting them at the time. There was also apparently another balloon identified early in Biden's term, without the public catching wind of it.
