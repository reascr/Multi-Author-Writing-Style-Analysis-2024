A long long time ago, there was a little girl. Her name was Marjorie. Marjorie went to school for 6 years before dropping out of middle school to take care of her beloved peepaw. Peepaw like to drink beers, so many beers. When his beer was empty he often would need another. Marjorie’s peepaw had a strange way of letting little ole Marjorie know it was empty, prompting the fetching of a fresh, cold, bush light. Throwing the cab at Marjorie’s head usually would get her attention. One day ole Timothy Ravis Greene had one too many, forgetting some beer still left in the can he launched it at ole marges head knocking out her two front teeth. Some years later peepaw Greene died of liver cancer. Leaving little ole Margie 10,000$. She went and fixed her two front teeth. And at the moment as she gazed upon herself after getting her teeth fixed, Marjorie Taylor Greene was born.. or something like that. Who knows. Lol.
