I have no idea how she came into her activism for this cause, but (assuming your characterization is correct) - in a world where intelligent, educated adults can so thoroughly buy into political lies that they’ll participate in an insurrection - you question an 11-year old’s reaction to finding out that we have avoidably inflicted worldwide catastrophes on her and subsequent generations?
And she is right, climate change is going to be the largest catastrophe humanity ever seen and those old people in power just doesn't care and its infuriating.
I’ve never understood the disrespect directed toward her. She never held herself up as an expert. To the best of my knowledge, she hasn’t monetized her position. She, as a member of the first generation who will spend their whole lives dealing with the consequences of our failures (I’m in my 50’s.), has merely been calling us out. Angrily. As well she should. We get angry about the price of gas, and people mock her for being pissed about a lifetime of increasingly expensive catastrophes? SMH.
Making a big noise about it is helpful. She did nothing wrong yet you are bitching about some superficial bullshit like a 9 year old.
