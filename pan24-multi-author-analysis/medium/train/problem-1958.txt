Wasn't there an investigation ongoing into "hEr EmAilS" up until like a week before the 2016 election? I mean, not that A narcissist (or a republican for that matter) would care about integrity. Just something to remind people of when Trump inevitably calls this investigation into him "unprecedented".
one of the lesser discussed crimes Trump could be charged with is massive wire fraud for his stop the steal fundraisers that never spent a penny on opposition to the 2020 vote count. When you raise money for something you have to spend it on that or it's wire fraud.

Not sure if it was fraud as long as that abided to the fine print. 50% of each donation (up to $5000) went into Trump's pocket. The other 50% (up to $5000) went to the GOP. Anything over $10,000 went towards whatever they claimed to be raising money for.
