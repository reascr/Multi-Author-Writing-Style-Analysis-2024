I quickly came to the conclusion that the majority of them were swindling the system by falsifying documents for anything from benefits (when they were in fact working) to getting a state pension (sometimes going back 20 years when in reality they barely had been in the country for a year). It was done brazenly and discussed openly in social media groups. One was a felon wanted for serious crimes but got to the UK by chilling in the trunk of a car for a couple of hours til they left the borders of my country, so he got from one EU country to (at the time) another EU country and is able to evade justice, all because no information sharing was going on. On violent criminals. Between two countries that were both in the EU. Imagine that.
People want better life for themself. There is nothing wrong with this desire. In Middle East and Africa it is also trendy to migrate.
In my experience, while some people come from universally known warzones or areas of incredible persecution, there are many gray areas.
