Meanwhile, Sani hides behind stupid words like "woke". Let's be real- the word "woke" is shorthand for "let's treat gay people like humans, let's not kill black people, let's not become a bunch of crazy Christians from Moralton". Trump actually says the ugly truth, without hiding behind some smokescreen of "oh, you're gonna force our wives to get abortions and then leave us for transgender lesbians". Trump takes the makeup off to expose the ugly. Good. If they're going to act ugly, then they should be forced to come out and say "I am ugly and hateful".
