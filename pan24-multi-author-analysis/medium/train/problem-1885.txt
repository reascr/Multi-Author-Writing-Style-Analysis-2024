It seems Bloomberg is a month behind on the information. It's not years, but expected to be next year to have enough LNG capacity.
Currently Germany still has to rely on LNG imports via Dutch and Belgian terminals as there are only 3 new terminals in Germany so far.
But since December 2022, there is already a discussion about vast LNG over-capacity once everything that got planned is also up and running.
"Accordingly, ten floating terminals are planned on the North Sea and Baltic Sea, six of them with state participation.
These floating terminals alone would have a capacity of 53 to 67 billion cubic meters of gas per year from 2024. In addition, three terminals are to be built on land by 2026, also with a capacity of up to 50 billion cubic meters of gas.".
The says they got it from the German Economy Ministry and some guy named Olaf Scholz in an interview last week.
Well, the actual CEO of a company who already finished one of the terminals and started operation as well as the offically reported gasmix?
