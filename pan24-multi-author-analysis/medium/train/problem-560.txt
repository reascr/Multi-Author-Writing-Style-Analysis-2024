Well, that depends on how quickly and easily it spreads. But if it is anything like COVID (which is unlikely), in that case I'd think people would self-restrict just from fear. 60-80% death rate isn't something anti-vaxxers and deniers can just raise their noses at and call fake news. There would be literal piles of bodies everywhere, with people burying their family members in their backyard because of how overwhelmed all the health services would be. That is, if they're even functional at that stage. COVID wasn't even that bad in the sense that a lot of people didn't even show symptoms at all and the majority of people just got better at home, and even that pretty much crippled health services in a lot of places.
Raising livestock of any kind for commercial purposes such as food production is a messy business and herds have always been susceptible to outbreaks of various diseases throughout history. These risks are acceptable because food production is necessary, and people eat meat.
Of course there’s always a risk when you have large numbers of animals living close together but the squalid conditions and the way they’re kept literally on top of each other is another pandemic waiting to happen.
