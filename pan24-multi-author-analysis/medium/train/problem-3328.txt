Even people that hate their current government will rally under them (temporarily) if a third party attacks them in a manner the citizens consider unjustified.
a tactical strike to take out nuclear facilities of their dear leader who they've been protesting nationwide since September.
Do their citizens think they Khamenei needs a nuke? Would this not completely and fully entrench his power? Will they feel such a strike like this unjustified? Lots of questions but i think your line of thinking would hardly apply.
This sounds right. The US did assassinate an Iranian general about 3 years ago on foreign soil. I think going up against Israel and using the strike as a casus belli is more realistic to go full on war.
You aren’t just nuking Khamenei though, those facilities still reside within a country they (ostensibly) consider their own. Having nuclear weapons isn’t an evil act itself, and with Ukraine as an example it’s actually really an unfortunate necessity.
The average citizen could completely be for a bomb or assassination to dismantle their government but find a strike to take out any defensive mechanism against future aggression, even if the government is changed, to be unwarranted.
well if it was a nuclear strike then your bombing the entire world. Iran would be irrelevant in the grand shit storm you just unreleased. I get that last part though for sure, self-preservation goes beyond the current dictator, and nukes are certainly a countries best bet.
I feel like that’s just going to force them to move nuclear sites under ground/hidden or worse, nestled next to residential buildings and schools to play on “look how many innocent bystanders you killed!”.
