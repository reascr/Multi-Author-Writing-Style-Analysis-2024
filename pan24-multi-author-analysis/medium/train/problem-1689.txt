I believe this. It’s just surfaced now. Our society is so divided. So unequal. I’m hanging out just wasting time, Bc of the huge blizzard outside and even watching “the crown” ( netflix) is getting hard bc I despise rich ppl so much. Why do the Brits even allow “ royalty” anymore when their own ppl are hungry. The rich think they are entitled to the vast majority of their wealth but most of it, no. It’s basically stolen. In the US,( where I am), poor ppl who support MAGA, the GOP and Trump just baffle me. I’m rambling … I’ll go. But yea, I agree, it’s a cesspool alright.
Isn’t it tho ? It’s really weird. I’m in the US and when trump was potus, it was the same…he’d lie such an obvious lie and his supporters would just eat it up. I could not for the life of me, figure out how they didn’t see it? This is like that. Twisting the truth until it’s completely inverted.
When you build your power base on corruption, your underlings lie to you about how ready you are and corruptly steal funds for themselves. Who could have seen that coming.
