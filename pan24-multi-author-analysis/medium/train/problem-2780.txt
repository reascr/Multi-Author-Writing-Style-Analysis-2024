Yesterday I had a chat with an ex-Yugoslavian. They had a rule about the salary ratio of management to the workers.
We voted on that in Switzerland some years ago. The ratio couldn't be higher than 12:1 for the highest and lowest salary. The population rejected the law with 65% of the votes.
Also, the government recommended rejecting this law. They found that it's not the job of the federal state to dictate those conditions. Salaries should be handled by the unions (which are more powerful than those you have in the US) and companies.
Companies would create shell companies, out-source to other shell companies and do other tricks to avoid the law. Other companies and or people would just have left the country for greener pastures. In the end it was estimated that tax income would decrease and the problem wouldn't get fixed.
Keep also in mind, that working conditions in Switzerland are better than the US. The minimum wage is around 25$/h and average salary is about 7k$ per Month. There's less social unrest due to that. It doesn't matter that there are rich people if the lowest class has a comfortable and livable life.
