If it’s any consolation rightist authoritarian governments often eventually cede power to liberal democracy.
A lot led up to it, they got a new young president in 2019 that made Bitcoin legal tender, they developed an official government cryptowallet, opened up the immigration laws to encourage rich foreigners to invest in the country, have a plan to use geothermal energy since theres tons of volcanoes in the country, and expand infrastructure to rural areas to increase quality of life and economic opportunities, but at the same time it was one if the most violent countries and after 60 people were killed in one day from gang violence the president started the military campaign and declared a national emergency and suspened some of the peoples rights.
The situation there isn’t ideal but I genuinely believe that in the case of a country where nobody can start a business without fear of extortion, where tens of murders happen daily, drugs and violence are a part of life there is somewhat an excuse for his harshness on gangs.
