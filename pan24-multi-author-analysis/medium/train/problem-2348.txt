bOtH sIdEs make the claim both sides are the same, usually used to imply both sides are equally bad and often by saying both parties are corporate shills who pass legislation only to help their corporate overlords and that neither party is actually interested in helping citizens. This is demonstrably false, especially after one party attempted to overthrow our democracy.
That's why they should get experts to weigh in - and not go out of their way to find the one crazy expert that thinks climate change is fake or covid is a "plandemic" to balance the coverage. Instead find the highest ranking/most experienced or published expert they can get and let them explain why one side is right and the other wrong.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
