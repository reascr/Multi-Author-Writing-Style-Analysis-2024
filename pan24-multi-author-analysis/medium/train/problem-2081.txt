Kind of sounds exactly like all the candidates that either lost or almost lost in Oregon. Part of the problem is that local Democratic Party offices have an oversized role in pushing their favorite candidates (similar to the Hillary/Bernie debacle). In Oregon, where a hipster with a beard and a flannel is a shoe-in for just about any political position, has been passed over a hundred times for milquetoast lesbians that fit the role of a Portlandia character much better than the role of an elected official. Yeah, that goes over well in Portland, but the rest of the state is basically Idaho or Montana and the Democrats get trounced outside the metro.

She's just not a good candidate, Katie Hill won the district when it was redder, Christy Smith lost to Garcia in 2 blue waves. The simplest biggest qualifier for candidancy is being a looser and now Smith has lost 3 times.
