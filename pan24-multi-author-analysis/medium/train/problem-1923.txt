So he was convicted for murder, joined the invasion for a pardon and deserted, was then traded back to Russia as a pow for a ukraine pow, and the Wagner gang murdered him.
That's really awful, it really is, but I'm more happy they got a Ukrainian out of whatever hell hole they were trapped in.
>tight shot of old man with goatee in fatigues sitting on the floor with his head plastic wrapped to a rigid post on his left face. he says a speech and a sledgehammer comes swinging into frame and hits his jaw right where the hinge is. no blood, no deformation and the impact knocks him out of the plastic wrap and he falls back (shot is low and from the feet. can only see his goatee over his chest). Then there is one more downward blow and no blood. then the video ends.<.
He was at least unconscious after the first blow and probably already had massive brain damage. It happened while he was talking and he didn't seem to know that the hammer was being swung. I don't think he suffered at all â€“ independent of potential torture before the video was shot.
I completely unexpectedly saw the video last night, when I clicked through celebration videos from Kherson. Took me entirely by surprise, but, while shocking, it really isn't gory.
Its actually insane how bleak Russian future looks like if u look at it objectively. I was against the war since day 1 and expected the shit show, but not at that level and not at that speed.
It's definitely not how I would want to die, but I would certainly prefer it to a lot of the deaths we've seen in videos from the battlefields. One second he was talking, the next he was dead.
