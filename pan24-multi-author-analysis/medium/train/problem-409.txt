For so many years, decades even, russia has been living off this fear they presented to the world. Of their army, of their military might, their military weapons, their military intelligence. They showed themselves as ravenous bears on the battlefield. In reality, that masquerade popped as though that ravenous bear was truthfully a balloon bear.
The russian army has been eaten on the inside with corruption, lies, and the waste of equipment and weapons. We are watching firsthand, a past military might scrambling to invoke fear to the rest of the world of their army as best as they can.
While this war is not over, I believe it will irreparably reshape the forces of power in Europe and Asia.
I have a strong feeling in my gut somewhere down the line Dan Carlin is going to make a 12-part episode of Hardcore History on this war.
I find this fascinating. This war is horrible, but as an observer of military conflicts and one who studies past wars in history, this has been very interesting. Between the determination of the Ukrainian army, citizens, and leaders, to the idiotic choices of russia and their military incompetence.
What’s truly baffling is the Russian strategy has changed zero times since the beginning. It’s “more troops, more weapons, more vehicles”. That’s it. Just the stupidest strats I’ve ever seen.
It actually reminds me of a shitty general from the American Civil War, but instead of one general it’s the whole damn military.
I'm all for shitting on Russia's incompetence, but they have switched tactics quite a few times to try and mix things up. To be fair, most of these pivots were due to failures, but they most certainly haven't done the same thing since day one.
