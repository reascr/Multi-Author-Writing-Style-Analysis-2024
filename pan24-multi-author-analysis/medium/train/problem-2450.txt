Are you really suggesting that the political "center", from the beginning of time til the end, be defined in terms of American politics in the year 2022? That no one in the history of human civilization up to about 100 years ago has ever been anything but conservative?
Thatâ€™s such a misleading question. Everyone thinks the country is headed in the wrong direction. Republicans think we are living under socialism. Democrats see us sliding towards fascism. If has no bearing on who our representatives actually are.
America was the first modern democracy/republic. It was founded on the ideas of the day's most progressive thinkers. How do you figure that only counts as "center right"?

Left and Right are always relative to the status quo. They progressed from their "normal", just as progressives today progress from our normal, just as progressives tomorrow will progress from their normal.
It would be just as ridiculous for people 200 years from now to say everyone alive today was conservative, just because our "center" was to the right of theirs. Or, god forbid, we regress, and modern republicans are considered "progressives" because the center has shifted so far to the right.
