Is it that they’re dumb or are they just laissez faire? I mean, if he had laid low and never become POTUS and just kept on being his plain mediocre self, he probably would still be getting away with all the sketchy shit he’s been getting away with his whole life. I don’t even think they bothered to try to hide much, they thought they’d never be held accountable. Someone along the way was privy to whatever shady shit he was up to and just turned a blind eye, like they do for the wealthy and influential. You said yourself, they have no interest in holding these people accountable. He could still just be taking bite-sized roles as a punchline in movies and hosting cringe-inducing reality shows and slapping his name on shit and largely avoided this kind of scrutiny. Hope the four years he got to play president were worth this.
