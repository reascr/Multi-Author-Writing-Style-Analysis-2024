If we can get congress to care about the major issues that are impacting families like the astronomical cost of daycare maybe we can eventually get congress to do things like bringing back the pandemic-era child benefit that helped bring down child poverty by 30%.
The hard part is that childcare workers deserve a living wage too, and daycares need to profit too, so the only way to actually make childcare more affordable is for the government to subsidize it.
For the past two months I’ve paid roughly $13k in childcare costs for my twins. $1680/week, 12 hour shifts, 4 days a week. The thing is, that’s only $35/hr which is a very fair wage for the help we received. But the vast majority of families couldn’t afford a month at that rate.
I mean it definitely isn’t a myth, i wouldn’t have a relationship with my child if i didn’t sue her for one. But i agree family issues effect all genders, i probably have an “outlier” case.
I am truly glad to see a feminist support this. As a non custodial father, it is very frustrating knowing that i am more than willing and able to pull my weight and do the best i can for my child, i just don’t have mom’s permission. Almost begging to play a bigger role and handle more responsibilities, but the laws create an environment for mom’s to say “no” for no other reason than because it isn’t illegal.
