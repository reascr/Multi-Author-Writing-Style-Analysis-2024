No, it was a Sidewinder. There’s a good article on The Drive’s ‘The War zone’ page where they talk about the problems. Machine guns are worse than useless in this context because the bullets will probably make small holes so the balloon would take a very long time to deflate but they’ll also have to land somewhere, which is problematic if there are people down range.
I'm curious what they did to the missile, if anything, to make it more useful in this context. The balloon would probably not have been solid enough for a radar proximity fuse to trigger, nor for a contact fuse. So what did they do to ensure the missile didn't just fly straight through making only a small hole?
Back in the 80's, the airforce put a kinetic missile onto an f-15 to shoot a satellite. The service ceiling of the eagle is 80k feet. Without the explosive warhead, you can cram more fuel into the missile. Works well against satellites. They used the same kind of missile. You have to remember that missiles of that size are moving faster than mach 3.
