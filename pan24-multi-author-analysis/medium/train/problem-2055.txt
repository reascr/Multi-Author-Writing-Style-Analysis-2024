Someone (apparently) accidentally launched a Russian-made missile that hit a farm in Poland and killed 2 people. Poland wants to declare Article 4 earlier but dropped it; leaders meet nonetheless to talk about the situation and where did that came from. Redditors are pointing at Russia, the ones that got downvoted to oblivion are pointing it at Ukraine, it's a shit show tbh.
Still no Article 5 so for those people who are dying to hear it: No, you still have to go to work, pay taxes, and feed your obese politicians.
They might as well just launch their tsar bomba or whatever unholy concoction they have if they're going to double down and willingly screw with a NATO member so, yeah I agree.
We shall declare war against Ukraine and lay waste upon their land. Fuck Ukrainians and their sunflowers, amirite? (/s).
Ukraine firing a Russian made mistake seems sus. My guess is a false flag op to draw NATO into direct conflict with Russia or Russia accidentally/provokingly fired the middle and NATO is scared to acknowledge it because they donâ€™t want to engage directly with Russia. Just a guess, but I have a hard time believing the Ukrainians were firing Russian missles, accidentally hit Poland, then blamed Russia publicly.
