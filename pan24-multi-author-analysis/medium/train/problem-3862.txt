The water polo match between Hungary and the Soviet Union at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics after the USSR had invaded their country was legendary for its violence in the pool.
Don’t worry someone would be there to ensure you shot your self in the back of the head 4 or 5 times when you landed. Assuming they haven’t all become sunflowers in Ukraine by the time you landed.
They aren't exactly creative with the killings though. They keep throwing people out high windows, it's like they can't think of any other "accidental" ways. Whoever is carrying out the hits clearly hasn't gotten a single Silent Assassin rating in their miserable life. There's definitely a terror element to it, like sending a message that they're not afraid to kill anyone, but at this point it just looks sloppy to try to sell the same dumb lie every freaking time.
I think is an intimidation tactic. Everyone knows this is murder and probably thrown out of a high window to “hide” multiple signs of torture. I think it’s a warning to those who are thinking of not complying.
