The collective West (2022): they are totally planning an invasion but probably as a bluff. Or not. Let’s demonstrate that we are privy to the conversations. See how that works.
Totally achieved what we wanted… why of course we are not defeated. Also, don’t you dare because nukes.
Putin: how dare the evil west draw away our Slavic little brother with the promise of improved circumstances? Yankee bastards.
The west: you know, let’s give some more. Not enough to turn the tide… we don’t want to make the war angry.
NATO: ok Ukraine, 2014 sucked, but don’t rearm because it might piss Russia off. We’ll train and totally revamp how you go about the art of war but no new western equipment. Also. You guys so poor. Not as bad as before, but still.
Putin: what? No! Why do you keep resisting? We only want to kill you. How dare you prolong the suffering.
Putin (2022): we are totally not preparing to invade. Again. But if Ukraine does anything, or doesn’t, who’s to say? If NATO says anything, nukes.
I'm just imagining the leaders of the various countries both in the EU and NATO awkwardly switching between which chairs they're sitting on throughout the meeting to indicate whether they are talking as EU or NATO.
