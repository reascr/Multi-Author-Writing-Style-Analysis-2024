Their nukes are not Soviet era nukes. It is dangerous to underestimate them. I just want to explain to you why they can strike us. Russia has a nuke called SATAN 2, and also SATAN 1. But Satan 2 is the new version. Basically it is a single intercontinental ballistic missile that can easily reach the states but that isn’t the problem. The problem is that each Satan missile has a cap that carry’s many nukes all capable of independent targeting. The intercontinental main missile gets above target nearly in orbit and hovers there. From there it can send each one of its nukes to many different cities. I believe one of their nukes could target at least 8 different targets. That’s just off the top of my head. The point is it doesn’t matter how good our air defense is when they only need to get one missile through to completely reduce all of our major cities to ash. It’s quite scary that the nuke is named SATAN. Satan is also referred to as the morning star in the Bible. I wonder if that’s because a nuke will come in the morning hours and it will look like a star in the sky. I wonder if the Bible was speaking about their nukes the entire time.
That is why the best tactic to deal with bullies is returned force. Bullies thrive on others cowering to them without a fight, because on a deep level, they are deeply insecure and try to gain a feeling of security by trampling others. This is why I do not discourage my kids from defending themselves in such a situation. The school may expel you, but if you are purely defending yourself, you’re in no trouble with me.
