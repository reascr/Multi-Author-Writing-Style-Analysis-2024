Seriously stop. My wife's father fled Iran during the Islamic revolution. Her and I are both very liberal on social issues, and she's said multiple times that when she hears liberal politicians talk like this as if Republicans are in any way similar to those who literally wanted to murder her father for his religion, and would do the exact same thing to anyone lgbt or who even wanted gender equality, she doesn't trust those people with power. And I don't blame her. Lots of Republicans are problematic with their social views and deserve to be voted out of office. Comparing them to Islamic extremists in the middle east makes a mockery of the brutality of these extremists. Many Republicans want to force lgbt teachers to hide their identity, relegate same sex couples to second-class legal status, and not teach children that transgenderism is a thing. Those are all bad. Islamic extremists want to execute everyone who's lgbt and murder women who seek an education or want to leave their house without their husband's permission. The two are not the same, even if they're both bad.
I think the 2 might stand for Two-Spirit. It’s an Indigenous thing that’s sort of similar to being trans I think? I’m far from an expert though so consider looking it up if you’re interested.
