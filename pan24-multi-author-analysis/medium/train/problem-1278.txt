Are you an idiot? You really think the asswat Modi who supports the fascist Putin really needs to make weapons? Try reading about what Putin is doing in Ukraine before you decide if he needs to have any help him making more weapons.
Yea… when Russia desperately needs weapons to arm his new soldiers for the mass murder they are committing in Ukraine they start a joint venture to manufacture millions of Russian Assault Rifles just for India…come on. Don’t be naive. Some of those weapons are going straight into the hands of Russian Soldiers. This is just a convenient way for India to get the guns to arm their soldiers while also supporting Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.
Russia is perfectly capable of building their own aks. Why the fuck would they take something build in india?
Try reading the US companies still doing business with Russia. Try reading how the US use Ukraine as a lab for field testing their weapons without real intention to end this war or help Ukraine. Try reading the resources still flowing from Russia to the EU. Try reading how the EU is purchasing Russian oil routed through India as long as the price is right.
I’ve read about all those actually. None of it is perfect. Could we as a nation forbid all companies based in the US to get out of Russia? I bet we could, but I, not sure. And boycott the ones who aren’t based here but still do business there. ( IKEA comes to mind) We could’ve stopped this war months ago but seem bent on keeping it going. Like I said it’s far from perfect , the way it’s playing out. War has always been a boost to a slow economy. Is this what’s happening ? It’s a strategy ?
Google " How Ukraine became a testbed for western weapons" by CNN. I hope CNN is not a Russian media.
I just mean when it comes to profiteering from the Ukraine war, US, EU, India (and many others) are at the front.
