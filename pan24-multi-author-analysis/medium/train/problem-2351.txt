The EU would need to ‘drive the boat’ for a few years to ensure it won’t just collapse under their feet.
At best Ukraine can expect Customs Union in 2 years. 5 years-ish after that single market. A further 3 years full EU membership and possibly Schengen.
Schengen after 10 years from now? That's insanely optimistic. Romania and Bulgaria not in Schengen after 15 years in the EU.
I would be surprised that the chapters of acquis for Ukraine will be closed in 30 years, and Schengen and other perks on Saint Waiting's day.
Ukraine should also be wise that if they do get their wish in 2 years though overly optimistic it is, they should do well to protect their agricultural industry and gas/oil from outside private investors who only want to profit, the locals be damned.
The thousand plus kilometer unsecured land border with two former enemies, rife for weapons smuggling and human trafficking?
There's a huge difference between visa-free access and Schengen. With Schengen you basically have no hard border, anyone can cross anytime with ease, and any checks in importing/exporting, visas, or identity to enter the area need to be done by the country a person or shipment of goods enter the Schengen area through. The whole area is therefore subject to the standards of the weakest version in the agreement, and it will take a long time before Ukraine can demonstrate their up to the standard the other countries in the agreement will accept.
