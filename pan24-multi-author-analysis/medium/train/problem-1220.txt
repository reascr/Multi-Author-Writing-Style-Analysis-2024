The constitution regards all liberties not defined within it to be either the property of the states or the people. That is explicit and textual. English Common Law, the basis for American Common Law, makes it very clear that the right of a woman to recieve an abortion is legal for up to 5 months (20 weeks) and would only become a felonious crime after 6 months (24 weeks). Roe codified that an individuals choice was based on the idea of personal liberty in that period. Logically it cannot be otherwise. Precedent going back to the 18th century makes it clear that abortion is legally permissible with certain limitations and is thus a liberty. The constitution grants liberties beyond its strictest dictates to the people and the states. In Dobbs, the court rejected personal liberties and centuries of precedent to side with a guy who literally had "witches" executed. Furthermore, do you know what else the constitution doesn't explicitly protect? The Environment. Guess the EPA is unconstitutional, same for the National Parks, or fish and wildlife. Also, if the court wishes to be literalists, then they should refuse to strike down laws. After all, nowhere in the constitution does it say the courts have the right to strike down laws made by legislatures.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
