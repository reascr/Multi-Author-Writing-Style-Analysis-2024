In addition, high cost of living areas are typically high cost because they are objectively great places to live. Yes, it’s expensive to live in Manhattan, but … you get to live in Manhattan.
I couldn’t believe they have zero sick/personal days a year. So shameful. It seems to be the case for so many American workers today after 2020. They’re often still working emergency productivity levels with no extra pay and never home to live or see their families. It’s been 3 years and something has to give.
The funny thing is people are like oh these railroad workers make like 100k. That’s around the bare minimum average income to own a home in the US. I hope the benefits are awesome.
Holy crap, they make $100k? Sorry, but I just lost all sympathy for them. That’s quite a bit higher than the average household income with two earners.
Well, in some sense I have sympathy for every human being who has to figure out life in this world - including even Warren Buffett. Who I’m sure is doing the best he can.
We also went to war against organized labor after it was so successful in the 30’s-50’s. They made almost every effective tactic working people have to fight for better pay/working conditions illegal since then.
