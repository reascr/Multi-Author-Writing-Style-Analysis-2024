“ these companies are not following Senate Bill 13, which was passed in 2021 and prohibits the state from contracting with or investing in companies that divest from oil, natural gas and coal companies.”.
That’s how these stupid-ass Republicans are treating the law, but that’s not actually what the law says. As per the article:
Guess the free market won’t decide this one, boys. Either way, BlackRock and other investment firms can eat a chode for speculating on housing.
The companies aren’t breaking the law by divesting from oil and gas. The State is breaking the law by continuing to do business with them. The best they can get away with is using the divestments as an excuse to end contracts with those companies.

SCOTUS ruled spending money is speech. So investing is speech. So any law the insists what you can or cannot invest in is the government controlling speech and unconstitutional under the first amendment. Gee it's a shame Republicans on SCOTUS ruled that way years ago and now it's going to bite them in the ass. As per usual with what Republicans want.
Well they can abide their previous rulings or finish destroying what little legitimacy they have left. But if courts have zero legitimacy there's no reason to follow their rulings, so.... GOP backing themselves into corners. Self-own.
