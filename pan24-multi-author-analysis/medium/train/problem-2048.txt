Edit: anyone interested learning about our fucked practice of penal slavery should watch the documentary 13th it should be on Netflix and it's amazingly well made.
From January 2022 to April 2022, 27 percent of the people who were legally entitled to be released from state custody, some for minor crimes or first-time offenses, were held past their release dates. About 24 percent of those improperly detained had been held 90 days or longer past their release days, the Justice Department found.
... “In Louisiana, Black people represent 65 percent of the adult correctional population, while only representing 33 percent of the overall state population,” she added.
Many louisiana prisoners turn a big profit because they can be forced to work and paid less than a dollar an hour for it. Its pretty fucked, and in a similarly fucked way the profits are likely going to private prison owners (who we already pay 10s of thousands year per prisone) and the companies that buy the slave labor (who are probably buddies of the state officials that set up the contracts).
If you mean how do they force them if they refuse, they'll punish them in a variety of ways including loss of privileges, solitary confinement, and parole denial.
Long term solitary is no different than torture based on its effects (many even consider it torture including the UN) and pretty much everyone is going to start working after a bit of that.
