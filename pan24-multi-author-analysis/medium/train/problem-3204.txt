Harris is physically in the Phillipines right now so it somewhat makes sense to re-state American policy towards the nation. Basically, I think some of the US sphere countries are worried that the US can't support Ukraine and everyone else. We can.
Always has, always will. The seas surrounding the Philippines are integral to China's economy and cutting them off is deterrent 1 against an aggressive China. This is why we stood by Philippines' side even though Duterte who was famously anti-American.
More of Duterte wanted to adopt the "friend to all" schtick of having close relations with China, late in his term he was pivoting away from China back to the US.
The current regime is very US friendly, the US helped evacuate his dad after People Power ousted him.
Duterte was anti-everybody it seemed. He never made any sense and would frequently change his mind 180 degrees and make the most outlandish claims and quotes I have ever heard from any leader. It seemed as if he suffered from bipolar disorder. Anyway that guy was scary. A wannabe authoritarian populist.
