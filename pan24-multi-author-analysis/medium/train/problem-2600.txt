These headlines drive me crazy. Republicans will NEVER admit they were wrong. They will lie deflect gaslight and eventually win over the stupid people. We have a name for that type of society. It’s called communist. The Republican Party is a communist cult. If we just labeled republicans communists you would understand everything about them. From their attack on gay rights to their worship of elites to their love of cult daddy. We wouldn’t have to get their opinion on anything because it will always be the opposite of what a liberal would want. What a liberal what’s is what’s best for the country. So republicans want the opposite of that. Liberals want a democracy. Republicans go the other direction and go full commie Russia style. Liberals refuse to call them communists. They call us commies for wanting affordable healthcare and the wealthy to pay taxes and they win and we lose. Call them commies.
