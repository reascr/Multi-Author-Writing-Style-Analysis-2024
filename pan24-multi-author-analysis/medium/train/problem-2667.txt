Not to defend the stupidity of not reading linked articles, but I've lost count of how many times I've opened a post to read more, and been bombarded by an almost unreadable article that's syphilitic with ads, pop ups, and requests for cookies. It's definitely trained me to be less likely to click on the article. In this case the article is perfectly readable, but it's not always the case.
On a separate note, my friend you need to get some proper ad blockers in your life! No one should be subjected to what you're describing. uBlock Origin is the best IMO, and if you feel like taking more time to add more control you can throw NoScript into the mix.
Offer them money and you can call for genocide. Be a user and you lose your account for telling the people calling for your genocide to go fuck themselves. That's capitalism for you.
It really is infuriating, my hope is that as people who've lived with this grow to an age where they can reach high political office en masse, things might change.
I think it says a lot about the state of the world, when "news" sources are prioritizing ads over content, and the end result is fools regurgitating headlines that often say the opposite of what the body of the article says.
"...Ten ads were submitted to each of the three platforms (all were removed before being published)...".
