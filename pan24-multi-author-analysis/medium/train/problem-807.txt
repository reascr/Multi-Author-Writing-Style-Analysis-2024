One of the incredible things about cougars to me is how much they resemble a house cat. Mountain lions don't really look like African lions at all, other than being solid colored. The "small cat" design is just scaled up to leopard size, so the proportions of their faces, bodies, and habits resemble "big cats" but those features still look like "small cats": big eyes, big pointy ears, kind of a sweet expression, a profile without the big cat underbite-looking chin. And they purr and meow, and unlike panthera cats who grasp their food to eat it and often lie on their sides to do it, cougars crouch over their kill like a house cat at a food dish. Beautiful and scary. Instead of making me want a pet cougar, it points out how much sense it makes that a small cat was domesticated instead of a big one. A labrador-sized cat would not only be dangerous, but also more expensive to feed than a dog, since cats' diet require a much higher concentration of meat. A small cougar requires 15 lbs of meat per day.
I looked at the bill and it does include cheetahs, whose size overlaps quite a bit with that of cougars--they can weigh up to 160lbs.
>However, current owners of big cats will be allowed to keep their animals - as long as they don't allow direct contact between them and the public and register them with the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
