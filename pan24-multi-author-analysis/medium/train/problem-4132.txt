I agree. I think he campaigned as an educated-ish everyman. I think some of us younger voters hoped the promises of electoral reform and his lower-white-collar roots would calibrate him to most of us, unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.
Look you can complain about the missiles being fired but that G20 summit had about as much chance of securing a resolution to the war as this forum does.
Really says something about the state of the UK when the press don't even mention names in the headline. No big deal, it'll be a new PM next week anyway.
honestly as an american who just barely skims UK politics as to not be completely unaware of whats going on. Rishi Sunak just looks "under cooked" for the job when i see him in pictures. he's good looking in a way id usually call charismatic. almost as much as Trudeau in canada. but unlike trudeau theres just something underneath the surface that screams DISCOMFORT that i cant quite place my finger on.
As some of the right-wing in Canada will state to paint him as unqualified "he was a highschool drama teacher".
I can't judge him as a person, but as a politician, he's very out of touch and scummy as any of the olds.
