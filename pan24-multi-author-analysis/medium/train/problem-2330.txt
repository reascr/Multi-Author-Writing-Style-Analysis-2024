He’s not talking about western country’s being paragons he’s talking about the people who live in the west who will protest their government’s if they are committing atrocities. The people of Russia are not the same their are outliers but the vast majority of Russians support this war and it’s not uncommon to hear them cheering the deaths of Ukrainians and you may say this is caused by their government crackdown on foreign and non state media at the start of the war but Russia has invaded other places like Georgia without good reason and they got very little resistance from their citizens. Even the US got a lot of pushback on the invasion of Iraq from it citizens and would have gotten more if it wasn’t for 9-11 and today it isn’t looked back as a just war even though the military was successful in it’s tasks.
No one should be surprised by this kind of behavior from them, considering Wagner made shirts commemorating one of the guys who tortured a Syrian man with a sledgehammer before killing him, which has become an unofficial unit logo. This kind of savagery is their calling card.
