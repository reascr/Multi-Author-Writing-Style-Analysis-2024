I remember watching that movie sometime after it came out. Man, that was a fun movie. My favourite part was that, at the end of the day, he learned absolutely nothing. Pretty sure it's implied he has the deuteraganist and main love interest (an American woman) assassinated at the end of the movie after learning she's Jewish.
Also, fun fact, the title of protagonist/deuteragonist/tritagonist originally referred not to the characters, but to the actors themselves. Greek acting troupes were formed of 3 actors who played multiple roles during the play.
Did you know that one of the biggest rules of Greek drama was that death couldn't happen on-stage? So when, for example, Agamemnon got shanked by Clytemnestra and her lover, he would be off-stage and his lines had him shouting something to the effect of "Ack I am stabbed Agh, twice, I am stabbed again Now I die" It is rather silly to read.
They had their General Randomly assassinated by the US on their soverign soil, and spies enter the country and murdered their scientists. Despite how shitty their government is, they have a right to protect their sovereignty from countries that act and kill their citizens freely and with impunity.
- Scientists (according to intel) involved in nuclear weapon programs and weapon programs that are involved in long-distance weapons, with the possible side-effect of producing ICBMs.
When you're a nation which funds and supplies terrorist groups, you shouldn't be surprised that there'd be ramifications. Neither if your leadership is of the religious-worldhating kind and you're involved in illegal nuclear weapons programs.
