Interesting concept. Tell your people 'leave now while you can because in 2 months you will have no freedom or control of your assets unless we say you do'.
You can no longer leave Russia if you were on the first draft list which was created and used for mobilization a few month ago. If you were 18 at the moment mobilization was announced you have extremely high chances to be caught on border control and forced to die in Ukraine for Putin and his friends. The best option is to hide, but not many have it the same as not many people could leave Russia without a need to return in a few months after mobilization's announce.
Regular Ivan has to maintain his family, he barely has any savings and has to pay for his apartment's loan for the next 20-30 years or so. He cannot run because his wife and child/children depend on his income and cannot hide because hiding involves him losing his job. He cannot decide to take a part in this war on Russian side or not, he is obligated to in order to keep his family wealth. I know it sounds dumb since other people's lives and your own one > your wealth, but when it comes to family they have no choice unfortunately. That is exactly how Putin controls people using their poverty.
At some point, we gotta ask ourselves, is Putin secretly an undercover CIA implant/brainwashed minion whose task is to dismantle Russia from its seams. /s but lol.
