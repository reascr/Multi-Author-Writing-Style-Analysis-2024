No progress is being made on those though, because they don't get people angry like guns do. It's much easier to score easy political points within your party by attacking/defending conceptually simple concepts like gun ownership than it is to do it by laying the groundwork for real structural change. In the long run though, that attitude means nothing changes at all, because we're bickering over minutiae rather than actually addressing root causes.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

I believe that making certain guns/equipment illegal it makes crimes associated with those guns/equipment harder to perform - thus reducing said crime.
