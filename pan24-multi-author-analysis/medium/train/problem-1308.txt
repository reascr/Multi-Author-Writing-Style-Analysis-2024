1.	They are sticking with the story that this was a civilian balloon, thus no need for defense ministry to get involved.
Fun fact: was a protest song about floating red balloons into communist East Germany with notes to show the people how great the free world is.
A similar practice is used today with North Korea, where balloons are floated into the country with SD Cards and USB sticks - which are small enough to break and swallow in a pinch. It is easy to get involved with this through.
2.	They didn’t know what their official position would be yet. A lot of analysts are bewildered by this whole incident, which led to Blinken postponing a trip to Beijing that the Chinese themselves very much wanted. It’s like they intentionally sabotaged themselves right before a meeting they wanted. There are speculations that not everyone in the Chinese government was rowing for the same direction, or it could just be a case where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right hand. If that’s the case they were most likely too busy panicking internally to talk to us.
I was under the impression that nk population doesn't have computers ? They been lacking enough food for decades let alone $500 to spend on a 'cheap' computer.
I speculate the Chinese is gonna say some semi-harsh stuff for their domestic audience to consume and then quickly quiet down and pretend this never happened. I think they fucked up and they know it.
