Gerrymandering is an issue, and while maybe did not completely cost the Democrats the election, it does deny fair representation.
A solution that should be considered is increasing the number of representatives in the house. The over a century old 435-member cap further exacerbates the need for gerrymandering, and lessens the voters power in congress. If you are going to insist on originalism in the courts, then give us more representation in line with the Founders original concepts too.
