Also hearing how long the US believes its gonna take till the Abrams are operational (including supply line and training for soldiers/engineers) I kinda have to doubt the whole "we planned it all a year in advance but just held back the actual hardware (e.g. fighter jets) for now.".
Though itâ€™s an old jet fighter, but still very powerful. Why not to deliver these Tornados to Ukraine @Bundeskanzler?
It would appear as if the Ukrainian deputy minister of foreign affairs and previously ambassador in Berlin disagrees with you, /u/Masterious-Lion-3577.
I mean, if the spare parts for maintenance intervals don't exist, they might as well but a shitty RC controller on the flight stick and launch them off like cruise missiles. That's the real problem with these older planes. You live or die by parts availability. That's why the British navy got so hosed by the F35 delay. They were more or less out of harrier parts by the time the first F35B showed up.
At another point he asked for F-16s, F-35s, Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.
