Based on his pre-election comments he obviously wanted to try, but he just couldn't get the support together to go through with it. So he ran away to Florida to hang out with his buddy instead.
Honestly it seems like this. I mean bannon and his fuckfest team of fuckers were all helping him plan the whole thing, to make it more successful than jan6.
Then it seems some key actors didn't go onboard or didn't want to sit out, like the military, so he left Brazil incase the plot got out or those who he tried to approach (like the military) decided to stop being semi-neutral and just blow the lid of the plot.
Lastly it seems either key plotters got impatient, or knew they were gonna get found out anyway for the plot so they might as well try some last ditch effort before the net got tight enough to catch them anyway.
The supporters seems equally fucking stupid and such, but there were literal bussloads of these idiots being shuffled into all the major pillars of society. That just doesn't happen spontaneously.
And the only reason that the 3 power plaza invasion was possible is due to weird lacking of security personnel. There is a current investigation on why there where so few security people there, on where each side accuses the other of omission. The government says that there are too many "Bolsonaristas" on the security forces that were lenient with the protester, and the opposition accuses the government to purposely let a small security personnel on that day to ease the invasion and pose themselves as victims.
