Great power rivalries is what drives wars. Russia wanted to form a NWO sideline Pax Americana and together with China rise as superpowers. Had that happened we would now be on the verge of WWIII.
The appeasers and enablers of fascism lost. And India can thank the west, since a Russia-Chinese military alliance (from "No Limits" to New Axis was a Czech Ukraine annexation away) would spell doom to India.
Why would people think America loses in a "great power rivalry" scenario? An unapologetic American empire with its overwhelming naval power would be the most horrifying situation for third-world countries.
Because great power rivalry means power parity among them. Right now America has overwhelming military economic diplomatic advantage over all its adversaries combined, this is being the sole superpower.
Russia thought the power gap was much much shallower, it was deadly wrong, and now will pay the price with its dissolution and made an example of for future wannabe NWO-seekers (ie China).
Most likely it’s one of those speeches that are intended for his voters …. World is always changing,… and Russia was way stronger in the past than China is today compare to the US/NATO. Chinas power came from manufacturing industry and cheap labor, now when manufacturing leaving China, due to the cost of labour, and politics; China doesn’t have enough economic power to produce and to spend to maintain GDP as before, so their economy will go nowhere but down. That is why china wants Taiwan and it’s semiconductor industry, one thing that west still would need from them if they had it.
