How can you say that there’s no geopolitical impact to picking sides anymore? How can you make such an absurd statement? Let’s take an example here: India makes a statement that India+China+Russia+OPEC is coming in a group. Will there be no geopolitical changes? Will US ignore such a grouping? Will USA not plan ahead and be terrified because of the world’s major countries and maximum population of this world coming combined in a group? And you also said that India has no negotiating power. Dear, then why was Joe Biden saluting to Narendra Modi in the recent G20 Summit? Because he knows how India is vital for the international relations. India will surpass China in terms of population in coming years being the demographic dividend the key feature, which will give rise a huge market.You can’t be insane to mess with India because India holds the future. Because if it’s strategic location + Population + Democracy + relations with other countries. Choose your words carefully before making any supreme statements.
Most countries hedge their bets, trying not to overly support one great power over the other. The world isn't divided into two cold war camps anymore.
