I’m a left wing libertarian; I don’t care much about private ownership, happy to pay taxes and industry regulation is good. I do care about my personal liberties and those of citizens in general. I think maybe left wing libertarians tend to care about personal liberties whereas right wing libertarians extend that to corporations. Taxes are great because they are a method of redistributing wealth to level the playing field as it were for those who don’t have means from those who have more than enough. I don’t want to preserve unjust hierarchies, actually the opposite!
