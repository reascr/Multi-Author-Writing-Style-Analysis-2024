Putin is careful not to push too hard on Lukashenko, lest the Belarusian citizens rebel and cause another lost puppet.
Well yes, the entire purpose of this visit was to force Lukashenka to again lend his ground forces to throw themselves into meat grinder. He didn't just make personal visit for the first time in years to talk about house chores lol.
Calling out obvious bullshit is quoted. Not a Reuters assessment. All Reuters can say is that someone said it but Reuters cannot plainly say that Russia is absorbing, invading, colonizing, and executing a broad genocide campaign against Ukrainians in Ukraine.
Younger "brother" thanks older "brother" for cheap oil and gas: Lukashenko, at one point calling Putin an "older brother", praised Russia as a friend that had "held out its hand to us", providing Belarus with oil and gas at discounted prices.
Lie of the Year: "Russia has no interest in absorbing anyone," Putin said. "There is simply no expediency in this ... It's not a takeover, it's a matter of policy alignment.".
