That makes it fairly clear that she wasn't representing the wishes of roughly half the state of Arizona, at least in significant ways. I saw a comment elsewhere that she voted with Biden's priorities about 90% of the time. It's that other 10% that's the problem.
It’s not the 10%. She watered down or killed bills and that doesn’t get calculated in the vote percentage. Same with Manchin but his situation is drastically different considering he represents one of the reddest states in the country.
Makes you think about how crazy it is that candidates in the general election are dictated by maybe 20% of the state population.
The rule of thumb is that usually about 30% of the general election day electorate votes in a primary. And the general election day electorate itself is maybe a third of the population on a good day. So if you're talking about who's voting in the Democratic primary in Arizona, you're talking around 10% of the state's population. Not roughly half.
Good point. I don't know where I saw the 90/10 thing, and can't seem to find it now. Is there somewhere to find bills that never saw the light of day with some explanation of what killed them?
The was reasonably close, (50.0%/47.6%) with 64.5% of registered voters casting ballots. I was giving the people who didn't vote the benefit of the doubt and assuming the split between Sinema and McSally among them was pretty similar.
