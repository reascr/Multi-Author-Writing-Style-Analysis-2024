They regularly drive on the highway near where I live in Finland, the armoured brigade is located there.
They got steamrolled by the Abrams. One of the main advantages the M1 has over a T72 is the M1 is deadly accurate even moving at full speed. For a T72 to be accurate it has to stop to aim.
T-72’s also have gun stabilizers, although I doubt their fire control systems are on par with the M1. I’ve heard the Iraqi’s dug out their positions to have their tanks sit hull down with only the turret exposed, but rendered them completely stationary and the coalition forces were easily able to pick off the stationary targets. Not to mention the Iraqis had older model T-72b’s likely without any ERA protection that more modern Russian variants typically have.
I do wonder if the decision wasn't already made a while ago, or if they weren't already preparing for the eventuality of it.
Wouldn't be the first time Ukraine gets weapons that take 2 months to deliver, two weeks after the decision to deliver them.
My mom was a logistics tech for the US Marines. I use to watch them load the big cargo ships. I saw the Humvee before it became popular and was like "Jesus that thing is big!" Then the Abrams MBT rolled up... The Humvee was tiny compared to it.
LOL. Those Abrams rocked the Iraqi tankers in T72s back in the Gulf War. The Iraqis are fierce motherfuckers and were battle hardened from their wars with Iran. They knew how to fight with those T72s.
