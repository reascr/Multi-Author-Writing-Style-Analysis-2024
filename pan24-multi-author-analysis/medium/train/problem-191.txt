Why are you repeating this? It’s literally not true that the upfront costs for coal are less. It’s just not. At some point years ago that was true but time marches forward. At the moment the cost to start either facility are up but solar/wind/etc are a lot cheaper on both up front costs and operating expenses. It’s not even close.
I just commented on the previous statement. What I meant it’s not really trading problems for poor countries if they already have one of the problems and will keep it (being poor). No idea if you’re correct, but with such statements it would be better to include sources to inform people like me lol.
There are a lot of sources but some are behind paywalls. I chose this be because it’s not paywalled but the gist is that if you are an energy investor or a business looking to increase the energy supply it is far cheaper to build a new wind/solar/offshore plant that generates more electricity for less investment and is cheaper on operating costs. These plants are beating coal by a mile now.
