Shortly after , it was announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be visiting Washinon to meet with President Biden and to address Congress in his first trip abroad since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February. The visit comes as Congress is considering an omnibus spending bill that includes $45 billion of emergency assistence to Ukraine, and, , as "... the White House braces for greater resistance from a Republican-controlled House that’s signaled it will put more scrutiny on aid for Ukraine in the new Congress. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has said his party’s lawmakers will not write a 'blank check' for Ukraine.".
Then... he AIRED THE CLIP. Huge mistake. I've no idea who in the newsroom allowed that to happen, because the clip instantly contradicted what Tucker just said. Now, I know most viewers won't notice because they can only understand what Tucker tells them to think. But I was sort of dumbfounded.
Not that any of that matters. But through my disgust I found it encouraging that even Fox News and Tucker Carlson aren't willing to spend a lot of time on the subject. By drawing attention, it creates awareness, and the morality is so clear on the most cursory consideration that creating awareness is VERY bad for their Putin-ordered messaging.
This will be Zelenskyy's second address to Congress, the first having been remotely delivered in March. The first, 20-minute address can be viewed .
He used this exact quote to go on a tirade about this authoritarian daring to come into our Congress wearing sweatpants and demanding money. Who does he think he is, stealing our money?!
I roll my eyes every time the Right goes on about his clothing choices. They would complain if he dressed in a nice suit and tie too. They're like a bunch of teenage girls....
