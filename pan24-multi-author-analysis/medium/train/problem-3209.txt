"Schoolchildren apparently pose a major challenge to the political establishment in Tehran. Security and intelligence agencies are trying to find ways to suppress crowds of children calling for freedom.".
This is how it went in the Syrian conflict a decade ago. Kids protest, thug beat and kill kids. Parents start protesting their kids getting hurt. Then all hell breaks loose.
1. Sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims. They've been killing each other literally since their prophet died, and they have civil wars everywhere there is a mix of them (Iraq, Syria, Yemen, etc.). Syria is 2/3 Shia and were oppressed by a 1/3 Suni.
2. State actors having proxy fights. Syria is propped up by Iran and borders Israel. Israel routinely strikes Syria and Iran routinely arms Syria to strike Israel. Golan Heights is of particular important here. Add to that Israel is aligned with the West and Syria traditionally aligned with Russia and you also start to see the west and Russia having a proxy fight here. Always "contractors" (American) or "volunteers" (Russia) so that there isn't a direct confrontation between powers.
Iran is a little different in that they are predominately Shia, but the second point will likely hold. If the killing of protestors continues you'll likely see sanctions imposed by the west as well as humanitarian aid and arms being funneled by the west to protestors, likely though some intermediary like India.
