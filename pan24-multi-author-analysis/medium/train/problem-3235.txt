... is full of traitors and insurrectionists at this point IMO, their only universal ongoing goal is to corrupt the US government as much as possible to enable their twisted pseudo-religious fascist worldview where a white male majority makes up the rules and enforces them selectively as they see fit. It's a complete betrayal of everything they supposedly stood for throughout the Cold War, but very on par with the embrace of the radical elements in their base. The only reason they have any power still is the massive amount of gaslighting and brainwashing they've been doing through their heavily-biased media outlets (Faux News, Breitbart, OANN etc.) to gullible, selfish and/or hate-filled people who have been conditioned to always vote for that shiny red (R) above all else. I have lost all respect for anyone who to this day can still consider themselves a Republican, it's like a giant red flag to avoid association with that person at all costs by now based solely upon the views they must hold and opinions about the nation they must believe (or how completely clueless they are about very important subjects) in order to stick with that traitorous Party.
Nope, after Dumbp’s shit show, I would only re-enter a deal if it had incredibly strict rules for termination, and couldn’t just be backed out of or cancelled.
And they've been violating it long before this war. Russia usually vetoes security council resolutions related to it.
