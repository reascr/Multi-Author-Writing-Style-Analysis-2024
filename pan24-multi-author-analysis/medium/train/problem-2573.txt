I grew up in a conservative household. Father mostly. I remember watching Rush when he had a tv show and then listening to his radio show. Itâ€™s like grievance crack and I was hooked on it for a brief period. Going away to college and living on my own in multiple us regions changed my views. I can understand how people fall for this stuff but I am frustrated that no amount of reason or logic or blatant, obvious hypocrisy get some people to consider their beliefs. Trump is a piece shit glowing brightly in the mid day sun, and the fact that some people love him just boggles the mind. I get that some people will vote for anyone with an R next to their name, but to actually like this guy??
