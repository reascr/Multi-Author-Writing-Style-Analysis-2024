Man itâ€™s gonna be funny as fuck to see the new generation of conscriptovich diging more trenches in the red forest realy work that radiation in to the pores Russia is not gonna accomplish anything sense Ukrainian is getting leopard 2 tanks and those are gonna spank the T-34 that Russia is gonna have to dig out get us a repeat of Ukrainian tractors capturing tax deductible Russian tanks.
I wonder how many man hours and millions that the West/5 eyes has spend on assisting Ukraine fucking up the Russians ðŸ¤” I bet any move towards Kyiv would be met with well deserved destruction and carnage.
I have no doubt there is substantial western assistance for deep targeting - ie a hotline to HIMARS battery and real-time guidance about targeting logistics and command nodes or large troop formations.
It'll be more attack on power sources than a manned invasion. Freezing Ukraine to submission was always a big hope. Sucks that we happen to have a really cold fucking start of the winter for the first time in years here in East Europe!
