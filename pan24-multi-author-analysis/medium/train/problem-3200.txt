Isn't sharing someone's nude photos with out consent actually considered a fairly serious crime anymore?
I know there were bits of revenge porn at the spearhead of the legislation but it kinda got to the point lawmakers and other powerful people were worried about people sharing nudes of their adult children. So they made some legislation about it. So Twitter and other outlets would face, sharing this to try to catch Joe with some splash damage and then lots of legal trouble OR just making it go away.
"The following states have no revenge porn laws: Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, and Wyoming.".
Uh, that’s kinda wrong. In Kentucky it’s illegal to distribute “private erotic matter” online without their consent with additional penalties if it’s with the intent to inflict harm or harassment.
