The media keeps making the point that Congress can force the rail workers to accept a deal, but fail to mention that Congress can also force the companies to accept a deal. So how about just giving these hard working people the time off flexibility they deserve? But of course this is Congress we’re talking about, so they’ll take the side of the highly monopolized rail industry in handing the workers a shit sandwich.
The other thing that keeps getting talked about is how big a raise they’re getting. Sounds nice except a) that’s not the main thing they’re asking for and b) they haven’t gotten one in years so a big raise now is just making up for years of getting screwed.
It's "forcing" the workers and companies to accept the third-party panel's recommended contract (that some unions have already voted down), not Congress coming up with a new contract.
If you want to avert a strike why not give the workers what they want? Rail companies make billions and are the backbone of the US economy, I'm sure they could manage a bit more pay or a benefit program or something...
If that's possible, it's news to me. All the coverage I've seen, and has been to force through the current proposed contract, not any modified version.
