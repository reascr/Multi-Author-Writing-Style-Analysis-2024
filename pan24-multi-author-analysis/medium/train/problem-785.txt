Welcome to every history article ever. “Amazing dinosaur fossils found of new species” “pristine shipwreck discovered” “Ancient tomb reveals artifacts valued at millions!”.
Only the Theropod Dinosaurs would, but yes that is correct. Having an intact one from a T-Rex though is relatively rare, hence why it took over 100 years to realize they actually had wishbones.
To be fair, that's usually because the Media does a piss-poor way of portraying science. We discover cool fossils all the time, but it takes a DECADE of painstaking extraction to get it to the point it's actually visible to the layperson. Hence why we tend to employ artists to make concept art for us.
Oh what you wanted a picture? HAHHA! Sorry bub. You can see it in 20 years in random museum that you’ll never get a chance to visit.
Also: Most people don't actually care. They scroll by reading shit. It's like the University of Chicago Field Museum where the big almost complete T-Rex Lucy is. Everyone spends time looking at the big T-Rex, but never goes to look at her Wishbone which is actually the coolest part of her.
Yes but given our long struggle of trying to get water to go some where other than where it want to, its a miracle that we have as many flushing toilets as we do now. Our ancestors would be incensed with the amount of precious water we poor on our poop.
