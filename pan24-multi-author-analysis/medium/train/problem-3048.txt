Just rubbing it in that Joe can ride a train in the open closer to the warzone than ol Poot lol meanwhile Pooter is busy shitting his pants in a secret railway, with his own family sent away from his country.
This honestly makes the most sense if you think about everything going on. Bleed the Russians while they wait for Western tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, longer range rockets, and possibly jets so that they can steam roll them in a grand scale counter offensive like Kharkiv. Russia has gone through half of all of their working tanks according to U.S. intelligence and they've gone through at the very least 60k lives and more than double that in injuries. About a million of their best and brightest have fled the country and their economy is on the verge of collapsing. I can't see Ukraine messing this up with all they've accomplished and I can't see Russia winning anymore. The Russians are tossing away so much equipment and so many lives at taking a couple of kilometers that they could easily lose. A wise man once said, "We are very lucky that they are so fucking stupid.".
