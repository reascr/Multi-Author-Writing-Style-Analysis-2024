People like Hobbs are better suited being appointed to administrative jobs by a winning warrior-like candidate. Not trying to be said warrior. This isn't 1972 or 1982 anymore. Most Republicans are Fascists now, no longer just the respectable gentleperson who's views I disagree with. We need more Bernie Sanders, Tim Ryan, John Fetterman type fighters. Not Evan Bayhs.
Most of us weren't taught how to deal with people who love conflict and drama. We were (told) to disengage, ignore them, don't give them attention and they'll go away and leave you alone.

We need warriors to deal with this kind of threat. I'm sorry, but peaceable booknerds and librarians who just want a friendly exchange aren't built for this kind of fight.
