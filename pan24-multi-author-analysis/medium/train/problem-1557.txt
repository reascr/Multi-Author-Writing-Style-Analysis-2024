Imagine signing up for this shit and then the next thing you know you come back aware but with no body or inputs, in a black void with occasional strange/painful sensations as the company tests shit by zapping your brain in a jar. The horror. Just die with dignity.
As opposed to feeling bacteria, fungi, maggots, etc. slowly eating away at your body? I think I'd take the fire.
What a joke. I'm sure 100 years from now someone will be able to take all those brain cells that ruptured when ice crystals formed in them and put them back together. /s.
imagine a bucket of water almost filled to the top. and water is slowly dripping in the bucket. the same amount of water dripping in it is also dripping out from the bottom.
If they're using cryoprotectants, well they're toxic, so they'd be poisoned in every cell. But hey, I guess it gives you someone to give your money to.
the good thing about death is no matter how horrible of a person you are and no matter what atrocities you have committed, eventually even they will die and the world will be free of them too.
Some ancient Egyptian mummies were preserved almost like they were still alive, by basically isolating them from any amount of water/air/etc (by encasing them in many layers of coal and other materials). They were still so "fresh" that the tissues were still supple and lifelike 3000+ years later. That would probably be the least painful way to bury someone in this scenario.
now imagine sealing the bottom of the bucket but water still continues to fill the bucket from the top.
