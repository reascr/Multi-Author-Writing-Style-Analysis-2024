Basically the US wants to develop a method to deliver conventionally armed Presicion Guided Weapons anywhere on Earth within an hour. Back in 1998 thry tried to hit Osama Bin Laden with Tomahawks. But by the time the Tomahawks got there, he was gone. One idea was to use submarine launched Trident missiles with a conventional or even inert warhead. As a 500KG warhead hitting a target at Mach 18. Can level a city block. But the Russians objected, saying thst thry wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a conventional warhead and a nuclear one.
The Apollo spacecraft were very roughly conical shaped but the flat end headed towards the Earth, in order to slow them down.
Well Bin Laden was in a terrorist training camp miles from anywhere in Afghanistan. But the Americans could put aero-brakes on it to slow it down, have a different shape e.g. missile launched nuclear war heads are conical shaped with the pointy end heading towards the enemy.
The city block statement is just a crude calculation based on mass (500KG) x velocity and converting that energy into TNT (its surprisingly high). The Americans did also develop the "Ninja" Hellfire missile. Where they can fire the missile at say a taxi and decide which occupant in the taxi they want to slice and dice. Leaving the other occupants unharmed from the missile but the car is a total write off. Just so thry can minimise the collateral damage.
Not gonna lie, the us acting like a global police force kinda scares me. Them using unmanned drones and the president just choosing targets with the press of a button is very problematic, this would just be another version of that.
