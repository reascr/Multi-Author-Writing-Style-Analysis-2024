Hey i will agree with you on that standpoint. Zelinskey (sorry if I misspelled his name) but anyways he very very very effectively used social media towards this whole ordeal and it didn't just work but its worked fucking phenomenally IMO. But yeah i hope the west does take out Putler collectively. Bc he's a POS who invaded his neighbor bc he doesn't recognize them as their own sovereign state. Wtf gives his ass the right to recognize any country as a legit country. He should've just worried about his real problems at home instead of going after innocent ppl and bombed schools, hospitals, playgrounds, civilians, civilian neighborhoods, shopping malls, etc... Wow that list could keep on going, oh and MASS kidnapping on a scale of the likes we haven't seen in nearly a century. But since he decided to go that route now hits fate is decided and i predict he'll wither be dead or not in power in less than a year.
Agreed, but many battles around the world are fought and no one gives a singular fuck, says allot about how much they used social media strategically and also how invested the west is in fucking Putin over, there is always the fact that they are white as well.
