No, he's right. Their mission is to logjam everything they can when the democrats are in power, so they can point at government and say "look at how many millions of dollars we wasted filibustering this food-for-orphans bill, government just doesn't work" Most people won't read about the horse-trading aspect of this or decide it means they need to vote for a party more serious about governing. They'll just scroll past "congress a mess" headlines on their social media feeds and use it to fuel their 'The swamp is corrupt, burn it all down" cognitive biases, even though that is totally not how swamps work.
Same, but this means the Republicans have won. They successfully broke government, at least in our minds, to the point that if they do anything at all we're surprised. The complete breaking will take time.
