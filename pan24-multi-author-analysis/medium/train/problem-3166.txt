So, yes, Jay and Alex are both “out-of-staters” that became WV politicians, but when you actually look at the details of each one’s career, they’re pretty different.
This dude’s political career exists solely because the Koch political machine made it so. He doesn’t live in WV and has no interest in the concerns of WVians.
This sub loves to hate on Joe Manchin but you better hope to whatever deity you prefer that he wins. You currently have a Democratic senator from one of the reddest states in the country and you may never have another in your lifetime if he goes down right now. Like him or not he has been helpful in passing some key Biden legislation and seating more judges than any President to this point. You don't have to like him but do you really want to lose him?
I'd argue that he sometimes steers the bandwagon. Look at what he did with the child tax credit that was widely popular and how he ignored coal unions regarding BBB. He'll do things that are popular with constituents but sometimes ignores them rather than educates them.
