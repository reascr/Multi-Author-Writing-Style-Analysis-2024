Interesting how the article's giggest claim had already been corrected and acknowledged officially before this article was published. The other claims against him seem to rely on a bid of mental gymnastics to indicate Biden should use a different context, or include data that would offset his numbers. Overall, a bit of a dog's breakfast of a fact check article, stressing minor exaggerations at best and that the vast majority of Biidn's citations are correct. Definitely written with an agenda.

In that context, CNN's descent into a hard right turn under the guise of balance is even more wretched.
In contrast here, for most of Trump's presidency I made an effort to give benefit of the doubt when I saw headlines saying he said something misleading, false, or otherwise just awful. I'd go in reading those articles looking for ways Trump was getting an uncharitable assessment. But, far more often than not, when I read or watched the things Trump actually said, the headlines were actually giving Trump more credit than he deserved. The crap that came out of Trump's mouth was regularly even worse than the headlines I tried to take with a grain of salt.
