Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine has put Moldova - one of Europe's poorest countries - under great strain. They rely on gas from Russia and electricity from Ukraine, but Russia has disrupted that source. The mad man in the bunker continues to find ways to cause more crisis for the EU.
No surprise considering that russia has admitted to interfering with uk and us election. I imagine moldova's (being an old USSR nation) is guaranteed to be getting screwed by russias meddling and manipulations.
What's worse is that the UK did an investigation and when it was found out the Russians were involved they sat on the report and refused to release it until it was heavily redacted. The Tories knew and did nothing besides cover it up.
You do know interfering in elections is part of the game right? I feel it odd and Brits and Yanks cry about Russian interferences but they all helped military coups and covertyl and publicly invaded and toppled governments, not really the right people to cry about it.
