Yup never impede on the sovereignty of a nation that the US is interested in. There are way more factors in place for Taiwan's protection than there are for Ukraine such as semiconductors, and shipping lanes in the south China sea. The US ain't letting China do noting to that island.
China also only has a handful of nukes, so the U.S. isn’t afraid to get down and dirty with them like we are with Russia. Chinas main strenh is it’s industry and sheer manpower, neither of which helps in an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. In fact, their industry would be crippled by the sudden lack of western customers in that scenario.
I think deep down, China has no real intention of taking Taiwan. Publicly, they claim to, but it’s just to keep their internal populace distracted and to maintain their “claims” on the island.
At the end of the day, China has 1.4 billion mouths to feed, if the economy evaporates (like it would in this scenario) that suddenly becomes 1.4 billion hungry dissidents, which is a major problem.
