And the DNC should let the actual registered voters decide who the nominee is this time, rather than the party big wigs. I have a sneaking suspicion that if you let the candidate people are actually voting for be your nominee you have a better chance at winning an election. Radical, I know, but I say we give it a shot.

Biden should step aside when the time comes and let someone else run. He did better than expected in the midterms, but I don't think he can beat DeSantis in 2024, and that's all that matters.If he steps aside he can go out on top.
