>Police suspect the two explosions in Jerusalem this morning were caused by near-identical remotely detonated explosive devices. The devices were packed with nails to maximize casualties, Kan reports, citing police officials.
I wear the downvotes as a badge of honor because it shows just how many actual morons I triggered. Get rekt intersectionalist snowflakes. I am the real feminist.
It is astounding how people think isreal = jewish. Nah dude...a country is a country, and a people is a people. A country can be informed/led by a religion or culture, but it is NOT that religion nor culture.
This is the same reason you can Hate china and not be racist because you Love Taiwan and Hong Kong. Chinese isnt only in one place, Jewish isnt only in one place. Anti-semitism has literally no meaning in it that is connected to Israel.
The jewish people deserve better than Israel. Israel is a fucked up terrorist country no better than Russia. Jewish people have a vibrant culture and history and contribute more than their weight to our modern world.
