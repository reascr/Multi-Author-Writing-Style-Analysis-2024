Because they are drunk enough to consider it funny to shoot fireworks at random other people, everyone else already ran away because they don't like being pelted with explosives, and now a bunch of new people showed up, and since they're important/"official" people, it's extra funny And they even brought blinking lights to the party, attracting all the attention.
Pro tip from the US: if someone is actively breaking into your house, they’ll likely be long gone before police get there, and you’ll file a report and little to nothing will happen after that. If your car is broken into, you’ll be filing a report over the phone and will never physically see a cop and you can kiss the stolen sht goodbye. The report may help you with your insurance to get the broken window fixed, but expect that to cost less than your deductible and to pay for that out of pocket too (ask me how I know).
Have FD there ensures support, witnesses, and medical care which are better than nothing and actually help you.
