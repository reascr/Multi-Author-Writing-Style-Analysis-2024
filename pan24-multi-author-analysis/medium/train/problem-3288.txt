Biden said it well a few months back... I can't see an offramp from this for Putin... the only question that matters now... how long does the world continue to allow this sort of evil to take place and only respond by strong words, and hap hazard military strategies? NATO when into the Former Yugoslavia to stop them from slaughtering eachother. When do we stop allowing others to be slaughtered in such a manner? If Putin wants to saber rattle his so called nukes as a shield to obliterate Ukraine in a way that might as well be nuclear in result, then what's the point? Simple warning. If you launch nukes, the world will remove Russia as a country from human existence. For now, NATO should be removing Russian from the Ukraine. Overtly. With overwhelming force. Instead, it's become a terrible case of envy temptation... we are rejoicing in their misery by our actions of gossping about it, writing stories about it, selling arms about it. We as a planet deserve what is coming. We have been warned, over and over and over.
I hope someone is there to make bad jokes for imaginary internet points when youâ€™re turned to pink paste inside your own home.
