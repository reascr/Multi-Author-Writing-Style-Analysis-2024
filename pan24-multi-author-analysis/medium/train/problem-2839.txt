Sure does but if you cant feed them, house them, or provide a certain level of societal medicine then you hit a hard ceiling for population level and people die off untill you get back to the level your society can support. Market capitalism in its infancy and adolescense raised the ceiling. When a society is organically incentivised to maximize production for the attainment of wealth and you couple that with a free thinking, relatively educated people, you get innovation, invention, and the ability to bring standards of living elsewhere up through export of surplus. Idk why i even.bothered writing this though because im probably speaking to some spoiled 14 year old who has never held a job.
We do hold world leaders accountable, just not when they are sitting on a bunch of oil and buy our stuff.
If gas shot up to $10 a gallon, and energy prices tripled and the average American can't drive to work or afford to heat their home, they'd happily trade one dead journalist for normalcy, and you're kidding yourself if you don't believe that.
