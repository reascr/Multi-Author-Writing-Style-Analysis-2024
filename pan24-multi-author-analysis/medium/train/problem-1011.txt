1) Why are we so focused on someone following the process and not someone who committed multiple felonies with 20 times the number of more current national secrets?
3) Why are republicans focused on Hunter Biden when Jared had way more access and motive to sell secrets?

2.	 To be fair its not biden they should be investigating but hjs team. His team failed him and put his name in the spotlight.
Im not blaming biden at all here btw - his team screwed him. People should be fired, clearances revoked, and prosecuted.
