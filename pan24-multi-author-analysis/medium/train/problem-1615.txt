Teen Vogue is more respectable journalism than Forbes, Business Insider, Newsweek, etc... And that's not even a joke.
"But even that decisive victory came at a high cost for the Americans. Chinese escorts, aircraft and submarines sank a fifth of the deployed American subs every three or four days throughout the two-week war.".
I'd like to know if this scenario is takes into account leadership of and abilities of the crews that man the prospective Navies. The article also does not mention if it includes the JDF or any other allies.
So just 20% of just submarines to defeat the entire Chinese Navy? Lose of life is bad, but that sounds like a bargain.
That's a hell of a bargain. Only 20% of the fleet lost to put China in the same position as Japan post-43, with no ability to import food or oil and losing their new ships as faster than they can commission them.
Nukes won't stop that assault and the US would have no reason not to accept whatever the Chinese are willing to give up at that point. In this situation the biggest threat to the existence of China would be internal problems, not subjugation by a foreign power. Considering at this point China would likely have lost all their Boomers they would not have any second strike capability, so a nuclear strike against the US would be asinine.
