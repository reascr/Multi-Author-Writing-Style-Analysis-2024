Some context: In the aftermath of the Republicans’ dysfunctional speakership election, George Santos has eaten most of the attention, stealing some of the limelight away from the plum committee assignments being handed to extremists, or their weird ideas.
It may not last forever, but the House’s bona fide extremists and their weird ideas are helpfully distracting attention from the scandal-plagued congressman.
Santos isn't really distracting from anything. Not much has been going on in the House because they're still putting committees together and getting going.

You are so right. It’s stuff like ”No matter what you’re doing, here’s why you’re being fooled” type of headlines that make me hate a lot of media. No one’s take ever seems to be “yeah, that’s a reasonable reaction for the population to have.” A lot of this was in the Trump years, where if headlines were getting clicks we were all eating up his tricks but if we weren’t then we were overwhelmed and tired of paying attention. So frustrating.
