Note that this is the master appointed by Judge Aileen Cannon to review the Mar-a-Lago documents for possible executive privilege, etc.
It means DOJ can use all the documents immediately in its investigation without waiting for the special master to rule on any exclusions. Not sure, but Trump can probably appeal today's ruling.

This is about Judge Qannons lack of authority at all in the case, which would make her special master order moot. The order takes place in 7 days, unless Trump files an appeal with the Supreme Court and they issue a stay. Special council Jack Smith is overseeing this Mar a Lago documents case AND the separate Jan 6/election investigation.
Doesn't involve the separate investigation now being run by Special Counsel Jack Smith appointed by AG Merrick Garland.
