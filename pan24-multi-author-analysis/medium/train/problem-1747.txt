Trump for the ‚ÄúTrump Patriotic American-Continental God United Party of the Christ Southern Baptist of New QAnon ProTIFA Republic‚Äù.
DeSantis absolutely wants Trump's voters. Almost all of Desantis's policies have been aimed at their asinine political ideals. Here in Florida, the voters are pretty much split between Trump and DeSantis, not republican vs democrat. It's a sad joke.
I support you on this. Trump please go third party and show the Dems that you own them, the GQP, and Hunter Biden! /s.

Many of his most fervent fanatics might still turn violent, but that likely must be dealt with in any scenario.
