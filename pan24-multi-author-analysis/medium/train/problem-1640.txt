The way I see it, no one is forced to accept them, but they do have to tolerate them and not discriminate in open society. They can hate all they want, just keep it to themselves. Their God will know what's in their heart, so God will know they hate LGBT+ people. These people should let God deal with all those LGBT+ people when the time comes, if God actually has a problem with them. Something about not judging people, lest ye be judged....or something like that from the bible these people don't know, or comprehend the meaning of, or follow because it's inconvenient for them.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
