China is somewhat satisfied with the status quo and probably won't attack. What they don't like is Taiwanese pushes for independence and breaking off from "One-China" policy.
Progress like this is why I roll my eyes whenever warhawk pundits try to say that China is about to invade Taiwan any day now, but for realsies this time, we swear. They don't want to fuck up the progress they've made digging themselves out of the deep COVID hole and, with their severe population crisis, they probably don't want to do something stupid like send their young people to fight in what would amount to WWIII.
the west also depends on Taiwan (muh chips) and China knows it, and they also depends on the west for a lot of things. All of their hostile/nationalist rhetorics are simply distractions from slowing economy growth. They have a much better chance asking the KMT government (poised to win the next TW election) than invading.
China collapsed again yesterday, and collapsed this morning too. And now I see here that it just collapsed once again. I bet it will collapse again within the next 5 minutes or so.
