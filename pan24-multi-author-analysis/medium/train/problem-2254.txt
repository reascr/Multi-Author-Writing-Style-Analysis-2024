If a country is growing, or becoming wealthier, or there is substantial inflation, all budget allocations are likely to be larger than the preceding years. There's no point in talking about "records".
What do you mean? No, several other departments also got "record" funding, because there has been an 8% inflation for more than a year.

We all recognize the importance of the military and spending on it. But the government is out of control with this stuff. $800 BILLION in ONE YEAR is madness.
That’s right. $800B which who knows how many more billions in dark money funding weapons, but healthcare for all is the devil!
How about make this the central point for elections moving forward: healthcare for all or not. Make all politicians clearly state he’s or no.
