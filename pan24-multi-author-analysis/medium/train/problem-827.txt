Yesterday I got into an argument in an "anti-war" sub (ie: pro-war, and even pro-genocide, as long as it isn't done by the West) with a guy who claimed that Ukraine was slaughtering people in Donbass (even if only around 300 civilians from both sides had died since 2016, after the end of the high intensity conflict, up to the February invasion, with the number of fatalities getting smaller with each year) and that the Army was filled with Nazis (even if Ukraine itself is, depending on the study, way less anti-semitic than Russia or downright the least anti-semitic country in Eastern Europe, and that the far-right parties only have one single seat in the Parliament).
One of the people I watch covering the war explains it like this: Russian propaganda is a disorganized mess on purpose. Even within a few minutes of a single state news program, you'll have like 4 different people arguing completely contradictory points and not even acknowledging each other, which leaves the viewer more bewildered than anything.
You chose nice example, "Berlusconi" says everything you want to know about the sort of people who make excuses for putin with just one name. Sleazy, corrupt, morally bankrupt self-serving scumbags who play dumb and repeat russian propaganda.
