When you have the initiative and the advantage you keep the tempo and increase the pressure. You don’t slow down, you don’t stop, you don’t take up defensive positions until your goals are met.
I don’t disagree to be honest. It’s definitely a lopsided misinfo war, but it’s good to be vigilant.
Western citizens are far removed from the war, but their posture and by extension that of their governments is a material factor in the outcome of the war. It’s almost guaranteed that on large social media platforms there are government-sponsored efforts to influence public opinion in the West towards this war, from both sides of the conflict. And they would be foolish not to make such an effort. This is just as important as counterintel or any other spying / propaganda efforts. We should all be vigilant in checking for that bias in what we consume here.
They tried in the past. More than 20 times before this year's war. As we've seen. None of them worked. But I guess the 21st time's the charm.
