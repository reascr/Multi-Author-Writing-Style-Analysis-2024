Also there's every possibility that he didn't think China/US were adversaries at the time, certainly not to the extent they are now. 2010 and 2012 was before China/US relations really soured. This was before Trump's trade war. Hell Xi Jinping wasn't even President at the time. Hu Jintao was President during this time and he was largely considered quite moderate and predictable and even downgraded China's relationship with Russia while keeping pretty good relations with the US in line with his predecessor Jiang Zemin who was also relatively pro US-China relations.
Yeah, Cmdr Walker, who sold the screw configuration of our submarines to the Soviets in the 1980s was paid like $30,000, and Clayton Lonetree, the US embassy guard in Moscow, sold us out for sex with a pretty average looking female KGB agent. I think treason should carry the death penalty, especially if you're compromising the entire submarine fleet for $30,000 or selling embassy secrets for a blowjob. This pilot should be shot too, if he's guilty.
