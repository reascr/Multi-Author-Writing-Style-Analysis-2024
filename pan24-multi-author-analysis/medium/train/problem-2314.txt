Depends on if it was a repurposed s300 being used to hit a ground target or if it was a kalibr missile. If the debris is an s300 then debris alone won't tell you who it came from. There's also a very real possibility that it was fired by Russia but in the interest of de-escalation, this is the story being told. It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to publicly state Russia fired a cruise missile killing Polish citizens if they don't want to escalate because of it.
So glad its calm, measured and understanding response from the Polish president, for what could have been a really fucked up situation.
If it was 3 I'm guessing the Poles would know by now by the debris, so it was probably one of the former 2. There's been far, far, graver accidents during the cold war that the US and USSR agreed to sweep under the rug. No reason the same won't be done here.
Coincidentally I just watched that episode of For All Mankind and was shocked when I realized it was a real event! I can't imagine how tense it must've been for those living at the time. Wars have been started for far, far less.
Proving it was fired by Russia is even more beneficial for Ukraine because it would come with some sort of escalation. It could be used as an excuse to provide better and more air defenses.
