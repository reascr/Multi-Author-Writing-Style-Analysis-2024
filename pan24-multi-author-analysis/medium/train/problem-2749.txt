I imagine that ignoring the worst parts of something does make it pretty easy to write off. Healthcare reform? Only a small percentage of people will have medical emergencies in a given year and besides doctors will still treat you if something is immediately life threatening. Election reform? All the people getting disenfranchised are minorities so who cares? Plus you can't gerrymander at a federal level so it's probably fine. Climate crisis? Most people alive today won't live to see the worst of that and even for the ones who do America is gonna win any water wars that get started so we'll be fine.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
