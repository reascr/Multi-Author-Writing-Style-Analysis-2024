I don't think you blanket statement anything when it comes to ASD including that this quote is inaccurate. Certainly when it comes to my daughter it is very accurate. She suffers from paralyzing anxiety disorder and several other behavioral and mood disorders, she also has developmental delays that results in an inability to deal with numbers and mathematical equations. she is considered high functioning because she has skills and abilities when it comes to information retention and understanding non mathematical academics esp sciences, she was top of her school honour roll at graduation and had several scholarships, yet is unable to live independently or maintain employment. There really is no one size fits all you can apply to autism. My cousin was institutionalized because he was so severely impacted, but a friend son is an engineer living the dream with a 6 figure salary.
The way scientific press releases are typically drafted is that they go through a "public information officer", or PIO. The PIO is a journalist, and is generally not a specialist in the field they're writing about. Their job is to interview the scientists, broadly understand the research they've done, and then summarize that research in a way that can be understood by a general audience.
Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying that the author of this press release VERY clearly did NOT understand the researchers and was TOO NICE to say anything about it.
