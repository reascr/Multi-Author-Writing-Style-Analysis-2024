I'm going to write a series of vampire novels were vampires walk around accusing everyone else of being a vampire. The vampires will scream for anti-vampire laws to be passed. They'll demand a wooden steak in every house. They'll sell steaks with funny sayings on it. The MyPillow Guy will become super anti-coffin.

In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
The vampires will constantly do things like take a picture of a person traveling at night, post it to Twitter and Facebook and explain in detail how that person MUST be a vampire because they travelled at night.
The twist ending will be that the vampires are scared of vampires. It won't make any sense, and everyone will hate it.
