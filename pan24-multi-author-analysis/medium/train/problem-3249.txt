This public relations spin is all a part of Jude Wanniski's Two Santa Claus Theory which is designed to force the Democratic Party to either "play" Scrooge economically or "kill" the Santa Claus of social welfare.
The whole thing is a gross shell game designed to force a narrative that one party is good for the economy but bad for social welfare and the other party is bad for the economy but good for social welfare. This is the reason that it is so common for Talking Heads and those who repeat what they say to reduce any consideration of the appropriate role of government to this binary, which only benefits the corporations and those who are willing to sell themselves out to them.
This tactic was used to pitch the entire concept of trickle-down theory that has continued to exacerbate the wealth divide in America, to the benefit of Corporations and those who have exorbitant capital.
If you look closely enough at whatever they are about to pitch, I can almost guarantee that it will be done for the benefit of the wealthy and to the detriment of the middle and labor class.
