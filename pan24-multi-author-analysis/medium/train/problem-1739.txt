Since the GOP has taken power have they even attempted to pass any legislation to improve the immigration crisis or corner inflation like they said. This would be the time, they have the majority, they can vote on whatever they want . But no they are playing these silly games and asking for the government to bail them out by expanding the debt limit. These fools are going to send us into another government shutdown. Literally the other day they voted on wether or not the house should be required to say the pledge of allegiance every day. This should be a wake up call for republicans that even if you like their policies they will never be implemented because there are no policies to begin with. They just state a problem and blame the dems and that’s how they get elected.

That is what this debate is about. There is this idea that you are suspect if you are an immigrant. Or if you are from a certain part of the world, of a certain skin tone or a Muslim.”.
This is what basically all of the holdouts were saying. It effectively amounts to "we don't think this was right, but we're going to still vote to kick her off now but make it harder to vote to kick people off in the future.".
