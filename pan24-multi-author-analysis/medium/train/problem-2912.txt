The nature of a police officer's job REQUIRES them to put themselves in dangerous situations on occasion to assist other people. That's what they get paid for. Unfortunately they run the risk of injury or death to do it. Just like fire fighters. That these officers did not act to attempt to rescue innocent children and adults from a psychotic gunman is not only a professional failure but also a moral one.
We don't pay police officers to kill themselves. Even if we did... they wouldn't do it because no one wants their bodies ripped to shreds by an AR-15.
