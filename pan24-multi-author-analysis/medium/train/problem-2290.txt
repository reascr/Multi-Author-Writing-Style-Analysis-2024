It will essentially be non-existent, but I suppose being on your deathbed you really don't give a shit.
If, indeed, but I suspect if happens, it'll be when the Red Giant Sun swallows up Earth in 10bil years, because he hasn't made any new ground in a while now. He's just wasting missiles and sending young Russians to unnecessary deaths.
If he takes over Ukraine, he can claim those as his own. For him it's just a numbers game: how many troops lost vs how many people conquered. If he conquers enough, who cares about the fallen. Certainly not the Kremlin.
Puti is a gambler. He won in Georgia, Chechnya(twice), Syria, Africa, Venezuela (politically), took Crimea. Where else has he poked his nose? Now Ukraine. The body count to date is over a million souls! The ground at the Kremlin will be shaking when he passes on...
On a slightly different note, he has no idea what he has unleashed, Ukraine is being supplied with weapons that have no Russian equivalent and are far superior to what Russia has.
Just read another post, Germany has shipped some kind of anti-aircraft system mounted on a "tank" with targeting to hit aircraft, in coming missiles and drones up to 3 kilometers high.
