“All lenders – bilateral, multilateral, and private – must share the burden of restructuring, with assurance of additional financing in the near term.”.
When you default on tens of billions out of sheer corruption and mismanagement, that is going to make future lenders a little antsy about throwing more money your way.
Remember that Sri Lanka failed and is begging for more money. If they want charity, go beg for charity. Financing and loans are not charity. You are barking up the wrong tree if you are confused between the two.
Why? Lenders are in it as an investment. If the risk of default is too high, why would they want to assure additional financing.
Since when is a hedge fund in the business of providing charity? A bond is a loan to the government from private entities.
> “Such lenders charged a premium to lend to Sri Lanka to cover their risks, which accrued them massive profits and contributed to Sri Lanka’s first ever default in April 2022. Lenders who benefited from higher returns because of the ‘risk premium’ must be willing to take the consequences of that risk.”.
