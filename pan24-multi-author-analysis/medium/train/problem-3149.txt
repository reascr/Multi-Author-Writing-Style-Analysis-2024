Business ? Business is just the dumb side of hating humans. Honestly if someone was taking 10 he'll even 20% cut for corruption but was doing a good job other wise it would still be understandable. Bad ? Yes. But still understandable. I hate humans for more complicated reasons. For example if i remember the year correctly in 2017 there was a rape case that happened in Kashmir where victim was basically kept hostage and assaulted in temple. Parents of the victim were looking for her but they didn't search the temple because they thought nobody who keep someone hostage there. That probably is enough to make an average person get upset, right ? After it became clear what happened bjp people there took out a protest with indian flag and everything IN SUPPORT OF THE ACCUSED. Still don't hate humanity enough? Once this thing started getting attention you can guess the regular political drama so no point in pointing out towards more messed up behaviour by bjp so I will give you something that will make you hate humanity. It was top searched for term on xvideos. Know what makes it even worst ? The rape in a holy place, the political support for accused, the fact that people were searching for a rape video on a porn site ? The victim was not even 10 iirc.
AIs work off model data. That means it would roll a % dice to cause a world war every time an Archduke is assassinated or Poland is invaded. All you need is a data error (or a hack) to cause everyone to be designated as an archduke, and BAM itâ€™s WWIII.
