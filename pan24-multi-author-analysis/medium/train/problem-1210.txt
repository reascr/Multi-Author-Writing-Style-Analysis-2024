They have moved it back before, but we're sort of dealing with a lot of mounting "crises" at the moment.
Could we invent technology to solve all of our problems? Sure, but it's best not to put all your eggs in one basket.
Plastic for instance. Solved a lot of our problems, but now we've basically turned the planet and ourselves into giant balls of plastic, how do you even begin cleaning an entire planet?
>never ending cycle of creating problems when you're solving problems until you create more problems than you solve and can no longer handle the amount of work to be done.
Its humanities short sightedness, which cant really be fixed. It's just this never ending cycle of creating problems when you're solving problems until you create more problems than you solve and can no longer handle the amount of work to be done.
You might be joking, I cant tell, but the increase in egg prices has been caused by avian flu, which is sweeping through the worlds flocks, both wild and domestic, leading to the culling and deaths of millions of birds.
Pandemics are becoming a more frequent threat as humans encroach on natural areas, wildlife migrate and mingle more in new areas with new species and close to humans, and domestic factory farming fails to address its sanitation and over medication issues.
It's been said over and over, there will be worse pandemics than covid and they will happen more often, because of all and more of the above factors.
The doomsday clock isnt a literal countdown, it's a representation of the increasing threats organized civilization faces.
OK, define Doomsday? Is it a single day where the earth explodes? Cause I don't think the war in Ukraine is going to cause that. Nuclear War? There is no guarantee that it would be an all out exchange, and then, no guarantee it would be the end of the human race. Not exactly doomsday. Sucky day, sure.
