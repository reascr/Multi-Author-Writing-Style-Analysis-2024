I'm second gen American and one side of my family is from what was once Galicia in the border region of Poland and Ukraine. Since borders fluctuated so much in that area in the last century, my family says we're "Polish-Ukrainian." I am so proud of my ancestral countries and how Poland has supported its neighbor Ukraine. Both know all too well about neighboring powers invading for natural resources, etc.
(And Latvia and the other countries in the region that have been bravely standing up to Russia and supporting Ukraine are bros for sure!).
My next door neighbor is a Polish immigrant who's been in the US for 40+ years. She still watches all of her news in polish via satellite TV and is so proud of her home country for supporting Ukraine and taking in refugees.
An event that never would have happened if Russia had stayed where it fucking belongs. It may have been Ukraine’s missile, but it sure as shit wasn’t Ukraine’s fault.
The missile thing is tragic. Two people lost their lives due to a senseless, random, terrible event.
If someone open fires at you and you defend yourself, accidentally killing a bystander in the process, the aggressor can be convicted of murder.
I agree that the realities are even worse than my analogy but the point was to use a very simplified example using (hopefully) familiar laws.
