russia's only strenh was convincing the world that they had a strong and powerful military for the past 30 years. They exposed themselves and gave all that up when they attacked Ukraine because putin has a really small penis and a fragile ego.
Russia completely failed to defend armenia from azerbaijan as per their defence agreement and is now upset that the EU is fulfilling their defense obligations for them.
Apparently they would prefer that their defense partner suffer starvation from blockade rather then get help from outsiders.
Unfortunately for russia they have no diplomatic power and no military power to enforce any authority on the issue, so anything they say about this issue is irrelevant.
“Stoke tensions” that whole invasion thing the Russians are doing hasn’t done that yet, this is what will trigger everything.
Yeah, you see that...that over there flying away Russia? That's your credibility on the geopolitical stage disappearing before your very eyes.
Move over, nobody cares for your slams anymore we're taking the reigns and sorting shit out. You are officially yesterdays chip paper.
