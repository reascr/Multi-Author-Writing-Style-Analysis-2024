There is no scenario in which Republicans join Dems to give Dems the majority because, the simple fact is, Dems don’t have the majority. But there could be a scenario in which Dems can support a reasonable partner, act as a powerful minority, and actually govern.
No republicans will elect a D speaker. Maybe a more center leaning R but never a D. Anyone who thinks they might hasn’t paid attention to American politics the last 50 years.
This is silly. The Democrats are the minority without a compromise like this. The question for them is this: is it better to be in the minority with a reasonable partner whom you can govern with or be in the minority and held to the whims of Marjorie Taylor Greene and her ilk? Because if this continues and the Republicans have no other off-ramp, they will eventually cave to the far right and concede to someone like Jim Jordan as Speaker.
