.. many people don't get good jobs or any kind of clout or respect until they hit their 40's .. you have to have money and status to change anything .. it is just the old people screwing it up and being greedy.
Except by the time that happens, the young folks have now become the old folks. And they end up with all the same vested interests all the same property turf, power, wealth, etc. Russia has completely backslid. Many countries are backsliding and not progressing forward. And autocracies are now learning how to leverage technology to create an even tighter digital iron fist. Protests and revolutions will become harder because it will be more difficult to not be surveilled and protests preempted and worst is it becomes so much easier to identify protesters after they protest. And arrest them later and go after their families.
.. as for RuZZia .. Iran .. China? .. young people dislike autocrats .. they will lose in the end when old age eats them up .. but you cannot let their worthless kids take things over.
This is the naive belief of youth. There will always be old people. All young people become middle-aged and all middle-aged people become old. And you don't have to be old to have these changing cynical views. Cynicism comes with age because with age comes experience. And you get to experience how horrible systems and people can be.
