MOSCOW— A Russian court on Friday sentenced a former regional governor to 22 years in prison after finding him guilty of murder in a case that triggered massive protests two years ago.
Sergei Furgal was convicted of ordering the killing of two business competitors in 2004-2005, before he became the governor of Russia’s far eastern Khabarovsk region, and involvement in the botched attempt to kill another businessman.
Three other people convicted of involvement in the murders alongside Furgal were handed prison terms ranging from 9 1/2 to 21 years.
Speaking at his trial, Furgal, 52, insisted on his innocence and denounced the charges against him, saying they were fabricated by rivals “intoxicated by power and money that can destroy anyone.”.
“Aren’t you ashamed of delivering that sentence?” Furgal told the judge after hearing the sentence on Friday.
Earlier this week, he also directly addressed members of the jury, saying they should be ashamed of declaring him guilty on what he described as unfounded charges.
“He considers this sentence absolutely illegal, he never was part of any (criminal) groups, he had nothing to do with incriminating acts,” Kozhemyakin told reporters.
Sentence Putin, his propaganda bitch, Russias military, Kadyrov, the TikTok Army, Wagner and all others that are actively killing Ukrainians for murder.
