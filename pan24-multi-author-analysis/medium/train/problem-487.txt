US federal agents actually escort ships carrying cocaine into ports in Miami, then it's loaded onto cargo planes and distributed throughout the US in aircraft that are sanctioned and protected by the CIA.
In exchange Columbia agrees to remain a strategic ally rather than being an ally for Russia or North Korea.
Just going to confirm what you're saying is accurate - thanks for the thoughtful reply. But I also want to point out that the 712 page pdf we found is only part of the full report, which is over 6,000 pages according to Wikipedia. So just to play devil's advocate it is true in this case that we don't know what we don't know.
This among many other surprising strategies was revealed in the Senate intelligence Committee Report on CIA Torture which was released in December of 2014 and which almost nobody read.
The CIA is a shady, shitty, and down right dangerous organization, but if you make these assertions, please back up these claims, I don't even need super hard evidence, just some evidence. Many conspiracy people quote documents to give themselves legitimacy, relying on the fact that most people won't read a 712 page document to verify the information. I actually went through it and from what I saw, "Columbia" isn't even mentioned.
On a more serious note, if anyone wants to be upset, go read the wiki article for this report. The Colombia thing from the other poster was a total red herring but holy shit what's actually in the report is almost worse.
Over the last few years in my town coke has gotten super popular. People that i never would have guessed would be messing around with it are randomly offering me bumps at clubs and parties. Im no tea-toter myself, and will try a little bugar sugar every now and then, but the amount around town is kind of alarming. Its not an innocent drug amd if you don twatch yourself you can get caught up in it pretty quick.
