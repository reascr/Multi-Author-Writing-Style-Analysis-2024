I was living in Chicago when they legalized. 30% tax on anything non medicinal, which I thought might not be so bad until I went to the city dispensaries. Having to reserve an appointment online for an hour slot a day ahead of time. Okay I’ll work with that. Finally go in and they have zero variety. Not only is there a 30% tax on non medicinal, only 30% of available products are for non medicinal purchases. Nothing is out to be viewed. Everything is locked in the back and you can’t preview anything before purchase. My experiences in Denver left me with such high hopes. These Chicago experiences occurred about two years ago during COVID restrictions. Maybe things have changed now.
