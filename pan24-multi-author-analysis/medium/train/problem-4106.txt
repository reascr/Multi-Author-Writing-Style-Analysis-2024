A lot of modern equipment was designed back in the 70s and 80s, and have simply been updated and refitted since then. Why design an entirely new vehicle from the ground up when simply modifications to existing designs achieve parity with a new one?
The modernity vehicle is mostly classified by its soft factors, optics, targeting systems sensors etc. All best Western tanks have been designed in the 70s, but their modern version is not comparable to one produced then without refit.
It's cheaper to give them to Ukraine then to dispose of them properly. They had to spend the money anyways so why not.
Diplomats work to build trust where there is none. Surely many Russian diplomat types quietly want peace, just as those in the west must. I worry political leaders are too happy to let this war go on for ages while their arms manufacturer boosters rake in money. True for both sides. There must be diplomacy going on somewhere.
Russia under Putin has broken every single deal it's agreed to only a fool would trust him. As there can be no trust there is no diplomatic solution to be blunt this is appeasement all over again an unworkable option.
The negotiation behind the scenes? they're not diplomatic to be blunt v I'd wager they are who is going to take over when Putin is gone when he is either defeated, killed or runs.
