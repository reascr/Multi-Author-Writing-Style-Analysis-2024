So as governor she has some unique power over state employees (since she is the chief executive of the state) but not over private business.
This is one of those things I don't understand why more state level politicians don't immediately implement. I have a family member who works for state government. Although many state employees don't like or agree with the governor, almost all of them continue to vote for her along with their families. Why? Because despite other policies and political positions, the governor has given them raises each year and often closes an additional day around major holidays. Why would they vote against the person giving them more money and time off?
