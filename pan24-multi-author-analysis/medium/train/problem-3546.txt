They've lost THREE THOUSAND tanks??? 300 aircraft???? over 250 Helicopters??? Wtf? How are can afford all these losses? And how can they replace them? 3 fucking thousand tanks????
Isn't it like 5 million bucks for a tank? Is my math horrible or isn't that 15 billion dollars in losses from tanks alone??
Eh, allow for propaganda. The oryx blog is counting visual evidence and has Russian losses at around 1500 tanks. If we take the truth as somewhere in the middle, then they've lost around 2,200. Not so bad, eh?
Also, they have a lot of old stock that is making its way to the front. As the saying goes, never stop your enemy while they're making a mistake!
They still cost money to get to the battlefield, tune up enough to operate, train crewmen, supply with ammunition and fuel.
So, I guess Russian tanks are actually pretty cheap a T-62 is only like $300,000 and a T-72 is only $500,000 - $1.2 million, this is what Wikipedia tells me at least. I used the Oryx blog and Wikipedia to calculate how much money all the destroyed/damaged/abandoned/captured costed Russia. I did not include the unknown tanks in the cost.
This is the bare minimum that it could have costed Russia (probably even less as i didn't take in account the cost of different variants and some of the prices were weird) which is $1,025,230,002. Also, this doesn't take into account all the tank operators that died which is supposedly the most expensive part.
That wouldn't include training which is the biggest part of a operators value, but using the Value of Life for Russia at $40,000 each soldier at 4 people for a tank is $252,640,000 meaning total lost is $1,277,870,002 but even then you still need to calculate the ammo and equipment of onboard. Since I used the minimum value for everything I would take a guess and say the total value of Russia tank losses would be $2,500,000,000 but this is a guess.
