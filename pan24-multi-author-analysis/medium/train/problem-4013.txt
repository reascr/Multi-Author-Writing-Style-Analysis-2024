Bullshit. Luka sold his country to the devil to save his own ass. Remember that he called Daddy Putin for help to be rescued from the 2020 Belarus protests after his own people were tired of his dictatorship. Putin "helped", alright, but Putin's help has a habit of not leaving after overextending its welcome. The "Russian invasion" Luka talks about already happened, Luka just surrendered without firing a shot. Putin tried pulling the same shit in Kazakhstan in early 2022, until he was kicked out by China (the irony... even Xi is tired of Putin's imperialist aggression.).
So, fuck Luka. He has no moral high ground. He didn't get friendly with Russia to save Belarus, he did it to save himself, condemning his country to invasion and oppression in the process.
If Ukraine so far manages to push Russia back, imagine how much better the war would have went for it, had Belarus allied with Ukraine in a united front against Russia, rather than directly support Putin with territory and weapons (and possibly soldiers, too, now that Putin grabs Luka harder and harder by the balls.) The West would have also been even more supportive from day 1, because it'd be clear Putin is going after Eastern Europe as a whole, rather than just "one country full of Nazis" as his propaganda claims.
