Oh come on, man... "The best outcome is peace on whatever terms"? The best outcome for who? Russia? Sure it is. For a regular joe in Ukraine? Hell naw, if they bend over to a peace on Russia's terms, they will throw every progress they've had as a people for two generations right out the window. The oligarchs you're referring to are an essential part of russian culture (boyars), and their power within Ukraine is of russian heritage. Ukraine is far from paradise when it comes to a functioning society, but they're going to the right direction. This war has given the people their "birth story", something they can all relate to when times get tough, and at the same time it has given them the will to get rid of the corruption. Time will tell whether they'll succeed, but every free nation has had to fight for their sovereignity on some form, Ukraine among many others for more than once. This might be tricky for you to understand, but on many cases an individual has to put their faith on a collective good, even when the outcome seems bad. That is the only way to actually change something major, like a whole nation's social structure in this case.
Germany is chosing the lesser of two evils for the sake of keeping an essential resource in stock, without which the economy and the people would suffer immensely.
India is chosing to buy cheap oil from russia for the sake of having cheap oil to grow their industry with.
