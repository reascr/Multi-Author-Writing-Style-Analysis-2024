Your point about prolonging the war is a fallacy. Since Ukraine won’t surrender, arming them with specific kinds of tactical weapons systems they lack reduces their casualties and enables them to take their morale and manpower advantage and beat Russia back faster than would otherwise be possible. Also, the rest of the west is providing more basic kinds of things like winter clothes, small arms, field kitchen/heating/generator systems too. Much of it being organized and funded at a grassroots level. We’re doing what we can to stop a genocide in the least-morally-ambiguous major armed conflict in several generations.
It's pretty obvious that Putin's Russia will be deeply indebted to China for a long time, invariably default on those debt obligations because they're shady, and then our next issue begins.
China is the only market for Russian oil which they sell to them at a discount. Couple that w/ China moving into Central Asia and taking over the old role of the CSTO, and it’s not hard to realize that Russia is now little more than a protectorate of Beijing. Russian leaders will be traveling to China to bend the knee in a matter of a few years and seeking Chinese protection in the Far East.
