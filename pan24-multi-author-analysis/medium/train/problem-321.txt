Yes, candidates for federal office must file financial disclosure forms (see 5 U.S.C. Section 101(c)) and yes, lying on those forms is a crime. According to published reports, Santos ran for office in 2020 and listed his salary as $55k and no significant assets. In 2022 his reports claimed that he had loaned his campaign about $700k. So, how did a person with no college degree and prior unpaid judgments (rent) get $700k in less than 2 years? There are lots of possible answers to that question that would be perfectly acceptable, but also some that would probably disqualify him for office. The acceptable answers will be mostly verifiable, most of the disqualifying ones will not be. I really don't care very much about the resume enhancements as I have a low opinion of the truthfulness of politicians, but I DO care about felonies. I want to know where that $700k came from and I think that it is very unlikely that we'll get to January 3 without knowing much more.
What's worse is that there are no laws holding congress or senate members accountable. Once again, if we lied like this for a job we would be fired and in some situations could be in a lot more trouble. But for the people who might be in charge of our infrastructure, our defense, our economy, our health care there is nothing. This is total Bullshit. He should be forcibly removed.
