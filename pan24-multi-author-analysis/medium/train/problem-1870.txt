“WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A New Zealand court temporarily took away medical custody of a baby from his parents on Wednesday after they refused blood transfusions for him unless the blood came from donors who were unvaccinated against COVID-19.
The court’s ruling in favor of health authorities places the 4-month-old boy into the guardianship of authorities until after he undergoes an urgently needed heart operation and recovers. The parents remain in charge of decisions about their boy that don’t relate to the operation.”.
There is no difference because your blood is just the route of delivery of the drug, just like pretty much everything you inject, breath in or swallow. For some reason, anti-Vaxers think vaccines live in your blood like little robots. It’s insanity and ignorance.
Political/religious beliefs should not give parents the right to neglect/abuse their kids....especially crackpot conspiracy theories. Anti-vaxxers will see this as an over-reach while conveniently ignoring how the parents were essentially sentencing their new born to death.
My understanding is that because there is no detectable difference in the blood of a vaccinated vs unvaccinated person they don't collect that info from donors, and because the parents couldn't be guaranteed any blood donations wouldn't be "tainted" by the covid vaccine they refused to go forward with a life saving heart operation.
