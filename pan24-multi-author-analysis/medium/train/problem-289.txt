When have you ever seen Israel bomb targets in another country for PR? They always bomb only if there's a threat. They already bombed an Iranian drone warehouse in Syria. There was no PR change anyway.
You know that's not going to happen though. The Russian/Iranian propaganda machine will go into overdrive accusing Israel of war crimes, genocide, and every crime under the sun, and many idiots and anti-Semites around the world will swallow the propaganda hook, line and sinker as they have done for decades.
Except when they're annihilating Palestinians with weapons hundreds of times more powerful than the ones being used against them, definitely a sort of PR insofar as to flex your abilities.
How about support our human rights movement by helping us get rid of our shitty leaders, rather than doing something that’s likely going to end that movement and probably expand this war to the Middle East?
I sympathize with Ukraine for being invaded by a shitty dictator & getting bombarded with weapons from our shitty dictatorship. By the same token, when a shitty dictator invaded us and the world armed him… I don’t think many people would have agreed those arms factories should be liquidated.
From my perspective, unless attacks are done covertly - bombing these sites is likely going to undermine our goal of having human rights in Iran. And probably pull a few other countries in the region into direct conflict with the blowback.
Support the movement by actually having sanctions target every IRGC/IRI official & their families. Kick their kids and wives out of Canada/UK/EU & expel their diplomats. Seize their assets abroad too.
