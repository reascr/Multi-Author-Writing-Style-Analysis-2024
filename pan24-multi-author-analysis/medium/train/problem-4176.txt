After Afghanistan, the US military intelligience was conservative in their estimates of belligerent forces, it's better to plan for a more powerful adversely than a weaker adversary. Even assuming basic military readiness on Russia's part should have seen them make better inroads than they did. The irony is Russia saw the US acceptance of Russian propoganda as legitimate estimates of Russia's true strenh which made them more confident in their outcome.
Yes it's pathetic i quite agree, but to be fair they have more artillery pieces than you can count, shitty Chinese knockoffs of soviet Era...but alot of them are trained on Seoul, it would literally pancake that city...besides nukes it's there only real threat, seriously they could flatten that city and would if war ever kicked off...pretty scary thought.
I used to work with a guy who had been stationed in South Korea in the US Army and he said something along the lines of, "We could probably bowl their whole military over in a couple hours, but in that time frame they're going to make everyone close pay the price.".
