They all seem to run on a Republican ticket, which is interesting because it showcases the gap between their candidates and their constituents. They have to lie now, blatantly, in order to appear to be like everyone else. The media has been dropping the ball here, in my opinion. A well-informed electorate relies on journalism that does not rely so much on content like "You Won't Believe What MTG Just Said"-style headlines. The Santos thing was exposed by smaller outlets that had a limited reach but larger outlets like the NY Times ignored it until after the election. Why? Page views?
