Although Russia is at war with Ukraine.. I love the skaters like, OMG I cannot, they are absolutely beautiful at skating especially, Kamila Valieva. But, IOC should suspend them because of the war, it would be improper if they didn't, but it would also break my poor little heart not to see them skate; They are at war, but suspending Russia's team, (that has absolutely nothing to do with Russia's war) is just like Okay, I can see the reasons and it's fine, but it's literally people that have absolutely no role in the war, it's the nation as a whole that's at war. The war has two sides legit and I don't think people see that Putin is the leader and is just forcing them to vote for him as a leader; Most Russians don't even want the war, it's just their lunatic president ( and some people that are crazy AF ). In my honest opinion, is that they should be suspended, and if the IOC wants to suspend them, they can, it's fine, but like in the end, it's up to the countries and the IOC to come to agreement. (As an America/Russian and other DNA mixed in, I am in between here, I absolutely Okay with this, I will see get to see my home country play (USA), but it also hurts me 'cause I wanna see Russia's Skaters and others play, but is okay-ish for me).
I dont think the IOC will want to change the premise of the foundation for the Olympics, regardless how disgusted they may feel about a country. They may just have them play under the IOC flag, but in general why condem the athletes to play at the olympics when the problems were started by the crappy dictators.
