I, an uncultured American, had to do a momentary head check to understand that Norwegians aren't valuing stocks by how many Nokia phones they're worth. Lol.
German here. I wouldn't say hubris, but more like stupidity. As in stupidity to get rid of nuclear in favour of fossil fuels. and stupidity not to reduce reliance on Russia after it invaded Crimea.
It is cruel in the way that the stock’s steep price increase is heavily correlated with the sudden scarcity of fossile fuels in Europe which is a result of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine that caused death and suffering of civilized Europe’s very Eastern frontier. Why did I even write this I am confident you could have connected the dots yourself.
I work for a Norwegian company that has maritime and military branches. Within the first month of the war, the stock price skyrocketed. Like from 120 NOK to 340 NOK. It was insane. Cruel, but it was really beneficial for those who were in employee stock program. My friend sold most of his stock and payed 3/4 of his mortgage.
