The holocaust has an incredible amount of documentation, videos, interviews etc thanks in a large part to Eisenhower who wanted to make sure no one would ever forget it.
“Get it all on record now, get the films, get the witnesses because somewhere down the road of history some bastard will get up and say that this never happened.” - Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Even with all the documentation, I still feel like holocaust is underrated in terms of atrocities. Like I feel as though it isn’t talked about enough that the nazis were literally killing 16,000 innocent people (mostly Jewish but tons of other minorities too) DAILY. I don’t think people understand how many bodies that is. Not to mention the torture that the survivors went through. Or the fact that dying in a gas oven is torturous in itself.
It must be agonizing for survivors to see holocaust underplayed today. I’ve recently read quite a few books on it - and when you hear the day to day details, it is unfathomable how horrible it was. There was ZERO respect for human life and NO mercy.
