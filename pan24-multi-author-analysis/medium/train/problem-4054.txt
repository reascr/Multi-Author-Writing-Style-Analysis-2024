I'm pretty sure French commentary on what is considered 'good' and 'bad' influence in many parts of West Africa is met with a mixture of indifference, mockery and distrust.
France is leveraging its historic ties there to shape many things that would be considered 'expanding influence' and sometimes bordering on 'predatory' or 'colonialist in attitude'. So why is this ok then but Russia challenging this is automatically bad?
French intervention in Mali is highly controversial both in France and in Mali and the surrounding countries itself. Even if it was on request, it does not mean France's entry into local conflicts there has been positive. The fact that some French diplomats have been expelled there does not shine a particularly successful light on the entire operation.
Yes the government of Mali requested the help of France to stop the advance of ISIS. And asked for help to fight it after the initial strike.
But the gouvernement, was overthrown by a Junta. That junta dislike heavily the Touareg because of a lot of different reason, but one they like to use is that they "help" ISIS to hide.
Anyway, they wanted to attack touareg and wanted the french to help. But France didn't want any involvement in that matter, and didn't let the junta do their "totally not a genocide".
The European nebulous and ambivalent position towards African vaccine production and licensing due to profit considerations during the first rollout of the Covid vaccine has also not been forgotten by many African states. While France has been very vocal about 'vaccine disparity' in public, privately the deadlock is still strong because the details are hard to figure out.
So the junta, not happy with the french doing just the fight against ISIS, and not letting them do what they want to the Touareg, they went with the mercenary Wagner, that is less keen, on the whole "not a genocide", and started the whole diplomat thing and bashing. That tried multiple time to And tried multiple time .
