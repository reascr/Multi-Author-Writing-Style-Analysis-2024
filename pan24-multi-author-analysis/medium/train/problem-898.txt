It’s a ghost town over there. I scrolled through several pages and nothing. I went over to Fox News website and silence. They must be struggling coming up with a way to spin the story.
Kind of hard to claim it was mistakenly stuffed in a box. You’d have to pull the docs from the classified folder, unstaple them, scan pages. Trump will blame the aide and aide will likely flip fast.

In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
