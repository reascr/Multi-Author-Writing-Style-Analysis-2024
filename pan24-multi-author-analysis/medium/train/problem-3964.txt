Just a periodic reminder that the Wisconsin Supreme Court election is April 4, 2023, and it's the most important election in the country between the Georgia runoff and the 2024 general.
The gerrymander is obviously my top issue, so we can actually have a legitimately elected government again in Wisconsin -- it's been 10 years.
But it would also be great to see the Court lay down the law on all these pre-2018 executive appointees who have just stayed in office after their terms expired because the crooked Legislature won't let the Democratic Governor appoint anyone new.
No chance of ranked choice before February, or any time while the Republican gerrymander is in effect in the state.
