Agreed that the post WW2 wouldn't work in Russia because as you said thanks to the nukes, Russia would need to invite us. But there are some scenarios where it could be possible - like if Russia has been white-anting their $8 billion a year upkeep of their nuclear arsenal (just like they did with the rest of their military). They may not even have functioning nuclear capabilities at this point. If Putin is crazy enough to try using a nuke and it turned out to be a dud - that would be Putin and Russia done and we would see some NATO peacekeeping force occupying Russia for at least the next 50 years. Very unlikely/unfeasible I know - but I would have said the same about Russian military, before they showed us Russian military power was the equivalent of cardboard cutouts in the Ukraine. We just don't know how far the kleptomania goes in Russia, but I'm personally betting on "all the way down".
