"The genius of American democracy and Israeli democracy is that they are both built on strong institutions, on checks and balances, on an independent judiciary. Building consensus for fundamental changes is really important to ensure that the people buy into them so they can be sustained.".
By and large the judiciary in the US is, in fact, independent. The fact that the judiciary may return a decision that offends one part of the electorate or another from time to time is immaterial to that fact. Judges, and even justices, can be removed from office following very specific mechanisms found in the constitution. That such mechanisms have only rarely been employed, and only under egregious circumstances is a sign of that independence.
I mean, how many of them lied about their opinions about Roe being "settled law?" No offense, but, they are far from independent in the context of fashioning their rulings to fit an ideologica worldview. Sure, they're "independent" from the other branches, but not even remotely in terms of ideological adherence to making people who can become pregnant into second-class citizens.
