Yes, I’m in a blue state and this isn’t a private religious school, but those classes of kids who lived through Trump’s first term hate him, and a good portion of them will be of voting age by 2024.
Speaking as a parent of middle and high school kids, just about the worst insult one kid can level at another is calling them a Trump supporter. It’s so bad that it is rarely used in actual anger. There’s also open speculation about whether any teachers are Trump voters, and the kids do not hold back about their criticism if they find out.
