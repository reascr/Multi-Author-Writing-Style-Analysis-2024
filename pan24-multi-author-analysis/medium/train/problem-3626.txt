I mean NORADs whole purpose is to detect and eliminate intercontinental ballistic missiles, which can launch in mascow and land in the U.S. within like 18 minutes or something so I'm a bit suspicious they didn't detect a slow moving balloon.
out of the million things flying around every single day, speed is a nice thing to filter for when you want to automatically and reliably detect ICBM without many false alarms.
This is also the reason why it could be detected far later: the flight trajectories of every single detected object get logged and can still be looked at manually, even years later.
There was a tweet I read quoting Jake Sullivan as saying one of Biden’s earlier priorities was improving air detection capabilities to prevent things like this from happening. It was implied that China has done this before, and these balloons weren’t detected until well over the continental US, at which point acknowledging it would have been embarrassing.
So it’s likely China has been doing this for awhile, launching several balloons at once with an understanding the winds will likely mean some won’t end up where they want (and why some made their way over Latin America). It’s just now they got caught, and are trying to explain how they’re not hypocrites.
