Jacobin seems to have forgotten that FDR had a Democratic supermajority in both chambers. Almost 3/4ths of the entire Congress was Dem.

He wasn't my first choice for President, but I'm massively impressed at what he has accomplished amidst extremely imperfect circumstances. He will have my vote in 2024 without hesitation. Imagine what he could get done with solid majorities in the House and Senate to back him up?
