Putin is not going to take Belarus. He gave them nukes to hold. When one of those are ‘sabotaged,’ Putin will vow to avenge them while arguing to the UN the West and NATO are dangerous and reckless. I suspect his plan is to get more Russians to join the military.
So it was unable to prove its "supremacy", was dispersed and badly damaged, consists of retroffited 70s equipment and now is comprised of fresh recruits. Sounds like meat for me. I hope BT2 will dispose of it quickly once it crosses into Ukraine territory.
1st guards got severely fucked up in Kharkiv. They were supposed to be an elite unit and they got routed, abandoned their tanks, and suffered super high casualties.
Wikipedia: Having suffered heavy casualties, it described the army as "severely degraded" and its ability to counter NATO "severely weakened."[14] By December, the UK MoD reported that the Army had been replenished with recruits, and was active in the Battle of Svatove.
All they will ever do for the rest of the war is hide behind their "elite" reputation like this, to be a threatening symbol on a map to pull defenders away from the real fight.
I do hope russia moronically tries another "we attack Kyiv from belarus" though, because it would be such a blunder, such a display of the complete lack of strategy from the top that I think it would be the end of putin.
Tanks work, the trouble with them in this conflict is that the Russians just drove them down roads in columns without adequate infantry support to clear defiles and reconnaissance to prevent/preempt ambushes. But now everyone says “hur dur tank dead” because they saw the shitshow.
