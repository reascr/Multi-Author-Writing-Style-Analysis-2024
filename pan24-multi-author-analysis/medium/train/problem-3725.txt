Generally speaking there is usually records of prominent things, but by records that could mean something pretty enduring like stone carvings, stuff a bit more fragile like articles written on paper/papyrus, and then verbal records through stories or songs.

They have searched about .001% of the Sahara Desert. Which is about the same size of the United States. We haven’t even scratched the surface. We know precisely Dick about what’s buried out there.
We'll be discovering things like this probably long after you and I are gone. Assuming we aren't all dead by then.
