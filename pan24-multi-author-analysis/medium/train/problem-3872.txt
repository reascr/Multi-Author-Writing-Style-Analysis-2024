Panspermia is a bad theory because it's just moves the question from how on earth to how somewhere else. Also the fact that you can find all five bases (4 for DNA and uracil for RNA) doesn't prove that DNA or RNA came to earth from space. After all it is just 5 simple chemicals which could form spuriously in many places. I would read this in different way. If those chemicals could form in quite cold and inert environment of space (in case this meteorites never've been a part of another planet) then chances for them to form in warm chemicaly active invironment of other planets quite high. And our carbon based life may be way more common then we thought.
This is great way of looking at it. I roll my eyes whenever I hear people talk about our insignificance in comparison to the vastness of the universe. Yes, we are physically small in comparison to stars and galaxies, but we are also literally the universe observing itself. That’s pretty damn significant, in my opinion, and it’s unique in comparison to the vast majority of “stuff” in existence. Without sentient creatures like us (and any others that might exist), the universe would not even know about itself.
