Xi has surrounded himself with nationalist loon yes men. Like Putin he will be tricked into a folly by the west. China can afford to lose millions and Taiwan is of no real importance and can be destroyed. The west will then attempt to destabilise China further creating unrest in the regions such as Tibet. Xi will let Putin and his cronies live if Putin accepts Russia as a vassal state otherwise NATO will take Russia and Putin will imprisoned. Putin has to therefore fight on to the bitter end. Xi wants the oil, greed will be his weakness, the west will use this against him. The last thing anyone wants is Russia to fall apart into individual states, unless of course you are in those states. Maintaining a superpower takes much effort and since both China and Russia are closed states their culture has stagnated and can not evolve, so no real new ideas and enterprise, Russia makes nothing and China copies the west.
Xi Jinping: Look now, Vlad, we have a problem with the birth rate, and your men are either dead or useless... so what are you going to do with so many women?
