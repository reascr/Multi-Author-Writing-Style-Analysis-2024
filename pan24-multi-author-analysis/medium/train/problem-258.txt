You're correct that a strategic nuclear missile would be pretty unfeasible to pull off at least in the short term. But all those explosives and radioactive material could be easily used to create dirty bombs. Maybe a really big one, maybe a lot of smaller ones to create havoc for whatever hypothetical future administration takes over. Dirty bombs aren't as big a threat to life because they don't create such a large explosion and generate the heat fission reactions create, but they can make a multi-square mile distance very uninhabitable. You put enough in the right spots and you don't need a nuke. If you target business centric areas where most of the jobs and entertainment are you could essentially destroy a town or even a small cities just through the economic impact of people not being able to travel freely.
your not thinking big enough, firstly, if kadyrov wants to take out prigozhin or lukashenko, he doesn't need that nuke to necessarily be a projectile. a truck might just do the trick.
