Basically all the bells and whistles of getting executed up until the point of the blade/rope/gun going off. Ie: Pulled out of your cell, bag thrown over your head, bag pulled off at a place of execution, see the executioner sharpening his blade/loading his gun/tying the rope, put on your knees, asked if you have any last words. Possibly a blank fire or sword swung next to you. Then sent back to your jail cell. It's a very effective way to fuck with people that are locked up... Esp in countries known for executing people.
They pretend they are going execute them. For an example if the say they will electrocute them, then they will pull them out of their cell, take them to an execution room, hook them up to the wires and press the button. The prisoner thinks they will die. The button is fake and nothing happens. Not sure in these case what they are using to go through with the fake execution (I.e. electric, hanging, shooting, etc.).
