Oh, they've figured it out. But it's like diamonds - it's not about the stone, because you can make an indistinguishable one in a lab, down to every imperfection. It's about prestige.
Which is wild every time I think about it. I would 10000x rather have a lab grown diamond thats perfect in every way, created for me, for a fraction of the cost. I would love to tell people "look at this ring, it was made in a lab. Its wild how they do it....".
Ivory is worth worth 600 and 700 US per kg. So they are worth between 11k to 51k per tusk. In Zimbabwe the per capita gdp is below 5k. So the smallest female elephant would net you 4 times your average annual income. In a day.
It's not like they would get the market price for them anyways. Aren't people in those scenarios usually fucked and they get perhaps 5-10% of the market value?
But in seriousness - when everyone has diamonds they stop being diamonds and become cubic lattice carbon. The sole purpose behind prestige products is to separate yourself from ones who can't afford it.
