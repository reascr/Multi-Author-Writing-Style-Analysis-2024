I'd like to think the recovery team knew exactly where/when it was going to land, and had boats waiting for it... if you let it sink and sit in the water for 48hrs, a number of hostile submarines could approach and destroy it.
It's impossible to know when and where exactly it will land, they can only estimate an area. The US had a Destroyer within the area fairly quickly, and an oceanographic survey vessel + UUVs searching that area. It was just a case of narrowing down exactly where it was. Not too difficult considering the waters where it fell are shallow.
Because hostile submarines would know exactly when and where it would be shot down and somehow be on site within a day? Do you think they can teleport or something?
Similar thing happened to an American recon plane back in (2004? 2001?) after it collided with a Chinese fighter jet near China in international waters. China gave it back to the US in pieces and billed us for the dismantling.
the US Gov knew exactly where it was at the time they shot it down with a missile. Granted, it had to fall for 60,000 feet, but I'm sure we have people in the military who know the rough math for that (about 2-10 minutes to fall 60k feet or so). Maybe not 'exactly' when/where, but within a few miles.
That's exactly my point, they did the math and narrowed it down to an area where it landed and then searched that area to pinpoint it's location. That takes a bit of time when that area is in the ocean, ships don't move that fast.
