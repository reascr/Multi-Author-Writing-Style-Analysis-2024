I mean, what else is he going to do? He fled prosecution in the US and is living in Russia. It's not like he's going to say he hates them. He's focused on self preservation.
The guy is in a fucked spot and the US put him there. I don't believe for a second he supports the war in Ukraine or any other of Putin's bull, but thanks to the shitty rich people in power he can't come home.
No one forced him to do what he did, and no one forced him to run from the consequences in such a way that his motives could be questioned to this extent.
You're right, no one forced him to stand up for the rights of the American people. He did that on his own, knowing the potential consequences.
Nice virtue signal. If someone told you that you can either make an empty promise or go to prison yoh would say anything. It’s easy to claim a moral high ground from your cozy apartment or cubicle.
The alternative is going to us federal pound me in the ass prison. Who cares what he pledges allegeince to. every govt sucks. You virtue signalers saying you wouldn’t are full of shit.
