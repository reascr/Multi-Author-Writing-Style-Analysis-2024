Parker and Stone are smart guys, but who says they know perfect romanji? I actually just watched the episode after this comment thread made me think of it, and it's definitely 'Streisanda'.
But it did kind of make me wonder what the translation of what she said as she was transforming (among a couple other things) really is. It would be like them to put something dirty or ridiculous in there.
The equivalent Chinese expression is “欲蓋彌彰”. The Chinese writer Zuo Qiuming was actually the first person to ever comment on the Streisand Effect all the way back in 400 BC, which makes it all the more surprising that Xi Jinping still hasn’t gotten the memo.
Given that Trey Parker majored in Japanese in college and regularly traveled to Japan and writes the Japanese lines in South Park when it calls for it, I would say it’s fair to think he knows perfect romaji.
Trey Parker has a degree in Japanese and is extremely fluent. His impression of the accent was developed in college and is intentionally stereotypical.
