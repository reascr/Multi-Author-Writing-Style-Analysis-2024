Only learned this like a free weeks/months ago during a press.comferemce and although his twatfuckery is despicable it doesn't mean I can't have a laugh each time I see his botoxed mig.
Am like 5'7" but am happy and proud of it and don't go extra miles to convince the world am a strong man. That was point.
I guess I don't understand why it's funny... Also you're arguing with someone else. I'm not trying for a gotcha or anything, I just don't understand the comment and why it's funny or relevant. Blame the 'tism if you want, I might just be missing a social thing.
My bad mate. Also funny was in quotes because it wasnt aimed at making a laughable joke merely commentary. I was trying topoint out how the autocratic strongmen, Putin will do anything to save face ,even ignoring normal genetics (height), and his immensely bottoxed face (along with the many calendars and having state magazines name Jim.man of the yeat) to appear relevant even when he is he cause of immense worldwide issues and atrocities.
Just like how he said he wasnt going to invade, then said h needed his military to conduct a "secial operation" in Ukraine to help istreatemen of russians and rid it of Nazis, then had another press conference yesyereda saying he was finally open to peace talks for the "special operation" (which is obviously coz they're getting they frosted arsed handed to them despite the indiscriminate bombing and war crimes they've committed.
