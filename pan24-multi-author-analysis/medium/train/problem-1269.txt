The real core issue is Xi. He reversed China's previous direction which both makes them a less valuable partner to the west and threatens their economic rise.
The stuff about Taiwan and Hong Kong is just Xi offering nationalist rewards in exchange for the financial rewards he's been taking away. Basically the same play as Putin but less incompetent.
Yes, Xi has done the rest of the world a big favor by jumping the gun in their plans to directly challenge the west. China was on a pretty unstoppable path but Xi decided that wasn’t good enough and it’s blown up in his face.
Haha I live on a giant cannabis farm in the mountains on the coast. I can fuck who I want without any complaints, I can do drugs and at best get a $100 ticket for having a ball of cocaine (I don't use just an example of freedom), and the local gas stations almost all have biscuits and gravy I fucking love living in the west.
I feel very fortunate to have been born into the West, I mean we suck shit at a lot of things and I'll fight you all most days on the dumbest stuff, but in the end I like our problems and our leadership a lot better than the ones I see the people facing in China/Russia/NK etc.
That being said our government is shady as fuck and I don't like how we treat the world. I would gladly give up somethings for the world to have a better time.
It wouldn't be bad if it wasn't also damaging to China. Xi is not making a nation better for Chinese people. Xi is making a nation easier for him to control. He's basically slowly implementing the same kind of mechanisms Putin has in Russia.
So China acts not for the benefit of China as an entity, or the Chinese people collectively. It acts for the benefit of Xi and Chinese policy is policy designed to make it easier for Xi to rule them, short term and long.
