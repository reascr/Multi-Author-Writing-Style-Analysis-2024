The misery for Russian citizens will continue even after the war. It will only stop when they remove the current government and install a progressive and democratic one. But sad thing is many Russians are just like their government so probably nothing would change even if they were to change governments.
I dont like Russia either but I wouldn't go that far (the Nazis were awful people too, do you want the Germans to stop existing too?). All of the Russians I've met so far were wonderful people. The main problem is the government and the propaganda. Russians are basically trained by their government to hate and belittle everyone who isn't Russia (Religion can have the same effect). And to add to the drama, many Russians can't leave the country for vacation because they don't have enough money thus they don't see how much better life outside of Russia is.
Different times make different people, Dumber time's make dumber people, more violent times make more violent people.
Let the Zheads see what war is like. See what It does too your economy, see how few friends come back, and hope they learn the lesson sooner than later. Because a the longer the lesson sinks in. The more people going to die.
