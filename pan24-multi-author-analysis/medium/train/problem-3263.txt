The White House knows they have the authority to overturn Trump’s executive order, but is deferring to the supreme court, so they don’t have to make that hard call. Of course, there is no good scenario for what will happen when the order is lifted. Due to Trump’s executive order, there is an immigration backlog combined with a massive increase from unstable countries.
We are not prepared for the level of immigrants who will be seeking asylum. And the White House knows what conservative media will be headlining, “the invasion caused by Biden”. It’s really a no-win situation. Of course America refused asylum for some Jewish immigrants during the 30s and we know how that turned out.
At some point, Democrats and Republicans are going to have to come together and pass immigration reform. But I don’t have a lot of hope for that.
