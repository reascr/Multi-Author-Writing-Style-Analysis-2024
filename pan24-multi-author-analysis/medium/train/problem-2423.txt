If a company has established business in Russia, I am not surprised some will try to hang on to it so that their investment will not be totally wasted and also to be around when the fighting eventually stop.
and in all likelyhood, there never will be again, because Russia is likely going to cease to be as a state within 25 years.
That said, I think some of the healthcare suppliers, like Stryker, still doing business in Russia should be treated differently. After all, should Russian citizens be denied access to life saving healthcare supplies because of an invasion that they probably have no control over or power to stop? It is one thing to cut them off from McDonalds and another thing to cut them off from emergency/trauma surgery equipment, which Stryker provides. That said, other healthcare suppliers like Align Technologies, which makes orthodontic supplies could definitely leave without loss of life.
There are some big names I recognize from the US: Carl's Jr., Patreon, Match Group (the online dating service), Quiksilver (clothing), Riot Games (e.g. League of Legends), S'barro, TGI Friday's, and Valve (games).
