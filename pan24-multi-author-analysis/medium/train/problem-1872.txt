If we hadn't done all that, his payments were projected to be done when we were 67. It absolutely fucking sucks that this shit is still happening.
I really feel for you all and it's getting worse. I went to college 88-92. I worked 30-35 hours a week and my mom had a second job. I graduated with $1,500 in debt. My mom still refuses to let me pay that back to her.
We can't keep going with college graduates having debt equal to a fucking house. Fuck every republican who isn't helping to solve this problem and fuck every person who has the "I paid it off, so should you" attitude. You're not helping and you're not seeing the bigger, long-term picture.
