You are definitely not alone....as I mentioned in another comment, I just watched an interview on CNN (12-8-22) with Erin Burnett and Kathi Lynn Austin, a human rights investigator who tracked Viktor Bout for 15 years. She called him a "weapon of mass destruction" who has been responsible for thousands of deaths and will be deployed immediately by Putin. Austin was clearly of the belief this was a horrendous swap that will likely cost lives. Biden fucked up here for nothing more than political optics. Watch the interview yourselves, and see if Ms. Austin's credibility isn't worthy of her opinions.
Viktor Bout has been in custody since 2008 and was due to be released in 2029 (about 6.5 years from now) at which point he would be deported anyway.
He won't be able to get up to his old tricks because his network is long gone and all eyes will be on him. He doesn't give Putin any new tools that Putin doesn't already have.
I'm well aware of his history. He sold old Soviet junk to African dictators and left wing revolutionaries.
See the CNN interview I referenced. I think her credentials and opinions will enlighten you and likely change your view. This guy should have served every last second of his sentence.
The comment I replied to suggests the same thing, in a callous way, trading an athlete for an arms dealer, although calling it a joke.
now put him in charge of distributing and supplying weaponry but this time with full endorsement and resources from russian regime in the ukr conflict context. I believe that russia has need of those skills given that they are struggling with equipment.
Russia is not having trouble supplying their troops with old Soviet junk, they're having a hard time supplying their troops with thermal optics, composite body armor, night vision goggles, precision guided munitions, and modern well maintained armored vehicles. Viktor Bout is going to be of absolutely no use to Russia with respect to their current war effort.
It's been suggested that Russia's motives to negotiate Bout, an internationally renowned criminal, for a basketball player is suspicious. What does a sovereign nation like Russia want with Bout while pitted against the Ukraine?
She's an American citizen. You literally just made a microcosmic analogy to Benghazi, however this situation didnt leave 13 people stranded for death. Russia would literally prefer having Bout and use Griner as leverage for him. THAT is suspicious. That question had hounded me all day.
I made the comparison to Hillary's "What does it matter?" Comment in response, regarding the Benghazi attack where we had GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS promised help, and never delivered.
Now, now......don't destroy the narrative that Biden saved a poor American who did nothing wrong with contrary information. Karin Jean-Pierre will have to put you in your place! This rates right up there with that debacle of a withdrawal from Afghanistan that killed Americans and Afghani's, and Obama trading 5 terrorists from Gitmo for Army deserter Bo Bergdahl.
