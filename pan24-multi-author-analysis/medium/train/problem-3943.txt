The sad thing is that a lot of governments across the world were more like "Huh, this Wuhan Flu thing sounds concerning. How's the US reacting to it? Oh, they're not worried? We shouldn't be worried either then", which is why the red button was pushed so late in many places. It's a reality that many governments look to the US for cues in dealing with international issues, and in this case, it came out extremely short. Didn't help that countries like NZ that pushed the button early started getting mocked and derided for panicking.
