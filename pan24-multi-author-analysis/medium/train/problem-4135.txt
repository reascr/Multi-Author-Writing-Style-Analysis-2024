Washinon has a pretty high sales tax, around 10% in the Seattle Metro area, mostly because income tax is disallowed by our state constitution, and any attempts at anything that looks like an income tax gets killed in our courts. We all know here our tax structure is the most regressive (tax burden split: lowest 20%: 17.8%, middle 60%: 10.4%, top 1%: 3%), but there's little we can do to change it here. Compare to nearby Oregon which has 0% sales tax and an income tax rate of between 4.75% and 9.9% and is in the top 10 for least regressive (lowest 20%: 10.1%, middle 60%: 8.8%, top 1%: 8.1%).
