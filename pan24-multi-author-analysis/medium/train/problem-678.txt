Yeah, if you are responsible for 3 GOP election setbacks over the last 4 years, it's hard to threaten someone politically it would seem like.
It did become clear that Donald Trump is not a kingmaker. But being denounced by Trump is still a career-ender. I would expect Republican luminaries to be hard for Trump to get on the phone, maybe, but they are still going to tread very carefully.
However, certainly DeSantis is making "endorse me and I'll make it worth your while" calls too, and will announce the day after Trump is indicted. DeSantis can at least claim he won't throw his supporters under the bus and vilify them if they displease him in the slightest way.
What I hate about all of this is that Republicans are now throwing Trump under the bus because he is weak and are saying exactly what we have been saying about Trump the entire time. This demonstration is exactly what the party is all about Party Over Country. As long as you keep the party strong, you can do what you want, but if you make the party weak, we will tell the truth about you.
