I mean, on Reddit, sure. But that's because most positive stories regarding Israel will be buried in controversial, while even the most mundane negative-sounding ones will rocket to the front page (cough cough oranges cough cough).
Why the fuck is Israel helping the Syrians? They would be laughing if something bad happened to israel and yet whenever something bad happens to them, they take our aid and then resume attacking Israel later.
It’s the richer country with specialists and resources that can help, it also helps the image internationally and it’s right thing to do in a disaster situation.
Because that's what normal civilized countries do. Greece helps Turkey, Turkey helps Greece, and Israel helps Syria. The fact that Syria wouldn't give half a shit if an earthquake hit Israel doesn't matter, there are people in need and we have an obligation to help.
The truth is a great deal of how the I/P conflict is covered is due to media's ability to operate in the region. It gets arguably undue attention because it's a relatively safe middle east conflict to report on, especially from within Israel. And in Israel you can be for or against the Israeli government's actions, while if you're reporting from the West Bank or Gaza opposing the governments can be dangerous and resuli in violence, arrest, etc.
