An update to this: Brazil's supreme electoral court replied that the complaint needs to be edited or it will be discarded without the merit being examined since it's not legally possible to challenge only the second round of the election without voiding it entirely.
It's also worth nothing that Bolsonaro's party (PL) elected the largest number of congressmen than any other party in this year's election (which already shows how full of bullshit they are for claiming that there was fraud), so even if their complaint had merit, by requesting a new election they would risk to end up electing fewer congressman and having less power than they currently have (even with Bolsonaro having lost the election), so this is nothing but a stupid theater to please a sector of the PL party and avoid a potential fractured among the members, since there's currently a lot of friction among those who respect the results of the election and a more radical group that wants to overturn the election.
