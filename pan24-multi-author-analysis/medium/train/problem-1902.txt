Under the guise of a soldier's mother, Putin was told about the problems of the military by a Moscow official and United Russian deputy Olga Beltseva - she is the deputy director of the state budgetary institution "Leisure and Sports Center "Yunist" and a member of the Vidradny Council of Deputies. As stated on her page, her specialty is "providing social assistance to privileged categories of citizens".
If we are to talk about welcoming Russia back into the global community, aside from the removal and execution of putin, the Russian people need to be treated exactly like the Germans post ww2. They need to be systematically denazified and efforts must be taken to correct the insane brainwashing that has held the country for almost a century. Russia doesn't need to blame the west for their failures anymore, they are the cause of their absolutely shit country and they need to step up and own that.
I find it very hard to believe that Putin would allow any actual civillians effected by the war onto the same floor or possibly even into the same building as him at this point...
