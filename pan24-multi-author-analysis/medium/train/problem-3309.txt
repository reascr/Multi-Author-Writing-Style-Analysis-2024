Not just Amazon, Borneo and Sumatra are in shambles too. The wildlife there are on track for extinction, or getting completely wiped from their habitats - the current projection is that there wouldn't be any wild orangutans left by the end of the decade. We would see them only in zoos and breeding centres where they don't belong. Tapanuli orangutan, the third and most recently recognised orangutan species has less than 800 individuals in the wild. All this because palm oil is cheaper than soy or coconut or sunflower and everything needs cheap fat - from chocolate to instant noodles, doritos to frozen food, shampoos, soaps and makeup. Almost all of our domestic perishable goods contain palm oil.
I feel like the jade colored glasses and bitterness comes after the anxiety settles. It goes from "Oh my god, the world is ending!".
many people my age (late 20s) are just opting to not have kids or adopt for this reason. i was briefly engaged and it was frightening having to worry about the future again.
