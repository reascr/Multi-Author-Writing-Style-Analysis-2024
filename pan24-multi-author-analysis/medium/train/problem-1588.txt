They can't do that, the government is a kleptocracy. The ruling class constantly runs out of things to steal within the country, so their only avenue for growth is to steal from other nations. They can't stop stealing, because they would open up an avenue for capital (and thus power on the global stage) to accumulate with someone Putin doesn't control, and that's not an option to maintaining his power. It's not even about being closer to Western ideas, any disent of any kind is unacceptable to him.
Edit: Yes, I get it, Ukraine had security assurances too, Trump didn't uphold previous agreements, blah blah. They're in the European Union which has its own mutual defense agreement and even though it's not in the EU, Norway would absolutely not tolerate Russia invading Sweden or Finland.
The reality is Sweden and Finland already have security assurances from the US and other NATO countries, so in more ways than not they're already in NATO. The US and the rest of NATO have all the time in the world to pressure Turkey to give its vote, there's no real urgency to do it fast.
