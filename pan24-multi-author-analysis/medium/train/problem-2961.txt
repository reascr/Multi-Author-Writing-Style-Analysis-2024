I’m not sure who you are following, but I live in Youngstown. It smells fine. In fact, the wind often doesn’t come from the southeast, which is where East Palestine is from here; it’s generally from the west or northwest. Moreover I did look at the watersheds in the area and Canfield or anywhere in Mahoning county are not in the watershed of east Palestine. Local news (the Vindicator in Youngstown and Salemnews.net) has been covering it and is reporting that the Ohio dept of agriculture has not received any reports of livestock deaths or illness. I’m not saying anyone should believe Norfolk Southern, but it does appear that the necessary local, state, and federal agencies were and are on the ground monitoring and will continue to do so long-term. So far it seems like a disaster for east Palestine certainly, a sign that Norfolk southern was not in compliance or that there need to be stricter rules for hazardous chemical transport, but let’s not jump to a chernobyl 2.0 huge cover up situation right away….
