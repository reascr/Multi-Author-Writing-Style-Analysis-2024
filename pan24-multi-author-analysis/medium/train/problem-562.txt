However, the situation is really tough. Despite the fact that russia gets their shit kicked, they don't care about the amount of lives/resources they are going to throw more into this meatgrinder from their side. It means they want to keep this war going no matter what, bringing more suffering and losses for Ukraine too.
Technically they can attack from any point. Though it would be nice to drag all damaged military hardware along lines where Russian would attack. Nothing is more devastating for soldiers going to war than blow up military hardware they hope will help them survive.
Russian invaders are concentrating their offensive forces in eastern Ukraine. However, the south of the country also remains under threat, as Natalia Humeniuk, the Head of Coordination Headquarters of Press Center of Ukrainian Southern Defence Forces, said during the national TV marathon.
According to her, Russians are deploying more trained personnel in the eastern part of the country. Humeniuk emphasizes that this is where the enemy has focused its main efforts.
