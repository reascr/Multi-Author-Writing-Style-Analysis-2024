Everyone is making the same idiotic mistake that they think musk cares about the advertisers. Sure he would like to keep some. But as he has said multiple times. It is the actual demographic information is what he is wanting Twitter for and thought it was undervalued as far as that was concerned. No where near the 40 billion dollars he is lighting on fire. But the advertisers were NOT where he thought he could make a lot of revenue. Essentially he is looking for the Data not for the ad money. And if he develops a set of tools he can use algorithims to make money selling that data to other people. Not worth the 40 billion dollars however.
