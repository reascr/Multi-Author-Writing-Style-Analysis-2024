I have also been told that it is illegal for a VP to take classified docs, but it's totally fine for a former potus to take em and not give them back.

Seems like maybe we need to look into the protocols for controlling classified docs as well. Shit like this shouldn't be able to sit around this long. The local library gives me more shit if Clifford the Big Ass Dog is day a late.
I used to work with classified document security. Believe it or not, breaches happen more frequently than you'd like to think. Usually, they don't amount to anything, and initial offenders usually just get reprimanded. Repeat offenders, or offenders that don't cooperate with security, will be charged and held accountable according to the level of classification of materials left unsecured. This includes revocation of security clearance, heavy fines, and prison sentences.
I mean, the severity of both crimes appear not even relatively similar, according to present evidence, sure. But they're both still crimes... just because the mess Trump made is worse than this doesn't mean both matters shouldn't be investigated thoroughly and charges made accordingly.
