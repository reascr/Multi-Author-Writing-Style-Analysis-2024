Not yet. Trump will outdo himself next year in ways previously thought impossible. 18 months from now when the Capitol is literally on fire or worse, Zuckerberg himself will re-ban Trump permanently and implement the sort of progressive, pre-emptive content moderation policy that we want and enough highly-paid moderators to do it.
