Not only did he refuse to convict, he deliberately called for unanimous consent to close the Senate session right after Trump’s second impeachment (which happened on Jan 11), thereby ensuring there would be at least a couple of weeks’ delay until the Senate trial, and that it wouldn’t happen until after Trump was already out of power (thus rendering the whole “remove the President” aspect of the impeachment trial moot). So the GOP was able to play up the whole “Trump’s already gone, why are you wasting time trying to punish him?” bullshit argument.
