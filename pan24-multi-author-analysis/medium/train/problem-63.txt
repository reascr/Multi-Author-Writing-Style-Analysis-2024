Yeah but we knew the mirror was 1.2 m same as Hubble and the max resolution that can do is like 10 cm. So he only confirmed what everyone knew. Scott Manley has a great video on it, he and some others actually work out the time and angle and which satellite it was. The Keyhole satellites are basically Hubble chassis but with near sighted lenses as opposed to NASA. NRO gifted NASA two of them some years back one is now WFIRST.
We'd see them launch it and the orbit would make it pretty obvious what it was anyway. Plus the X-37b might snap some pics of it. Maybe wave back, with it's little robot arm.
A buddy of mine worked on the X-37b, I have always been really curious about all the things it does up there. He swears he just built the thing and has no idea, but I ask him a couple times a year just in case he has some kind of idea and can't say and it ever becomes declassified.
That's cool... well we know it sometimes does materials science experiments exposing stuff to space and it sometimes deploys stuff... and it maneuvers. And it's up for a really long time.
