The area has been declared a firing zone (a zone being used for training purposes) by the IDF in 1979.
While this was in Israeli court the IDF provided a series of satelite images in which there was no sign of human presence. The masafer yatta's moved on to claim in court they lived in caves and used the area for agricultural purposes, mainly sheep herding. The IDF proposed a compromise in which some of the area will be used for agriculture, both growing crops and herding, the palestinians rejected the compromise.
Whilst it may be true that the school has been built by a program of the PA ministry of education, the area is designated "area C" according to the Oslo accords which means it is both under the administrative and military jurisdiction of Israel , as things stand the PA have literally no authority over that area.
Instead they designate areas of the West Bank as firing ranges, seize them, expel any resident Palestinians and prevent Palestinian settlement or use, then often give the land to jewish settlers.
Which is usually a tactic by the Israel government to steal land. There is plenty of land actually in Israel the IDF could use as a firing range.
