Ok, so now let’s stop giving the oil sector 20 B per year and give THAT to renewables here in the US. We could transition off fossil fuels completely if only we would seriously begin. Repeal the 1 T tax cut trump gave to the top 1% and let that money be used to transition. Make electric buses free to encourage us to transition. Lots can be done, but no … we will just wait til all the fish are dead, and the animals depending on the protein to swim upriver are also gone…forests are burned up and ag is at a standstill bc of mega drought, and society has collapsed. ( pentagon study predicts this within 20 years…and really don’t ask for a link, just google it).
For anyone who asks what's wrong with carbon credits: Here is an account over the Australian attempt.
So the US carbon credits rely on Transparency, Integrity and rigorous accounting in Nigeria. If any of those is broken, everyone profits, just the planet looses.
We all need to get behind this great idea, and it only can come from grassroots motivation: Carbon Tax.
