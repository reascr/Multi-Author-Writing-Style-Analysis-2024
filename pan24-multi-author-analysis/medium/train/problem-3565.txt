They were there before HIMARS and there's a video of it in various subreddits. Turkey probably sent other stuff under the table as well as we see Turkish equipment popping here and there within Ukrainian inventory.
\-US/EU not giving air defense systems then whining when Turkey puchases from Russia, then sanctioning on F-35 as a retaliation while Greece et al uses S-300s from Russia.
On the other hand Turkey and Russia have so many conflicts even military currently. Syria, Libya, Karabag, Ukraine etc.
those are off the top of my head. In 10 minutes I can list hundreds as I said West pushing Turkey intensified after coup attempt. I think it will continue if Erdogan gets elected next year.
Tukey was a staunch us ally, till they shot a russian jet that was violating their airspace and us withdrew. ErdoÄŸan is friendly with russia recently since the russians warned him about the coup and the us did not.
Turkey will never become a 100% russian allies, theyll milk them like the indians but theyve fought waaaaay to many wars in their history and have tons of bad blood.
