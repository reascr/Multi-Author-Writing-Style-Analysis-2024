Putin cannot match the president of the USA visiting Ukraine that’s why yesterday he went on a rant that nothing he said tied together, Putin starting to sound way off beat and his reasoning is no longer logical and he’s stuck with international labels like being a WAR CRIMINAL and a state sponsored mobster that is killing Russians by throwing them off buildings to their death and shooting them in the head, these are not images Russians would like to think of their president but unfortunately that’s what Putin is doing and more. Putin has sent over 100,000 Russian soldiers to their death without training, Putin is sending criminals to their death in this war, think of the worst and Putin is doing like Stalin his new found past Russian hero, so Putin brings back the ghosts of past Russian leaders that knew nothing but destroy other people. Putin wants to have that legacy written on his tomb stone: Last Russian president that saw extermination of Ukrainians.
Definitely Santos the foreign spy. How come we're not pushing that narrative that they want to turn America into Russia. Wasn't the boomer patriotic nut jobs. How are they accepting this nonsense.
