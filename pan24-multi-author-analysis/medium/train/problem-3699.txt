"more than 30k". Interesting math. They had IIRC 52k prisoners and 32k mercenaries. 31st of January the whole Wagner group was 28k, including just above 7k prisoners. 135 prisoners were granted Wagner pardon completing their contracts. About a thousand received their pardons for heroism on the battlefield. That leaves 43k prisoners that aren't accounted for and not a single prisoner returned to continue his sentence (that's the rule when they are signing up, btw). So at least 43k people from Wagner group wasn't able to return to fight. I think that's the definition of casuality.
Hopefully this means that Fox is willing to have these points of view on more instead of the Tucker shit. I also wouldn't be surprised to see this being a consolation from the core GOP seeing how poorly they're performing... to move itself away from the Trumpers. Hopefully at least.
Way to go, Luxembourg Doing your part and then some. Luxembourgers should be proud of the part they are playing in defending the world from Russian aggression.
