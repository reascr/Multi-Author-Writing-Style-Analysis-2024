Turkey isn’t an EU member, so it cannot be booted from the Union. Unfortunately it’s still a candidate- member since 1999, most people think they likely won’t be eligible to join in any near future or ever (especially with Erdogan around).
Yeah then they suddenly feel differently about things and allow Russia to bring other fleets into the Black Sea. I mean maybe they'll even just close the strait and prevent Ukrainian shipments. There are very important reasons why Turkey is in NATO and the chances of them being "removed" are near zero.
Earlier this week he threatened fellow nato member Greece with missile strikes because he claimes ownership of some Greek islands.
He supports some bogus republic of ethnic Turks that occupy the northern half of Cyprus, an EU memberstate.
He is blackmailing NATO with his vote to veto new members, which he forces to extradite political enemies.
He regularly calls Western Europeans facists and actively stirs divisions between Turks in Europe and the communities they live in.
While NATO allies were stationed at the Turkish- Syrian border as a protective measure, he used the opportunity to fight the Kurds in Syria instead of ISIS.
Turkey was a secular state. Whenever the encroaching authoritarianism of Political Islam threatened that secular state, the military stood as a back-stop...until the EU demanded that the military have its fangs removed as a condition for admittance to the EU.
