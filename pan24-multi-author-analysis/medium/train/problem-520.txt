There are over 200 "R" representatives, and only about 20ish fall into your examples of constituency........the reat are still not as far right......and the ones that are full MAGA will start to turn on their reps when they can't give them what they promised.....when the laundry list of Biden appointments arent impeached, when budgets get passed, when the government does get stuff done rather than be completely locked up.........McCarthy signed yet another deal with a whole different slate of devils, and it will come back to haunt them just like Trump is. That's my take at least........you can only juggle grenades for so long before you become pink mist on the walls.......
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
