They got the Bosphorus that ain’t happening, and Erdogan aside Turkey’s been fighting alongside the US in our shitty wars in one way or another for over 70 years now.
Turkey is arguably the second most important NATO member behind the US. They have the second largest army and are strategically important to containing Russia in the Black Sea.
Imagine being so stupid that you believe you are smarter than every leader of every western nation for the last 50 years or so. Turkey is the cultural bridge to the middle east for the west. We need to do whatever we can to support free Democracy in Turkey but turning our backs on them only makes matters worse.
And this is an equally ignorant opinion. There is a reason literally every Democratic nation does business with this "totalitarian nation".
If we are going geographically, Denmark is not on the Scandinavian peninsula (though part of Finland is), so it shouldn't be Scandinavian.
If we are going culturally, then Iceland and the Faroe Islands are Scandinavian, in addition to those on your list, and Finland is not.
If we are going historically, then Finland, Iceland, FI, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway are all Scandinavian from past rule.
