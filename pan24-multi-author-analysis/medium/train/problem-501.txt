The title is misleading. The title seems to suggest to me that they have around 88.5 milion (the population is 99.4 milion) people infected with Covid right now which would be insane amount of people.
And if someone thinks that they don't cover up their numbers then he is insane. In country of 1.4 bilion people they have 5242 deaths. China was starting place of this disease and they have this low official number. If you believe in this then I have one question for you. Are you freaking insane ? This statement from this local official contradicts the official statistic from China. They have official statistic of 503,302	cases and he says around 88 milion had this disease. Even if he is wrong by 90% this still is only one province in this massive country. We will never truly know the number of deaths and cases because even CCP doesn't know those numbers.
But to be clear I have to say this. Only CCP is to blame for everything. They lied for so long that they made this pandemic possible and even now they are lying that they have everything under control and that they have numbers that they present to the world.
Yep, and as it stands now they don't seem to have a desire to address this problem than letting the virus more or less move through the population. Letting it kill scores of people and leaving anyone strong enough to survive. Worst yet, they are actively trying to spread the virus by making it easier to travel for Chinese citizens outside the country who are likely infected with it. They do not care about their citizens' health or wellbeing the same way they don't care about the health of wellbeing of any other country's citizens.
