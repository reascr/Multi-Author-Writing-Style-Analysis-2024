From our perspective, Andrew is a disgraced POS who is very likely guilty of heinous sex crimes, and if not then he's at least still a gross little shit who used his birth position to interact with some of the worst people high society had to offer.
As someone not in the UK I never give a shit about the royal family. Looking into their properties it blows my mind everyone isnâ€™t calling to end the monarchy.
From the Queen's perspective, he was still her son. It's almost impossible for any mother to imagine that her son is evil. It must be even harder to believe when you're in your 90's and have lived most of your life believing otherwise.
Hell, the Britannia the former royal yacht was turned into a tourist attraction. You can have tea on it or rent it for special occasions. I say do the same to all the royal palaces/castles. And the "smaller" royal properties like Clarence House or Edwards 120 room home can be sold for private homes.
is in London and he still has an apartment there. It's down the street from Buckingham Palace, a distance of 0.3 miles.
I dont think he cares like that. Its just the bad PR would be extremely damaging. It might honestly end the monarchy if Andrew got caught still diddling teenagers.
WTF, did the royals ever need so many palaces so close together. (Because Kensinon Palace is also walking distance.) Why wasn't one palace enough for them?
