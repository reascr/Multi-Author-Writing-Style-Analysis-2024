Scotland had a vote in 2014, you can't have a vote every time something changes else when do you stop? Do you say only major changes? But there will be a grey line between major and medium etc so where do you stop? Scotland had a fair vote and decided to stay. You have to stay through thick and thin not just while the good times roll.
We love Scotland in the UK and it's part of all of our history and heritage. We are British let's stay united not divided.
That's not really the case though, European culture is quite different to British culture. Britain has been united for hundreds of years, whereas the European union has only been around for about 40. The EU had some benefits for sure but also some negatives. Let's build a better world, we can't keep attempting to turn the clocks back.
Nonsense, all Countries have their own cultures, including Scotland England and Wales, ..that's why they all have their own flags... the European Union was formed as a peace project after the most disastrous wars in history.
I am a British European, and one of the 1/2 billion fellow Europeans, not one of the 17 million ( and decreasing ) little englanders....
Well l am one of " the people " and l don't have any very close ties with any other countries in the UK, ...l do however have very close ties with people in other ( Canada, South Africa )countries, and they are very similar to me....
