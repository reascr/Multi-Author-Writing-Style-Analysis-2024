I'm sure all those who didn't want the girl to abort her pregnancy, which was inflicted on her against her will, will be more than willing to take the child off her and give it the very best upbringing while asking nothing in return...
Pregnancy and childbirth is incredibly difficult and painful. The body goes through a plethora of changes, etc, etc.
Being forced, literally forced to go through all of that is so evil it amazes me. The Christo-fascists in my country (the US) are the same people.
Yes, my wife has had three children. Had we not miraculously got the medical attention we needed seemingly by chance for the last one, there was a good chance both mother and baby would be dead (a chance comment during a routine appointment made the doctor do an ultrasound, revealing a placental abruption, requiring an immediate caesarian - otherwise baby and possibly mother would die).
I don't know what the health system is like in Poland, but my wife has had kids in the UK and Australia and we've not had to pay a penny out of pocket (or at least not much - there may have been a little for ultrasounds).
And this chill’s body is the crime scene -why force this malignancy on her health and well-being? The cruelty is a feature or they would prioritize this child over a bundle of cells.
Yep - my wife's had three kids. First one was a 38-hour labour. Second was relatively straightforward by comparison. Third was an emergency caesarian - had a complication (placental abruption) not been caught, seemingly by chance, both baby and mother could well be dead.
For people who don’t know, rape victims can go through ptsd break down due to how painful giving birth is it triggers flashbacks to the rape. Which can also lead to post natal depression (prenatal depression too on feeling like rapists took away sense of control over their bodies).
