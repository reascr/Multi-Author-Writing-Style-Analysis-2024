It is the highest form of hipocrisy. You can edit the genes of your unborn kids as much as you want, you can smoke for instance or consume any other genotoxic substance you please. You have the right to introduce any number of randim mutations. But if you introduce a single, well-characterised mutation suddenly everybody is outraged.

You can introduce as many unvanted genetic changes into your kid's genome as you would like and people are totally fine with it.
but no, you don't know what you are talking about....looks like you never bothered to read the article or anything else about it or genetic manipulation and the consequences involved...
you can double down on stupidity but it is still stupidity you are spouting. out off curiosity where exactly are the changing he genetic codes of kids? you know outside of the guy that went to prison for it already? can you name some cases as you seem to be the expert..ps there appears to be quite a bit of outrage over it so perhaps people aren't fine with it...now get to googling for your answer you dont know.
I see.. So people smoking is the same thing as people genetically manipulating genes of others, with no idea the ancillary consequences? You seem to be an expert on false analogies for sure, the rest? not so much...tripling down on stupidity still leaves the fact that it is stupidity in the first place...it is the internet though, so a quadrupling down and more false analogies are sure to come. Let the logical fallacies continue sir.
This is not an analogy. It works the exact same way, by introducing random mutations into the genome. These are the same "off-target effects" or "unwanted genetic changes" you fear so much. Please learn some biology!
