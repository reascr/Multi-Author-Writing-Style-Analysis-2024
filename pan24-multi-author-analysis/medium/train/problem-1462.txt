So why did the White House cap income at for married couples for this program? They could have set a much lower limit but for whatever reason it was very important to them that people doing better than the vast majority of Americans got help too. Wouldn’t have anything to do with how they vote, would it?
Not the “average person”. A very specific kind of person. Most Americans don’t have student debt and 50% of student debt is held by those with post-graduate degrees. Sort of tired of Reddit pretending that no help was going to people in great jobs with advanced degrees while it did nothing for the single mom working two waitress jobs.
