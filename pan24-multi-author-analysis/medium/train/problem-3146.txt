Thanks American voters, you did it again to yourselves. For all those states that sent Republicans to Congress your tax dollars will go into the fireplace now and we will hear these Republicans hash out bullshit on someone that has nothing to do with the political relevance of today’s issues and economic problems. When you send to Congress clowns that are there just for their own interests for protecting their salary and healthcare benefits this is the jokesters you get. Not one serious Republican congressman will work for you the taxpayer. Republicans can’t win with policies so now they are going after Hunter Biden. Let the show begin, and lets have a democratic president with the house and senate in 2024.
