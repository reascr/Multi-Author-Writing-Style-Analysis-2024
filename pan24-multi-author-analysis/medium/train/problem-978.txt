Documents have been in the closet since at least 2020 (if not before) but allegedly not before 2017. No one, truly no one, seems to have realized the documents were there. So to follow your speculation at least one person outside of Biden's staff would have to have known they were there to break into the closet to look at them. Or you're saying someone was breaking into random closets and got lucky. Or you're saying someone methodically broke into closets in that building, but this is the ONLY ONE to be reported on, and it wasn't broken into that we know of.
I wonder how many people that don't have clearance looked at the classified documents we had to take from Trump?
