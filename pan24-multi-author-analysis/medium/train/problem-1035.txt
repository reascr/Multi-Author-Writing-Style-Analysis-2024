The serious health risk of CV19 risk to younger people in peak physical condition is minimal however, there are some studies that suggest there is a slightly elevated risk of vaccine side effects in this group. The efficacy of this vaccine wanes within months of taking it, there are no long term studies on its effects. I think it’s safe but because everyone’s health history is different, I don’t feel it should be mandatory i.e., Epstein Barr. These are some of the reasons I don’t think it should be mandatory. It’s okay if you disagree but I do know someone that faced complications.
