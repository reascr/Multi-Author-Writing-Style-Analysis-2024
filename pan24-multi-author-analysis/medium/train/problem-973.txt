Biden really was the right man for the job. Sure, he's old. And gaffe prone. But he knows how the system is supposed to work. Trump and his cronies smashed the system like a toddler smashes a Lego house. And there wasn't anyone more qualified then Biden to put it back together.
Yeah, Biden has been doing great with some of these progressive bills and making em passable w bipartisanship. Bernie has great ideas, they just need to be tweaked in a right way for em to pass.
