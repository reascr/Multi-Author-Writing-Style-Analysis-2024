From December 15th to today, gas prices in Europe dropped from €134.7 to €85.25, almost 37% in a single week.
This is while gas reserves are being held at an almost unprecedented high level, which is excellent news.
Germany built a LNG terminal in months and more are on the way. If Europe can get through this winter, dependence on Russian gas will be a thing of the past.
Wasn’t Ukraine fault, it was Europe’s fault for trusting Putin. It sucks the world had to pay a higher cost of energy but it’s probably better for the planet.
As Europe demonstrated that this was in fact not the case, the price fell steadily back to the €100-150 range. More deals were done, gas supplies were found, industries started switching to electricity instead of gas, people turned their heating down, gas usage dropped over 20%, gas storage around the continent went up incredibly fast and hit max level, and we've now successfully negotiated the first major cold snap without issues. Gas levels remain high (in fact some countries increased), and recent reports have industry doing pretty well. Also, China's suffering serious problems with Covid and demand has slackened there also.
So, death by a thousand cuts, really : most of the news is positive, and the overall picture has ticked solidly over to "Gas needs Europe more than Europe needs gas", driving the prices down.
