I’m I bet less than a year especially with outbreaks in Europe and Asia they are going to report these people dying from what they “should have been vaccinated against” then blame the democrats. Then try to bring it back with: “this is the real vaccine see I’m taking it.” The anti-vax will still be: “I don’t trust any vaccine from 50 years ago to now because a bunch of fake boob celebrities told me it gave their kids autism.”.
The drill instructors and corpsmen I dealt with in basic listened to every one of my concerns, and didn't care. I got all my vaccinations, including a golf-ball sized knot in my friggin ass-cheek.
