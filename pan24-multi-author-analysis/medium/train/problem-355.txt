Wow, this is a serious and possibly terminal misstep for tv rain. I think what they were attempting to do is "win" some apathetic or even pro war followers to their "side" to get some viewership and maybe influence them, but supporting combatants is not the way to do that because it alienates the anti war audience they already had. Would have been much better optics to do something like help families who have lost a breadwinner, either because they died or are perpetually listed as "missing". That would have not supported actual killing operations and it would maybe get people thinking something like "the government took my loved one, and then didn't help me, only other people stepped in to help me" and break the image of the infallible regime for some of the lightly brainwashed.
It's a bit weird, since we now know that the Wagner group is really a branch of the Russian military used whenever Kremlin wants to keep some distance. Can it be the branch of the military and a terrorist organization at the same time?
