The most effective answer is to make cops carry malpractice insurance just like doctors, lawyers, electricians and other professionals. If they are liable for their own mistakes, rather than the taxpayers, you will see a dramatic change, overnight. And the worst ones will become uninsurable and will have to find a different job.
It would actually be foolish of those pushing the status qou to allow that to happen. As long as the enforcers are treated better than the enforcees, there will never be change as you know.
