Are you sure about that? The article seems to focus on the Indian caste system, which is based on religion, and religious discrimination is illegal per the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Yeah, gotta love how so many laws are open to interpretation so the haves can always manipulate them against the have-nots.
No, I'm not SURE about that, but it's about what can be proven in court. I would think it difficult to prove religious discrimination when both parties are the same religion, and there's no additional language in the law to even recognize that the idea of 'caste' exists. It seems like an easy way to clarify and update the law to include something that wasn't really an issue in 1964 but is certainly in keeping with its spirit.
Just for fun, I asked ChatGPT if caste discrimination was legal in the US (which ChatGPT couldn't answer any challenging questions from my intro soils course correctly) and it said that the national origin aspect of the Civil Rights Act makes caste discrimination illegal.
>Furthermore, it's worth noting that in some cases, discrimination based on caste or other social hierarchies can be perpetuated by the very fact of being in a new country. For instance, if a person who holds a lower caste status in their home country moves to the United States and experiences discrimination from members of their own community who hold a higher caste status, this can be a form of discrimination that is linked to their national origin, and is thus prohibited by U.S. law.
