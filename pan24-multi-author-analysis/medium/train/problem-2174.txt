Then when you get the actual interview with the IT people you can find out what the job really requires. If you don’t lie or bend the truth you won’t ever get the interview because you won’t make it past the HR person with no clue what the job is.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

It’s not always about morals I work in IT and it’s common for HR to put either insane requirements or stuff that isn’t even related to the job on the job posting. So if you ever want an interview for some jobs you have to either outright lie or fudge the truth on the application.
