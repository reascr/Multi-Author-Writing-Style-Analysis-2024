On Wednesday the Supreme Court hosted nearly three hours of oral arguments in a case many experts say could do more damage to democracy than anything since Donald Trump’s attempted coup.
Moore v Harper revolves around an idea cooked up on the fringes of conservative legal thought that could turn federal elections into statewide power-grabs, and possibly do more to weaken the power of voters’ ballots than gerrymandering ever could.
There’s been plenty of good analysis on the arcane legal readings and textual interpretations driving “independent state legislature” theory. So let’s take a second to talk about the politics.
Why is a right-wing theory that even conservative legal scholars call obtuse and “indefensible” on the cusp of altering federal elections? For the same reason Trump’s self-preserving lies about a stolen election found such fertile ground in the GOP base, and why they spawned an entire political movement more than happy to excuse a coup: Republicans are tired of sharing power.
Democracy can never recover unless it is overturned, because the electorate is simply too stupid and falls for obvious propaganda.
How do we inform the electorate? MSMedia news outlets are obviously biased to put it nicely and now we just lost Twitter to a tyrant entirely in charge. Yes we're too stupid but real information is not even making it to their eyes or ears for them judge for themselves.
