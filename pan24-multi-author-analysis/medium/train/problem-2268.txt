Who can forget yelling at kids for political theater then turning around and having a news conference with those same kids being used as political theatre props?
I've said for quite awhile now that once Americans actually get to know DeSantis they aren't going to like what they see. He's a very smarmy, needlessly hostile, cocky asshole.
