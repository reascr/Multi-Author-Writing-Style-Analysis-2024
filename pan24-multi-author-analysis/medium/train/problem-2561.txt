Well actually I have great sympathy for the Russian conscripts being forced into this. We fully agree on this. I had to stop watching the never ending drone grenade drop videos as it was just too disturbing to me. But it is hard to muster sympathy for those Wagner guys thats as profoundly evil as it gets.
Yeah, they have a way to fix this: get out of Ukraine. Otherwise, they should expect their sons to continue to die, and odds are, that tempo will only increase.
"We are defending ourselves because they were about to attack us. We asked for guarantees of safety and they did not give them to us. We could not wait any longer.".
Well there is real truth to the idea that if you live by the sword you die by the sword. You do the crime you pay the time. If you play with fire prepared to gent burnt. I believe all Russians know and accept this. Whatâ€™s got their goat is that this conflict exposed significant ineptitude and incompetence in sharp contrast to the propaganda they have been fed. It exposes the fact that perhaps NATO doctrine is superior to Soviet doctrine. Those are hard pills to swallow.
