What you're cheering isn't freedom of speech. It's actually one single man—Musk—being the ultimate arbiter of what speech is or isn't allowed on a particular forum, and you just happen to like the speech he's decided to allow. Musk's reaction to any Twitter employee expressing any criticism of himself should tell you all you need to know about his real views on 'free speech.'.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

There never was a question that Musk is a Trump fan and was going to let Trump slime the US again via Twitter.
