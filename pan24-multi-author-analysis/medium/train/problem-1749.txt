>The so-called "Deutschlandticket" will cost around 3 billion euros, financed by both the federal and states' governments, with Berlin promising an additional one billion euros per year to help states cope with rising energy prices and staff costs.
That’s crazy I will say that at least you have a public transportation system, we only have busses in major cities the biggest have limited rapid trains - very limited. If I want to go to to a city 6-7 hours away from where I live I have to drive, there is no transit of any kind that will take me there, possibly I could fly IF that city has an airport…. We did have greyhound bus lines which you could buy a ticket to drive between city’s on but they were a private company that shut down.
If I were to get a train (return) from Manchester to London tomorrow to return the next day via train the cheapest price would be £136.60 or $209 CAD. From Glasgow to London that price is £326.00 or $500 CAD.
So I have found a flight departing on 10/11/2022 to return on 17/11/2022 to London to Toronto for £369 all included. It would cost me £43 more to fly to Canada and back than it would to get a train from Glasgow to London….
We have a large country with a small population so public transportation is not good, there are so many places even in the city that you can’t even catch a bus. A monthly transit pass in Edmonton is $100. I live in a suburb of Edmonton you can get a bus into Edmonton from one area of my town a few times a day but it’s not practical and costly.
Vancouver city has a really good transit system though… but it doesn’t translate to the rest of the lower mainland (greater Vancouver area).
The German public transit system was also privatised 25 or so years ago, but it's a weird system where the government still has some stake in the rail company.
I only got mine, because the Amazon and Google clouds don't have any other payment options (though I'm not using either anymore now).
