This is also the problem with the big party tents we find ourselves trapped in as a result of how our voting system is structured. As long as FPTP exists, no third party will ever be a serious contender in most seats. As a result, people largely feel under or misrepresented because they don't see the party's candidate as ideal, when in reality it's just the outcome of trying to represent such a wide range of interests in a single party. We need to redesign our voting systems so that people can rank candidates (e.g., ranked choice or some alternative voting system) they most agree with without feeling they are tossing the election to someone they are least likely to agree with. This should not only help with diversifying the political landscape and break up the consolidated power of the big parties, but also encourage voter participation and help tamper extremism. While nothing is guaranteed, we have got to try to make some changes because the Tea Party element that took over the Republican party isn't going anywhere and they have shown they have no interest in working with the rest of the country to govern with compromise.
