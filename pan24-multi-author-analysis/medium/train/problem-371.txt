We are not closing farms to 'comply with EU rules'. This is just framing. We are cloaing farms because the biodiversity in our nature reserves is getting destroyed by NOx.
And no, we will not starve. A huge part of the 'food' on these farms is from or for livestock and this is mainly exported!
Do you not understand how basic economies work? Creating export creates money, something that is needed for a healthy economy and especially during a time of recession.
Your climate emergency bullshit is just another way for every major corporation on earth to make even more money by having you believe that they are doing the right thing.
Wtf is the country going to do with all this land now? Create another national park? Build houses? What about matching income generated from those farms?
You act as if Dutch land is prehistoric when most of this country was a swamp and marsh up until 1.5k years ago. Literally the great pyramids of egypt are older than both Noord and Zuid Holland.
So other people will starve. I'm guessing the brown folks are going to take another one for the team. Then they will then try to farm some new land. The production of those areas are going to be shit compared to quality european farmland, so it will surely cost thousands of square km of previously unfarmed nature areas. then ?????.... then Profit/nature wins somehow....
