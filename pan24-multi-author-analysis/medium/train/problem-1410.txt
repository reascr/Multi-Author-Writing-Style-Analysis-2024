Canada checking in here. Outside of Trudeau's recent scolding of Xi last week, I've not encountered anything in the media yet. If there is an investigation going on, it could take a little while, and the RCMP or CSIS won't comment during an active investigation. Even once it's done, there's no guarantee that any reports will become public. I hope they do though: it is most definitely something we ought to know for the public good.
Can you imagine a just setting up a American federal agency in Nigeria. NO. we don't do stuff like this. Yes there are spy's , agents undercover, and a few assassins(just in case).
But having a foreign police force just enforcing their laws, arresting people, some of them citizens of your country. Disappearing them.
Espionage happens. But this is so blatant and uncalled for. I wouldn't blame them if they used their Geneva convention rights and place a kill order on them.(spy's and assassins can be executed on discovery under the Geneva convention. no paper work).
