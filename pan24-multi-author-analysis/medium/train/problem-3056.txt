It puts the GOP in a weird spot because you know they want to say "What Biden did is WORSE than Trump" but that would also be an admission that what Trump did is in the realm of bad. And that implication will make Trump have a fit.

If this was all premeditated, this is 4d chess. Find classified documents, go through the correct process, comply with any investigation that arises. Demonstrate how this is supposed to happen without...idk bringing a corrupt judge into it only to have that judge smacked down too. And then sit back and wait for the "both sides" people to tie themselves in a knot.
At first I thought it was damaging, that it diminished Trump's crimes. But as Biden plays it by the book, stays uninvolved and gets back to work, it is a remarkable contrast with Trump - calling the special council a terrorist and demanding 'his' documents back, while he sits around raging on social media from his retirement home.
