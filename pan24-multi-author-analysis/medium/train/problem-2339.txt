The 10,000,000 illegal immigrants in US and those coming are key workers for GOP businesses in farming, construction, real estate, food processing, hotels, building maintenance.
The GOP immigration laws are not designed stop immigration, they are designed to keep the 10,000,000 "illegal" so they can be exploited by GOP corporations for profit.
Workers get $50k, which is five years median income in Mexico. US government gets $500B to pay down GOP debt from tax cuts for rich and unfunded US military. A win-win for everybody...except the white supremacist, Christian anti-immigrant (but we hire them) GOP.
GOP businesses employ the illegal immigrants in US and those coming here. Of course the businesses don't use e-verify...see ILLLEGAL above. It is how they exploit them with low wages and unsafe workplaces so GOP'ers can make a profit.
