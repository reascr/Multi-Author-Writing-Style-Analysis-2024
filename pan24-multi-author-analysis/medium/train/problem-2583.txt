I don't see Biden or the democrats agreeing to cut Medicaid so republicans might have to just go ahead and tank the global economy or quit their crying and raise the debt ceiling like responsible adults.
Any cuts to the safety net should be (and probably are) non-starters for democrats. That includes Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, WIC, Social Security and every other safety net program.
Or just Tax companies accordingly. Apple alone currently has quite the stack of cash sitting in Ireland but they still call themselves and American corporation. The military is arguably cuttable but with the current world of conflicts and the fact China is growing their own military it’s a harder sell.
I dunno, man, I feel like the whole of society benefits when there’s not a large class of people with nothing to lose who need to steal or commit crime to survive. Do you think public schools benefit the general welfare or kids only?
