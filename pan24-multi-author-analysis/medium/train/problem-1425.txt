Terrible wording - the actual word should be "cured", as in corrected because they were not machine readable (or were missing dates or signatures) but turned out to be valid ballots.

I guess forgetting to sign is one thing, but to think anyone is trying to match signatures in this day and age is crazy.
According to the article many of them are signature issues, either missing signature or a "discrepancy" in the signature.
And I don't know how much longer signatures are going to be distinct/verifiable forms of identification anyway.
With payment apps and chip readers there are fewer and fewer places where signatures are needed. Maybe your school or army application, rental agreement, car purchase, home purchase, marriage license and...? (insert snark about how young people can't afford school, rent, cars or marriage).
Given the current lead she holds and the nature of outstanding ballots (overseas, needing cured etc.), it seems highly unlikely (I'm in her district and would love to see it, but it is now a very long shot).
