This would seem to suggest there is some uneasiness among Russian citizens about the war in Ukraine. We have been hearing that the war against Ukraine enjoys much support by Russians but there seems to be a segment of Russians who at least understand that their armies are committing atrocities. Am I correct or have I missed something?
I've meant the new iteration in it's current form, with unique features and systems in place, apologies if it wasn't clear enough.
Russia is an authoritarian state that spent past 22 years perfecting it's oppression tools. Opposition is always playing a high risk, low reward game - so many are just saving themselves until the government is in a tight spot and there is an opening to do something meaningful. You can notice that behavior all the way from 2012 with protests hitting the streets each time government crossed a line, then going back underground after being unsuccessful.
I'm not claiming that majority of Russians are oppressed innocents, probably far from it and currently much less than the sum of "apolitical" majority and active putin supporters. But the opposition forces are higher than we notice on the first glance. Somebody is brave enough lighting buildings on fire, many are in prison or in forced immigration, some are moving out of the country themselves with their capital and tax money, few even participate in public activism still, but even more are just anonymously voicing their opinion online... Still not enough, but shouldn't be ignored imo.
