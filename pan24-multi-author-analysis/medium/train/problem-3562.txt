I mean yeah, in the long term this is true, but I feel like in terms of the politics of elections the GOP has always been about consolidating as much power as possible in the short term so that they can leverage that power to stack the deck in their favor in the long term.
Part of me does think they'll actually turn on him this time so personally I'm overcompensating by refusing to actually believe it because I feel like charlie brown and the football. I can see why they may finally decide he is politically a sinking ship, but also can see why they are sort of stuck to him. He's got major control over a very critical part of the GOP voter base that they actually must keep, and these people have 0 principles. At what point do they think they can safely discard him without sustaining major damage? And if it's now, I'll believe it when I see them go all in on pushing for him to face real consequences instead of this toe in the water bullshit.
