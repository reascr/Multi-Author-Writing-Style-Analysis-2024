Where are you getting this from? UK net migration has been fairly stable and this was obviously planned by the Tories by the fact they lowered the Skilled Worker visa minimum salary to £25.6k from £30k (this can go even lower if the workers are in certain sectors). They also reduced the cost of visas for health workers. This is probably one of the few things that the Tories have actually done successfully. Even a broken clock is right twice per day.
Brit here. I'm cool with it, particularly given that the citizens of these countries have historically been hugely impacted by Westminster Governments over the last three centuries.
The UK desperately needs that trade deal post Brexit and they desperately need more non-EU immigrants to replace the lack of EU migrants after Brexit, so that's a win-win for them. Of course it won't be popular with a certain demographic the Tories depend on.
The real difference in migration terms is not the numbers but the explosion in terms of numbers of skilled workers with a reduction in non-skilled workers. This means more tax paid which can then be reinvested in services which are needed to support the increasing population.
