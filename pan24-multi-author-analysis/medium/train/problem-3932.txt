2. The President should not be able to influence the IRS’s ability to perform such an audit, and the existing process should be revised accordingly;.
The House Ways and Means Committee has voted along party lines 24 to 16 to publicly release several years of former president Donald Trump's tax returns in a redacted form, bringing a years-long dispute to a close.
If anyone is curious, they don’t exactly dance around the fact that this is in response to Trump in the report. They make direct reference to his repeated public statements regarding his taxes, his audits, and the fact that he believes he was unfairly targeted due to…being a Christian (which I am not making up, but really wish that I was).
Something something, it was never required before, therefor they're only doing this to attack Trump, it's democrats weaponizing the IRS to attack Trump, just because he said he's running for president again.
This nation was founded by persecuted Christians who wanted the freedom to practice their Christianity without government or any other type of interference!
