He wants to look like he supports trump to trump supporters and will drag this out before pleading the fifth instead of putting down a guy who could've gotten him killed and showed no remorse. Because he thinks he can be president.

What's bullshit is he can probably appeal this infinite times to drag it out. That's an intentionally designed flaw in our court system that benefits the rich.
That's the problem all the 2024 contenders have. They are delusional if they think the majority of people who supported Trump in 2020 will move to them in a primary. Especially if Trump blames them for his loss based on their wishy washy support for his candidacy in 2020. Nothing but blind obedience is good for the cult and that's a litmus test GOP presidential candidates won't pass.
It’s about the appearance of him fighting: if he submits without one, he’s seen as weak - especially since he’ll probably announce his candidacy for president soon.
Pence looks weak and delusional because he is shielding a man who tried to have him killed from liability and accountability believing it will get the cult that supports that same man to support him instead - in an election against the cult's leader of all things.
