Lol you’re not even saying anything. You’re just saying I don’t know anything. I think the US. Is all the way in Russias territory and whether we like it or not russia is willing to go a lot further than us to protect their backyard. I would argue you’re a fucking idiot who eats up propaganda like chicken noodle soup. I know what nato is.( not from what they say but from what they do.) it’s a European alliance whose focus is on dominating the non European world. Russia is a European country who refuses to play ball. China is a non European power structure who is very capable of toppling the European global order. (That’s why China is a threat.) the United States has been in the driver seat of the world order for at least 50 years. A lot of blood is owed.
All this time, this last 11 months, it has been one lie after another. Even before the actual invasion began, remember? They were doing exercises on Ukraine's border. Remember that? Even if Russia came out and said the sky was blue, I would have to run to the window to check.
