Because Miami is the mecca of every mediocre Brazilian right wing nut job. As much as I enjoy seeing the door hit him on the way out, please send him back to us. The courts and the federal police are waiting.
And Venezuelans and Cubans and more. Many south and Central American countries have toyed with socialism, to varying degrees of success (to put it lightly), which means you come across a lot of Floridians who fled those places in search of a better life. Some found it in the US. Of course this is a bit of a self selection process since youâ€™re not talking to the many people who chose to stay behind, but it is very much a thing. I neither mean that as an endorsement of socialism or the American capitalist system.
The majority of Brazilians in Florida are that typical Upper Middle Class who voted in Bolsonaro to save Brazil from ''Communism'', They believe in Meritocracy, Neoliberalism and are against social programs, because this is socialism and we'll become Cuba, Venezuela and blablabla.
