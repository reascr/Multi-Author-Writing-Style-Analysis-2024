The country needs to have a very personal and deep conversation about mental health after these elections. Candidates like Walker and West need help. Both should be surrounded be loved ones and therapists, especially West.
The one thing I could guess about Walker (besides everything reported), is that he would be able to do a Scooby-Doo impersonation. As a superstar athlete, basically his entire life, he has never had to mature beyond his childhood.

Yes and he doesnâ€™t seem to be aware. Minnesota got a so-called star but he was nothing special there, they became more of a passing team. Dallas loaded up their roster w draft studs and would have won at least 4 in a row and be considered the all time team if not for Deion Sanders joining SF.
He came to Dallas after they had won their division w legendary Tony Dorsett as their star RB. Immediately team got worse. Herschel had a monster statistical year when they were terrible w just 3 wins getting the iconic Tom Landry fired. He was on their awful 1-15 team w Jimmy Johnson, famously was the trade bait that launched the dynasty, replaced by Emmitt Smith another legend. Then he had some OK years but mostly as an all purpose back who could run back kicks, not the franchise workhorse he should have been coming out of college.
