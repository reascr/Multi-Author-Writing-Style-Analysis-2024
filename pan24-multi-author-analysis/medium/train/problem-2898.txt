I wish the lawyer would have followed up his "same answer" with "For the record the deposed has answered that he pleads the fifth". It would take maybe 2-3 times before Trump would have perjured himself. (and I know the prosecutor was the one who recommended trump say "same answer" to speed things up. He had to speed things up because Trump's lawyers constructed a script that said I plead the fifth without actually saying those words, which made it multiple sentences of slow talking, small dick energy).

yeah i can’t believe they did that. i’d have expected them to force the statement “i assert my 5th amendment rights” or something similar so that each question has a clear stated response and not “same answer”.
Just run this along the "people who plead the fifth are guilty" moments. It is not the 50s when you could say anything you wanted and nobody could record you. Everything is online, especially when you're the freaking President and speak in front of cameras.
haven’t seen the paper, it could be a pictogram where he just has to say the images he sees and it sounds like reading. similar to the three cues method for “teaching “ reading.
