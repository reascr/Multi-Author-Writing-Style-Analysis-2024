Today some missile strikes did happen, so it was a bit less quiet than usual. At around 11:35pm we heard some explosions, about a minute later an air raid alert was triggered and that was when we realized that the explosions were from Russian missiles. We didnâ€™t have any prior warnings, so the missiles were most likely launched from some unusual place, probably somewhere deeper in Belgorod oblast.
Some missiles were apparently intercepted by our air defense, but some did make it through and landed somewhere not too far from Kharkiv. There were reports of electricity being cut in some places in Kharkiv oblast, so Russians were most likely aiming for our energy infrastructure as usual. Our air defense is definitely getting better/more skilled, as today 13 Shaheds were fired at Kyiv in the morning and not a single one made it through. Also, a bit later in the day another batch of Shaheds were fired at Odesa, but all of those were intercepted as well, our AA is getting really good at shooting them down.
Today there were more explosions in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts, apparently, we targeted their military bases again. Russians reported that everything was intercepted as usual, but there are videos showing big explosions happen on the ground, so something was definitely hit. Actually, those missile strikes that were aimed at Kharkiv might have been a retaliation for hitting their military bases, but unsurprisingly they are retaliating against civilians every time their military targets get hit.
