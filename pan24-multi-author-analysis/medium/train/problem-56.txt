What’s up with that? I’ve even seen Russians in Russia say they have more freedom and opportunities than anywhere else, which is obviously incorrect. I assume they think this way because they watch their Fox News equivalent constantly, RT, is it? They seem to really love watching state TV over there. And who could blame them, sounds like a blast, watching Steven Seagal say how strong Russia is. That guy is so compromised it’s actually sad.
Had a Russian dude like that in my EET classes. Guy scoffed that his RU certifications weren't recognized, then proceeded to cheat his ass off from the first mother fucking term. I even had an instructor approach me to see if I knew that he was cheating off me. Oh - and then he proceeded to get kicked out of an unpaid internship with a local hospital.
But fuck us for not accepting his EE cert that apparently didn't even test as far Ohm's Fucking Law.
What's even more depressing is there's non Russians in other countries that have never been to Russia, who think Russia is better off than where they currently live.
