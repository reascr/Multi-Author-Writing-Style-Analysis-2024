At that point Russia either carry out an attack on a ship under the deal, or they lose publicly and have to rejoin or admit impotence.
That's assuming that Ukraine haven't broken through to the Melitopol coast in the interim and assumed anti-ship fire control over the entire Azov Sea, anyway.
If Russia want to start wasting ammunition on grain silos in the ports while making countries hate them even more, Ukraine can just decentralise to regional silos and only bring in cargoes last minute.
>Russia’s agricultural exports have not been explicitly targeted by Western sanctions, but Moscow says blocks on its payments, logistics and insurance industries are a “barrier” to it being able to export its own grains and fertilisers.
If Ukraine asked for international help to safe guard it’s food exports from ports that the international world recognises as been Ukrainian then would it legal for international forces to create a safe corridor for the food the world needs to be delivered safely with or without Russia ?
