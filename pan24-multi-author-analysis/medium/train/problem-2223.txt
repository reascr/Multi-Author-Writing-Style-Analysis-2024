TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, should be removed from app stores run by Apple and Google because the social media app poses a risk to national security, Democratic Senator Michael Bennet said.
The app, which Congress has already banned from federal government devices, has come under increasing criticism because of concern that China's government could use it to harvest data on Americans or advance Chinese interests.
"No company subject to CCP dictates should have the power to accumulate such extensive data on the American people or curate content to nearly a third of our population," Bennet wrote in a letter to the heads of Alphabet and Apple.
