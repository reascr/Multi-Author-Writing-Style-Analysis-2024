December 3, 1855 â€“ February 2, 1856: The election for Speaker of the House was the longest and most contentious Speaker election in its history, due to sectional conflict over slavery and a rising anti-immigrant mood in the nation that contributed to a poisoned and deteriorating political climate. Further, no party had received a majority of the seats, while 21 members vied for the post of Speaker. The election took 133 ballots and two months, with Nathaniel P. Banks winning over William Aiken Jr. by 103 to 100 votes. Technically, 113 votes were required to secure a majority in the election for Speaker, but a change was made to the rules so that a winner to be declared with a plurality if, after three consecutive rounds of voting, no majority was achieved.[1] Banks, a member of both the nativist Know-Nothing (American) Party and the Free Soil Party, served one term as Speaker before Democrats regained control of the chamber in the 35th Congress.[2][3].
