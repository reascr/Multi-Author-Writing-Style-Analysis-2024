ron doesn’t give a shit about Hunter Biden, I wish people in the media would just ask “dude, you know you don’t give a shit about Hunter Biden, we know you don’t, can’t we just talk about you doing your fucking job?”.

Unfortunately that's a common phenomenon for a lot of states with the rural/urban divide. There are two Americas and each sees themselves as a bulwark against the reprehensible nature of the other. I had hope after the 2008 election showed signs of a more evenly spread out electoral map that things were starting to normalize after the country had been through so many polarizing things like 9/11, the Iraq War, the beginning shocks to the economy, etc. I thought we'd see people migrating back to the middle once we were a few years past these events and they saw hyperpartisan gridlock halting anything meaningful but I was wrong. Everyone only doubled down and now you're either godless socialist heathen or a backwards redneck luddite depending on who you disagree with. Even if you agree with 99% of everything else, your 1% variation in opinion is more than enough to disgrace you from partisan circles and it naturally leads to scenarios like you've pointed out.
