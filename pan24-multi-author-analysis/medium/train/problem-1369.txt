America lost like 12k troops in the 20 yr forever War that Strong Man President Biden had the cahonnes to FINALLY BE A PRESIDENT THAT KEEPS HIS PROMISES and that was a big one. Trump couldn't do it because in truth Biden's way was best. Otherwise it would have been American troops slaughtering thousands of civilians in Afghanistan as they get all their equipment in a 1 yr evacuation plan. Biden did it in days and we lost 12 great men of honor. True patriots who lost their lives at the End of 20 yrs of War with nothing getting accomplished except the 1% were getting rich using KIA s to launder Heroin in back to the states billions of dollars worth. I actually think the 1% wanted 2 wars for a distraction to the real reason we even went to Afghanistan - for the poppy plants and the Heroin aka a few years later in America coincidentally a OPIATE CRISIS BROKE OUT. Do the math it was NEVER ABOUT OIL !
Sad to inform you that it might be true. Zelenskyj has said (which may or may not be an inflated number to garner sympathies and spur other countries to action) but Russian casualties are at best estimate only around 100 000 ish.
