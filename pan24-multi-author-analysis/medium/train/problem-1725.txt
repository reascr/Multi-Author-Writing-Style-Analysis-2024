In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
And then promise in a followup speech to still pursue paid leave via another avenue less prone to being fucked with by Republicans.
