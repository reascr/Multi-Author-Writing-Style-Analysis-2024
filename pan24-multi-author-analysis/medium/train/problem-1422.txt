This won't go on for two years, the lenhiest battle for Speaker in US history took two months and 133 votes, and that one was right before the Civil War. January 13th is my bet for the latest it will go on. Reason being, that's the day they run out of funding for their own staff and if I know anything about the pampered princesses on Capitol Hill it's that a shockingly large amount of them couldn't get anything done without their staff holding their hands. There's also the fact that, theoretically, they themselves might not get paid. Eventually, even their billionaire sugar daddies will get fed up with it because instability is bad for business. Until then, enjoy the ride.
