Not just Barr. Every miniscule tidbit they alleged got wildly amplified in the right wing media. During the Sussman trial they elicited a single line of testimony that the Clinton campaign approved of telling media sources about a possible digital connection between the trump campaign and a Russian bank. The details of the story (a trump campaign server made thousands of DNS lookups to Alfa Bank then stopped the minute it hit the news, no explanation ever given) was entirely true if not directly incriminating. Sussman also gave this info to the FBI which is what tried for and instantly acquitted. . The OpEd reads like it was written a Trump PR flack and teed up for publication at the exact moment that the testimony was elicited but before the verdict rendered it moot. Not to mention that even if it were true would not remotely justify their conclusions. It reeked of collaboration between Durham and his friendly media.
