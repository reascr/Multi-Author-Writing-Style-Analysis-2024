I wonder if it warded off independents to instead vote for democrats, or if between the primaries and now, the Trump bump just fizzled out and those folks were kinda meh on Kent now.
I think the Independents that decide the majority of elections were just unwilling to go for the extremists, that just kept ramping up their rhetoric even when it was clearly the wrong move. They may not have voted for the Democrat either, but could not make themselves vote (R).

Would it not be better if they won the House also. What I see in general media so far, it seems that "traditionally" the House are won by opposition party during midterms (regardless which party is governing), what interest me is why the incumbent party never manage to win a second term also.
