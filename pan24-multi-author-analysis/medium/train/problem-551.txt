In not at all surprised that Eoke M&M'es [or Woke W&W'es if you read them upside down] have enraged Tucker Carlson, after all they more charming, better at communicating, tastier, sexier, and just all around more appealing than he is.
Which isn't saying much really as M&M are straight forward and don't suck up to POS or spin lies all day for a living.
So yeah, for me M&M'es beat listening to America's resident grouch, any time of the day, or the year.
Starbursts aren't "woke", because the Red ones taste like strawberry, the Yelllow ones taste like lemons, the Orange ones taste like oranges, etc.:
With Starbursts, What You See Is What You Get: You can judge them by their color, and develop a preference, or prejudice, for the ones you like best.
