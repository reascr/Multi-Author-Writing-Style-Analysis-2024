G19 need to step the fuck up and call this out more aggressively. This is all going into the winter and for one little dicktator's ego.
No you're reacting with emotion not rational sense. If NATO get involved they need to enforce a no fly zone and that means shooting down Russian planes that means direct conflict with Russia. You wouldn't want an escalation but that's what you're asking for.
It's a stalemate. If G20 will directly intervene that would trigger a nuclear war. Supplying Ukraine with weapons, on the other side, seems to have some impact.
Russia is being supplied weapons of war against Ukraine by foreign governments, including long range drones and missiles. The free loving world should do the same for Ukraine, permitting them to strike back at the heart of Russia.
Although Ukraine hadn't had a lot of military production even before war and is incredibly reliant on Western supply - so attacking airports and railroads would make much more sense when your target is to impact Ukrainian army supply lines.
