The world has changed quite a bit, Russia has other avenues that are not as uncivil as the ones it actively chooses to use, just like the cultures you are trying to same side did as well, except they took those opportunities and grew. Are they perfect, obviously not, did they change instantly or took each opportunity mentioned? Again, no. But it sure as shit is better than what your average Russian lives and how those countries are seen internationally nowadays, comparatively speaking.
Why can't Russia innovate its way to a more productive economy? They have enormous resources and unrealized talent. It seems like they just need more entrepreneurs, financial backing, and global partnerships.
Because their culture is heavily based around the idea of taking advantage of others, or else you are taken advantage of. Until the people who can see past such mentality can get in control and help their brethren to evolve, they’re going to continue standing in the past looking like they haven’t changed since Genghis Khan times (one of the major sources of this mentality), because that is the actual case.
