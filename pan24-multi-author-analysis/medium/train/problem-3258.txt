Only ever knew one person IRL that had pages pass through their hands and that was the term they used. A few hits of the trimmed off perferoated edges of a sheet was also one of the most visual and transformative trips I ever had (much aside from the visuals could be ascribed to it also being a very transformative time in life moving from manual labor to grad school, as well as a beautiful sunny day off work due to expected rain storms, I still have a sneaky suspicion that really fresh LSD is a lot more visual than older doses though).
A “Bible” is actually a classic hippy term for ten pages of sheets (a “sheet” being 100 hits, typically cut off from one “page” of 900-1,000 hits/doses of LSD.).
Fresher is better. I had a friend that regularly got a few posters to a Bible at a time a few times a month when it was plentiful. First time I met him, I was a little fucked up on pills. Dude sits down next to me, hands me a pencil and a ruler, shows me how big make the hits, then had me put lines on that shit.
