Something tells me the IDF is destroying far more homes and lives than Gaza militants have rockets to fire.
If the IDF would stop kicking Palestinians out of their homes, demolishing homes, and pushing settlements maybe real peace talks could begin.
Terrorizing a population will make them want to fight back any way they can. It's time for the more powerful side to stop the campaign of terror.
2. Why don’t you ask how many homes each side has ATTEMPTED to destroy? Every unaimed rocket launched by Hamas is an attempt to hit Israeli civilians, and they celebrate when they hit Israeli homes. Should Israel not try to stop them just because they are bad at hitting Israeli civilians and Israel is really good at protecting civilians?
It's funny how; a) things in Gaza always fire up when shit is hitting the fan in Iran, and b) that a terrorized populace (ie Israelis) would fight back when terrorized.
Hamas is doing terrible shit and is an indefeasible organization, but when it comes to who is committing more destruction the numbers are not even close. We're comparing apples to atoms.
1. IDF isn’t kicking anyone out of their homes, and certainly not in Gaza, where there isn’t even an Israeli presence.
