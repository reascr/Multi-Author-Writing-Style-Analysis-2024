You fill out a form and pay a fee, in my state it's $5k for the house. From there you collect signatures of registered voters in your district; when you have 120% of the amount you need or when the deadline comes and you have at least 100% of what you need you turn them in. From there, the secretary of state validates the signatures you turned in. Assuming you submitted enough valid signatures, what happens next depends on what you wrote on the form: independents get placed on the election ballot. Party-affiliated candidates get placed on the primary election ballot; each voter will only participate in one of the primary elections. From there it's only about getting enough votes.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
