I don't want you to do anything. I was just trying to point out the absurdity of calling entire states shitholes based largely on an opinion. But I honestly don't care if you agree or not. Keep believing whatever you want. I've been to most of the states with the exception of Alaska and couple of the little ones in New England. I've yet to find one that would deserve to be called a shithole. There are areas of each state that are shitholes but also beautiful places and lovely people. But keep up thinking the way you do. Maybe it'll keep the crowds away and I can enjoy some peace the ne t time I visit.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
