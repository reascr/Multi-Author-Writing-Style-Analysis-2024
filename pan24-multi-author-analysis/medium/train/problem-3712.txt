I don’t think in politics I think of humans as individuals. Anybody can claim to be left or right but at the end of the day you can’t tell me half the people follow one party while another half follows another and can say they’re better than one another. Its straight stupid and it’s a clear red flag of brainwashing by both parties.
Ah yes “both sides” nah I don’t care for this type of “discussion” it’s always the same shit it’s very easy to see who you stand with. Find your personal values and see what lines up best, nothing will ever be exact. The true losers in a conflict are those who don’t pick a side.
The true conflict is with losers who choose to free think? Nah bro I don’t think you know anything about me. I have personal values and it’s not being screwed over by politicians claiming to be for the people. Yeah, BOTH sides. I can’t believe that not obvious to everyone yet.
Canada used to be a kinder gentler United States. What happened? Half of my business was in Canada during the 80's and 90's I loved the culture. What has happened?
