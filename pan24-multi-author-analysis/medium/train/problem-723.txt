"All members of the household are being reminded of the diversity and inclusivity policies which they are required to uphold at all times.".
That's nice. But the issue here I think isn't the lack of awareness of the diversity and inclusivity policy, and perhaps they need to find something to do against systemic racism. The issue is not only the behaviour, but more importantly the mindset and belief from that person they are not doing something fundamentally wrong.
This story came across my twitter feed yesterday, the Buckingham Palace aide was about as ignorant and "not racist" as someone who doesn't use ethnic slurs often is.
The fired aide kept pushing "WHERE ARE YOU REALLY FROM" similar to the way Asians and Latinos are asked in the US.
The questions weren't asked out of curiosity, it was overly aggressive and rude, pure bad faith trying to remind the black woman she is an "other".
Protip - Don't touch anyone's hair without permission, but touching a Black Woman's hair without permission is extraordinarily shitty, disrespectful, and can be considered racist.
