So in nerve damage patients. Hallucinogenics work to ease pain and in some cases numbness/paralyses by firing neurotransmitters to forgotten nerve pathways.
i think nationally it has been legalised medicinally? Or are there a couple of states that are still yet to do it (I straddle between ACT and NSW, so unsure re other state legislation).
“Imagine your brain is like a ski resort. There’s all different levels of slopes but most neurons do the same runs everyday, so neurons don’t carve trails through the backcountry or under the tree runs. When you take a hallucinogenic, it’s like fresh powder on the mountain. The neurons can’t see the trail as clearly, so they feel confident to run a new trail and explore the possibilities. These new trails can link up with old forgotten trails and help other neurons travel down the mountain.”.
I'm sure I've heard that it's legal to grow a couple of plants in the ACT and have a small amount for recreational purposes but you're not allowed to buy or sell it.
