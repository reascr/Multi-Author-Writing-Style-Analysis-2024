I think that’s the hope, because it will be very hard for the SC to block this while allowing the Texas abortion ban operating under similar mechanisms.
They still could, but there isn’t a legitimate legal argument for doing so. And the SC is already on thin ice in terms of legitimacy, so they may not risk the fallout of legislating from the bench on this one.
“Thin ice” lol, they have a dude in the bench who’s wife was intimately involved with an attempted coup on US soil. The ice is thick af people, and it’s not getting thinner with these dumb ass lifetime appointments.
