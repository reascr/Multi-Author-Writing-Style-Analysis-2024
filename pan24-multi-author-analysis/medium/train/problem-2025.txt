Why would the Americans go through that headache when they have cheaper and much safer alternatives if there was a chance of your scenario?
I don’t think NASA would send the Americans with the Russians if they thought they would hold the astronaut captive.
Space collaboration was one thing that went beyond nation’s boundaries ever since the Apollo-Soyuz project. Y’all need to stop making random scenarios up with 0 credible proof when it comes to Russia. People talk shit about Russian and Chinese propaganda and spew the same shit without any credible evidence that they do that to an ASTRONAUT.
Buzhinsky surmised, “Clearly, the West is headed towards an escalation... I think we should also cautiously start to walk down a path of escalation... The West has many vulnerabilities.” Buzhinsky floated his ideas for attacking Americans in retaliation for their alleged involvement in blowing up the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, proposing that Russia attack American pipelines at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the Norwegian Sea.
You’re bringing, yet again, your feelings and assumptions into the table, not past actions nor credible evidence that justifies your viewpoint.
This has nothing to the pipelines, nor are there anything linking to the pipelines, yet you’re spewing another speculative narrative that is yet another speculation or a possible highly likely propaganda.
