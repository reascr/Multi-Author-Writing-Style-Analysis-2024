>In the Czech Republic’s parliamentary system, the presidency carries limited powers, with key executive authority held by the government. But the head of state has a say in the creation of the cabinet, leads the military, picks central bankers and appoints judges.
Trump has shown rich people does not have brain to run country properly so I hope Czech people will vote for retired military general who rose through the rank by proving himself he can lead.
I'm a Czech and I voted for General Pavel. I don't want to jinx it, but at this point, I don't really see a realistic scenario where he loses. The democratic votes were spread across more candidates, especially Danuše Nerudová who gained close to 12%. The only other populist candidate besides Babiš was Bašta with a mere 5%. General Pavel already won the first round and now he will also collect most of the votes belonging to the other democratic candidates, while Babiš will mostly stick to his original voter base. We'll see in two weeks, but my prediction is that General Pavel will win with 55-58% in the second round.
