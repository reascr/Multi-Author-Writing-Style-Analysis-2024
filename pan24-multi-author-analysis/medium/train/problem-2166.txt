Let me get this straight. A WNBA player goes to Russia with HashOil in a vape pen. An illegal substance. Gets convicted for violating the law and then some assclown in the state department says yeah trading a man who puts our citizens, aircraft, and military at risk is a great trade to get her out of prison. Who negotiated this? This is the problem with our country, we are more worried about the way this looks, then safety and security for all. What a bunch of crap. How many people will now die because of this exchange?
I’m a huge pothead, (check my profile) I’m actually pretty angry about this. She should have known better, she did commit a crime even if it was recently legalized in whatever state she lives in. So now this guy can go back to dealing arms that will take lives and plotting terror attacks, but hey, at least we can have our fucking female basketball player back.
The thing that bothers me is that it’s still federally illegal here so why go to these lenhs to free her? Are they gonna lock her up here? Would the same happen to me?
