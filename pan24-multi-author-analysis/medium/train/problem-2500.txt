It's still Russian troops doing it so they will still attack anything belonging to Ukraine. It's not like the put out a Facebook ad for this.
How dumb would a Russian soldier have to be to think they'd actually get paid this bounty. I'm sure they'll eventually take out some tanks or and get some photos, but a higher up would pay will pay it to a friendly subordinate who'll kick back the majority.
They're trying to incentivize people to take out the new tanks because they're not sure how to deal with them effectively, so they want their troops to do whatever they can to take them out. If they get 12 reports of destroyed tanks and 9 of them were killed in the same, or similar, fashion then they will start telling all their troops to use that method to deal with them.
Sergeant kills private, reports destroyed tank to Lieutenant. Lieutenant kills Sergeant, reports kill to General. General kills Lieutenant, getting the bounty. Proud Russian General on the front line destroying 100 by hand.
"Excellent job, comrade. Go home and let the less competent people take over from here. Wait a sec, now that we have inspected the tank, it's not destroyed by our definition. Forget what I said, give back the medal I just gave you and go back to the frontline to try again.".
