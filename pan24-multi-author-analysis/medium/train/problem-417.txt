In my country, any professor is tenured. That puts some weight on the scale. Other countries have assistent and associate professors, which give a huge inflation on the title of professor. Because there’s a lot of dumb fucks teaching these days that fail to achieve the academic rigor you’d expect from a “professor”.
Because they are professors, not teachers. A good researcher does not necessarily make a good teacher. It's just a compromise because finding someone that has dedicated a lifetime in a field and has a teaching degree is pretty rare.
College professors don’t get “teaching degrees”. If you want to teach something at the collegiate level, you generally need some type of graduate degree in whatever you’re going to teach. The degrees centered around teaching are generally for elementary-high school level.
Those who teach usually spent 20 years doing, when you talk academia. Which is why they are sometimes bad teacher: they just aren't teachers.
It's peak whiny highschool kid to say that teachers are all people to bad to do things. What I've learned in the 6 years since uni, it's that throughout school the teacher weren't actually that bad. I was just primed to think they were.
It is always about money. Not about building a better country. Not about helping the 99 % create a stronger economy, life, world.
