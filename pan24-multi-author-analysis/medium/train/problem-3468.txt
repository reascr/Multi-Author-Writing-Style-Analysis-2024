I like how this headline makes it sound like it’s a fucking game show where they dump the 1B in a random ass field and let all the homeless people fight to the death over it.
The media does a terrible job reporting on homelessness in general. Most of the time it treats all homeless as a monolith with identical needs and obvious solutions that only require money. It’s a really hard problem to solve because it’s actually many problems, some with only long-term and upstream solutions and others that are short-term and low ROI.
