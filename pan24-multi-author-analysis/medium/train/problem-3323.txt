Among other things. It's also about strenhening trade with the most important customer base for Ukrainian crops.
Opening the door for accepting migrant workers might be a thing too. Something Ukraine will have a desperate need for after the war in order to rebuild, among with other benefits.
Do you know what was done to USSR citizens who lived in Africa? Read it up, whoever white did not want to give up business was dead. I have a Ukrainian friend, her husband was found dead inside of his shop.
I give it ten years before Africa will be begging for help to rid them of russians, that is if russian even exists in the next few years.
Africa needs to see what a clusterfuck it is going to be with russians in there countries, damn in russia there is a conflict in the military against various groups from different parts of russia, imagine the clusterfuck of russians armed to the teeth in African countries.
Russia will continue to exist, if only because it is too big of a project to take over(possibly even for the entire developed world). Africa isn't really in a good place having to choose between former imperialists(who may or may not have changed their attitudes toward African people) and new imperialists.
My point was that former Imperialism while not good built up all the countries they took over, Russia is going to destroy them and will not fund any infrastructure building even as they destroy it.
