There is a court order to not build the turbines. Energy company wants to ignore the court order. Thunberg and court are on the same side in this.
The concession to build the park was given in 2010 by NVE. This was during the Stoltenberg goverment(Workersparty/Arbeiderpartiet). So blaming the whole "mess" on "the last goverment" is incorrect. Under the Solberg goverments(Right/Høyre); Building started in 2015 and the park was fully operational in 2020.
So the current goverment is stuck cleaning up the mess made by their own political party in 2010. Not "The last goverment".
The courts came to the verdict 11th of october 2021. The Støre goverment(Workersparty/Arbeiderpartiet) went into power 14th of october 2021. Doubt the Solberg had time to fix anything in the 3 days before transition of power.
>free roaming reindeers should have been corected to barn deers. no more payout for loss from goverment, cause its crazy, ourund here they feed the deers on the traintraks! insane but true.
The reindeer are free roaming. There are no barns. The closest you get is some fenced areas they will herd the reindeer in during slaughter season.
The wind turbines put a bunch of micro and nano plastic along with other nasty pollution into the environment. It ends up in reindeers, fish, plants, water, etc.
This is a way of life for the Sami people. They rely on reindeer herding as a matter of survival. The energy company wants to take land from an ethnic minority group to further their own profits.
