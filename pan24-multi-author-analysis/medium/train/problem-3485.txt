I get that Ukrainian news is hyper partisan and they're trying their best to shame other countries. But 95 million dollars of oil in 2 months at the going rate of oil ($90 per barrel) is 1 million barrels. The UK uses around 1.24 million barrels of oil PER DAY.
It is, the cut off date is soon. Some other nations are filling storage tanks also and then will use that while moving on to new sources. The bad news for Russia is many of these buyers will not buy from them again for a long time, even if sanctions someday end.
I can't speak definitively to this case but oil contracts are purchased months ahead of time. Oil contracts are also not always directly purchased. One can go into the market for a certain amount of oil futures delivery from another party. That party can source the oil delivery from Russia - it isn't always clear what the source is either at the time the contract is purchased or when the contract is delivered.
Bear in mind although June-July sounds like enough time to scrutinize every single contract, that actually isn't the case. The EU announced the embargo on Russian oil on June 3rd not on February 24th.
Yeah esp when all of it is probably going right into Oligarchs pockets. There's a reason their own military doesn't have fuel and supplies. They don't ever see the money.
