This is pretty weak even by the standards of Lawrence Tribe. I think he’s trying to make the argument that because Ginni Thomas used a version of the Independent State Legislature theory when encouraging people in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin to throw out presidential election results, it means she somehow has a legal interest in a case where the North Carolina legislature contends that the ISL theory prevents a state court from throwing out a gerrymandered congressional map and drawing its own congressional map. But Ginni Thomas has nothing to do with this case, and hasn’t had any involvement with this case.
