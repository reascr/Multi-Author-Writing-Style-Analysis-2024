Mexican here, this is the context: Plan B arose as a whim of the President after the failure to pass the Electoral Reform which was intended to make the Electoral Institute, broadly speaking, less autonomous and that the government could be more involved in it.
The government claims that the intention of the reform is to "spend less" because "in the neoliberal period, a lot was spent and politicians were served as if they were kings" which is misleading, the government has even provided comparisons with other Electoral Institutes around the world but it is misleading since our electoral institute not only counts votes, but it is also in charge of giving official identifications when you are in legal age in México (credential which you can vote with it) and it is also the autonomous institute that judges electoral crimes.
Among all the things proposed in the reform there is only one good thing: to give less money to political parties (a lot of money is allocated from the treasury since there are about 8 different Mexican political parties, and frankly, it's silly to give money to all of them when only 2 or 3 are popular in every election), however, this is the fallacious argument used by the government and through their bots in social networks: "Are you opposed to the reform? It is because you are classist, you oppose that politicians stop receiving money, surely some relative of yours benefits from this", when in fact we criticize more aspects of such reform, not only that particular aspect.
He learned a lot from Cuba’s current government, especially the way he labels anyone who protests as corrupt. Next week they’ll be labeled CIA agents and terrorists.
