Again, as an option it'd be great. With full drug legalization, I'd hope and expect harm reduction businesses to start up to offer safe environments. But I don't see any reason the government mandating this option is any better than the government staying out of people's consumption habits. If I'm at a party and want a line of coke, why should I have to leave, go to the hospital, wait, get my fix, and then...drive back to the party? Unless I'm not allowed to leave until I'm sober, in which case the only option is to break the law doing lines in the bathroom.
Didn’t think the China Covid lockdowns were that bad, this story is making me rethink that train of thought.
Wow that story hits a bit too close to home. Sometimes I really take for granted what I have (job, roof over head, car, US citizen since birth) and I forget my hardships pale in comparison to other people’s life or death struggles.
I was honestly anticipating some truly unexpected group to be mentioned but no, it's just Nicaraguans, possibly the most expected migrant group, right next to Venezuelans, Hondurans, and Salvadorans.
