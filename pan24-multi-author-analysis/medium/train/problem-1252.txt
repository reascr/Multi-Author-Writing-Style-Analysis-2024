At best they're ending up with a single digit majority of a fractured caucus that wants to go half for full on fascism and the other half for the days of reagan-style fascism where the culture wars were just cover for more tax breaks. Meanwhile, the democrats are fresh off a midterm where they held and even took some seats they weren't supposed to. The number may be against them, but they will have the solidarity that the other side wont, so if anything gets done at all, its because a few frightened bootlickers try to hold on to their seats in 24 and vote with dems to pass mandatory legislation. I don't see the non crazies seeing a government shutdown as a positive this time.
