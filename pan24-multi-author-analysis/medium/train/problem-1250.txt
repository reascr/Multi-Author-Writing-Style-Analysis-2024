They did and they were made in Ukraine. Even their ships and tanks were made in Ukraine. Russia doesn’t have the brain power (smart ones fled) any longer or the man power to make anything useful plus they pissed off anyone that could help them. China is not Russia’s friend or they would be supplying them weapons instead of North Korea and Iran. They are scrapping the barrel now using Syrian forces who have just been through a decade of war. Russia got played by everyone thinking they were an advanced military while India and China watched them in real time get smashed to bits and taken off of the list of forces they needed to worry about. Where would they get advanced chips from?
Kind of a nothing burger article. Russia is one of, if not the largest supplier of arms to Algeria. Algeria isn’t suddenly bucking tradition and going with Russia…. They’re sticking with consistency. Because if anything, we’ve seen that Russian advanced arms translates to yet another T-72 chassis with some pilfered French thermals crammed in the commander’s seat next to the ammo carousel in the turret ring.
At first I was afraid and thought ahh crap this is the how ww3 is gonna start with Russia arming nations to fight as fodder but then it hit me that Russia doesn’t even have advanced weaponry to arm its own troops in a war it started and now I’m not afraid anymore.
