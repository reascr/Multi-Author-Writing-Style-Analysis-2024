I like the theory that the rookie SS guy handling the brand new (at the time) M16 was so startled by LHO's shots that he tripped and fell and accidentally discharged the rifle which shot JFK in the head and killed him.
Sad thing is, society's dumdums will look at this like the government is still covering for someone instead of realizing it is probably more for medical or security concerns. Some people don't grasp the government isn't as "evil" as they want to think. This goes for both sides. Most of the reason the left and right don't get along is media manipulation to a huge degree across the board. The JFK assassination was a more than just a single terrible event in our country's history. It spawned all kinds of conspiracy theories. If this does turn out to be anything more than what is already known (by that I mean more than one shooter and Oswald as a patsy type stuff) then I can admit when I'm wrong.
u/adorsai I had a similar problem with a headline, it’s some Reddit thing. Turns out that mess of symbols is just ‘, so if you replace it then Reddit still counts that as using the original title.
