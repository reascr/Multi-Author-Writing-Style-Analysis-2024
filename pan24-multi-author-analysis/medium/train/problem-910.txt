So yeah, if you actually care about America and don’t want to see it fall into fascism (as Republican policies are clearly trying to do,) then voting Democratic is indeed the only choice. That doesn’t make Democrats perfect, but JHFC at least they’re not insane and are actually doing some good for this country instead of constantly trying to tear it apart.
The Democratic Party has gotten more progressive since the days of Bill Clinton. That’s a good thing. Meanwhile, the Republican Party has become more extremist and downright stupid. Republican policies and rhetoric are centered around hurting people while only helping the rich and corporations.
