I hate to break it to you, but Trump was the empowering agent that let these demagogues know "it's okay" to cry "fake news" (seriously both Netanyahu and Bolsonaro have done that) and the current Insurrectionist party 'running' the House of Representatives in the United States certainly has not even pretended to give a damn about rule of law considering the current Speaker of the House (at least for this week) also voted against certifying the results of a democratic and fair election.
However, as the poster above noted some leftwing parties refused to merge and some even split, while a lot of traditionally leftwing voters strategically voted for Lapid's center party, causing some parties to not make it past the threshold and all the votes they got to be wasted, giving the pro-Netanyahu bloc a significant advantage.
To add to that, in the most recent elections the vote count was split almost exactly between the pro-Netanyahu and anti-Natanyahu count. Had all the "anti" votes been counted Netanyahu would not have been able to form a coalition.
