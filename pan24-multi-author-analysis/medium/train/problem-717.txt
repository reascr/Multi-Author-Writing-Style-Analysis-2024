I genuinely feel sorry for the North Korean peasants (let's face it they aren't citizens they're peasants, although if someone wants to re educate me on that feel free!) Remember a few years back when one or 2 Soldiers managed to get to South Korea and they were malnourished and full of lice. If that's the general state of the "Million Man Army" I'd hate to see the nick of the civilians. Not to mention they have a fat wee dick in charge of them, imagine that, you're starving and not sure when you next get a slice of bread and that fat little cunt tells you that you can't get his style of haircut and that he hits hole in ones that travel round the world first(that latter is a bit of hyperbole but there was a hole in 1 claim at one point but am too lazy to look it up lol).
Plus what they use would be considered "subpar" even by North Vietnam in 1960s, majority of conspricts are just forced labour for the state without any training and economy on life support don't sound like something being able to keep all that tanks/planes/ships/trucks going.
