Three Belarusians, who tried to prevent the transportation of military equipment to Ukraine in the first days of the Russian invasion, have been sentenced to prison terms of 21-23 years.
Details: According to the explanation by the Investigative Committee of Belarus, Oleg Molchanov, Dmitrii Ravich and Denis Dikun set fire to the relay cabinet on the Zherd-Ostankovichi station on the railway road leading to Ukraine on 28 February, the fifth day of the full-scale war. As a result of their actions, the traffic lights and arrows on this section of the road were disabled for some time.
The court sentenced Molchanov to 21 years of imprisonment, Ravich to 22 years, Dikun to 23 years. They were also fined 4,800 Belarusian rubles each and the property found during the searches was confiscated.
Is there some way to donate to these brave heroes to pay for their fines and other financial problems they are facing? These men should be rewarded for doing what their government is too scared/corrupt/immoral to do.
