This is way pettier a crime than Pruitt or Carson or Kushner level theft and gritfting, but it's from someone we believed was qualified and directly and immediately stealing from someone directly rather than them largely robbing groups and looting from the public. Yet, here it is, still front page. It's far more likely for Sam or any other Biden appointee to have their crimes blow up here if they happen, since there's less fellow cons to spread up the news cycle. That said, hope those thieves from the Trump admin see at least as much consequence as I want Brinton to get.
