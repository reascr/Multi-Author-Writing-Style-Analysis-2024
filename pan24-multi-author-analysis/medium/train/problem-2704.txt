It seems that Orban had a more liberal vision for Hungary during his first term in power from 1998 to 2002, but once he regained it in 2010 that power corrupted him.
The Communist-led government was deemed inflexible to serious reform and refused to relinquish power for years. Orban, Fidesz, and many opposed it only years later to become an inflexible government that now tilts the voting scales because it wants to remain in power.
Which is probably the point he wants hungry to be out of the EU so heâ€™s free to set up a mini dictatorship, but he also wants it to not be his fault. as it will cost an economic disaster.
The real upcoming problem is what happens when he leaves the stage. People who hold onto power like this stay until they die usually (because they are legally vulnerable if ousted) but since they don't leave, they also don't foster a successor either. Hungary is about to have a power vacuum in the next decade or so.
Tho even bigger cities tend towards fidezs which is really concerning. Hopefully boomers die out soon.
