We get so many Afghan refugees at the school I teach at. They are such a pleasure to teach and really care about their education, especially the girls. I have this one 1st grader who is only the size of a 4 year old due to malnutrition. Never been to school and really acts like a preschooler, but she is making miles of progress every week. It's so sad that she had to leave her home to have such basic things. The older kids tell me how much they miss home and how hard it is to adjust. They are working with refugee agencies to get them settled and provide therapy, but damn, I thought my heart had turned cold after 16 years of urban teaching, but these kids are truly inspiring. They have transformed our class environment and the other kids are better students seeing these kids bust their asses. We should be welcoming more if we can.
Tbh, this is the future that many Americans who live outside of urban areas want, they just don't get the chance here. I lived in rural deep south for over 20 years coming up, many of them would absolutely have kept the "women-folk" from educating themselves and even working a job outside of the home, if they had that ability.
