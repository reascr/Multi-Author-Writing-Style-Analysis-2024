Republicans are great at rewriting history. We need to be good at not letting them do it this time. It still disgusts me how this same group of assholes defended Bush's wars for years and then had the nerve to criticize democrats for any use of the military whatsoever as if they were suddenly the anti-war party. Then the flip flopped again and criticized everything about the Afghanistan pull-out. No, they don't get to do it this time. You guys made excuses for admission to sexual assault before he was even elected. You guys made excuses for Charlottesville, and you pointed fingers over the human rights violations at the border while allowing it to go on and only worsened, you defending his blatant out in the open corruption over and over. You're not getting away with it this time.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
