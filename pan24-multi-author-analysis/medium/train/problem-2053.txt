The current reporting sounds like DoJ is looking at RICO cases against Trump, and at a minimum conspiracy to defraud Congress. Hard to prove, lots of evidence needed to get confidence in an ironclad prosecution.
No, everyone gets it and the threats it implies. Which is why someone in a position of power should have shut him down long ago..I guess when a full 1/3 of congress is complicit in the crime, shutting him down is hard to do.

If Trump gets off with no consequence, America is doomed. He is an abject traitor guilty of so many egregious crimes and yet nothing has come of it.
IIRC Hitler got off even though some officials were suspicious and then he got into power and the rest is history.
