UK citizens vote to explore leaving the EU with a tiny majority in a non-binding referendum and the Tories demand that the people's will be respected with no looking back.
Scotland votes with an overwhelming majority to pass legislation protecting and aiding trans people but now the Tories think democracy has gone too far.
The Scottish vote was a vote restricted to parliamentarians, in which the party whip wasn't lifted for both SNP and Labour. You can't compare the two.
This Bill was passed with 86 for, 39 against with 4 that didn’t vote. It had majority support from the SNP, Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Green Party. The only party against were the Conservatives, though some Conservatives did vote for. This was not an SNP only piece of legislation.
And seeing as how the party whip wasn't lifted for both SNP and Labour, the fact that 11 MPs voted against this bill is a significant rebellion against the ruling party and Sturgeon.
It passed with 69% approval of MPs participating with the only real opposition being Tories. That’s not a minority at all. It’s Tories being right wing transphobes.
