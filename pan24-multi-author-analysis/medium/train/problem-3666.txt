Yes, of course there are still slaves but most countries deem it illegal. You only have to look at the middle east to see slavery accepted and alive. How did Qatar build the World cup facilities?
Your family could have chosen not to get into that market. Someone else could have done it, but they chose to for their own gain. Everyone has a choice. So, no, I do not have it backwards. Africans could have told Europeans to fuck off, instead they chose to enslave other Africans to make money. They chose not to act ethically. This is a discussion of ethics, not capitalistic market factors.
Yeah, seems weird to blame the customer more than the business owners on this one. Yes, Europeans bought/trafficked many slaves. But they purchased them from African slave traders almost exclusively.
Still not blaming the right people: the ones who chose to enslave the individuals and sell them to Europeans. Yeah, Europeans bought available products. But if there were no slavers selling there would have been nothing to buy. Just like puppy mills, the breeders are the biggest part of thr problem.
I'm not saying the customer is without blame, because they are the ones sustaining the demand/industry, but the majority of the blame should be placed on the supplier. That's why drug dealers get a harsher sentence than the drug users.
