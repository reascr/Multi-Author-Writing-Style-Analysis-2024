Well he doesn't have control over the company or their content they release even though he said that. Basically and I might be wrong so please correct me if so. Is that Disney back in the day made a deal with Florida that when they develop the Orlando area there wasn't jack shit there. And they also knew people eventually would pack in and become what Disney World is today in Orlando. So Disney Basically said we will take care of all (normally state funded services) if you let us buy and develop all this land. Everything went well and smoothly for like since they founded Disney in Florida until Dick head got his feelings hurt by Disney going against some of his fucked views on about everything. So Dick head then decided to go head to head with Disney. I'm honestly not a huge fan of huge corporations like Disney but this one time......I hope they nail his ass to a fucking cross.
