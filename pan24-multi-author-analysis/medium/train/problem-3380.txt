A 9 seat majority for Republicans means that only 5 need to defect (2% of Republicans), to get Dem bills passed. If you think about it, the filibuster in the Senate is a substantially higher burden to overcome. If a bill starts in the Senate, and gets passed, then that means it got 9 Republican senators (about 20% of the Republican delegation), so it doesn't seem too unlikely that it'd pass in the House.
Additionally, Dems now have an easier time with nominations in the Senate. 51 is a lot stronger than 50. Individual House Republicans may be able to exert some influence on that in return for legislative concessions. This will be especially important for certain bills that can go through reconciliation.
This will be a very interesting House session. I know this sounds naiively hopeful, but I expect to see real bipartisanship.
