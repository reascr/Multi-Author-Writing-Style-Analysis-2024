And even if China manages to knock out the air defenses, what is going to stop new air defenses arriving overnight? China is going to have to put on the greatest and most precise missile display ever and then follow it up with an equally Amazing air campaign, naval campaign, and finally an invasion. All the while keeping up with a Logistics train that has never been seen before on this planet. Taiwan has 4000+ stinger missiles in addition to other varieties. An invasion through the air just isn't practical when 1 guy with a stinger can kill hundreds in a transport plane. Without full air supremacy, you can't stop resupply from the USA. To top it off, you now have to invade an island that has placed thousands of mines in the water on the coast and the entire beach. It also has tons of artillery trained precisely on the area an invasion force needs to land. All the while, your invasion ships will be under fire from artillery and anti-ship missiles. Once you land, you get to deal with Snipers and Tanks and other weapons that have been buried into the ground.
I think the USâ€™s long game in Ukraine is to get China to sink themselves. They lose a lot of face by doing this, and all their trading partners are aware.
