Y'all out here acting like the Republicans are some sort of mega geniuses at messaging. They're not. It's just that their "base" is just much more easily manipulated. They are far more religious, and thus very used to being told "Just believe me" and they just fall in line and believe. Having faith in something without requiring evidence is hard wired into their systems, so it isn't too big of a stretch for a Republican politician to say "The election was stolen" and they just say "Yeah okay". Their lack of critical thinking ability or need for evidence makes them very easy to control.
