Any time anyone from either party introduces legislation on either abortion, gun rights, anything to do with gender identity, or immigration itâ€™s controversial to one side or the other.
Democrats harshest gun bills are pretty much what Ronald Reagan was speaking for. Democrats most controversial gender bills give them equal rights. And yes, we know Republicans don't understand science and think abortion is somehow murder, but that doesn't make it controversial, it just makes them dumb.
