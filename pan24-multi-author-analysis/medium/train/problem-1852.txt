Given their home-brewed vaccine is much less effective than the mRNA versions we have here in the west.
And China not willing to prostrate itself to acquire the western vaccine. It's only logical their vaccination status shouldn't count.
Also, which country would trust a vaccination passport from China? I can see that being forged and paid for.
I think you're not placing the risk correctly. If you're vaccinated with mrna vax any American varients are going to be much more dangerous. Because any new varients in china are not going to evolve to escape mrna vax antibodies. In a weird sense, it's not bad news that chiba relies on their own vax. Mrna vaccines have already seen a fairly significant drop in effectiveness with omicron sub varients.
They rarely do anymore, but they probably will start forcing people coming from China to do all of the things they where doing in lock down and even make them get the vaccine if they font have one or force them to get back on planes and ho back to China.
With how fast this new variant is spreading and how dangerous it us they probably will start stopping anyone coming in from China and make them quarantine/ get tested and/ or even will likely tell them they have to get the vaccine if they want to be allowed into the country or force them back onto planes to go right back to China if they refuse.
