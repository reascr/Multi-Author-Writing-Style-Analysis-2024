It's possible everything is 100% honest and above board. But it's also quite possible that the tax returns follow the letter of the law in how the paperwork is put together and how deductions are claimed, but those numbers don't accurately reflect reality. Given the high profile of this particular taxpayer, his claims of complete honesty and perfection, balanced by his public track record of arguing, litigating, and delaying to avoid actually being held to account on his claim of honesty and perfection, one would think the IRS would at least check that there is even any paperwork at all to support the claimed losses, deductions and donations, but right now it's not even clear they've gotten that far for any tax year within the current release. Which suggests again, either a politically-manipulated, or chronically weakened tax office (or both).
Made me think of all the times Trump fucked up thr pronunciation of a word in a speech and then tried to cover it up by pronouncing the word correctly and then purposely repeating the mispronunciation in a bizarre attempt to make it seem like it was intentional the first time.
