I got to watch in real time as one of my ex coworkers balked at masks, and talked about how Covid isn’t real, then Covid was real, but just a flu, and masks don’t work anyways. Then it turned to “only people who are already weak are dying, they should just wear masks themselves, and no one else should have to”. Then he, a fairly healthy 30 year old father of a small child got hospitalized with Covid (but not before coming to work without telling anyone he had it, and trying to go on a work trip with us). He got better, but man it absolutely destroyed him, and got one of my other coworkers that was in the truck with him pretty good, but not hospitalization good. After that he took it pretty serious for about two months, and then slowly went back to “pfft, COVID’s nothing I got it, and it barely did anything Basically the flu, idk what everyone’s so worked up about”. Even if you mention how messed up he got, he’ll be like “naw, everyone was just blowing it way out of proportion”.
You know what I'd do if that started happening around me? Start listening to the "extremists" that are saying we need to kill the invaders and likely join them.
