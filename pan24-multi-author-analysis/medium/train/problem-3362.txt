Utah voted and has medical weed dispensaries as of last year, utah also has state liquor stores, similar to the south, they used to have pisswater % for beer but they've been voting to bring it more in like with standard commercial beers now if I'm remembering correctly. It's definitely heavily religious but Utahs conservatism has some distinct differences when compared to normal conservatism in the US, it probably helps their flavor of religion allows the prophet to get regular patch updates to their belief system direct from god, and I'm not trying to downplay the long history of racism, sexism, and LGBTQ rights issues in Utah, but those issues also exist everywhere, and for how heavily religious they are, they have surprisingly made more progress than anyone would give them credit for.
The President can initiate a process to descedule a substance, but that requires very specific and complicated follow up actions, research and hearings by the AG and the heads of several other Federal agencies who all have to agree weed is harmless and should be descheduled based on known scientific research.
