I would be interested in asking for your perspective on globalization of supply chains. There are definitely drawbacks.
The economies of the developed nations of the world are deeply interconnected. So yes, cutting each other off with effective sanctions would be incredibly painful and lead to a global recession spanning several years. At the same point, is short term economic pain worth securing European security for the next generation, and continuing this incredible experiment of trying to cooperate globally to gain more through trade, versus killing each other to gain more.
Countries that rely on stable global supply chains (IE, most developed nations) will get economically screwed over anyway if you upend the current global peace. Why would you invest in India, or SE Asia, if they could get invaded at any time with little/no repercussions?
Xi does not want to trade China's biggest export market for cooperating with what's left of Russia. Even Putin should understand this (but obviously not).
