Transistria is basically a glorified russian military base, just like Abhasia, Osetia, DNR and LNR. "Wow, suddenly we decided that we want to be separated from the country and become our own thing, while allowing russian soldiers to "keep us secure". The same trick, time and time again.
I often wonder what will become of Transnistria when all of this is done with. They're going to find themselves sandwiched between two people with enough motivation to end the nonsense once Ukraine's dust settles.
Oh yeah, the second Transistria tries to attack Moldova, that former Soviet state is gonna be gone. With Ukraineâ€™s new NATO gear all Molvoda needs to do is to set up the celebrations once Ukraine make it to their side.
You can do it via legislation, except the opposition Communist Party (PCRM) has always had enough votes to prevent it.
The alternative, a referendum, needs >50% to pass, but it needs >33% of the country to vote to be valid. Previous amendment attempts have failed due to boycotts by the PCRM to reduce turnout below 33%.
