"A B.C. man who stabbed his wife in the back was acquitted of aggravated assault after a judge found he was likely to have been "effectively asleep" at the time.
Jean-Luc Charles Perignon admitted to stabbing his wife Debra with a kitchen knife at their home on the Sunshine Coast in 2017. The B.C. Supreme Court ruling that he was not guilty wasÂ posted online Wednesday.
"Such a defence will rarely succeed. The courts are justifiably reluctant to acquit on that ground due to policy concerns about the feignability of such a condition and the need to maintain respect for the administration of justice. Because the law assumes that, in general, people act voluntarily and are responsible for their actions, Mr. Perignon bears a heavy burden to demonstrate that the ordinary presumption should not apply here.".
i would throw things at my roomie. things that i had specifically told myself to mention to him that i had bought. first a popsicle, then a box of cheeze-its, and then a 9v battery. all different instance, and the last one he caught, cause he heard me stumbling again and was expecting it.
"He claims that he was in a state of automatism, unassociated with any mental disorder, as a result of having consumed a cocktail of prescription drugs and alcohol prior to the incident," he wrote.
As I recall, drunk drivers are still responsible for anyone they kill as a result of their actions, regardless of how drunk they were. Not really understanding why the same isn't true here.
the distinction being, that he was AT FUCKING HOME, and the marriage didnt have any issues beforehand. if he was like me when i sleptwalked CAUSE OF MEDICATION, he prolly went to lie down to sleep things off, then got back up in a blacked out, sleepwalking state.
So a person who gets blackout drunk isn't responsible for the decisions they make? They're also blacked out and unable to make rational decisions. Like the decision of whether to drive or not, for example.
