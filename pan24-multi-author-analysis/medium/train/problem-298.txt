As the article states, actually seceding would have slim to no chance (with slim just leaving town as the old saying goes), but being San Berdoo which is pretty mixed (and not, say, Shasta county), think this is some significant local opposition to the more progressive leanings of the California legislature.
What’s not being said is some of the growing opposition will probably get funded by ex-Trump aide Stephen Miller’s legal offense funds; that little instigator being from Santa Monica .. so you know California progressives are in his crosshairs. He’s actually had success in crying reverse discrimination, so I wouldn’t poopoo this movement entirely.
There’s various types in every Californian and I’d say American city. Part is whether the policies are popular.. or not.
That said with the way money goes through politics, there can be some strange bedfellows in politics…to go further than the original saying. I’m not convinced even in Los Angeles we’ve seen the last of, for instance, the councilmembers caught on tape, though 2 of the 3 are out of official office (1 resigned, the other had lost anyways before said tape was an issue).
