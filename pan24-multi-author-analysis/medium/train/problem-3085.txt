There. Is. No. Cognitive. Decline. He has a side effect called speech aphasia. His brain is still working exactly as it was except for auditory processing. The only reason it looked “bad” was because the “debate” was a format that favored someone like Dr Oz who has honed his tv speaking skills for decades and yet he still didn’t trounce fetterman according to numerous polls. The debate was literally a 60 second sound byte answer and 15-30 second response. Fetterman has always struggled with public speaking and especially at the debates. Same Dems that couldn’t wait to run clutching their pearls to the press that his performance against Pz was 100 also said his debate performances in the primary would end his campaign. Both times they were wrong.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
