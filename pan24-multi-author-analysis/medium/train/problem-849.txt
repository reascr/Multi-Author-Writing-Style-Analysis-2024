Every NATO country, applicant, and ally should end diplomatic relations with Russia, simultaneously. We can all just expel their entire foreign ministry staff of all levels. It would hurt their information warfare success for sure.
Putin's allies are active all over the world. This is literally his last hurrah, it's his ass on the line. He'll do anything that might help him turn this around and actually survive the next few years. His literal life very likely hangs on the outcome of the war, and like most people, I think he likes being alive.
Dude was literally contemplating nukes, before papa Xi told him it was a no-no. Probably still thinking about it, even though it'd just be a step closer to his suicide.
Last time Australia tried to invade and occupy the proud r-EMU-blic, they suffered a h-EMU-liating defeat.
Five Eyes (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) is arguably a tighter alliance than NATO. NATO the US has to wine and dine to get what it wants, FVEY the US says "we're going this way" and the rest of us tip that hat and say "yes guvnah I'll bring the gun". If NATO is the western whities group chat, FVEY is the sub-group-chat of western whities who speak English.
