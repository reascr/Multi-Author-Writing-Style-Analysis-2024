I feel like there’s a non-zero chance of Trump judges striking down the debt forgiveness and then Biden saying “eff it, the payment pause just continues as long as you keep me in office”, especially given how clutch under 30s were for Biden in this election.
There’s no credible way for the courts to strike down a pause now after it’s been going on for almost three years and two presidents, though they may try.
Which would only further the spiral of deligitimizing the court in the eyes of the younger generations after Dobbs.
Biden’s forgiveness plan may well end up the best option political conservatives on student loans have.
While I am heartbroken over this decision, I do believe Joe will simply extend the pause until the courts officially yeet the plan or let it go through.
