I'm not arguing against you, but you do have to consider that with millions and millions of mobilized Russians facing the truly horrific fight on the eastern front, less than 5% of your army turning and fleeing regardless of how effective your army is, is both understandable and numerically significant. I understand that it was not an even spread but the Russian army at it's peak during WW2 was over 10 million men and women.
The Soviets only survived WWII because they were propped up by western production. Must be terrifying for the Neo-Soviets to see that production turned against them.
It really makes one rethink the talking point of Russians giving their blood for the WWII effort. As in how much of that Soviet blood was unnecessarily spilt by poor Russian tactics like weâ€™re seeing now? The Allies certainly still needed the Soviet Union though.
Nazis and commies killing each other was the plan. After that for a couple of decades the Soviets had ZERO interest in wars.
It was the ideal scenario for the West. They did provide the blood, but they prefered that to an humilliating peace with serfdom to Nazi Germany.
