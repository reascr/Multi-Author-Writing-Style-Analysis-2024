But at least we know, with Musk at the helm, he will do everything in his power to stop the Chinese government from using Twitter bots to subvert the narrative on this critical political issue... /s.
In between rants about Apple yesterday, Musk admitted Twitter was being swamped by bots, and (one of) the processes/algorithms used to stop them broke under the load.
Take a peek at his Twitter replies sometime. Half the comments are fuckboys simping for him and the other half are scam bots with the same giveaway link.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
