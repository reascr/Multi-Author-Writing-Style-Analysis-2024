Fair, but if I start stumbling my explanation and someone else could explain it better, I wouldn't be upset. Now if the guy comes back and tells me I misunderstood him and I got what he was saying wrong, fair is fair, my mistake. However his intention is very clear in his comment, so I am confident that I got to what he was trying to get at.
what does his race have to do with this? mate some of you people are just as bad as the people you criticize.
We get it, you're a narcissist and you think you're better than a mayor when you're just some random person that doesn't even stand behind your real name and identity.
He is not saying it is an excuse, what he is trying to get at is don't read this as a commentary/reflection on Oregon leadership. Both political parties have a tendency to believe that anyone who is a leader of either party reflects the values and attitudes of the whole party, especially when it fits a narrative that the other side is ALL "crazy" or "rapists". Again, he wasn't excusing it, he just didn't want extreme assumptions to be made.
