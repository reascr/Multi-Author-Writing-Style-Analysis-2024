I always thought that district was for prostitution and the rest of the touristic area was for weed, never really saw people smoking while looking for sex workers there.
Edit: seems itâ€™s in the entire inner city tho. Just means the coffee shops will move to the edge, honestly.
It isn't, Amsterdam loses money on tourism... The amount of money spent on police required to keep them in check and the amount of damages the tourists cause doesn't even get covered by what Amsterdam 'earns' on tourism. Also almost all employees of restaurants and whatnot in the city centre are people with work visas, most money doesn't even end up in Amsterdam. There's Dutch articles on this if you want a source, couldn't find an English one sorry.
The first articles I found indicate the opposite, for example this one in nltimes, which refers to research of an institute associated with the University of Amsterdam.
To me, this is also intuitive, as tourism is usually a profitable industry (people are willing to pay high prices for mediocre products, just because it is in some special place). The trade offs are usually rather the destruction of nature for said profits, or in this case, stoners in every street.
