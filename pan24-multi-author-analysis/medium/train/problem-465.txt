To elaborate; when the Bolsheviks took power they wanted to achieve peace with the Germans, but wanted to draw out negotiations for as long as possible because they believed the central powers were on the brink of collapse (which wasn't the worst assessment, but was months premature). When the negotiations reached an impasse, they tried simply announcing that the war was over.
The Germans responded to this bizarre strategy by simply invading what was essentially undefended Russian land, and so were able to dictate a much harsher peace a few weeks later.
There was also the one of killing all the successful farmers and replacing them with unskilled ones.
To be fair the Nazis and Soviets were mutually expanding towards each other the Germans took West and Central Poland, the Soviets took the East and the Baltic states.
Collectovisation caused the Holodomor, Dekulakization was what caused the Holodomor to be a Genocide.
This is important because Collectovisation and Dekulakization are separate events (Although linked).
Yup, and it is really hard to tell whether dekulakization turned the famine into a genocide or whether it was just cover for a genocide... or if there is really any difference.
My favorite bit of reading about these negotiations was Trotsky bringing random ass dudes along because iirc they wanted to rep how the average person can be involved in the new government now? Imagine being a Russian peasant who barely washes his ass and now youâ€™re sitting at the table for war negotiations.
They adopted this strategy in response to a German peace offer that the deemed unsatisfactory though - they could have just ended the war by accepting that peace treaty.
I call it bizarre because they seemed to be in denial about why Germany was so demanding, and thought that they could replace armed resistance on the front with what was essentially a bureaucratic obstacle.
