Part of the purpose of the separation of powers is to create different branches of government who compete for and limit one another’s power. But the Florida legislature is showing zero interest in being a meaningful check on DeSantis. It’s not a “jealous” branch, with its own prerogatives; it’s just a rubber stamp for DeSantis’s agenda. And so now we’re seeing it hand this kind of authoritarian power to the governor’s office, again and again.

I honestly don’t think it is. Florida is redder now because a lot of MAGA people moved there and left the rest of the country. But I get the pessimism.
