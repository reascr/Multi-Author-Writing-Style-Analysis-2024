They have killed hundreds of men, women and children to show they have a peaceful and free Islamic Regime.
Sick to my back teeth with that deal and how ok the local population was with it. “Ah but all money is probably a little dirty”, “so what, who cares?” and “yeah but we need the money” was all I heard , the most disappointed I’ve been in a while.
Curious what their stories conveyed that put them specifically in the crosshairs. Anyone know? I mean a lot of things are said about Iran by a lot of journalists, why specifically these two?
The iranian media killed themselves over his death because they hate Saudi all the while they had more than hundreds of journalists, activists and students incarcerated in the Evin Prison.
The UK has been letting nation-state assassins get away with murder within their borders doe a long time without meaningful consequences.
Well it is the Islamic Regime please address them with what they are because Iran is now in streets freeing themselves and the world from this terror.
Tbh they are called Islamic Regime not Iranian because firstly they are not iranian, half of them are born in najaf, iraq.
Secondly, they are killing, torturing and executing in the name of allah and islam. Either Islamic and non-islamic communities should be triggered and support the people of Iran or at least stop calling them Iran or Iranian Regime.
