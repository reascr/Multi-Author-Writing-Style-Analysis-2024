Seems to be. Considering there is debate about if ruzzia has actually launched their much anticipated renewed offensive or not, it might very well be just the face of the most pathetic offensive of all time. We'll have to wait and see, but if russia doesn't move before Ukraine counterattack starts, it's really not going to look good for them.
The Chinese are going to ramp up support for Putin's "army" they've already sent supplies.......now they're going to give weapons aid .....who didn't figure this out already ?
Seeing that India buys a literal shit ton of steel from Putin they might have to tap different resources...they've actually been financially aiding Russia in the war by buying up all their steel at a steal of a price.
Edit....sending Schumer is like sending a zombie....He is an absolute moron ...and it's been proven time and time again.

India will play both sides cause that’s what benefits India. India will not help China though because the two are mortal enemies. We don’t need India to be our super close ally, we just need them to be the opposition to China. And the US is still importing Russian gas and oil. Sometimes everything is just grey during wartime.
