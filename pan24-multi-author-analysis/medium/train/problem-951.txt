> The countermeasures that were recommended included higher sea walls to deflect a powerful tsunami of up to 15.7 meters (51 feet, 6 inches), and additional backup generators to continue providing coolant to the reactors.
The original plans for the plant had a much higher seawall, but that seawall was mostly cancelled because of costs and they were over budget and behind schedule. Also, the US nuclear regulatory agency had recommended that they move the backup generators out of the plant's basement and up high away from likely tsunami zones, but the managers ignored that advice. Even earlier, during construction, at least one engineer during construction had the same thoughts and said the generators needed to be somewhere else other than the basement, but the managers decided to stick exactly with the American GE plans and keep the generators in the basement. All it took was for one of those three opportunities, originally higher sea wall, moving the generators during construction, or relocating the generators in the 1980s after the US recommendations, to have prevented this. BTW, Japan has historic records of major tsunamis and earthquakes going back over one thousand years, and geologic evidence going back thousands more. There was no excuse for what happened.
