Her life had not been affected by this at much (after the first time, that is) because access to that medicine was simple enough. But now any doctor in Georgia prescribing it to her faces jail time because she has a functioning uterus and it could cause an abortion in the hypothetical scenario she had an embryo in there.
My sister had to flee the state because she had endometriosis. Every month she fails to fully shed her uterine lining, and if she doesn't get the proper medication to help me alone it starts to rot inside her and can kill her.
So now Georgia has lost another registered nurse while Illinois has gained one, and since she took her six year old daughter with her my father went from being able to see his only grandchild every week or two to seeing her once a year maybe.
Fuck every Georgian who confirmed that my sister is nothing but a subhuman breeder fuckslave in their eyes, unworthy of basic medical care. Fuck you all eternally.
Most who cast votes for such stupidity have no idea about human reproduction at all, and are too lazy or callous to bother learning. I wish her and your family good health.
