Trump found someone who was less intelligent and intellectually curious than he was. Listening to Walker speak was painful. He peaked as a college football player and, it seems, that he has few redeeming qualities off of the field. I hope that he is nominated by the GOP so that he can be repudiated yet again. Perhaps then will the GOP leadership then finally turn their back on the orange turd (I've lost faith that their rank and file ever will).
