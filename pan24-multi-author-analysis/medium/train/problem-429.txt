The bigger question is why the other Arab apartheid states still refuse to teach about the Holocaust and are still actively spreading hatred against Jews in their schools, media and religious institutions. We should be boycotting those tyrannical regimes. The best way to do that is with an electric car.
Renewable energy has always been the answer. If conservatives don't care about the environment and global warming they can at least care about not having to rely on tyrannical regimes.
Uh, everywhere rooftop Solar is installed. Itâ€™s actually regulated in California, and most of the US ,that if you install solar panels on a rooftop that the power purchase agreement must be at a lower rate than the utility option.
Because it's dependent on other power producers and the grid when the sun goes down. That cost is not born by the solar power companies, as pricing is decided by spot pricing. The cost of having a backup is "someone else's problem".
Solar and wind both have capacity factors of, at best, 40%. Even in the good spots. Which means 60% of the time we need to be running something else. Before you say "storage" we just don't have a scalable, viable storage solution beyond hydro.
Most of the best locations have already been dammed. The UK, a decidedly wet place, doesn't get enough rainfall to replace their hydrocarbon use with hydro. We are going to need nuclear if we wish to put a proper dent in CO2 emissions. It drives me nuts that the environmental movement is unwilling to support a proven scalable solution. However, don't take random guy on the internets word for it. I suggest the former UK scientific advisor to climate change, and Cambridge fellow David Mackay.
