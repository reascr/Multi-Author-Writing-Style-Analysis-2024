The Biden administration announced today they want to "Cure cancer". "Cure cancer"? What does that even mean? What even is "cancer"? If you look at the history books, no one hardly even mentioned cancer 100 years ago, but now we need a "cure" for it? They say it's uncontrolled growth in the body, but what are they talking about? Are my fingernails cancer? I have to clip those once a week When you go to get a haircut, are you "curing cancer"? It's absurd. It's yet another ploy by the marxists to get you to surrender your liberties and make you and your family less safe. To make you servile to the state. Now in addition to promising they'll "make everyone rich" by taxing the hell out of you, they're going to make you live forever too Haha, can you believe that? Because I can't... They want to take your dignity from you. From your children and your parents. They'll pump you full of who knows what drugs and hit your with more radiation than Chernobyl... After all that, who knows what'll be left of you? Who knows what you'll "identify" as? Who knows who you'll feel the need to vote for?
