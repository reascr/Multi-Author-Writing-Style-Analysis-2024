Violence against anybody is never good and not right. But what has been happening with these tribals is that these people are indigenous and have no notion of any religion. Missionaries just fool them with scare tactics or give them some freebies and convert them. And they also go as far as scaring them that the lord will strike them with vengeance if they go on the path of sin by reconverting! I wish people follow their religion without trying to convert every pagan, sinner, infidel into their choice of religion... It's like my path is the path of righteousness and you are on the wrong path..
Stalin and Mao the atheists murdered more people by far than all the religious killings over the past few decades combined. So might wanna look in the mirror before judging all religious people.
I’ve never understood the notion of giving a shit about another persons choice of religion. Why would it effect me if someone believes in a different God than me?
The church had a Inquisition office for centuries on this. How to punish the non believers by burning villages and people too!
And I still wouldn’t bother to care because I don’t waste my time on getting worked up about what religion strangers believe in. I’m not the thought police. So long as it stays in their head, it’s their right to think whatever they want to think; including things that I fundamentally disagree with. People who get worked up about religious people getting worked up are exactly the same as the people they’re mad at. It’s ridiculous how aggravated everyone gets over something like this.
