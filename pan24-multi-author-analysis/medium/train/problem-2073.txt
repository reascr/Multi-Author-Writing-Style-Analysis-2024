As a geophysicist in the energy industry I chuckle at the baloney I read on Reddit post after post on he ‘death of’ fossil fuels.
Coal and oil will continue toincrease in use until at least mid century. Quite substantially as subsaharan Africa adds another billion people, Indian another half billion. Doubly so as industry shifts away from Europe to these regions.
And not just the population increases but more and more newly getting access to electricity as well. For example a third of Indians got access to electricity just within the last decade, and now close to 99% Indians have electricity access. India had to pump up more coal based electricity for more of her citizens to get better living standards aka electricity during a short span of time.
What do you think about the massive under investment in fossil fuel resource extraction? Will this cause a squeeze on energy prices in the 2-5 year mark as fossil fuel demand become much higher than supply?
Article claims world has cut coal use in half during the last decade. If we're now burning 40% more than we did last year, we're still in a better place than we were 10 years ago. Not the progress we want to see but shite happens.
