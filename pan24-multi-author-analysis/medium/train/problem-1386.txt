What's the difference? The scientific method (bless Bacon and his 4 steps), is the sole way people can know whether something is true. Worse, the luddites don't understand the interconnectedness of science. Chemistry doesn't work unless it all works and biology won't work unless all of Chemistry is behind it. Math must be included.
