In order to purchase a firearm, you need a permit from a database that doesn't exist, after taking a class at a government firearms training facility that doesn't exist, from state firearms instructors that don't exist.
The permit to purchase requires a gun safety class. This class HAS to be taught by the law enforcement at a state facility. The current system of approved gun safety courses (for Concealed Handgun Licenses) taught by civilians at ranges or gun stores will not suffice.
There is already an ATF federal background check. Gun Shows have added ATF background checks for firearms transactions.
It's not a Shall Issue, it's a May Issue. Do you really want your purple-haired trans friend in Kissin' Cousins County being harassed by her neighbors counting on Sheriff Cletus to decide whether or not she gets a gun?
It's a law that goes into place next month that would take millions of dollars and years for the state to catch up to, and would create a massive backlog.
May issue permits are sexist, racist, bigoted, classist, and whatever other negative word you want to throw at it. They should be ruled unconstitutional by SCOTUS.
