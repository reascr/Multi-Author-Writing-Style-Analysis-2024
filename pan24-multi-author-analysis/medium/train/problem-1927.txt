These were super popular for a short time in Spain for expats. As you needed a covid pass to get into clubs and restaurants and you needed to be resident to get the vaccine. So no choice for some but to get covid so they can continue with their life and not be locked at home. The only way was to get a covid recovery covid pass. some just decided to stay home, but a small minority.
I got almost got stuck in Spain during the omicron outbreak. Right when they released that QR app code. Luckily the number of people signing up crashed the servers and I managed to get back to the US before lockdowns again.
Digital nomads, basically people entering the country on a tourist visa and staying however long they’re legally allowed, seems like it would be more difficult to obtain vaccines.
"...I could make sure I recovered and won't be infected again during the holiday if I intentionally control the time I get infected.".
I remember some kid in the US went to a covid party and died. His last words were “I wish I hadn’t done it” pretty much. How pathetic, not to use your young brain for something beneficial to society….
This isn't like other illnesses though, once you get it you don't have an immunity to not get it again. It can happen and relatively quickly, or am I way off?
