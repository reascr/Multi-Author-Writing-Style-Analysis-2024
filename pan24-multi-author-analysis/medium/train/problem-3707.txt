I was just the other week here on Reddit arguing with people who informed me that China did not have strong influence in Canada, nor were the Chinese at all responsible for the housing crisis in Vancouver and that I’m just xenophobic and looking for an excuse for my own inability to afford living in BC. Wonder what they’d have to say about this.
It looks like OP posted an AMP link. These should load faster, but AMP is controversial because of .
It very much becomes the same thing -- see the craziness happening at Canadian Universities and elsewhere. If you're in Canada and speak up, you and yours aren't really protected so the ones pushing for X towards China become the only real voice and they come bearing bags of cash.
They're exclusively targeting Chinese nationals in Canada, which is still disgusting (and I don't trust at all that the CCP is not using it to target dissidents abroad), but not the same thing. Not to mention lots of Canadians complain about Chinese businessmen who have gotten rich through illegal activities moving to Canada.
