Russia's entire strategy was based on attacking a weaker country and focusing on civilian casualties. Now they're upset that other civilized countries are helping Ukraine push back.
even worse, the west is just toying with Putin... goading him to send all of his troops to the meat grinder... send all of your tanks.
the arming of Ukraine hasn't been on a scale to decisively win the war, but rather just enough to seem winnable to Russia.
by the end, they will have gained no territory, but their losses will be enormous. they will be 2-3 generations behind the west in technology and economic development.
i think it wouldn't be defensible to say that if russia stopped the war now and spent the next 75 years trying to catch up, they couldn't.
Putin will be considered one of history's most foolish leaders... one that doubled down again and again while everyone knew the cards he was holding.
From a humanitarian point of view this is much worse of course. But for an end to Russia, the state collapsing in on itself would do far more damage than just being pushed to their borders. Though perhaps these are not exclusive to one another.
