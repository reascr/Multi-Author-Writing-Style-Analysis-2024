People below 18 are still entitled to citizenship, still get counted in the census, are still eligible for child tax breaks. Pretty disingenuous to compare those to guns and voting and alcohol, which are widely regarded as adult things which require some degree of maturity to handle responsibly.
Michigan still needs to do that part (Dems got a majority though so I doubt they drag their feet on rubber stamping it).
It goes into effect December 23, 45 days after election. Constitutional amendments in Michigan can be passed by citizen initiative, the legislature is not required.
But also, if fetuses are people then why don’t they get citizenship rights when they’re conceived in the US instead of at birth? Why don’t pregnant mothers get child tax breaks? Why aren’t fetuses counted in the census? Seems like the law doesn’t exactly regard them as people either.
Before fetal viability it’s really just a clump of cells, it’s a glorified tumor. After fetal viability it was never really legal to abort anyways, and I think most people would agree with that approach.
