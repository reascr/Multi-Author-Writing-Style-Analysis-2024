English did it to the scotts, US did it to the natives Americans and Hawaiians. Its pretty vicious of a nation to tell people that their language and rituals are banned from use.
Yeah no kidding, but they were effective sadly. Civilians always have the burden on trying to live and having to at times... be brave and fight for a change. Or watch and do nothing to survive.
Scotts were beat down and suppressed to where only like 5-8% still speak Gaelic today and they're trying to bring it back with their history.
In the west it is more of a sterilization, your views and traditions are pegan and satanic, no more hula dance... no more rituals and native tongue. Come let us teach you about Jesus Christ and force this cleansing on you with extreme prejudice.
This is an intentionally misleading post. OP is still not correcting the title despite being informed.
I do see your point though. The title of the article is in itself misleading, it shouldâ€™ve put it in context.
Over the summer, fundamentalist Muslims went on a ban happy spree reporting concert after concert, it made headlines in Turkey but didn't track outside - now that its a Kurdish singer its making headlines.
