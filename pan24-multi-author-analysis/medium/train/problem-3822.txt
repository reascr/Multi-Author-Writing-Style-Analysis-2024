Agree. Detachment from facts and evidence is a destructive trend in the US. Coupled with the (rightful) decline in faith in corporate news, exasperates the problem. It leads serious problems that are not easily solvable. The only correct way to fix this issue, is to instill the ability and will in the masses to critically think. But that will never occur as it creates a new set of issues for those with power to deal with; a populace that is not easily duped and who might actually become involved in the direction of their own actual best interest, as opposed to their indoctrinated & perceived "self interest". So I think this trend toward social lunacy will continue for a long time.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
