Nobody is objecting banning Russia. The point is, people here calling others hypocrites while they themselves only care about genocide only when it is a flavour of the months news. That is a fucking joke and just sends a message that other civilians are not as important as ukranians which is bs.
I feel like they can be let back in after they've done the first two and started on paying reparations. Showing a sincere effort towards repairing the damages should qualify them for the global pr events like the Olympics, and then the more important stuff (like starting to drop sanctions) can come after hitting various targets on the way to having fully repaid and prosecuted their war crimes.
Because they're a high profile active belligerents that is presently undermining national sovereignnty and this is a celebration of national sovereignnty.
I mean, you're not wrong, but the only difference between this case and others is that they are high profile. So other countries doing similar stuff but being low profile are free of consequences, which is exactly what hypocrisy is.
