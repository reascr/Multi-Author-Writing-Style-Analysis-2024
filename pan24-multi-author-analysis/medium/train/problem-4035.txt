Saw a screenshot from Margarita’s Simonyan telegram post today with words like “Now Poland got own Belgorod region. What did you expect?” She referred to Belgorod, as a territory that occasionally shelled in Russia.
And there lay the eventuality military planners knew would eventually occur. Russia reaching ever deeper up its ass looking for antiques, eventually something was going to 'break', especially as they grew more frustrated. Question is, do we shut down airspace over Ukraine? What can be done that shows we won't tolerate this without kicking shit off?
I will say Russia has committed worse atrocities. There is no good guy in a war, your killing people, people with families. You think the men in Ukraine are allowed to leave? No they're gangpressed otherwise known as the draft. Into this war. As are most russian soldiers at this point.
Russia could say it was a false flag by Ukraine. Sacrifice a few Polish lives to bring NATO into the mix and help destroy Russia. I personally don't think this is the case, most likely a f\\\ up by Russia. But the conspiracy theory that Ukraine is behind it - it's not completely inconceivable.
Dude, this would be an excellent false flag operation by Ukraine, currently all this war is doing for Ukraine is destroying it's infrastructure and everything else while grinding up their population to nothing.
While it's people are mostly innocent, it's government is not, not too long ago they were funneling aid money in paramilitary racist group. Until the USA said they could not do it anymore if they wanted the money to keep coming.
Ukraine has also removed many workers protections since the war started. They tried introducing that law before the war.
(1) Deliberate attack by Russia, (2) an accident by Russia , (3) or a false flag by Ukraine to get NATO involved? The most likely is (2), I don't see this bringing NATO into the mix though.
