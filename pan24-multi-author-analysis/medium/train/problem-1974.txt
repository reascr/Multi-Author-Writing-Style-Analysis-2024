It's frustrating to me there is no way to enforce factual article topics from the orgs that get shared here.
Headlines should contain more qualifiers or details, but generally if they explain in the first paragraph it's not that bad. A headline is just meant to catch someone's eye and convey a bare bone statement. It can/should be inferred what they are talking about, to a degree. When a governing body like a state government is talking about banning a word, it has to do with the usage of that word within the jurisdiction of that area of government.
So if there is a proposal for a state government to ban a word, it can be understood that it's on official state documents or state government language. Governments can't ban the use of a random term by the general population, private business, etc, for example, so we know it's not that.
I hear complaining about people using latinx at least 100x more often than I hear people actually using it. Yeah it’s cringe, don’t use it. But I think almost everyone is already kinda on the same page here.
