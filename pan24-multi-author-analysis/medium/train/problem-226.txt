It turns out the world has been making electricity for 150 years. I mean, millenia, if you want to get down to it.
But you know what happens when you destroy a country the whole Western World is standing behind? They bring their money, and their people, and their tech.
The spare parts for these substations are not easy to find, and as a stopgap measure the west is sending as many generators as they can.
I hope that the Russians can be convinced to at least stop this specific destruction of civilian infrastructure - itâ€™s causing and will cause so much misery as winter settles in.
We - me - us - we're thinking Ukraine is going to beat Russia back to Russia, and they're going to build reactors, and dams, and science.
Yes, that is my point. It sucks for this winter. But the Dutch aren't sending Soviet Era windmills. America - we - me - us - aren't committing 4.5 Billion US dollars thinking "Well, they'll need 100 thousand ceramic telephone pole insulators".
Yes but I have a feeling a lot of that help will be stimied in the new year with conservative in the house. They're not exactly being subtle about their love for Putin.
And Russia will fall into dozen of small irrelevant non nuclear countries and I can not wait for this to happen.
This will be, unfortunately, two years of the House of Representatives sucking cocks in hell. It'll be hard to get much done.
Not just energy. Ukrain going end up with best most modern infrastructure all around. Basically it will be something like Marshal Plan plus New Deal on Steoroids. Lviv will probably become silicone valley of Estern Europe and Odessa will be Monaco of Black Sea.
