It is my hope a clear signal is sent and justice is served for no other reason than I think our Republic's survival requires it. The fact I think that sorry POS Trump deserves it is secondary to my concern for my country, it's future, the future of my grandchildren, and myself. It's my hope those people in those positions are up to the task to not only serve justice but to demonstrate as much as possible why it's so necessary to our survival. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that justice is not only served but our country comes out the other end better for it. For now there is way to much division which is not good for our country either.
