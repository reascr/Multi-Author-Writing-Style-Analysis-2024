I mean I’m frankly surprised IF it’s so easy and IF the Republicans are SOO sure that there is fraud, then why has none of the Republican candidates tried it? Not that risking one’s own freedom and to set bad precedent or send a bad message, but I’m just saying. Either one party is nearly 5 nines effective and a master at obfuscation and lies to be unstoppable. It’s hyperbole on the part of the Republican Party… pure and simple. But the base believes it, because they want to believe they are the majority and that they are the correct choice and that some outside force is making it not so.
