So above 6, and the highest age I saw was 24. Quick math says that's about 160 individuals for each year, assuming an even distribution. Not exactly bad for statistics assuming they actually got a random sample. But honestly it's not great either. For example, one third of my graduating class could have been surveyed to account for all of the 18 year olds.
Their responses to an online survey, and those of younger children's parents, in April 2022, were used to assess different aspects of mental health, including:
The children and young people were then classified by how likely they were to have a mental disorder - unlikely, possible or probable - without being seen or diagnosed by a mental-health specialist.
I was a little worried about the structure of the study given how shit a lot of social studies are (this coming from someone with a social related degree and still somehow learned statistics), but clicking through and reading the setup of having multiple interviews including an initial in-person one makes me feel a lot better than "an online survey", which would not be representative.
