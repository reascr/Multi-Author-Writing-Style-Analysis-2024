I wasn't sure if it was Eisenhower but I knew it was pre Reagan. If Eisenhower were to run today supporting strong labor unions, and speaking against the military industrial complex like he did, he would be a dem. it's crazy that a republican from the 50s was more for labor unions, and against military spending than either party is today. The country has shifted so far right in the last 70 years it's hard to even recognize the post war 1950s society compared to today.
The same people who believe trickle down and that by bringing in less money and increasing spending can reduce the deficit. It's getting to the point where you have to be old to remember any time republicans might have cared about the budget. You would have to go back to before Reagan to find a republican who didn't explode the deficit. So I would assume that 90% of people who believe republicans care about the deficit are older. It's kind of hard to convince 30 and 40 year olds that republicans are good for the deficit despite republicans never reducing the deficits when in power once in our lives.
