I believe that is probably the case. It's quite tiring watching them all play the trickle effect with these weapons. I really wish they would just start loading ships and let the Ukrainians get this party started. Start training a few battalions today, and let 'em eat once the shit finally makes it to theater.
It's hard because they need to defend their own country too but as far as supplying the jets, US can easily do it and we are focusing on next gen fighters anyhow. Don't blame Poland. They need the jets.
Not only does Poland have fewer, they're also way more at risk of invasion than the US is. Who in their right mind thinks either of their neighbors are going to attack?
Poland could have 3 jets, and it wouldn't be that big of a deal. They happen to have NATO, and NATO has plenty of jets to protect Poland.
I'm not saying this to insinuate Poland should act in one day or another concerning jets to Ukraine ( although, I wish they would give them a squadron) just to point out that they would have whatever they need for defense of their people. Also, it doesn't matter anyway. pootin doesn't pick on countries that can fight back, he just made a grave miscalculation with the Ukrainians!
