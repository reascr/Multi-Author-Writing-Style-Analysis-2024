Let's just hope no one has to fly through some extremely tight tunnels to stop nuclear missile launches. And if they do, they don't try to do it in an a10 which is too wide for the tunnel XD.
Journalists are generally pretty bad with anything, they make these mistakes all the time. The pictures are there as cheap window dressing akin to your local store. They sell a very fleeting product so to max profit itâ€™s usually minimal effort and cheap stock images.
People get whipped up into their "just war" frenzy and just start firing wild with opinions that sound like they're from terrible fiction. They don't look at things from the perspective of "Would x country in y situation do this?" Instead it's more like "Would Dr. Evil do this?".
Thank you for the purchase order of 35224 jets. Incoterm 90 does not apply and the order is irreversible as stated in our terms of service. Edit: Delivery time is updated. With the current backlag of microprocessors we estimate delivery time to be 25 years. To leviate for the waiting time we can dispatch 10 well used airframes clear for reassembly. You can pick them up at these locations in Ukraine.
