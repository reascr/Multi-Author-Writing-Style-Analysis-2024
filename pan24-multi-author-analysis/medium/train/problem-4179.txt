The relatively small number of younger people that managed to get through Florida schools with some semblance of an education and sanity, are more than made up for by the influx of wealthy White Conservative Retirees that overwhelm the voting rolls and probably vote in two states.
Reality is that Florida is taking learning back to the time of segregation and DS is touting it as a way of protecting kids from divisive concepts, but what he is really doing is teaching kids that white grievance is the culture they should embrace and that anything that threatens that must be stopped at all costs.
His banning books and restricting education is pandering for votes from a fearful electorate that thinks that they are being replaced and discriminated against by an evolving multicultural America is obscene and disgusting.
Culture wars are not a reason to dumb down education- we are already way behind other countries in how effective and educated our kids are. Diversity and inclusion are not woke concepts,they are human concepts. Education is the biggest gift we can give children, and not telling all of it, and only telling the parts you like or agree with, does no one any favors.
