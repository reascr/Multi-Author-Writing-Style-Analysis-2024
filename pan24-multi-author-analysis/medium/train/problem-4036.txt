US Chairman of Joint chief of staff said in early November that both Russia and Ukraine suffered 100k casualties each. Note that casualty does not neccessarly mean dead. It isa sum of dead, wounded, captured and missing.
Also, I doubt Russia has more casualties then Ukraine. Whole spring and early summer Russian forces enjoyed great firepower superiority. Luckily for Ukraine, they didn't have manpower neccessary to have reserves to exploit their success.
This seems highly unlikely. But that's the nature of war, I suppose. Can't trust any official numbers, because both sides need to lie to keep morale up.
I wonder, what is the country? What is most important thing in it? For me it's people, human lives. It's the only thing that can't be replaced. But our government seems to be adamant in refusing to make any kind of talks to save the most important - humans lives. Even when russians are starting to openly terrorize civillians. Instead, they want territories where no Ukrainians live anymore, just so they could profit from resourses on it.
War taking lives every day, and rest of the people behind the frontline are thrown into extreme poverty due to the crashing economy. None of this are priorities of our governments. It seems like lives of the subjects bother them no more than the russians care about their troops. Both sides only value wealth that's on stake. So many people from both sides giving their lives so the rich could ejoy their luxury lives after.
