We're really not, though. You would need every person in the launch chain to be suicidally crazy. It's not just like the president of the US or putin can just unilaterally declare they want to do a first strike, they'd have to get everyone in the chain to go along with that. Soviet missile base commanders have refused the order in the past on more than one occasion.
In Russia, China, North Korea, there is a strong cult of loyalty to the leader. Rebels are weeded out or killed.
Lol who cares? I grew up in the cold war and these headlines were pretty common, the same problem Russia and the rest of the nuclear powers had then still exists now, if a single one of those warheads is ever used in anger the offending country gets turned to glass.
Except that we have literal proof of this not being the case when it comes to nuclear weapons, in living memory, during the most brutal periods of the post ww2 soviet union, which was as close to a cult of personality as you could get.
These systems are set up specifically so that no one madman could wield all the power and unilaterally decide on a first strike. That sure wouldn't be very safe for the people in power, nevermind everyone else.
A Russian sub commander was compelled under water by US Navy during Cuba missile crisis, and chose not to extricate his vessel by a nuclear counter attack.
There were notorious cases where early warning systems malfunctioned, and US and USSR military waited a few precious minutes for clarification. We are all here and very grateful.
