Better choice of words you could use here. Language comes off as negative. It's a great thing my country is still seen as a better place to live and be free. The American Dream is harder but still very much achievable.
We need open borders asap. I want to see massive immigration to the United States. In fact I want to see the U.S government pay for fleets of buses to bring economic immigrants here at a rapid pace. I also want the government to pay for their housing. Every single person that walks into this country should get citizenship. Could you imagine a billion people living in this country. All that wasteful land that animals live on can be turned to suburbs. I'm not joking about any of the above.
Oh the poor Russians. They are always misinformed. If only have a device in their pocket that literally connect them to the whole world. If only They all have friends/acquaintances who were mobilized, so they can know about how their troops have been raping and pillaging Ukraine, right?
I would say I am wanting justice for those committing atrocities and for their leader to be fully stripped of any authority and given over to the Ukraine people.
Also, if they all blissfully ignorant about the war, why did so many of them flee the country when mobilization was announced? After all, if they think things are going greatly and they are justified, they must have stayed, right?
Oh, and they also voted strongly for the war criminal Pootin last election, despite the 2014 invasion. How do you explain that, kind sir/madam?
. Stop apologizing for them, they are all scums of this planet. The only explanation is that they just want this, they want to rape and pillage Ukraine.
