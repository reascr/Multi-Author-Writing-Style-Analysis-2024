The GOP voters have a realy alternative in 2024 and Trumps support within the party has shrunk below 50% after his candidates failed the midterms.
Bush was unenthusiastic as fuck and in a year where people had enough of political dynasties he was doa.
Word on the street is that he fills his cheek pouches with garbage. Like really sloppy old macaroni and cheese, crumpled plastic, booger napkins, cleaning chemicals, and yeahâ€¦ literal dirt.
I'm not saying don't take the threat of a 2nd Trump term seriously, but him getting through the primaries is going to be significantly more troublesome than last time.
DeSantis is a completely different caliber from all of them. He is relatively young, but not as inexperienced as Rubio. He is charismatic, though not as batshit insane as Cruz, he is liked by the establishment, though not as dead boring as Kasich or Bush.
Trump also had one other advantage in '16. He was an unknown outsider to politics. His rhetoric of look at all this garbage, only I can fix it, played into that edge. Now sticking with the same rhetoric doesn't pull as well cause he was in charge for 4 years, 2 of which he had full congressional control.

Look at 2020 and his "this is Biden's America". Dude that was America under you, you were in charge and you didn't fix anything you said was broken.
