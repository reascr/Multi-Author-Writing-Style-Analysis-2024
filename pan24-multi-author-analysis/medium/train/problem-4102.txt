Yes, and one of the major reasons it's been hard to ban them is that they have lobbied that it's racist, because it's far more popular in the black population.
Banning all tobacco is a bad idea for the same reason that alcohol prohibition was a bad idea. Banning an addictive substance doesn't get rid of demand; it just gets rid of the government's ability to regulate age, ingredients, etc, causing way more issues than if we simply regulate tobacco. You can see the same thing happening with marajuana (for a more modern example) where banning it didn't get rid of it; banning pot only got rid of the regulating power that the government had over it.
I am somewhat happy that they had the bubblegum flavor vapes, because it finally crashed this argument. Menthol is the most common "starter" cigarette, so banning is great for long term reduction.
The difference here is that flavored products are appealing to children, making them an inherent health hazard to children/teens. Obviously, children/teenagers smoking/vaping is much more dangerous than adults doing the same, so this would fall more closely under age regulation and reducing demand for nicotine for minors.
never drank as a teen, you know that they drink for the feeling and socialization, definitely not for the flavor. You might not be experienced as you think you may be.
