I'm probably misinformed by the news, I haven't been following Israel a lot so from what I was seeing, it seemed like Israel had to be sort of dragged into this rather than willingly helping out. However, I'm aware they want to hit Iran in Syria but I don't see how it affects Ukraine?
1] Russia control Syria air space and has an understanding with Israel (from before the war) that Israel can attack there. They said out-loud they will retaliate if Israel helps too much , So it was Russia that connected the two regions for Israel. Which make Israel not that free to help like European countries that doesn't need Russia cooperation's (and kudos for them on stopping to rely on Russia gas).
2] Since Russia and Iran works together now (as seen by sharing UAVs) there is a new fear that any tech that falls into Russia hand might end up in Iran and therefore in Hamas hands.
In summery: Israel has no NATO backup to come if they start a conflict with Russia and have a lot to lose. They DID give many medical aids. So in this soup of interests Israel fear more what Russia can retaliate.
good we've sent them billions if not trillions in aid. also we're strategic allies especially in tech and cyber. I would hope they cave to pressure for help.
