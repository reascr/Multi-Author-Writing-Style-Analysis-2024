That's the reason we, the Swiss Citizen voted for a "company responsibility and Supply Chain Law" a few years back, but got steamrolled by Nestle funded lobbying in the parliament.
Don't get me wrong, if it comes to a referendum I'll vote for it, but the Swiss population is very easily swayed into voting against their own interest by the rich and powerful, as we have seen many times in the recent past.
Anytime they threaten higher taxes or corporations moving away from Switzerland, a large chunk of the electorate will kowtow to the capitalist Emperors, even if it hurts them.
Also, worth noting that a lot of people in Switzerland essentially live in a bubble, I've never heard anyone else criticize UBS, Credit Suisse or Nestlé in public, and when I do there's always someone to defend them.
A lot of Swiss people think Switzerland is seen in other countries as a paradise on earth, as my family said when I was growing up.
There are mentions of wrongdoing by Swiss people or corporations in Swiss media, but it always gets downplayed. In a way I am thankful for international news or I would still buy the bullshit that a lot of Swiss people parrot.
I recently visited Zug for work (and saw the Lindt factory on train ride to/from Zurich) and my Swiss colleagues gave me some Kägi Frett and Aeschbach chocolate. Probably best chocolate I’ve ever tasted, miles better than Lindt.
Honestly shocked to see the amount of hatred towards Switzerland in the comments. Even more because the story is only marginally related to Switzerland.
Even when a good news story is posted on Reddit (with exception of the german subreddits) about Switzerland.
_"The FinCEN Files investigation has revealed that top Deutsche Bank executives knew the bank could be used for money laundering. The news is the latest in a long line of scandals from Germany's largest bank."_.
