I served on a county election board representing the Democratic party in the 2018 primary in PA. A Republican candidate won by 1 vote. It was challenged by the other Republican. We did a manual recount. I was the one that verbally announced the vote of each of the 1,400 ballots. Each vote was verified by the other two election board members, the candidates, their lawyers, judge and other county personnel. It was intense, but the electronic vote was spot on and the dude one by one vote. Every vote does count.
