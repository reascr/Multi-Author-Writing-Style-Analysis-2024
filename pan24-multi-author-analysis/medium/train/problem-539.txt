It sounds like a right turn to me. If someone wants to die because of mental issues, getting themselves in front of medical professionals and having to go through a process of eliminating every option of treatment sounds better than the alternative.
Side story: A friend's mom had a condition called deja vecu; it is like being trapped in time loops, and it's a horrible condition, she wanted to die to have peace. Dr. Saks even weighed in on the case, it's so rare and there is no cure. They went to Switzerland, she ended her life humanely.
It is not a bad thing to delay it to get it right. It needs to be compassionate but not reckless. And mentally I’ll people need to be able to access supports when needed.
That’s a very strong argument in favor of providing this service - an incentive to get people into treatment instead of letting them take things into their own hands which generally has a bad outcome, especially for the people around them.
I think it will be hard to get people on board with this though as suicide is generally viewed as a selfish, sinful act. There’s no tradition of a right to die in western culture.
