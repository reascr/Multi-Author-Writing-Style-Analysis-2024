I’m a dog lover and have no hate for any breeds, but I’m always super curious as to why people seem to defend pitbulls so much. The only thing that comes to mind is people that might have grown up with them and have that kind of connection? Otherwise it’s odd to defend a breed that stands out when it comes to incidents with humans. Especially very tragic ones. I know there are far better behaved and safer dog breeds to have around for home protection, if that’s what people are looking for.
I personally try not to make huge sweeping generalizations. Humans are to be blamed for breeding those dogs to be what they are today. I don't know how much dog fighting is still going on but there shouldn't be any more mainstream breeding programs for that. The aggression that was selectively bred for will eventually be naturally bred out. It's going to take a lot of time.
It's really easy to say "shitbulls" or "all pitbulls are fucking trash" but its not easy to ask and understand why these things are happening.
There is such a bad stigma around pitbulls that they are often unwanted/discriminated against, a byproduct of this is that they are the most common dog found at shelters. Now that they are the most common and affordable dog, a lot of the adopters aren't going to do any proper training. Some of those untrained dogs will go right back to the shelter willy nilly because there wasn't much of an investment to adopt them to begin with. It's really a vicious cycle.
But also it doesn’t really matter why in my opinion they are dangerous and even without the extra aggression, they’re bite strenh is too strong for a house pet in my opinion.
