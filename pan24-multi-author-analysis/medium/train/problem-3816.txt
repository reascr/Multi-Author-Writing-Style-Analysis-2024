The same for all of Trump's picks for appointments - he did not hire people to work for the government, the country, or the people - he hired people to work for himself.
I should point out - not all of Trump's appointments were Trump's picks. Trump had a deal with Mitch McConnell - McConnell picked most of the judicial appointees and Trump rubber stamped them. In return McConnell kept Trump safe from Congressional over-sight.

I just mentioned it because some might wonder why so called 'Trump judicial picks' have been ruling against Trump in court.
They were not really Trump's picks (with some exceptions) - most of them were McConnell's picks and McConnell wants Trump out now - preferably without alienating Trump's base.
