That's the inherent flaw of authoritarian systems: the trade-off for lots of flexibility is that the dictator becomes a single point of failure. The longer a single leader remains is power, the more effectively selfish and manipulative forces can calcify around him and learn his blind spots. The dictator becomes vulnerable to misinformation by those below eager to stay in good graces. Without a line of succession, the dictator must sacrifice efficiency to play favoritism games so that those who might oppose him cannot coalesce and sharpen their knives in the dark. And perhaps worst of all, the education system that manufactures the best minds also manufactures the best dissidents: a healthy upper-middle class always begets a healthy ideological opposition (progressive and regressive). There is no outlet for dissidents that is not destructive in a dictatorship.
