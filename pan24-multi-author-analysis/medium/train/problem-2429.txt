I've had a different experience with my conservative relatives. None of them had any idea about 666 Park Ave or Ivanka's Chinese trademarks or that the ACORN "sting" was a fraudulent hit job, or the Planned Parenthood video was spliced together. When you only get information from sources that present one side, you don't know these things. Fox just didn't cover Jan 6 the way real news did. Sure, they could find more balanced news, but honestly, they don't know how. The world has past them by in ways they don't understand, and they get mad about it because Tucker tells them to be. It's sad, really.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
