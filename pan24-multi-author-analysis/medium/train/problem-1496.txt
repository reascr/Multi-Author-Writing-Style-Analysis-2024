That's the whole thing minus the title. I expected a whole meal and all I got was a small slice of bread.
The news is the implications of what he's saying. Not meming, that's literally it. He's saying they're ok with it but not outright encouraging it. Creating distance while stating that the US considers Russian targets fair game.
The best part about this war is its showing everyone in very real terms exactly what Corruption, bigotry, and blind nationalism does to a country.
They could easily prevent them but this is more of a "we have nothing to do with this" statement should russia get in a hissy and I'm sure the "we will nuke X" statements will come in the following days, just a distancing measure because I assume there are lines that shouldn't be crossed however them making their own long range shit is fine.
Put another way, the US HIMARS rockets are older designs that people would cause people to criticise the US military if our units ever were forced to use them in combat.
I suspect part of it is that we're still cleaning out our closet of old ammo. It's use it or loose it, and it costs money to dispose of. Like the Javelins with 1990s fate codes.
LOL. Ukraine is there own country. You know what, that's fine. The US doesn't need puppet states. It needs real allies.
