They used to be huge and collapsed. They are the only bank in South Korea to have working relationships ships with North Korea. If you ever did business in South Korea you would know there are a ton of large banks to use and you never see Daewoo anywhere. There is no reason to get a loan from Daewoo of all the banks in South Korea. On top of that, Trump never disclosed the loan.
He had an 18 million dollar loan from Daewoo which does business w North Korea. I wonder why Trump spent more time with Kim Jung Un than he did with all NATO leaders combined.
