Trying to find an excuse to ease the extremely unpopular and strict Covid measures in China without admitting the CCP was ever in the wrong. As in “well these measures were necessary for the original Covid but it’s mutated so now these measures aren’t needed for this new one”.
It’s almost like acknowledging that a largely vaccinated populace with the way the modern version of the disease works would warrant changing policy. Why the fuck are they still so afraid of it? Is it not way less lethal than it was?
That’s just not true. Their population is over 70% vaxxed and their vax doesnt prevent infection as well as ours (which also isn’t great at it) but it’s equally as good at preventing serious illness.
Despite how loud anti-vaxxers are around here, basically every western country has a covid vaccination rate among the 60+ of well over 95%.
It's actually interesting how bad their communication has been with this, anti-vaccine memes are apparently pretty common on their social media, and considering how much they attempt to curate what views are acceptable in their population, and what views are allowed online, it's weird they haven't cracked down on it more.
I’m supposed to believe a country that disappears political dissidents regularly and has mandated entire cities to stay on lockdown for much longer than the rest of the world , has optional vaccinations? They’re not compulsory?
It “mutating” to be less serious (which it hasn’t especially for them with no working vaccines) allows it to “mutate” back to being serious in a year when the protests pass too.
Their population IS NOT widely vaccinated and the ones who are have a vaccine that was ineffective against delta and continues to ineffective against omicron and all its descendants. They also haven’t had widespread transmission. So most of their population is essentially still immunologically naive.
