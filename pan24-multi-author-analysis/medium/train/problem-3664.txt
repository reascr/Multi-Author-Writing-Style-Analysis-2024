Bukele is eroding the country’s democracy while doing this, so yes there are negatives going on. Several years ago, he forced the army into their legislature to force a vote a certain way. He has been limiting the power of the courts as well. Imprisoning without trial. But Salvadorans want a strong man to deal with the gangs, so they deal with it. This is also not a country known for democracy or human rights. They are still recovering from a civil war that lasted decades. The people want peace at any cost. I have family from there, and this is my understanding of how they feel about it.
1) most people who leave El Salvador cite the gangs, and the resulting violence, as the main reason why they leave.
2) their travel advisory from the State Department cite as the reason for their 2nd harshest advisory, this being “rethink your choices” and the harshest being “god be with you, because we won’t be”.
3) “anti-gang push remains popular with salvadorans” is an understatement at best. He’s practically a hero.
