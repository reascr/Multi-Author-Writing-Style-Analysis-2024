Lol didn’t China only recently announce they are banning the sale of military grade semiconductors to Russia. I cannot help but feel that Russia greatly overestimates their alliance with China let alone Chinas long term intentions. Putin seems to be grasping straws with his economical threats and nuclear rhetoric, and until Russia brings some type of noteworthy victory to the table China can only see Russia as a loser in this war and therefor vulnerable.
Does China really want a powerful “ally” sitting on its northern border, or rather give the appearance of being an ally all the while propping the country up just enough so that it doesn’t become a failed state on its northern border?
If it came down to it and Russia collapsed, China would be rushing in to grab as many pieces as possible. Having them for an ally is like having a hungry tiger as a guard animal. It’ll turn on you as soon as it’s convenient.
If Russia collapsed, I wonder if The West would be better about rebuilding Russia than we were in the 90s.
