Obama didn't think he was a democrat, he thought he was a candidate McConnell would be willing to vote for, because McConnell brought Obama a list of judges he'd vote for, and Garland was on it.
Garland is a republican. People constantly overlook this. Biden believed in bipartisanship, chose a republican to run the DOJ, and now we will see him do republican things: protect everyone with an R.
Afterwards however, McConnell realized he could get away with just not bringing any candidate to a vote and it wouldn't hurt him any so he decided fuck it.

That all sounds pretty Democrat to me. Establishment/moderate Democrat, yes. But in the political climate of the last 20+ years, he's a lib.
He clerked for William Brennan, worked in the DOJ under Carter and Clinton, was nominated for SCOTUS (under whatever circumstances) by Obama, and now appointed AG by Biden.
Because he made a deal and will be turning over evidence to prosecutors. I wonder what Trump and his people told him, and whether they may want to mitigate that risk?
Sammy “The Bull” Gravano took down mafia boss John Gotti. This was a man who murdered more people than he could count. Doesn’t matter whether prosecutors believe him, only that a jury believes him.
