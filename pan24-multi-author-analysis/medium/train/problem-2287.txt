Weddings = money. This is a clever way to allow states to ban gay marriage if they really, really want to, but the consequence is that LBGT couples are able to spend their wedding dollars in blue states while maintaining residency (and voting) in red states where they already live, and the state still has to recognize their marriage anyway. Kind of a Catch-22 for red states that have gotten pretty good at crafting legislation to do the opposite (drive out blue voters or force them to implicitly normalize bigotry by staying and abiding by red state rules). A blanket marriage equality bill would of course have been better, but this is a smart play.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
