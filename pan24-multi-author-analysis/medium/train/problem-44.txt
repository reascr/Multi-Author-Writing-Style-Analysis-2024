- Churches, public libraries, zoos, amusement parks, playgrounds, banks and all other privately owned businesses that are open to the public would be gun-free zones….The one exception would be for business owners or churches who put up a sign that guns are OK on their property.
- No one could get a <concealed carry> permit if they are younger than 21. People would no longer have to give a reason for wanting a concealed weapon permit — like fearing for their safety — but they would still have to tell authorities about all of their prior arrests, convictions and restraining orders. Plus, they would have to submit three character references and sit for an in-person interview. No one could carry more than two guns at once, and applicants would have to complete at least 16 hours of training, including on how to safely store and transport guns.
But responsible gun owners shouldn't be upset about ensuring other gun owners are responsible. Gun stores and private sellers don't seem to be doing that!
