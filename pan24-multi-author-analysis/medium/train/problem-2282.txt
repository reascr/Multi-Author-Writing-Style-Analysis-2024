But what he’s doing here is (1) calling their bluff, and (2) playing “good cop” which is what France’s role almost always is with Russia and China. He’s basically telling China - “You want to end the war? Great. So do we. Go tell Russia to stop attacking Ukraine, and the war will be over and you will have helped the West.” Everyone knows China can’t do that, so… calling the bluff. It’s a smart strategy, and closer to what Ukraine itself is doing, because it’s a win/win. Either China doesn’t stop Russia, in which case China been called out for their hypocrisy on the world stage, or somehow they achieve the impossible and get Russia to pull out of Ukraine, pay reparations etc.
Why can't China stand on Ukraine's side? Know that this country faced the same situation 70 years ago, when they were on the side of aggression, their legitimacy disappeared.
Because China benefits if Russia and NATO countries waste money and resources fighting one another. Most of the world outside Europe view the war as a local one, and there's little appetite to go out on a limb for Ukraine.
Moral arguments tend to ring hollow in many ears when western military aggression in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America have been going on for decades.
