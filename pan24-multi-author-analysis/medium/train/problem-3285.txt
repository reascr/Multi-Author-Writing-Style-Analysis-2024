Putin deep in his core wants to be a weird fusion of Peter the Great and Joseph Stalin. Too bad he is more like Ivan the Terrible in his later years mixed with Nicholas II.
That caught them by surprise, they had a non-aggression pact with Ribbentrop. Considering how fast western Europe fell under blitzkrieg, the casualties are understandable. And they turned it around once the mud season hit.
This. According to Kotkinâ€™s second volume on Stalin, Stalin tried very hard to make pacts with the Britain but Churchill was vehemently anti-communist. Fearing Japanese expansion in the East, Stalin felt it best to sign a non-aggression pact with Germany so that he could focus on the East (we now know the Japanese at the time did not have intentions of invading the USSR). It seems he knew a war would breakout in mainland Europe and the hope was that Germany, Britain, and France would destroy themselves in the conflict; which, would enable to socialist uprising in these countries.
They did have a deal and the Russians helped the Germans build their military in secret for many years. But you would think that the paranoid backstabber would worry about being back-stabbed.
It really is crazy though to see how much warning Stalin received from his intelligence network, and others, though. .
