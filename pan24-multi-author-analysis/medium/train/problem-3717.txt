My comments had nothing about the west vs anybody, yet you comprehend as it was. Western nations want to restrict access to their insurance and shipping industry, I'm just suggesting that maybe developing nations including BRICS are maybe big enough to have their own shipping and insurance industry.
A bunch of people here acting like poor countries have a choice when the rest of the world starts buying non-russian oil shooting up it's price and OPEC is simultaneously cutting production.
If they are outbid on their traditional sources the alternative to moving to less ethical sources of oil is to have rolling blackouts. Plus I'd argue Saudi Arabia is just as unethical of a source which is where most South Asian countries got and still get the majority of their oil.
Since the developed "west" has decided to stop giving access to tankers and insurance, poorer countries should work together to form a counterweight to that.
Developing countries need to work together, and ofcourse bangladesh being a neighbor, India should help them.
