Not yet, mostly in the US at the moment. A few cases in other countries, but already 40% of cases in the US where it first emerged in November and about 5% in the UK. But it will inevitably sweep across the globe.
It's the one from the US Northeast, yes. First detected in NY in November, now already 40% of all US cases, fastest rise of any variant we've seen in the entire pandemic.
They still work extremely well for what they were designed for, preventing severe disease. This is still true for both the original vaccines and the updated bivalent ones.
Vaccinated and boosted. I caught it at the beginning of December and seem to have been given long covid as a result (still have an annoying cough and dry/scratchy through).
I feel like everyone I knew caught it in the past 3 weeks. Non of us were in contact with eachother. A day or two of crummy, sweats / chills / aches. Then it mostly became a sinus infection. Tired occasionally and just stuffed up sinus and phlegm.
YMMV of course. Was pretty rough for a few days and then felt like a mild cold. If I wasn't Vaccinated, I'm sure it would have been much worse.
That's what China did for the last two years. But it really only makes sense if you have no COVID cases domestically. And the problem is there is no exit strategy from it. Once you abandon it, your population is getting a speedrun of all the shit it was protected from before.
Against a disease like COVID selective travel restrictions are simply pointless anti-scientific woo. They make sense against something like Ebola which has a short incubation time and no asymptomatic infections, but not against something as stealthy as COVID.
