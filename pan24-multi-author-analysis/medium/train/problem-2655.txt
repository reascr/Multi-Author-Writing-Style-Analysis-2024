There was another article stating that the Kremlin called Ukraine's attack on their airbase a "terrorist attack", which only brings up the question of "if Ukraine defending itself against a hostile country is considered a terrorist action, then what do we categorize the Russian invasion as?"... smh.
Who are you comparing it to? Countries in Central/South America? Sub-Saharan Africa? South and South-East Asia? Probably not too bad. The citizens of the home nations of the Great Empires? Probably not too good. The middle class is a fairly recent thing, and life has never been good for the serfs, peasants, or near-slaves owned by the local nobility.
The Russian invasion isn't war in their minds, it's a special operation and thus you aren't allowed to fight back. You can only be attacked, civilians targeted, tortured and have war crimes committed against you. Attacking back is terrorism because it isn't a war. What unbelievable logic Russia has.
By this logic, Russia was a great country once the landmass was finished cooling, and fell into steady decline shortly after.
