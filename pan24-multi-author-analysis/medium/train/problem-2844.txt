And given the hard on Canada has for foreign students, this just seems like a huge cash cow returning to pre-pandemic form. Think of all that cash to be raked in from rental income alone.
While I'm not a fan of banning stuff, a good look at what is in the long range interst of each country is needed. A few wolves hidden in the flock could do a lot of damage. Little green wolves.
That’s the funny thing. There actually is quite a few, but they’re mostly studying at satellite campuses of US universities (for example, NYU and Duke have campuses in China) or joint teaching programs where you’re physically on the campus of a Chinese university but your classes are taught in English by a mix of US and local university faculty, you’re legally treated as attending the US one, and you get a US degree in the end (University of Michigan-SJTU program). Very very few Americans or Canadians attend purely Chinese universities for degree programs.
US/Canadian universities are generally better and more prestigious than anything in China. So why would they want to get their degrees in China?
