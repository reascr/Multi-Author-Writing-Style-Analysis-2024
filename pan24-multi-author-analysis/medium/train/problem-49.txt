Who couldâ€™ve guess that building military bases in international water, over fishing in other nations waters, and constantly asserting racial superiority would cause distrust amongst your neighbors?
You want me to explain how the U.S. surrounding China with military bases and allocating hundred of billions of dollars into weaponizing the Pacific is imperialism? Sorry, I don't think I have the patience for that.
Wolf-Warrior philosophy forgets that wolves hunt in packs and the lone wolf cannot survive without the pack.
What about this is imperialism? Can you explain to me what power the US is leveraging against the Phillipines to force them to give the US base access on their sovereign ground? This seems like a transactional arrangement where the Phillipines gets military assistance in the region with their consent and stimulus to local and national economies as military personal spend money in the region. Also they are hedging their bets when China and its illegal fishing trawler fleet has violated its internationally recognized EEZ. Fucking tankies man never even do basic research onto these subjects.
Go ask the Okinawans how they feel about the "protection" of U.S. military bases. In fact, just ask the Filipinos about their history of being raped and abused by the U.S. military.
