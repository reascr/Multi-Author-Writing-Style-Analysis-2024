It may be embarrassing for russian delusions of grandeur, but if it works for the war, it works. We mustn't underestimate Russia's ability to take from others what they're incapable of making themselves, and sometimes paying for it with all the natural resources they're hoarding.
And the thing about delusions of grandeur is they can absolutely weave their wounded pride into the narrative of justification. And Putin has been doing exactly that, framing them as being under attack from the West.
Some version of that narrative is probably being minted and circulated already. Whether the populace exchanges it freely amongst themselves, who knows.
It's a comforting lie, something you tell yourself so you don't lay awake at night and think about all the people who would gladly put authoritarians to the torch and dance around the fire.
All it will take is a speech along the lines of "they tried to crush us, and they failed" to coax the populace into accepting that their invasion is relying on handouts, and that they shouldn't be ashamed of that because their cause is righteous and the entire goddamn world is out to get them and whatnot.
