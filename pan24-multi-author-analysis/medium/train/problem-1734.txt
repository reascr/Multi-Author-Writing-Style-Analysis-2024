It's a shame that $1.4 billion in advance payments for canceled Covid shots for the world's poor have not been refunded by the vaccine makers. This money could have gone a long way in providing essential health services.
maybe the organization handing out the money should of planned better, read the contracts or had out clauses?
Apart from altruism, why should the companies give the money back? There are associated costs on their side too regardless of delivery or not.
Oh yeah, think of the poor multinational pharma companies. How will they survive, those associated costs are DEFINITELY 1.4 billion. Kind you if Bill Gates didn't push for it to get patented and everyone got to make the vaccine themselves this wouldn't be an issue. The idea that "oh people without the infrastructure might try and make it and fuck it up" is funny considering a bunch of money just got tossed in a well and most of the poorer countries vaccination rates are still dogshit.
TL;DR Whoever feels the need to defend massive pharmaceutical companies should suck on a car exhaust pipe.
