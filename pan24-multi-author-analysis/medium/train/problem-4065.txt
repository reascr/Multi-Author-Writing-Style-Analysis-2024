They used 2010, the year that the Republican party welcomed the Tea Party with open arms, as an example of how Republicans used to have standards. Jesus fucking Christ whoever wrote this article is a fucking moron.
"Well 3 Republicans resigned after being caught having affairs, so that means they had standards. As long as you don't mention their open embrace of white supremacy, of course.".
Bull fucking shit. The Tea Party was blatantly racist every step of the way. Why do you think they hated Obama with such a passion? Because of W's recession? What a joke.
