If any of the previous are good examples of what happens to the Republicans when they fail to take action on these kind of things then I say good because eventually it's going to come back to bite them on the ass.
Both Trump and Wayne Lapierre the CEO of the NRA are starting to cost the Republicans dearly. The Red Wave turned into the BIG whimper...... The NRA not only collects less money now because of the money Lapierre embezzled they also get to spend less because his personal legal bills cost the NRA even more money. But they keep reelecting him. Lapierre was just reelected recently. He's driving the NRA into the ground financially anyway.
