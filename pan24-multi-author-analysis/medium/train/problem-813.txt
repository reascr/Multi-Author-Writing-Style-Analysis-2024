This is a weaker defense than I expected. They stole money, they lied about it, they gambled it away and lost, and then they lied about it some more.
Hundreds of millions are still missing, and this guy wants to pretend like he wasn't trying to commit fraud.
It’s even crazier when you hear about how the company was run. There was NO accounting department. When an employee wanted cash to buy something they messaged the Signal App group and the group approved it. They then deleted a bunch of messages meaning no one will ever be able to figure out what happened to most of that cash.
It’s flat out insane that they tried to walk into a buyout offer without a fucking financial department of any kind. What did they expect to happen? That they could just sell it like it’s an ad posting on Craigslist? Like it isn’t a massive billion dollar purchase? They practically begged them to kick the dominoes over.
A lot of people didn’t. A bunch of pretty prominent investors sniffed it out right away just by meeting SBF. Binance backed out of their buyout precisely because of what you mentioned regarding their lack of an accounting team.
