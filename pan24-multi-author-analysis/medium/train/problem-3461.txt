Biden's repeated calls for more oil drilling is quite tone deaf given the climate summit and counter-productive to those of us who are arguing against a continuation of an oil dependent economy.
spend 10 minutes researching oil drilling in the US, and you will realize that Biden could beg for more oil drilling and open up any land and it would have almost no takers... There's thousands of leases that could be used to drill Today, none are because it's not profitable. Oil producers don't want to invest money into more oil drilling as they can keep supply limited and rake in more profits. They were previously burnt when they expanded and prices dropped and don't actually want to expand anymore.
Saying the US should do more oil drilling is just political theater to appease a segment of the public.
