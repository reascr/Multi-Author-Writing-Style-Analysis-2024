I don't know why people are so obsessed with trying to get the secret recipe for Coca-Cola. They are not going to get the original cocaine recipe. And even if they do get the cocaine recipe they are not gonna be able to get the ingredients that were around in those times to achieve the taste.
I once bought one of them Christmas calendar things with 24 beers in it. Yeah, so fully a third of those were IPAs and red ales, even the Christmas Eve one. All obscure Norwegian craft beer makers.
Maybe one of the IPAs were drinkable. There was one beer themed on Trump and featured a caricature of him with the super angry sphincternouth. It tasted like distilled stomach acid.
I actually quite like IPAs, but I have had some Norwegian and Icelandic ones and they were awful. I like other beers from those regions, but I have yet to drink a tolerable IPA from outside the US. There's some sample bias there of course, since when I'm somewhere else I tend to drink whatever's local which is usually not an IPA.
