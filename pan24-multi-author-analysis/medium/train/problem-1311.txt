Can this tired line die? Democracy in the US does not die with a Reichstag fire and people accepting a dictator-for-life. The country would fall apart before that. If it dies it dies under the cover of elections being fuged just enough to keep someone in power, with the veneer of freedom over it. Hungary, Turkey, Venezuela pre-Maduro, are better ideas of what the future could be than a straight up Nazi takeover. For something like that to happen the opposition has to roll over, and I refuse to believe enough people would be willing to do that. People would sooner start shooting than accept elections being straight-up cancelled.
