Depends on how you count. The UK was first with western tanks followed by Germany. On the other hand Poland had sent many Soviet tanks before that. Despite all bluster in the media Poland waited with Leopards until Germany had decided to send theirs.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Poland sending Leopards is contingent on Germany giving them permission to do so. As is with all German heavy weapons due to the weapons contracts between the countries.
You could always ignore the clause (and Poland has threatened to do so) but in general such international contracts are respected.
Because there's no point in ignoring them. If you break the contract, you get no technical support, no ammo and no logistics aside from what you can support yourself. Military vehicles quickly become useless under such circumstances, and when being used actively in a war, within days.
UK has the big dick power of a nuclear arsenal. It moves first, dares Russia to respond, and when Russia doesn't the rest of Europe piles in.
Well, French were the first to send modern SPGs, Caesar, the US were the first to send western MLRSs, HIMARS, and the US and Germany were the first to provide western anti-air. So the UK is not the only nation which breaks taboos. And many eastern European nations have sent tanks, helicopters and possibly fighter jets long before the Leopard.
