I know this isn't a great source but my friend is one of the soldiers that man the S400's. During his boot camp he explained how some soldiers asked the sergeant where the prayer room was and the sergeant went to town on that soldier. My friend is a staunch nationalist to the degree that he is trying to revive the old Turkic religion of Tengriism. He says that the military is still very secular but high officials closest to Erdogans position are probably filled with his cronies who have had secular military training.
but gov official numbers will be around 10-20k, because tv channels pretty much act like all is well and under control plus praising how well their "ruler" dealing with the crisis but live feeds or videos from survivors tells absolutely different stories.
But there are nearly 7 million people living within just the “severely affected” range of the two major quakes, let alone the nearly 15 million people living in the region USGS expects to see significant damage to infrastructure. Hopefully, some can be saved. It’s just depressing that so many are surely already lost.
