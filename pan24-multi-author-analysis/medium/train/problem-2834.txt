When I flew to Manila several years back for a 2 month stay the last connection was in Japan. My company told me absolutely do not bring cold meds (NyQuil, Sudafed) as it’s very controlled, so I didn’t bring anything other than my prescription thyroid medication (checked on that for both countries first). I did get a bad flu there and getting those types of meds OTC was not possible, so I suffered a bit more. I do feel terrible for Griner, punishment doesn’t fit the crime in any way. That said she made a poor decision. If you go to another country you be vigilant and abide their rules or suffer their legal system. Personally, not sure why any American would travel to Russia considering the last several years of politics.
I agree, I am smoking right now in a country it is illigal in - it carries a 14 year sentance but more likley an $100 fine.
But I wouldn't bring drugs across international borders and the world is immoral, wishing it isn't is great an all but the status quo is what it is.
