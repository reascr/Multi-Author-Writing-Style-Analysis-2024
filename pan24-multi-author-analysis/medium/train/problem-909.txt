It also hurts pushes to arm Ukraine with better weapon systems because many voters think they've already won the war. They need more weapons, more ammo, more winter gear, and a fucking air force. Why we don't have an American trained squadron of Ukrainian F-15 and F-16 about to deploy is insanity. We have the planes and training facilities, fucking use them!
What’s the point in conscripting more troops when you don’t have socks for them? Let alone guns, food, shelter. They have literally used every last weapon they’ve got, and are being supplied by Iran and North Korea. That won’t go on for long, as Iran and NK don’t have much means to produce new weapons.
Not sure where I saw it, but was watching an interview of one of the Ukrainian officers explain why things had slowed down. Firstly he cited the weather changes but he mentioned that the influx of Russian mobilized has absolutely caused them problems. Yes, they're not trained very well, and poorly equipped. But it's still an enemy you have to go through, and they do shoot back and call in artillery. Despite the moronic comments flooded on reddit, these Russian mobiks do have guns, ammo, anti tank weapons, APC's and armor. And they're killing Ukrainians with them.
