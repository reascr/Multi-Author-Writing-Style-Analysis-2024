Yeah... as a "disaster enthusiast" I concur. I'm basically a veteran storm chaser that keeps an eye on all things that could naturally destroy humanity... and what I can bear to make myself look at is beyond words.
They're likely not far off... the injured to dead ratio out of Syria is horrific. I don't think I've seen another disaster other than aircraft crashes with worse numbers than what are coming out of Syria. I don't know enough about Syria itself to grasp the numbers, but it's looking extremely grim for them.
It's gonna be 100k+ in the best scenario. Most of the wreckages are yet to receive help and it's been 45 hours. It's likely the last nights of people under the buildings. Some cities and towns are destroyed completely. The city of Hatay was wiped off the map.
What scares me is how low the "injured" count currently is for the whole region vs the scope of the devastation.
That's the best scenario by the way. A town of 160.000 was completely destroyed. All of the buildings in the town are collapsed. And that's only 1 town. Do the math yourself for 10 cities.
Turkey's numbers are looking better so far, but still I don't expect good news to come from many of these collapsed buildings.
