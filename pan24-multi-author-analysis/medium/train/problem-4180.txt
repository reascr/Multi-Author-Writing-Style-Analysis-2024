Same here and went almost straight Dem save for like two judges in local races that are sort of Rino anyway and just doing a shit ass job. I think my main beef is that there’s always this rhetoric that GOP is done because the virus is killing them all, or the newest that the party is going to tear itself apart from the inside because Trump is running. It drives me nuts because it’s lazy thinking, underestimates a lot of factors, and still leaves the door open for them to maintain power. I also didn’t think Beto stood a chance, but a lot of people were legit convinced the “blue wave” would finally come to Texas as we’ve been promised since Ann Richards. And most of that was based on the GQP not taking the vaccines and shit like that. And look. We get stuck with a clearly incompetent governor and a crook as an AG and the races weren’t even close.
The same experts puzzled at why Trump voters seem to fly more Confederate flags. And why 90% of Republicans in Congress are white Christian males.
