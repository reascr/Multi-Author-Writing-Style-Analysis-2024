I wonder if he'll be more or less vengeful against these women when he gets out. Sounds like the beginning of his villain arc I wouldn't be surprised if he escalates after he gets out.
He is already 54 years old, those elder guys rarely change and, according to the letters he wrote, he would have to make a 180 degrees turn in his political views.
It's the younger far right 'idiots' where you really have at least a chance to make them realize that their right wing way is a way to hell on earth. But, of course, that takes patience and money and skill. And while todays societies may have the skill, they don't have the patience and money - not for this kind of work.
The point should be to protect those women, and prison is only temporary, it is more likely the guy winds up even more threatening after serving his sentence. I would think they could defer to mandatory therapy at least.
By promising to do an "NSU 2.0" he set himself up as continuing where they left of. Which is quite a bit more serious than just sending a bunch of mean letters.
