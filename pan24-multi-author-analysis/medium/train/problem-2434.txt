Containers are not that great for building a home as some would have you believe. Also they don't use discarded ones, most are brand new so the "green" part is out of the window. The structural modifications are extensive, you can't just cut doors and windows without re-enforcing the structure.
Yes, you can cut doors and windows. The containers are literally designed to carry load at the corners. You can remove something like 80% of the walls and it won’t reduce the strenh at all. The side walls just reduce deflection of the side rails but if your stacking containers, the loading is carried through the corner post, not the side rails or walls. Sure, if you land a large point load in the middle of a container side wall it will deflect more, but this is a stacked container wall.
Most aren’t brand new. Most were used to import but since we don’t export as much as we import, we have surplus containers. Sure, if your building a fancy new home your contractor will order new, but the country has a shit load of lightly used containers for sale. Take a look at the picture, they are clearly used containers. So unless you want your contractor paying 10x as much for new, you buy a used one.
