Yeah I bet a large amount of it has to do with gloves, laboratory pipettes, the at-home test covid test kits, people doing more take home with plastic utensils vs eating in with metal utensils, etc.
All the PPE and all the takeout and delivery groceries would have been huge contributors. I’ve still got single use utensils and bags from 2020 and I imagine I’m not alone.
Many food places in my State transitioned to plant based plastic type of containers during the transition away from styrofoam as actual biodegradable friendly alternatives were not widely available. I got a stack of containers surviving no problem in the dishwasher two years later.
All the grocery stores in my area shut down all the bulk food items and replaced them with pre-packaged plastic containers. Even the pastries and buns that you could buy loose got replaced with pre-packaged clamshell containers. All in an effort to cut down on touching surfaces. Covid resulted in a huge increase in single use plastic when I feel like society was just about to start reducing it.
