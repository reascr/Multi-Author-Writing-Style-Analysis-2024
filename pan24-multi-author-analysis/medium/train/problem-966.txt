The Red Line recently did an excellent podcast on this. Basically, it’s a combination of fudging their numbers and kicking the proverbial can down the road.
The reports before COVID of their economy booking was due to land sales and taking on debt for public works projects….
But you can only sell those massive amounts of valuable real estate once. There’s a pyramid scheme of housing and infrastructure debt that’s been coming due for awhile.
It's a mix of scheming and speculation bubble which has grown to such a scale, that popping it would ruin the government, the corporations, and the individual citizens. At the same time it can't go on forever either, so the best case scenario is a controlled but painful deflation, I guess.
To add: cyclical debt was being abused to exploit speculative investment schemes... all to feed a growth and accumulation agenda. 'Evergrande' has been in "bankruptcy limbo" ever since it was revealed that they couldn't afford all of the commercial real estate they had "purchased"...
Basically: Take on loan to buy skyscraper, list the space for rent, apply for new loan using skyscraper as asset collateral, use loan2 to by another building, rinse-repeat.
This was a large part of the inflation in real estate prices in the commercial sector, until Covid drove a lot of workers out of their office space and companies started re-thinking their need for centralized offices....... collapsing commercial real estate values and blowing up the scheme in their faces. Now there's a lot of debt that banks can't really collect on because the buildings are all under liens to other entities and lost their inflated value that they loaned out.
The residential market is inflated for different reasons - the need for personal homes was not suddenly increased by the lockdowns.
To be fair, I was speaking in broad terms - that real estate is still in someone’s hands that lost value during the COVID lockdowns when it had been bought at inflated values.
