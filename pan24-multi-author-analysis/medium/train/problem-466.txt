If we start to value independent cultures awe have to take the federation goal of non interference. This doesn't happen, money flows. Europe and the west is coming out of imperialism and is the only nations to get rid of their own empires I think ever. This peace won't last. We have to decide due we want to impose our values so possibly more people are happy and there is less violence of let things play out and possibly have less influence. What is culture? Culture imho is what holidays you have, the words people say when you sneeze, do you hold doors open for each other, are meals communal, does everyone have their own house, do you value women or minorities or even men, do you value gay people. We have to accept hating gays and women is part of certain cultures. We have to accept if we want to impose a better world, cultural genocide might be needed. There is a prevailing theory peace will come through economics. The idea is to impose values using economics. It might work, we don't really know if it does. Is is because of trade or a third thing. As a liberal, I believe in freedom for all. If that means we have to change dangerous cultures, I'm up for it. Peaceful means are always better. But, I don't think it's worth it in the long run to entertain these people's antiquated ideas. I want humanity to get to space and people like this threaten the stability of earth and the future of the human race.
The Taliban saw what happened in Iran, they aren’t gonna have Martyrs. Especially when a lot of their power is local leaders going along purely because most of their demands aren’t big changes for them.
This isn't to say you can't or shouldn't try to understand a culture within its own context. You should. But there comes a point at which the abstract academic appreciation ends, and real decisions have to be made. Do you accept abhorrent behavior because it is part of a culture, or say, 'no, that's wrong', and start imposing your own values on others.
