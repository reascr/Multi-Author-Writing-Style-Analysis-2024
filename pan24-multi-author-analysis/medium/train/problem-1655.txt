I think you'll find its because of the time that has passed. The Muslims in China and the Ukraine war are recent.
I did read it slightly differently. I don’t think anyone reasonable genuinely thinks Israel wants to take over Gaza and the West Bank but I agree with OPs sentiment: The status quo suits Israel just fine, and OP (and many others) has lost faith that change can occur without something unthinkable happening.
Regardless, the point, which clearly went over your head, is if the goal is to steal land, they're doing a pretty shitty job of it if they're leaving territory like Gaza, and forcing Israelis to leave that area. They did that in an effort for peace, and they were rewarded with an Intifada as a result.
This is 100% correct. And kind of the point I wanted to make, the UN can't do anything, and some of that weakness is because the USA always supports Israel and vetos the things.
Who do you think is being fooled by this position? West Bank settlements are built on disputed land. “All the land” is a straw man. OP didn’t say that.
