I think if we see any primary fuckery on the democratic side (which is very unlikely imo) that it'll be a governor or something -- someone less directly obliged to the national party machinery than a senator.
I'm excited to vote for President Biden again. He's been the most productive President of my lifetime, and that's despite all of the garbage he's had to deal with from the GOP and right wing media. Dark Brandon is the hero we need right now.
They kind of made their bed here with the 2020 primary. Now they're married to him for another 4 unless they can get someone to primary a sitting president (which is really hard to imagine in this iteration of the party).
Most established pollsters were actually fairly accurate last year. It was mostly a bunch of Republican partisan polls like Trafalgar that were predicting a red wave and of course the media sensationalized all of them to create drama before the election.
Still, i think the poll in the OP speaks for itself. Nationally, dem voters aren't crazy about Biden right now, and democrats can only stand to hurt themselves by pretending they don't know that.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Does it matter, though? No Democrat is going to challenge Biden, they'd only run if he says he won't run again.
I'd grant that. Obama and Clinton would never have pulled out of Afghanistan, for a start. Even trump was too chickenshit for that, and republicans are usually insulated from the soft-on-foreign-policy canard.
