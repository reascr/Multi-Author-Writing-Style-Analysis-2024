The sultan unilaterally recognized the US on December 20, 1777, France recognized the US (officially, and bi-laterally) two months later in February 1778, with a treaty of peace and trade signed by the Charles Gravier, Comte de Vergennes on the behalf of King Louis XVI. Louis XVI previously stated that he recognized the sovereignty of the United States on December 6, 1777 (so two weeks earlier than the sultan) but he had not signed the treaty (yet). Acts of piracy by Moroccan pirates against US ships (I would not call that being a "friend") would continue until 1786, when a finally formalized the relations between Morocco and the USA and finally stopped piracy against US ships. So the two countries would only become officially "friends" in 1786, eight years after the official recognition by France. Morocco may be the country which first recognized the US (unilaterally and without any treaty), but they are not the US oldest friends, except if you consider piracy to be an act of friendship somehow.
UK donated directly to Ukrainian but Morocco sold the tanks to Czech government, which then gave them to Ukraine.
