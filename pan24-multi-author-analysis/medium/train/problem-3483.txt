I know a guy from college who went into pharma research. He's not a bad person. He genuinely loves developing new solutions for patients. We had a telling exchange one time. I'd just listened to a radio story about a big company re-patenting a topical drug by updating its included applicator. Absolutely no change to the drug itself or its MOA. But thanks to that change it somehow kept the drug expensive. How, I asked, could the company justify it? Was there something I wasn't understanding? Was it super expensive to manufacture, was the new applicator revolutionary? Gimme the inside dope, what merits these continued high prices in his industry?
There was no defense beyond "they want to and they can." Production costs were dirt cheap. The new applicator was just different enough to be considered an update. The company simply made one tiny change in order to keep a cheap drug pricy.
