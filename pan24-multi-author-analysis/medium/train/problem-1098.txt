Based on the article, it sounds like what the proposed bill would do is basically remove the distinction between men and women in South Korea as far as mandatory civil defense training goes:
The article is portraying this bill as being controversial and a means to attract young male voters. Of particular note from the article:
Their point seems to be that it’s not an equality bill, which is probably true if the same party wants to abolish the ministry of gender equality. If men don’t like mandatory civil defense, why aren’t they advocating for its end rather than trying to rope women into it too?
> Such policies included abolishing the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, one that was carried on by Yoon as a presidential campaign pledge.
Sure, the U.S. is there, but that's putting faith of your country's livelihood on another foreign entity. Meanwhile, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, look at the vast majority of Western Europe (France, Germany, Baltic states, etc.) increase spending on home defense even when they have the US pledge for defense (NATO).
As for why the men of SK - where does it say they dont like mandatory service? Its just clear that the women dont... for themselves only that is.
Meanwhile, women groups in Korea will argue against this bill, then get angry whenever a man, who served, gets a discount on coffee.
The same question can be asked of the 'womens groups'. Why arent they advocating for the end of mandatory service instead of what theyre doing - trying to keep it (unequally) male-only.
The bill would result in the same outcomes for both genders. Therefore its an equality bill. Being protested by the group that doesnt benefit from it.
