How do you even go about controlling a population a million strong who absolutely hate you and wish you dead.
I mean sure they will have the Army but those are all dead, under trained or criminals, most of which are needed in Ukraine.
Don't see the point of building cities you can barely control, field with constant sabotage, crime and on the verge of rebellion.
Helps if you build them in the middle of the Siberian tundra and make them completely dependent on the government for food, electricity and everything else.
Anyone want to rebel, they have to make their own weapons and hike thousands of kilometers, all while their families are starving at home because the government cut the supply lines.
And Russia could simply cut them off completely, then send someone over after a few months to clear out the bodies and prepare the "cities" for the next batch of undesirables.
Allowing Russia to continue, will only create greater net negatives for society. I know no one, besides maybe Russia (then oligarchy), wants ww3, but this shits got to stop.
And, while we're at it, let's stop the warlords in Africa as well, let's clean up this cesspool called earth and make it a respectable place to raise a family again.
