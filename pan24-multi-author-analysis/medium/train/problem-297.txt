Funny, a few other states did that with nowhere near this level of press preoccupation. Across the Hudson, for one.
And the crime rate in NYC is lower than Kansas City... So it's lots of unearned bashing from the fear mongers.
To be fair, whining about elimination of cash bail wasn't explained to the public. It was started and left to fester... Creating a fear of crime (whose statistics were presented without explanation).
Nobody in the press compares crime stats today with 2919, before the pandemic. People left NYC a ghost town for months. When they started out again, crime could be expected to rise... And lots of cops retired rather than expose themselves... Or died because of stupid political positions that they held on to.
Crime in NYC is comparable to the levels in 2008. Not a major bragging point, but certainly better than the 70s, 80s and 90s.
