I suggestion. During Iran national anthem is played for the match against Wales on 25th Nov, use loudhailer to either booing the anthem or singing ey Iran song. Any Iranian football player (especially Mehdi Taremi, Syed Jallal Hosseini and Puraliganji) that sing the anthem, took their pictures, shame them by exposing their mutaa marriages (temporary marriages) history. Put the great pressure to them because they prostrate to mullah and ignore the People sufferings in Iran. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·.
It was always a matter of time for Vouria. He's been sanctioned by the regime long before the protests.
Iran is really a weird and strange case, because they don't follow the Quran nor do they follow the authentic Hadith. They only follow the part they like, and yet they are extremists.
I kind of wanted it to be armed because they will be defenceless otherwise. I really dont think the regime care if they armed or not, they will kill as many as they need to.
I think they are going to just kill everyone until its finished unfortunately. They wont be removed peacefully thats for sure. Im not really sure how an unarmed populace can fight one with the military.
