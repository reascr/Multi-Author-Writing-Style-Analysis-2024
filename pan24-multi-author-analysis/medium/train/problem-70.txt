You can paint the US as the bad guy all you want. US wants Western influence on Europe & a larger NATO coalition, including the revered ports & resources of Ukraine. Russia wants the same but for the Russian Federation rather than NATO. It simply comes down to whether you would prefer NATO(US& co.) or Russia to have more power. US may have wrongfully invaded Iraq/Afghanistan but at least they had 9/11 to fall back on. This isnt Vietnam & we have 0 troop presence there. We have supplied Ukraine w the tools they requested in order for them to defend their own sovereignty. Chris has a larger issue w the geopolitical status quo which is a conversation for another day. As for now, which imperial power are you riding with… US or RF??
