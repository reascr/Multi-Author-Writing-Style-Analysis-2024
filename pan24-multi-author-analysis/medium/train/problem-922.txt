He didn’t want the job. He knew he was under qualified and propped up like a puppet. Outside of his football accomplishments, he was mostly an unknown figure. This election put him under the scrutiny of the entire US and plenty of outsiders… his “debauchery”, his character, his missteps, his hypocrisy, and all the allegations… he’d probably just as soon disappear back into the shadows.
