I very much doubt they'll do this. There's cool Swizz folk but there's a reason they're the worlds largest haven for bloodmoney for the last 100 years and it sure as fuck isn't because they overall care so much about their fellow man.
You're not wrong, but there is in Swiss papers that multiple firms in the defense industry have lost contracts because of Switzerland's refusal to allow re-export of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine.
If the parlament won't do a Special law (like the COVID law) for instance, which was highly debated here, then it will at least take some months because all the preperations will need to be set, including rewriting the law so the majority is happy.
Thing is, those contracts aren't going to be coming back for the next decade unless the Swiss companies absolutely slash their prices to be overly competitive.
There just aren't that many nine figure+ contracts to win in individual areas of the defense industry and no government is going to have forgotten the situation Germany found themselves in - wanting to provide defensive armaments, a good proportion of their own citizens demanding it, Western opinion absolutely howling for it, but being hamstrung by the Swiss export contract. The German money simply isn't coming back (Rheinmetall have started their own production line to replace it), and it'll be very interesting to see how many countries go back to buying from the Swiss.
