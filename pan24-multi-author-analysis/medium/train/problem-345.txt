Personally, I believe Putin intended the all-out invasion of Ukraine as a legacy defining move that would put him up there with Stalin in the Russian history books. It was totally unprovoked by any western action. Seize most of Ukraine and probably Moldova too, then Belarus joins willingly. Boom, new USSR. Then Putin steps down and some hand picked puppet can negotiate with the west to get them out of sanctions hell.
Ukraine at the time of democracy was full of corrupt politicians. My ex told me you can bribe teachers with liquor and they'll give you a passing grade same with bribing cops. This was around 2013.
It definitely made it hard. Let's also not forget the fact that some of those corrupt politicians have close ties to Russia.
Fuck, one of those corrupt politicians aides went on to run a USA presidents campaign. Forgot about that bit.
Yeah, lots of bs going on with politicians. Shit American banks are still lending money to Russia as we speak. Jp morgan and bank of America cough cough. Playing all sides to make money.
