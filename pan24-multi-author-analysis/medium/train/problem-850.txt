Murkowski is a far better choice for Senate than the MAGA she was running against, but I voted for Chesbro, the Democrat with a background in education, as my first choice. When Chesbro was eliminated, my vote (like most who voted for her) was moved into Murkowski’s tally, giving Murkowski the win in the second round count.
Unfortunately, Trump-endorsed governor Dunleavy won a second term in the first round of vote counting by getting 50.3 percent of the vote. We’ll now have to endure 4 more years of his BS.
