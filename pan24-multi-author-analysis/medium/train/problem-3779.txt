Im amazed the archive doesnt have a record of which docs are where, and that they dont regularly check with the holder to see if they are still needed or can be returned to the archive.
I'd posit that they did have record of them, but don't look at that list; most of these docs are likely to just be daily schedules and minutes from meetings that aren't of a national security nature. They're only classified bc they are almost immediately. Then they should've been declassified bc of their benign nature, but got overlooked and weren't. They're only looking out for the ones of national importance, which is why they knew what was missing when the orange refused to give back the documents he had, triggering the raid on MAL.
If Trump had taken any path other than "fuck the National Archives, my docs!", he'd be looking pretty vindicated right now.
