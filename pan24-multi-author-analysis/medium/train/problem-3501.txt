What would possibly give him this idea? Except getting away with everything he has done for decades. I'm glad we finally stood up to him but damn imagine Ukraine got the military support it asked and begged for years ago. How much suffering could have been prevented.
Imagine this, you're Putin. You invade Ukraine in 2014 and take a major region without a fight. Then you invade another region and kinda start winning until they fight back. After you inject some amount of your own cadre military Ukraine agrees to negotiations. After this you get reports on how many NATO instructors and mercenaries your army and proxies are killing in Ukraine. You also receive all the reports about successful PSYOPs and protest actions which were launched because of Russian involvement.
Putin just assumed Zelensky would hop on the first airplane out of Kyiv, so that he could install his own cronies who'd been waiting in the wings. It would have been the crowning achievement of Putin's career, and the Russian people would have been building statues of him in every square.
