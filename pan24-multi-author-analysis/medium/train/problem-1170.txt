Joe Manchin’s latest idea is reminiscent of the bipartisan “super committee” created in the deal to raise the debt limit in 2011. That effort was unsuccessful over a familiar deadlock to today: cutting entitlements versus raising taxes on the wealthy.
So he is basically saying put people like me and Sinema in charge and we will work in a bipartisan way to cut social safety nets that both parties can agree with. In other words automatically give into Republicans holding the debt ceiling hostage. How about no negotiations.
Honestly how do you negotiate with terrorists. The Republicans are putting the faith and credit of the United States in jeopardy. Because they don't want to pay for the bills they passed. Trump added 9 trillion dollars in 4 years. The corruption of the federal government continues.
