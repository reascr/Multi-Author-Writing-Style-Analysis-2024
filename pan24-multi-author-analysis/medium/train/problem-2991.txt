Gotta love the hypocrisy of small government, pro-business conservatives attacking a business for doing exactly what it sets out to do, legally, with greater transparency than most people even realize.
The Republican Party seems to be trying to slot DeSantis in as a replacement for Trump so they could continue their tax-cut/austerity/deregulation policies. Honestly, I think most of the Republican voting base could accept it, but the donor class might not like how he enacted a personal vendetta against the Disney corporation and Disney World.
Disney might put out a "family-friendly" or "liberal" appearance, but the majority of stockholders are old-money conservatives. Talk about "woke" politics all you want but actually threatening business is a step too far. Using the Florida state government to overrule corporate fiefdom is not very "small government".
