I don't agree with this war at all, because it's complete bs. BUT ( here it comes), if we had the same media coverage in WW1 or WW2, Would they also be covering every sort of weapon that both sides used? New V2's, 88's' damn Buster's, all that crap. It just seems like every news article is about what sort of weapons the Russians are using. Guess what people, it's a war, some wild shit is going to get used and clearly Russia doesn't give a shit about any sort of laws or rules that other countries follow. People are going use whatever they have in their arsenal on pretty much any building regardless of what it is, why in this day and age with all the pinpoint, satellite, lazer guided, bombs, ect.. who knows.m But Keep in mind both parties were guilty of carpet bombing entire cities in WW2.
This entire invasion has been predominantly an attack on civilians or civilian infrastructure. The entire Russian regime are guilty of War Crimes. Using a Kh-22 on civilians is nothing but another act of desperation by Putin and his cronies.
