Hmmmm well that energy charter treaty sounds like a pretty good way for companies and countries to receive long term support for investing in a 0 carbon form of energy, like nuclear but the Germans wouldn't want to build power plants that have proven to provide baseline energy reliably. Much easier to quickly build a few more gas plants and improve slightly statistically but not focus on how to reliably power their countries carbon free for the coming centuries.
Well it's a welcome change from Germany's blind to the world energy policies over recent decades. Maybe they will actually contribute to NATO and their military as well so that they don't have to rely on the US to protect their continent.
Our current government is moving a lot of rusty old shit out of the way and starts a few long overdue changes. They have their own issues (why the fck does Scholz use his power so that a Chinese state company can buy part of the Hamburg harbor), but they certainly don't have to work in the easiest of times.
The Chinese buying important assets from countries that they trade with is a worldwide issue. In my country we've sold the port in our most strategically important city to them, Darwin was the only one of our cities to get bombed in WWII (by an expansionist and nationalist East Asian power) and right next to our US military base where 2k soldiers rotate in and out.
