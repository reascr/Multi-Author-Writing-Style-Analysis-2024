The authorities are holding Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, on charges of killing five people, and say that 18 more people were injured in a rampage at the club that lasted only a few minutes. The death toll could have been much higher, officials said on Sunday, if patrons of the bar had not stopped the gunman.
As the fight continued, he said, he yelled for other club patrons to help him. A man grabbed the rifle and moved it away to safety. A drag dancer stomped on the gunman with her high heels. The whole time, Mr. Fierro said, he kept pummeling the shooterâ€™s head while the two men screamed obscenities at each other.
"Mr. Fierro said he was covered in blood when the police arrived, and officers tackled him and put him in handcuffs. He said he was held in a police car for more than an hour, and screamed and pleaded to be let go so that he could see what had happened to his family.".
Edit: "When the shooting started, Mr. Fierro said, he hit the floor, pulling a friend down with him.". He helped save his friend, THEN went after the gunman. Wow.
Edit: Lol, lots of pro-cop rhetoric in like 3 minutes. Must be getting brigaded by some back the blue folks.
