In one big public health study/effort spearheaded by some Brits to educate people and avoid the spread of aids They literally taught several hundred thousand African primary schoolers to critically think better than most of the anti-woke people can. And then studied the health outcomes of these kids and their families over the long term. Surprise- they were better off. Yes that’s right, lots and lots of kids now middle school aged to adulthood all over Africa with much less education and overall resources have documented and studied and trained better critical thinking abilities than your average faux news viewer does. The ingrained racism of the self described “anti-woke” is essentially a selfish last resort to their inescapable laziness both mentally and physically. It is the definition of ignorance. The same people who tell everyone to “pull themselves up by their bootstraps” instantly blame the least fortunate and most exploited people for their own shortcomings.
