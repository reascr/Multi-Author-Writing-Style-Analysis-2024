In all seriousness, despite what people might think that being at sea and thus easy access to water means fires aren't a big deal, this isn't the case.
Hmmm, would you say it is more or less of a worry now than it was in the age of sail? On the one hand, metal hulls burn less than wooden ones. On the other, modern vessels carry things that make bigger booms.
I'd say it's both more and less. Same as with houses really. There are simply more potential sources of a fire due to electronics, but if everything is maintained well and kept to high safety standards the actual risk isn't high. Not to mention fire detection and dousing systems.
And just because a ship's hull and overall structure is made of metal doesn't mean it is now immune to fire. In most cases there will still be plenty of flammable materials covering the walls and floors, be it wooden paneling, wallpaper, and etc. Not to mention fuel, oil, and other highly combustible substances. The fact remains that there's just a lot of stuff that can cause a fire, and burn really well.
As I already said, if high standards for safety and maintenance are upheld, then the actual chance of something going wrong badly will be very small.
