To touch on your point about immigrants not caring, I recently talked to a french Canadian and he made an interesting point. I was told that Immigrants in Quebec are usually very much against independence because when they immigrated they wanted to immigrate to Canada. If Quebec becomes independent that would mean immigrants in Quebec would either have to move or accept a change in nationality. It's not a huge issue per se but I was told that immigrants in Quebec do care a little bit about the independence movement in that they are against it.
The problem is that Canada isn’t independent from the British crown, it’s only independent from the UK parliament and prime minister. It’s still part of the Commonwealth and Charles is nominally the head of the government with the Canadian prime minister and members of parliament answering to him. So not swearing an oath of allegiance to Charles III is like refusing to take the constitutional oath of office in the US. You generally don’t get to take your seat in congress if you refuse that oath.
