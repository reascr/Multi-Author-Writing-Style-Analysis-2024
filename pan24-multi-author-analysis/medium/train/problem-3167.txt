Got it down to 2k on a single loan (paid down loans one at a time, didn't consolidate) before eventually moving out, then a little under that when they were frozen. It's definitely possible to get it done, and I don't need forgiveness to be ok financially, but I didn't do it without sacrifices to my quality of life.
I graduated with 72k in student loan debt, spent 10 years living at home (lucked out to pay only 150/mo in rent to my parents) and worked at a casino to get it paid down (first as security, eventually ending up as a dealer). Being at home definitely helped financially, though it stifled my social and dating life.
