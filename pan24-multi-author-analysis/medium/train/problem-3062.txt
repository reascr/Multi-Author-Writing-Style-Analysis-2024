This. We never throw stuff away. Hell we could give them original abrams tanks and those are better than what Russia could field. That being said it may not be useful without ways to cross rivers and there’s a lot of mud. Ukraine is a lot of farm land. Plenty to get stuck in.
Its just that there is always something more important to spend production or gold on, they kind of get shoved to the end. Even when I get them for free randomly from finding a tribal village, they are kind of use full for a few turns before they get cornered by barbarians. Galleys are my preferred exploration method, and for land just send out 2-3 horsemen that travel faster and are stronger.
I recall reading somewhere recently that for Ukraine to effectively take the initiative and go on the offensive in the spring they’d need another 2 armoured divisions minimum. Seeing all the news about any armour from modernized T55s, to Bradley’s, to French light tanks headed their way it seems like they’re trying to scrape together everything with tracks and a cannon to get the fight going.
