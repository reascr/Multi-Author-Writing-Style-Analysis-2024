You mean like how you squandered the last two republican house majorities? Seriously, it's like republicans everywhere deleted the names "John Boehner" and "Paul Ryan" from their brains. And all those years of embarrassing dysfunction that made life a living hell for both of those guys, not that we should feel sorry for them? Blank tape noise.
Speaking of Paul Ryan, watch that motherfucker. He's probably been planning a comeback for years now, but he shouldn't be given any leeway just because he wasn't AS extreme as this current batch of spite-babies. Do you hear that? Do you HEAR that, CNN?
