The basic premise is that if foreign officials feared arrest and prosecution in foreign countries it would be disastrous for international relations. Much in the same way that Qualified Immunity is supposed to allow for better policing when cops don't have to fear lawsuits for doing their jobs and transactional immunity protects confidential informants during criminal investigations.
In the US top-level ambassadors and their immediate deputies can commit crimes — from littering to murder — and remain immune from prosecution. They can be expelled from the country but under most circumstances immunity can only be waived by the official's home country.
This is the dark side of international relations. As disgusting as it is that MBS has immunity, it is backed by domestic and international law that shields foreign heads of state and delegated officials. They are codified by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), not to be confused with FISA.
The problem arises when you add the human element. People suck. They're bastards, they're bastard coated bastards with bastard filling.
Just become the leader of a country and you are free to kill how many people and embellish as much money as you’d like?
I'm not saying I agree with it, but this policy has been in place in some form since 1815 and in it's most recent form since 1964 internationally, and in the US since 1978.
