Instead you're using ad hominem. Like, it's the mental equivalent of saying "your mom" or "you smell". Which is typical when there are no factual counters.
So in reality, this seems to be tariffs aimed at China to combat the threat it poses to US hegemony and US interests, with a climate change wrapper.
Well to combat climate change we need a unified global effort because we are on the same planet together. So attacking any one nation isnt helping the fight, it's making it worse.
Sure, that's true. However, the US alone has emitted 25% of all CO2 by all mankind and more than any country in history despite having a small fraction of the worlds population and it's also blocked many international emissions standards with the argument that it puts the US at a disadvantage to EMs. The US has both contributed most to climate change and blocked the most progress.
I think the best case scenario, however is we stop playing the blame game and actually collectively get our act together.
It should be a competition in who can do the most and excel the most rather than who sucks the most.
