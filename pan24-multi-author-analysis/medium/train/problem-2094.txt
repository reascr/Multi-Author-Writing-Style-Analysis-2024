More importantly, I think, is the understanding of sexual predation amongst its leadership. This is hard one to overcome because of the nature of hierarchy; in general, leadership is older. Their academic knowledge of a given subject can be antiquated. When combined with the tendency to forgive sinful behaviors and accept genuine repentance we can have a recipe for disaster. Particularly when the predator is particularly adept at manipulation… which they often are.
Years ago I remember learning that catholic clergy as a group were slightly less likely to engage in abuse than the general population. In other words, grab ten priests and ten people you know and the odds of a predator amongst the folks you know would be slightly higher.
Where does that number come from? I read the article and I don’t see a source, and at one point it mentions there are “22 cases being legally pursued” and “there are 40 more that are too old to be prosecuted…” wildly inconsistent with the headline claim. Pretty much it just says in the first few sentences that there were 330000 victims in a “recent report” and that information isn’t backed up in any way for the rest of the article.
