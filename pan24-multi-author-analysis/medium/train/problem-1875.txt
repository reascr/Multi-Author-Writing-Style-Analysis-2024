This is exactly what happened, and probably the reason for his announcement. The EU let Hungary know that the expected decision to release the so far blocked cohesion funds on December 5 is now postponed to next year. It is generally assumed that Orbán is using his vote in the NATO expansion as a bargaining chip. Trying to strenhen his hand for next year, or just tit for tat "if you delay ill delay too" is the most plausible explanation.
I think Putin is actually planning on attacking Finland and telling Orban to promise to ratify but wait until Russia causes a border disturbance enough to render Finland ineligible for NATO membership.
I mean given how shitty Russia has been at strategic decision making lately I can almost believe that's what they were thing because it's so fucking dumb.
Finland and Sweden already have NATO guarantees that they will be treated as NATO members if attacked. There’s no benefit in this except for Turkey and Hungary trying to get concessions.
The long term goal for Orbán to keep Orbán in power. Anything else is pretty much a sidequest at most. The EU has been used as a faraway bogeyman in internal HU politics for years now. So for the public nothing would have changed perceptually if the EU would really try to punish Hungary.
