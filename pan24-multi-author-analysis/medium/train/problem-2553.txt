It's a bigger problem than just the mistreatment of labor. The whole industry is dysfunctional. It's more dangerous now than it was decades ago, slower, less efficient, and inconsistent. And freight rails fuck ups in turn fuck up passenger rail. It's a whole mess but it doesn't matter so long as that short term growth and profit keeps going up.
Oh boy, can't wait to hear "We HaD nO iDeA tHiS wOuLd HaPpEn!" when people continue to leave en masse and our rail infrastructure decays more and becomes even more unsafe because those that remain are over worked.
