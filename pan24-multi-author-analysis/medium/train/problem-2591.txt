Someone who is a serial rapist, he doesn't change after being locked up for a few years. The rape urge hasn't gone away. You release him, someone else is getting raped. I know you can't charge people with future crime but I think that after you've demonstrated the capacity to do it, future victims do need to be considered.
Sent to prison for child porn, released after four months and heads to Cambodia where he gets kicked out for diddling kids, goes to Vietnam and spends 2 /2 years in a Vietnamese prison for diddling more kids, then returns home to the UK and does it to three more girls. He gets 16 years for that, but they let him out after 8. Why? So he can have one last diddle of an innocent child before he dies of old age? Lock his ass back up.
Pretty much where I'm at. And even if he was too old to be a risk, putting him in jail isn't just to protect future children but to punish him for the ones already harmed. I think staying there until he dies is a good solution. Why let him out?
If he wasn't given a life sentence as he should have been, fine. The law's the law. But why let him out after half the sentence is served? There shouldn't be early release for this sort of thing.
