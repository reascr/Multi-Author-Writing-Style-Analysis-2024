You can condemn it, sure, but getting all upset is doing exactly what they want. They're trying to get a response. Just ensure your response is in your best interest. Someone says the N word? Film it, get them fired. Smacking them in the face gets you an assault charge. Someone burns a flag? Meh, it's their flag. They paid for it. Let that sucker burn, there's a shit load more of them. Getting in there and fighting someone in order to put it out will land you in the ER. Heck, maybe you can get the fire department to fine them for an uncontained fire or something. It's not about not responding, it's about ensuring you don't fall into the trap they have set very obviously, with no effort at all to hide, right in front of you. They want an emotional response, not a rational one. An emotional person will act in ways that will show them in a poor light.
One cop claims to have caught a less than second glimpse of the driver, and they grabbed some lower caste guy and sentenced him to life in prison off that alone...
