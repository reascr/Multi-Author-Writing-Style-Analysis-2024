True pacifists would support withering sanctions on the Russian regime that are actually enforced, with them only being lifted after a full withdrawal from Ukraine or a negotiated settlement.
I also like the version of pacifism that involves destroying as much of the Russian invasion force as it takes to stop them being able to continue their invasion.
I appreciate everyone having their own opinion but these people (Alice Schwarzer & Sarah Wagenknecht) offer no solution to the problem at all.

Fuck them and how they enable a genocidal murder state.
