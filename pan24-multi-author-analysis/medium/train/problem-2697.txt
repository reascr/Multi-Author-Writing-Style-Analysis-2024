I think what’s missing is that the Germans actually set up a repair camp in Slovakia for their gear in ukraine. For United States to give the Abrams they’d basically have to do the same, but inside ukraine near the front. This is why everyone hopes ukraine will get leopards. Which they should, with Bradley’s. Abrams would be nice, but not practical…it’s like giving them a bunch of aircraft carriers….by the time they figure out how to use them effectively, the wars over.
I was wondering about the Bradleys. You go through three months of Bradley school and then normally work your way from driver, to gunner, then commander. Officers go through other schools. Then the mechanics need to be trained. Then you need a logistics chain with spare parts. Then you need to support all those folks.
And the Bradley is more complicated now than when I commanded one 30 years ago. There are computers and other stuff.
That is a beautiful list! Thanks for that. So the rough total could be close to 2000 armour. Granted a lot of that will be spread along the borders. Hopefully some f-16s will enter the mix.
From what I understand, ukraine has captured about 500 APCs from Russia, and will receive another 100 plus from NATO. Hopefully the challengers and Bradley’s (with luck the leopards) will all combine into a force large enough to push back the Russian hoards.
