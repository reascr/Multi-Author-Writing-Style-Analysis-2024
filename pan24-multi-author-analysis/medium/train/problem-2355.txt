How does Putin expect to win? I’m genuinely curious at this point. I don’t think they’ve gained any ground in 6 months, constantly losing troops and equipment. The enemy is increasingly better trained, equipped, and motivated as the war continues.
That may sound flippant or hyperbolic, but it's the only way he'll win, it's a strategy that has been used before, and his latest tactics of destroying all civilian infrastructure point in that direction. I don't think he'll prevail, but he may keep trying for years to come.
At this point, just giving up without any gains means his ouster and likely death so it's keep it going or nothing. As far as how he hopes to achieve that, the best case scenario for Russia is that Western countries stop funding Ukraine's defense through a combination of fatigue and a global recession that makes constantly sending out billions in aid far less palatable to those countries and their people. Ukraine is heavily dependent on Western aid. That happens and Russia manages to get the upper hand then Ukraine may see themselves backed into a corner where they don't have too much choice except to concede some territory or face millions of deaths.
Putin plans to eliminate the civilian population by making the nation uninhabitable, eventually leaving nothing but scorched earth. He wants the land and resources, and the geographic buffer it provides for Russia. He's already stolen a couple of hundred thousand children that he can use to repopulate the land.
He doesn't see reality as it is. He sees himself as Jesus of Kremlin and Ukrainians as Satan's demons from hell. He will happily send everyone in his country to death to not submit to the boogeyman of the fantasy he lives in.
