Qatar funds terrorists worldwide, this was the base accusation for a Saudi led boycott against qatar which turned out to be true after investigations but was quickly tossed in the bin as they have an American military base and backing. This news company al Jazeera is also a qatar owned company and is know to push propaganda world wide they have been caught pushing different narratives on the same news in different languages, you can search "Nas daily Al Jazeera" on YouTube for more info on this . And at last there is a whisper in the intelligence community world wide that qatar does not have their own foreign agents as they pay terrorists to do their dirty work which cannot be tracked to them.
TBH it is weird the cartoonists went for "terrorists". If they'd had the Qatar team being chased by men with whips it'd be more direct and harder to criticise as simple racism.
If its depicting the players as terrorists, I hope they've at least linked all the players to clandestine financial activities at least. If not, then it is racist because the players aren't terrorists. The government and elites would be.
