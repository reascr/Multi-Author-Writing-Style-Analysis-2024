Mr. DeSantis deserves full credit for identifying problems: He will never succeed in his dreams of power if his state produces too many intelligent educated people.
I still can’t understand why the students didn’t shut down the campus and the faculty doesn’t strike. When they tried to raise tuition at my public university, the students took over the main administration and blocked everyone from the president on down from entering.
Everything I’ve read about the school makes it sound like there would be massive support and participation in a walkout and strike.
Also, I had no idea what a good school it was. And I’m intentionally using the past tense there, because the quality of the school is going to nosedive after this.
There's like 700 students and Florida might be one of the least strike friendly states in America-- but even if conditions were more favorable, this is not just a case of tuition being raised by a school board who might back down to pressure. Responding to such an openly fascist hostile takeover isn't easy. Blitzing your opponents harshly and swiftly with institutional support is incredibly effective.
