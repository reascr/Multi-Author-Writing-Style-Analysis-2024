Considering that the Israeli government has been committing war crimes against Palestine, it seems a little disingenuous to bring Holocaust Remembrance Day into it, which comes with the implication that this was some sort of hate crime and not a response action in an ongoing conflict.
You don't know anything about what's going on between Palestine and Israel, do you? If you did, you would not have written this. It's not about them being Jewish, it's about them being Israeli - again, because the conflict which has been ongoing for decades has been riddled with war crimes on Israel's part, and Palestine cannot be expected not to respond. War is messy. And for the record, many Jewish people are among those who condemn the actions of the Israeli government.
Of course it is a hate crime! Did the targets at the synagogue have anything to do with the ongoing conflict? Did the shooter recognize his targets from his moving car? All he knew was that he'd probably kill Jewish people. Jewish people who were most likely at the synagogue remembering a time when people were killing, simply for being Jewish.
Did you get this mad when the Israeli army was killing Palestinian journalists and interrupting their funeral processions? Did you get this mad on behalf of the ten (including one elderly woman) killed by Israeli forces in the Jenin camp only yesterday? Or is your ire reserved solely for acting righteously (and erroneously) indignated on Reddit? Because the Israel/Palestine conflict is a really fucking messy one, and these are not the first people to die in it. And they won't be the last, either.
