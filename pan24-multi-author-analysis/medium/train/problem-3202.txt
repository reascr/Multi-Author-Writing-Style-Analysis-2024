Propaganda by other russians. The problem is that russians believe their own lies, because most of them are too morally corrupt to care about the truth.
Yeah… I don’t think a lot of people from privileged backgrounds fully understand that a hard life leads to hard, unsympathetic, immoral people. The abused become the abuser, as it were.
Yeah, I always think that. I had an fucked up childhood, probably worse than 90% of people. And I would consider myself an empathetic person. I believe my childhood made me more empathetic, to be honest.
I'm definitely not a perfect person, but I resist this idea that if you come from dysfunction, you're just hopeless. It's just not true. Yes, a lot of people get abused, or go through neglect or whatever, and end up being addicts or alcoholics, and basically sink. But , it's not guaranteed.
It’s not, behavior and upbringing are certainly a big piece of what makes up a person but your genetics make up a big portion too. It’s like how some people can smoke every day and get lung cancer and some people can smoke every day and live to 103.
Oh for sure it can be organic. I’m saying that people aware of their own suffering and powerlessness develop a certain darkness that would terrify a therapist. And Russia is s country full of abused humans.
