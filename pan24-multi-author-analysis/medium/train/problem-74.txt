You are asking the wrong question. Indian government has taken a clear stand from the beginning supporting peace. in the name of sanctions, the market for oil has become unfavourable for low and middle income countries, While the high income countries enjoy with the wealth they plundered for 2 and half centuries. India would have stopped trade if European countries did it. But no, Europe continues to import large amounts of oil and paying back in euros. In fact, Europe buys more oil from Russia in one day than what india buys for the whole month. Why is there such double standards? Also, now since the Europe is under attack, everyone has empathy for Ukraine. Where was this empathy for India when we were invaded by Pakistan and china? Indo-pakistan war has been going on for 75 years now, and so is with china... The world said "deal with it" to India when china annexed the whole Tibet region. Why is that right but it's wrong when Indian leaders keep the interests of Indian citizens first?
Your title makes it seem like India is doing it - when it's a handful of company. And even then this article is a nothingburger.
