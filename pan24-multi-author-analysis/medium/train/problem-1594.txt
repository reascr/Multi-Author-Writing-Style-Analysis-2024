Ukraine is a mix of old war tactics, 1980s war tactics and technology, and new age capabilities including drones and cellphone tracking and social media.
I think the first 'drone war' will be one fought primarily by remote/automated technologies. The Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict was a glimpse. Hopefully this tension over South China Sea and Taiwan simmers down, or we're likely to find out very soon.
CSIS has been screaming for years to the government that the nation has consistently been a easy target to foreign actors. Not sure if the government will take any action for this current warning, as they never seemed to care.
You’re correct in saying that CSIS has been screaming about this for years. This is an intelligence issue, though, so what the government is doing is not broadcast on CBC. Just because we don’t get regular updates on TV doesn’t mean they are not working hard. I’m sure they are. It’s a bit unusual to publicize something like this, but that could be part of the mind game that is an intelligence operation.
Similarly, people have sounded the alarm that much of the money pouring into BC for the last decade or more is coming from Asia. CSIS is well aware of this, and I’m certain that they have been watching very closely.
Csis is to Canada to what rental security is to grocery stores in Canada in regards to this shit. Basically glorified note takers.
