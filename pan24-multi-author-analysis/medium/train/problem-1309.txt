The EC president is elected by the EP, but the Council nominates candidates to be voted on. This nomination could be seen as merely ceremonial, or a formality as a safety mechanism of last resort so the Council could step in to prevent a potential despot from getting elected. In this interpretation, it's analogous to how the PM is nominated by the monarch in the UK, how the German president nominates a candidate for chancellor for the Bundestag to vote on, or along the lines of how its technically the Electoral College that elects the president in the US.
It was the European Council, or rather, Macron (with Orban's support) blocking the Council from nominating Weber. Here's about this.
I'm still mad. Nobody voted her. The CDU backstabbed the guy the majority voted for and just took her instead and were like "well you all voted CDU and not the candidate if we are technically".
You can think of the Commission (EC) as the cabinet, and its president as the prime minister. The Council represents the member states, seating its heads of government/state. Very roughly, its the upper house, the senate to the EU parliament (EP), which is the lower house.).
