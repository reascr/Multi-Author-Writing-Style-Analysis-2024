While Biden may have mishandled documents, Trump likely intended to misuse them in criminal schemes or to create political leverage. He also was hosting documents at a resort where many people had access.
No one should have any classified documents in their home, in their garage, at their resort, etc. There needs to be better custodian of these documents.
With that said, Biden has been very transparent about this whereas Trump and his attorney's have lied, deceived, and refused to cooperate.
