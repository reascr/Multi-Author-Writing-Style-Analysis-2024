To be clear, the “boosting of Maga Republicans” that we are talking about is running an add during Republican primaries that said “Doug Mastriano is too conservative for Pennsylvania”.
Basically the same thing happened in Maryland. Ooh bad Democrats pointing out that Cox's brand of crazy isn't good for moderate Maryland. It's on the Republicans if they can't get behind an electable candidate.
There were no lies. It clearly stated who was paying for the ad. When it comes to election shenanigans I don’t know why we are even talking about this.
