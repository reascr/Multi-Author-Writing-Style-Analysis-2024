Dude was monogamous for 25 years and when his first wife dies he just goes off the rails, has a midlife crisis, and marries a dozen women decades his younger (one of whom is like 6, but he waits until she's 9 to rape her so it's fine.) Great guy.

They say women should dress modestly to not tempt men, and so if the men do get tempted, then the women are only getting what they encouraged.
