Which is really stupid because if you pay to keep cities nice, then you get more and better businesses there, and more tourism, and more money is spent and you'd get even more tax money to spend on both city and rural areas. Everyone could win if your goal wasn't just to hurt liberals who live in cities.

Here's a big issue - cities and people in cities pay like 90% of state taxes that are collected. But who runs the state is not decided by popular vote or by share of taxes paid. It's decided by gerrymandered districts that heavily favor rural areas who pay just a little bit of the taxes. Then those lawmakers decide how to spend those taxes, and refuse to put enough money into the cities to keep them running well.
