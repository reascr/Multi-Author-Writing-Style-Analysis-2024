Could you elaborate on this secular military element? What types of people do you envision this dissenting secular military population consisting of? This is where I get tripped up trying to follow you.
I’m curious, and maybe not informed enough. I figured in these scenarios in a currently theocratic country like Iran that simply another religious leader would likely fill the void and try to at least go through the motions of holding actual democratic elections with whoever wants to run on the ballot (ideally), and tell people what they want to hear otherwise.
This, as much as people on Reddit like to shit on the guy running Iran before the revolution, he at least tried to liberalize the country and did some reforms to help people:
I’m not sure it’d necessarily be an improvement. Some form of representative government would be better, but any sort of authoritarian government is a roll of the dice. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not for the theocracy sticking around, but don’t assume anything going into a potential revolution.
