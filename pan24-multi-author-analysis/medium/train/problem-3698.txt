China has some pretty powerful tools at its disposal for keeping its citizens in check. Everything from indoctrination of schoolchildren about how great the communist party is to tracking people via electronic surveillance. The whole system is built to keep the peace no matter the cost.
Short answer is no. China is China today exactly because of the ironfisted ruling for sooo many decades. To keep >a billion people in check for so many years is no simple feat. Of cos one cannot say never say never but the CCCP will almost always certainly come up tops because they control everything within China and especially now with the entire nation monitored, it will be even harder for the people to revolt in full force. The only hope is that Xi will for some miracle decide to reverse the zero covid mandate.

Even when people can see how bad things are, many are still too afraid to speak out to critically of them for fear of getting imprisoned for it. So it's not going to change without genuine widespread open revolt imo.
