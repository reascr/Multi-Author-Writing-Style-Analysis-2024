Because if she threatens to caucus with Republicans then the Senate composition would be 50-50 again with Kamala as the tiebreaker. This would mean Dems would have to enter a power sharing agreement with Repubs and share committee assignments. Sinema is trying to make a power play here, what a piece of shit.
Edit: It is not possible for Arizona to recall her, but I wonder if this would work: Dems find serious dirt on her and push for her impeachment and removal. With Hobbs as governor, she could appoint her replacement.
