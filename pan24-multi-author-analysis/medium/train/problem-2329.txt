I'm seeing a lot of people posting about the democratic party donations from FTX. Just wanted to bring to light that this isn't just a one sided company that was donating to a single party.

r/conservative banned me for spam since I was trying to post this information to people commenting. They only seem to care about the side where SBF, co-CEO, donated millions to dems. There's more to this story than that. Not many people knew about Ryan, but he was just as powerful and influential as SBF.
Ryan Salame, co-CEO of FTX was a massive republican donor too. He gave $24m to Republicans this midterm cycle alone.
Let's be empathetic towards the millions of investors that lost money from these absolute crooks involved with FTX. Rather than focusing on political sides.
