Meh, they're still protecting him. This article makes it sound like he lied about graduating from college, and embellished his experience working with large financial institutions, but in reality it went a lot deeper than that. His entire work history was a lie, and I haven't dug too deep into it, but his financial situation raises a ton of important questions that he doesn't address here. If the Post wanted to bury him, they easily could have - they didn't even mention his arrest in Brazil for check fraud - but they choose not to. It seems like Republicans are just going to ignore Santos and hope people move on, unless of course he stops reliably voting with their agenda in the House. Unfortunately, that will come as a surprise to exactly no one.
