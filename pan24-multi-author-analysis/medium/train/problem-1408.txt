Biggest problem is that even if you don't buy apple, which i don't, the alternatives aren't much better, and anyone saying you don't need a smart phone in today's world are pretty disingenuous or naive. I would gladly pay more for a phone made in the west at higher standards, but they are not really on the market or at least i have not found one.
Lots of speculation in this thread about what a no-slavery/no-worker-abuse phone would cost, and here we have a concrete example!
This is fascinating, thank you for posting it. I had no idea there was a smart phone made in the US.
This doesn't really solve the problem of needing a smartphone though. If they barely have any apps, even the open source and privacy centric ones, then the phone is pretty much useless for the average person.
I haven't looked much into this, but the comment complaining about being "google based" is so far off lol.
Android is open source and is widely supported by application makers. No one is making apps for a different random OS. That's the original point here, having a modern smartphone has become 'necessary' in a lot of places and that's specifically because of the apps that you need.
There are also versions of android without relying on google services if that's what you want, it's just that a lot of people would prefer having google services than otherwise. So it's better for them to start with that version and let users swap it when they want to.
