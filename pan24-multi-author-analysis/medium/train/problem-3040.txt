If my company had slides and arcades and all that sure it would be cool, but I’m an adult and don’t really think I would utilize a slide for fun or hopping on tetris at my corporate job lol.
People give them flack for showing off their workplace, but it doesn’t mean they don’t work hard. Some of the perks like free food, are to keep you in the office, thus working longer/harder.
She said she was gonna grow her plant selling business on Etsy... Or maybe become a chiropractor. Something tells me she wasn't supposed to be working there to begin with.
There's some kind of office near my work. Big ol grand lunch room , wall to ceiling windows. Absolutely great view of the bay boardwalk. Arcade cabinets, all kinds of stuff.
There’s a software company that famously has a gorgeous campus, with slides and a treehouse and all kinds of super cool conference rooms. It looks like a blast, but it’s actually incredibly stressful and miserable from what I’ve heard.
Indeed I am talking about Epic . I used to work for a competitor of theirs and Epic was always like the main goal everyone wanted to get to. Then I learned about how awful it really was there.
I worked for one of your competitors . I still instinctively look at each doctor’s EHR when I go there, but I’m glad I don’t have to hear about how much they hate MACRA etc… anymore lol.
I fully agree with everything you said. I work for a company that has lots of cool perks and is definitely a millennial/gen z vibe, but we work really hard and give great output. The idea is we want to attract and keep the best people. Good people can jump from job to job for a higher salary, but we have a vibe that makes people want to stay.
My company is good to me, so in turn, I give them my best work because I want to keep working here and I’m super happy here. We also frequently make those Best Places to World list which then brings us recognition and attracts top talent.
