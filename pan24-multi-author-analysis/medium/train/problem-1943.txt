Tbf tho, if my rep is SOTH then yeah, if I didn’t know better I would think that would be a boon for my community. Too bad Kevin lives with Frank Luntz when he’s not banging MTG in Congress and has no fucks to give his district.

Yup, he inexplicably dropped out even though Congress signaled that a majority of them didn’t believe the rumors, which means it was true or there was more to be found. I think that’s what happened w/Al Franken tbh, it was a complete set up (chick in the photo is Hannity’s friend) but I had to wonder if there was more. He was in show business. Or something he didn’t want his wife to know. IMHO.
