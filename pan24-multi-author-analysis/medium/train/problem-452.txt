Hence why Texas is simultaneously one election from flipping and a dozen at the same time. Demographics are moving democrat, but the election becomes correspondingly more rigged every election to compensate. It's not impossible we'll see a situation where Texas flips blue in presidential and gubernatorial elections, but highly unlikely we'll see it flip in federal or state legislature elections. Not unless Gerrymandering is federally regulated.
