I imagine a scenario in which conservatives finally decide we should do something about climate change... And this will be the answer they reach for.
That is what I was worrying about. I was wondering if anybody had done reviews on their research and math, and signed off on something that, if done wrong, could have cataclysmic consequences. Is Dr. Doom or Lex Luthor the Founder of this startup?
This is an interesting ethical scenario. Should a government, which holds the power to, yet does next to nothing to seriously make a difference to emissions and pollution, have the right to condemn another entity which is taking action, regardless of the motivation?
I feel it's irrelevant that they are for-profit, especially when the vast majority of the private sector literally works against humanity's interests when unregulated.
I have no doubt that those are the findings because such research would consider the worst-case outcome, which I agree would be disastrous. I haven't seen the literature myself.
