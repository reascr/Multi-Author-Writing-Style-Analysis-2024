But seriously though, if things get worse, illegal actions will become necessary, but there‚Äôs still a lot of stuff that can be done within the bounds of legality before it comes to that.
Lmfao yes can you imagine being Christian and believing god gave you amazing ways to express yourself and live during your short-ass 80 years on earth but somehow ur sure this is forbidden.
Can we all just stop a beat and acknowledge how fcking surreal all of this is? One of our two major political parties is outright and openly targeting innocent groups of American citizens. And the only thing anyone is doing about it is reminding each other to vote. Obviously of course vote but we worry too much about the possible future and lose sight of how really bad things already are. Vote and cross your fingers is an abnormal under-reaction and should be unacceptable to still be relying on. We need to be demanding more from everyone with any modicum of power.
Sorry for the rant; it‚Äôs just you‚Äôre üíØ right. And it feels crazy how many people still refuse to face that fact that the GOP will never stop because so far they already aren‚Äôt stopping.

That‚Äôs the thing tho. I read their shitty comments on articles and I read the random r/conservative posts that other subs laughing at them post because I want to see wtf they‚Äôre talking about doing now. And so far on this I haven‚Äôt actually seen any wondering or surprise. Nobody even actually questions if that‚Äôs ‚Äúfake news‚Äù or whatever. What I see them saying is shit about ways they can get the people against them not to be able to vote or just real ugly, hateful/violent shit directed at us. And that‚Äôs a lot scarier.
