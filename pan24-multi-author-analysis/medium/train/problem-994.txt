"This week ends with embattled Rep.-elect George Santos the center of a firestorm of controversy. Duke University Political Science professor Dr. Ahmed Surkassian thinks time is not on the New York Republican's side. Speaking to the AP, Dr. Surkassian noted 'Santos is always talking shit' and was in fact 'a tool' who once told Surkassian that 'his (Santos) cousin Rob works for Nintendo' and gave him 'a hyper-alpha build of Super Smash Bros. that includes a bikini mode for Princess Peach'.".
