True enough. They’d like to take us back to the good ol days where you could own another human and brown people knew their place, and women put up with whatever abuse was dished out because their only purpose in life was the cook, clean, and bear children.
I feel like this is to get around pesky things like the government saying you can’t teach that brown people are bad and that the holocaust was a hoax. Also it drives women back out of the workforce. No school, no abortion, let’s get women back to the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant and complete our back slide to the 1950’s.
We have so many other countries they could choose from if they’d like to live under religious law. Why can’t they just pick one of those, and go there?
