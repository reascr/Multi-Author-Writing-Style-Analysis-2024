Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela are two sovereign, independent countries, so why the hell would they need a license from the US to cooperate with each other?
The licence only relates to US sanctions on Venezuela. The sanctions mean the US will punish anyone who does business with that country. The licence just allows Trinidad and Tobago to negotiate with Venezuela and extract the gas without being punished, so long as no money goes to Venezuela. As the article notes, it's going to be a problem getting a deal to work with the no-money limitation.
Nobody is claiming that Venezuela doesn't have sovereignty over these offshore resources. They're free to develop them themselves, or to negotiate with third parties to develop them, or to refuse anyone else access to them. The trick is that, right now, any third parties involved will have problems if they also want to do business with the US, due to their sanctions.
They aren't as influential. They even requested that license. Just because you're a sovereign country doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. If the US has more influence and resources, then they have to consider that.
