Sounds like someone is selling fake passports for travel. And whoever buys them will likely have a bunk passport that wonâ€™t even work. Imagine trying to flee your country and you get taken for your livelihood.
Sounds more like the Russians are colonizing and a few smart ones used the opportunity to leave. The bureaucracy is in shambles and likely won't recover. They can more easily hide assets as a Ukrainian. By design for folks who want to stay as well. Russia wants rich Russians to rebuild ukraine and get richer doing it.
Have you heard of this secret plan, it's called the Great Swapping. Russian will move in swap the real population, which is already dwindling due to low birth rates and then just hammer down the flag. Georgiy Sorosoff is paying the tab. Look it up.
Having lots of Russians in your country is dangerous. For starters, Russia uses the presence of Russian speakers as a basis to claim rights to otherwise sovereign territory. Plus, most of these people fleeing are absolutely part of the problem. They support the corruption and political violence. They support Putin. They just don't like that they are feeling the consequences of those decisions. The last thing most western nations should want is a bunch of Russians who don't really believe in democracy or equitable governance suddenly flooding through their borders. It's a recipe for massive internal instability.
Russia has been led by nothing but corrupt oligarchs in some for or fashion in a basically unbroken line since Ivan the Terrible. This isn't some unique period of bad Russian governance; this is just another iteration of the Russian norm. It's not due to some existential curse, but rather is the result of a people who not only tolerate such corruption and malfeasance but often warmly embrace it.
