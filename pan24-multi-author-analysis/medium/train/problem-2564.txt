Vaccinated three times, masking in public, no gym only restaurants. My daughter went to a birthday party by some friends and came back with a surprise. All the family got it.
Yeah i have a coworker who is 3x vaccinated and has had it 3x thanks to his kids. I'm 4x vaccinated and have never had it, sibling got it for the first time last week! We spend a lot of time together, had just been out shopping together but I haven't tested positive yet and feel fine. (knock on wood). My turn might be nigh though seems everyone is getting it this round.
