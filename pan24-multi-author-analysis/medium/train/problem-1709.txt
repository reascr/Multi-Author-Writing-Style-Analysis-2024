I agree, but the one above us simplifying it by just calling them Nazis is just a Russian propaganda talking point. It's difficult to understand how some people even entertain this narrative.
Aren't these basically just another case of Osttruppen because the Nazis regarded the Slavs as sub-human but needed more bodies?
I'm a little confused since the 14th Grenadier Division (Galicia SS) was part of the Waffen SS that was founded by Nazi Germany and Ukrainian collaborators. That was the badge used by people who fought for fascists. Maybe they are not who they used to be now but the correct move would be to adopt a new symbol.
Do not attempt to invade Canada. We tried it a couple times. Turns out Canadians are polite because they can afford to be.
I agree with you fully it's important to talk about. I just don't like oversimplifications when we are talking about something like this. Many will want to or are going to simplify a situation where many don't even understand how the Nazi's viewed these people.
