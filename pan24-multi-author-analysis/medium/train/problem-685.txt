It’s interesting living here. The “moderate” Republican voters all like to talk a big game how they “don’t actually like trump” but these same people almost always end up having no problem pulling the lever for a DePerno, Karamo, Gibbs, Dixon this past election cycle. This news here of putting Karamo the nutbag in charge solidifies ‘24 the MI GOP will be propping up mostly MAGA candidates that will probably lose again like before, and I can’t wait to see all these R voters maybe actually move to Florida for good like they’ve been talking lately of doing. Get your popcorn ready.
