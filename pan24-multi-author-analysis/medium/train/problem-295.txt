You could argue something like NHS is socialist, because the industry itself is run by the state, but no way you can call the German system socialist, for example.
Aren't the old Cubans the rich plantation owners that fled after the workers rebelled during the revolution. Dole was so pissed that convinced the US Gov to blockade the island? I'm sure I've gotten that wrong...
Initially, yes, but a lot.of Cubans have come over since then. Most of the ones here, harbor some sort of hatred for the Communist regime. The right has managed to package any and all things that are government funded as Socialism. The truth is most people don't understand what Socialism is at its core. They don't see, how there is Socialism for the wealthy, while the rest of scrounge around for peanuts.
There is no such thing as socialism for the rich. The government giving people things isn't socialism. Socialism is worker/public control over the means of production (factories, warehouses, office buildings, etc). The welfare state is perfectly compatible with capitalism.
