Easy you can argue all day long who the best basketball player is or was. Gretzky is light years ahead of anybody. He is the most dominant player in any team sport in history.
Show me a player anywhere in the world whoâ€™s had there jersey number retired by the entire league? Cause nobody will ever wear 99 again.
They literally changed basketball rules because of Wilt Chamberlain and he scored 100 points in a game.
I say this as a big hockey fan who had a tremendous amount of respect for Gretsky, but these sorts of debates are stupid.
They took out the 2 line passes because of Gretzky and implemented the offsetting penalties to try and slow him down. Plus after the Oilers would be ahead 7 or 8 goals they would almost bench Gretzky so the other team donâ€™t get embarrassed lol.
That wasnâ€™t a rule change from the NHL. but in hockey when you embarrass a team people start to get hurt so they would take his big playing minutes away ðŸ¤·.
But the real fuck the Edmonton oilers came the year we traded Gretzky to the LA kings they put the 2 line pass back in play. So in other words fuck Edmonton and as soon as heâ€™s traded to LA they gave him that advantage back lol.
yeah, its like saying Michael Phelps is the best olympian of all time. How do you compare different sports and different amounts of medals that can be earned?
I would even go so far and say you cant fairly compare athletes from different generations in the same sport.
