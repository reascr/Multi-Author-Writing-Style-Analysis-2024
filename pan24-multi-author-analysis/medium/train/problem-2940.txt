Yeah. Duh. If this was a conventional-only type of conflict, NATO could wipe out every Russian position within 100 km of Ukraine within 24 hours. Russia can flex all they want with the nuclear threats. They’re empty threats. If they use one nuclear weapon, no matter how small, it’s the end of the Russian regime as we know it. If they go balls to the wall, first-strike, all out nuclear attack, they have no conventional forces to go and seize or capitulate their targets. Their goose is cooked and it’s only a matter of time. Right now we’re waiting on them to spend themselves so broke that their population starves and revolts, or Putin dies, or both.
Putin is probably also now doubting Russia's nuclear capabilities, too. Especially if they had to conduct some sort of large scale nuclear offensive. And knew that NATO nuclear weapons were going to be flying back at them.
It's probably the truth. The whole Europe want to kick his ass. The only reason Putin can do this is because they have nuke. He's a fucking mentally ill bully hiding behind daddy's nukes.
