if it was just one protest? sure - but with a slowdown in economic growth the state might decide to cut more social spending which is a big part of why the populace has not risen up before. People accept a curtailing of civil liberties more easily if they benefit from society as a whole. If people do not have enough money then they get pissed at the government and if the government as it is used to responds with violence the people get angrier.
You pay every month for something most people rarely need, and on the off chance you do need a major medical expense paid they fight tooth and nail to avoid covering it. Sounds like a scam to me.
I've never had this experience in my life. For example my medication (which has to be bought every three months) costs â‚¬2.7k. I never had to pay a dime for any procedures or medications. Don't know where you're problem is.
Yeah I don't know nearly enough about other country's healthcare to speak on them, I just know I've had some frustrating experiences in the US. Currently have a $5k bill for a medicine I'm supposed to take every 8 weeks that I haven't paid and haven't been able to refill for months as a result. The medication is $24k before insurance and the rest is usually covered by a copay assistance program but they have an anual limit so the remainder is supposed to be covered by ANOTHER program I had to enroll in through my employer and none of them will pay the 5k.
