I'm actually hoping a complete loss is enough to humiliate Russia away from their unearned nationalism.
You think LOSING is going to discourage mindless, fanatic nationalists? One of the biggest factors of the rise of fascism in Nazi Germany was the loss of WWI. "Our glorious army would have won the war if they weren't stabbed in the back by the civilian government.".
Russia... has not been winning at all. It's a bit harder to swing when they are losing to a much smaller nation rather than winning for three years against larger nations (counting the colonies).
Originally it was stabbed in the back by the government, and that was becoming popular even in 1919. The Jews were added to the mix by the Nazis when it became a "world wide conspiracy".
Of course, Germany was mainly able to do this because their army was, outside of the 100 days, not defeated. They had won from 1914-1917, and even knocked Russia out. They were even winning for part of 1918.
And that would be a valid argument... if they weren't exhausted from the Brusilov offensive and pushed far back into their own territory. If you look at the it would be easy to say that Russia wasn't pushed back near as far as the Soviets, however WW1 was not WW2- it was a more traditional war not a war of extermination. And Russia had lost almost every battle with Germany.
Heck, look at where Russia attacked a distracted Germany early in the war and lost, horribly. Russia in WW1 was a story of defeat after defeat, with their only successes being against the even more backwards Austria Hungary, and that was a large reason for the revolution, no different than after the Russo-Japanese war where a similar defeat caused an uprising against the Tsar.
Yes, it even forced him to make a constitution and quite a few reforms, in fact it is cited as a full blown , though the Tsar walked back many of the reforms over time.
