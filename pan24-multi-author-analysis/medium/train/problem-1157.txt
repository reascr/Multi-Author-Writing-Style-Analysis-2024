Kaczy≈Ñski is as morbid as ever in his hatred against Germany. It will do German-Polish relations a great deal of good when he eventually kicks the bucket.
Nothing to see here, just a conservative politician being a conservative politician and spewing nonsense. The article says that the majority of the Polish population does not agree with him on his stance towards Germany.
Need to remember this guy basically runs Poland. The actual senior politicians are just figure heads under this guy.
Unfortunately they can't seem to mount a decent opposition in Poland that isn't mired in controversy or divided.
Unlike trumpets in US, PiS voter base is not entirely demented. They keep voting on them mostly for two reasons - a) they keep giving out money to people via various social programs and keep promising new batches of it every voting season, and b) they are very pro-Catholic and keep targeting them as voters. Despite that less and less people are going to church, there is still a lot of Catholics in Poland and the Church keeps promoting PiS as a party that should be voted on (cause PiS keeps giving the Church money and land). Can't say I agree with them, but y'all need to understand that conservatives in Poland are not the same as in US.
