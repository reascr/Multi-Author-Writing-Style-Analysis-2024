McConnell’s comments come after twice-impeached, twice-popular-vote-losing former President Donald Trump met with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes, a Holocaust denier, white nationalist, and racist who has threatened murder against Jews and expressed approval for the Taliban.
But despite McConnell’s supposed disapproval of antisemitism and white supremacy, he refused to say he wouldn’t support Trump if he wins the 2024 Republican nomination.
In on April 7, 2022 with Axios reporter Jonathan Swan, McConnell was pressed by Swan about his "moral red line" that he wouldn't cross when it came to a Republican nominee for president, this was McConnell's response:
McConnell’s properties have always been self > financiers > party > … > somewhere down the list the country matters, but to be honest, I’ve never heard McConnell actually claim any duty to the country, constitution, or even his constituents. He tends to call them great or important, but never really talks about them in a personal sense. He doesn’t serve the country, state, or his constituents… they’re just tools & backdrop for welding power.
