Yes, it's possible that someone finished their education (or parts of it) and went into the military at an older age. This, however, is rare, since most of the population goes to the military when they're 18 years old. Good examples are doctors. If you've already studied medicine, you will most likely go to the medical reserve officer school and their reservist role will be a wartime doctor. At the same time they can (due to their own or the militarys motivation) become "simple infantrymen" just like everyone else. Same with engineers or any other civilian education. Everyone wins if they get put into positions where their education/experience can be used, but if they go through the military service, whatever their role, they will become soldiers.
My understanding is that Hungary are currently holding up Finlands entry into NATO, because the present rules require unanimity. Maybe NATO need to think about changing that rule ?
He wasn't just a mighty hunter. He was also well known for being a dumbshit who inherited a mighty empire, and then fucked it up by trying to attack an enemy he could never defeat, but planning so poorly that not only did his effort fail, in addition, everything he built literally crumbled apart and his empire broke up into countless small independent states, each with their own languages....
