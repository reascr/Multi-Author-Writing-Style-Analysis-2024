Unfortunately for those green pilots, what Chinas provocative drills don't tell them, is that in a live fire exchange, the majority of those planes won't reach their targets and an even greater majority will not return to base. Got to love these 'leaders' who love to play games with their peoples lives to bolster their own fragile egos, eh Pooh Bear?...
I’m unsure of the name of the YouTube channel but it’s like a mapped battle sim and information is put in with weapon types/ranges/functionality and many of the fights turn real and raw real quick when the deaths mount. It goes in depth of jets diving and averting missiles and accounts for missiles that have better acquisition measures.
Nothing prepares you for the death of your wingmen and the adrenaline of avoiding your own death under fire. There is no accurate way to predict how pilots who have never seen combat will react when their planes start falling from the sky, especially when 'all' your pilots are green. You can game it out all you want, that's just not reality.
