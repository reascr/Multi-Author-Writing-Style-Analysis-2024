Not really. I’m a war between US and China, sure the US wins. But if China were to attack Taiwan, they have a substantially bigger fleet in the region. By the time the rest of the Us navy makes it there, Taiwans probably already captured (based on almost every war simulation ever) …if you’re not counting nukes. At that point every can change.
So it doesn't actually matter if China does try and take Taiwan. We can pretty reliably starve the country.
Exactly this is what people fail to understand. Taiwan isn't about chips, it's about having full access the Pacific and securing their supply lines. It's very easy to contain China because Taiwan is litterally in their way.
Apparently, in your world, China can either teleport one million men in an instant or is able to hide the massive build-up required to successfully invade. Russia couldn't even do it in a land invasion with less personnel, equipment, and ships without being called out about it.
One of the reasons China can't take Taiwan is that the US and other interested parties can blockade the South China Sea and choke out most of china's international trade. That's why China has been trying so hard to invest in overland trade routes with other countries. It's one their biggest weaknesses.
That’s true but irrelevant. I’m describing a scenario where we’re ignoring the external factors and assuming an invasion has begun. Obviously if you bring in geopolitical factors, there’s way more to consider.
