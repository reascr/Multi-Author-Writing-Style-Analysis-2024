I thought that was standard GOP playbook at the local, state, and national level. Is that not why so many awful people who hate education, reading, and basic critical thought run for and take over school boards to begin with?
This is the endgame of the GOP and rich pigs like Betsy DeVos - to end public education and replace it with for profit schools that will make them wealthy.
Property taxes were already an unreliable way of financing public schools. A modern society cannot thrive without an educated population, and every kid deserves access to a decent education. The only problem is in a divided society, seeking a solution elsewhere will only have the effect of politicizing education even further, with one particular demo questioning the value of any education at all outside of their privileged, ideological enclave.
A society that can't agree that an unbiased, factually based and freely available education has value and should be available to all is doomed to regress. And the thought of desiring a new dark ages in the 21st century is mind-boggling.
