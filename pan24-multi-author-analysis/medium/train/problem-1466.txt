Did you point her to those candidates websites or statements? Because at this point none of them are subtle about it so I’m really struggling on how she doesn’t know this by now.
This doesnt make sense to me. The GOP has since Roe v Wade was handed down, targeted that decision. Tons and tons of money and manpower was devoted for over a half-century into reversing that decision. It was no secret. They have plotted for decades to reverse it. If you are such a pro-choice supporter that it makes a difference in how you vote....how the hell were you voting for Republicans in the first place?
My mom has been a Republican her entire life (she’s 50 so young enough to know better) and when I told her that Republican candidates were anti-choice she wouldn’t believe me and said that i must believe in a conspiracy. She said all of her Republican friends are pro-choice so that wouldn’t make any sense. I guess what I’m saying is that you really can’t underestimate how low-info these voters are, they have no idea what’s going on. It’s a sports team to them.
