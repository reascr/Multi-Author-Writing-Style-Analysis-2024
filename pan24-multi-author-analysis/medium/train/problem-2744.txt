Good, pile on the pressure. We can't let them get off scot free for everything they've done, we can't repeat the same mistake we did with russia in the past.
I still think about the night before the downing when there was a post about evacuating from Iran and a redditor said he was worried about his mom trying to leave to go back to Canada…and then the next day I saw the news of the downing and how Canadians were on board. I’ll never know if his mom made it back safely.
$61M for 290 ppl. Assuming each person had 5 close family members that’s 42,000 per grieving person. That’s not that impressive coming from a military that wipes its ass with $100 bills.
I have been valued different at various times - I think the best one was company we built got acquired in Silicon Valley.
Now that’s the valley where your head needs to have been educated for a while, with luck and privilege.
If you look into the space of “value for life” well then it’s a bit off. But the “value for life” metric is like an economic impact and that’s I think over blown for value… since the value is in your spend and growth of an economy .
But that’s an exception let’s look closer - that number they got (above) is actually close to what my life is worth if I die according to the life insurance premiums pay out for wages lost to death. (My kids get a bit more than that if I die) again from my work.
So yeah I’d put myself economically with in this price range (I live in South Africa so usd go way further).
Given that you divided by 5 which is unfair to the value sum the amount received is good recompense according to the numbers.
