In the netherlands it's compounded by absurd workloads being increased over and over with the years. That comes as an effect of the government refusing to spend more on health care and letting health insurers run wild. This in turn makes people not want to bear the responsibility which makes less people pursue the career and makes more people take a freelance approach which eventually decreases quality of care. It's a downward spiral that's not gonna stop by itself. Truly sad to see.
Oh that's not even the issue. It's the fact that schooling is too damn expensive. Good grades help but even people with good grades don't always get scholarships and such.
Why are you lying about the governments refusal to spend more on healthcare and why are fellow dutch reddiors always perpetuating this same lie?
Government expenditure by the dutch government has been increasing drastically for years (faster than population growth).
Well yes they aren't spending literally 0 more no but barely upped the spending even though pandemic.
In recent years hospitals have been consolidated or closed because of which all responsibility for a myriad of issues keeps being shoved onto already overworked GP's (huisartsen). They often cannot in good conscience take responsibility for ever expanding clinics while not making enough money to hire more staff so they either sell their practice to insurers who fill it with freelancers or they shut down because they burn out themselves.
It's a knot of issues that starts with hospitals, then GPs, then insurers who take advantage of the whole thing. The shortest way for a fix would be government spending on subsidies for GP staff so they can actually manage the workload and expanding our hospitals again.
In Italy they have a fixed number of students that can enroll in medicine for some dumb reason, itâ€™s not even a metter of performance.
