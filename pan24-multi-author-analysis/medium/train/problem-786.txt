The smear campaign was conducted by a conservative "dark money" group called the American Accountability Foundation and is an offshoot of the Conservative Partnership Institute which was founded by Jim DeMint, a former Republican politician, former president of the Heritage Foundation, and a leading figure of the Tea Party movement.
The AAF is your typical right-wing dark money group and their opposition research was used to try and derail the appointment of the USA's first black female justice to the United States Supreme Court. They also filed an ethics lawsuit against AOC for attending non-profit gala.
