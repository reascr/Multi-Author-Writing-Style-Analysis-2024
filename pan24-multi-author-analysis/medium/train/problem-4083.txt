Oh no. Never! They are the most honest country in the world. They have never done anything wrong. Its all the USA, EU, and NATO that have forced their hand every step of the way. They are simply defending themselves by invading, sorry, launching a 3Ã—100+ days special military operation in the illegal breakaway state of Ukraine. /S (if anyone were in doubt).
I'll admit, it's a funny hypothetical (imagining Putin's reaction), but you are 100% right. The reality is having embassies and ambassadors present is important for gathering intelligence, like Russia's intentions and their red lines. Both of which are incredibly important for navigating the current crisis without causing WW3.
Everyone knows that is how diplomatic representation works. The host country guarantees the safety of the guest countries' diplomatic corps.
By explicitly asking for it, Finland implicitly points out the Russians are either incapable or unwilling to do so. A very fine insult indeed.
And on the other hand, one can feel smug having issued such a finely tuned insult, even if the barbarians are too dense to comprehend they have been insulted.
