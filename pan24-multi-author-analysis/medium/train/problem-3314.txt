Also idk how much of a linguistic impression a generation or two of Viking rule in parts of England would have made. I think what you got there that’s far more telling is the geographical origins of the Angles and Saxons. They were from northern Germany close to the modern border of Denmark. And, represented to a lesser degree, the migration of the Anglo-Saxons was accompanied by that of the Jutes, who came from northern Denmark. They, at the very least, were an inarguably Scandinavian speaking people. I think it’s safe to say Old English has about as much in common with Old Norse (they were mutually intelligible to a degree as indicated by written records left behind by Alfred the Great) as it does with more southern Germanic languages.
With Lavrov, I get the feeling that he and the rest of the Russian leadership actually believes what comes out of his own mouth, which is much more worrisome.
Even if they don't, they are afraid to outwardly express their thoughts or act against the rhetoric. Also, many Russian people do believe it, which means the show goes on anyway, so it's all the same.
