Parallel lines equation would be ax+by+c1=0 and ax+by+c2=0 where constant are not equal but coincident lines would be ax+by+c=0 and ax+by+c=0 where constant are equal.
secondly: you're assuming flat-space, which works in a graph, on paper, but that's an assumption. there's a whole range of options for non-euclidean space, and general relativity itself shows that straight lines can end up curved. gravity itself, is just the tendency for objects to move in a straight line across/through our curved space.
Well, they stay lines the same way that lines on Earth stay lines despite Earth's gravity already warping space too ... until both their infinity converges into one singular point.
At least that's the one theory. The other says there isn't even any "space" inside a black hole because space already terminates into infinity at the event horizon and a black hole is literally a "hole in space".
A definition of something generally doesn’t include interpretations that some ‘may’ agree with. Like, I get where you’re coming from - but it’s just conjecture at this point.
