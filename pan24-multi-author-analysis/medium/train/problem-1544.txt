All of these were hollowed out over the years by jobbik and fidesz (right wing parties) as they consolidated their power under mr. Orban.
Just so you guys know, we have had really strong anti-EU propaganda for at least decade now in hungary despite the money pouring in. Currently there are giant fliers all around tge country with bombs on them that have "EU sanctions" written on them, saying "Brussels bombed europe's economy".
You literally can't open youtube wihout hearing a propaganda message on how the sanctions don't work because the war is still going on and that the EU is killing us with them.".
It's tragic what happened to Hungary, and it's a travesty that US republicans celebrate Orban as a hero.
Hungary was on a very different trajectory when they joined the EU. It had a vibrant, diverse media landscape, growing and vocal civil society, competitive multiparty elections.
This is a huge point of internal conflict in hugary it is common for political parties in election time to use catchphrases like "EU labor, EU wages.".
