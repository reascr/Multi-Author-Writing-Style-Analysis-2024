Yeah, I thought it was more. Could have sworn it was a little over a mil. google lied. I wasn't saying we were going to or that what we do now, just as an example of what we needed during WWII, a very different war. I think Russia needing 5 million sounds about right for what they're trying to do.
more really. the US was all over the place. US also didn't have locals car bombing their logistics on the regular. drone striking anything that moves. this war is a slog more than russia ever thought it would be. even the US would have to do the draft if it got into a fight like this. we only have sub 500k active duty, sure we can get that number up with the reserve and guard. but, we still don't have enough warm bodies to occupy one of the largest countries on the planet without a draft.
We have about 1.3 active duty military, another 800k in reserves, and in every war since Vietnam we've deployed at least 1/10th as many contractors as soldiers (most in non-combat roles).
US also would never have to occupy a country like Ukraine. If that were our goal, we would be coordinating as Polish, Hungarian, Lithuanian, etc soldiers occupied the country in cooperation with a pro-democracy, pro-liberalization Ukrainian force.
