I'm inclined to think this is BS since it's retaliation for the Modi documentary, but this also sounds exactly like something the BBC (or any other multi-national corporation) would do. Will have to wait for India to release its "proof.".
Maybe you should teach India a lesson. Stop driving and using tainted refined oil imported from India.
Also, Biden keeps saying that he's comfortable with India buying Russian oil. Given his shockingly antiquated grasp of geopolitics, he should be voted out of the presidency, and someone willing to take a hard stand against India should be elected instead.
Given this status it's very unlikely it would deliberately engage in tax avoidance/evasion as (a) there is no motive for a public company to do so and (b) it would be an extremely bad look for the UK government as a whole.
The BBC is owned by the UK government and does not make a profit or have shareholders. It is incorporated in many countries as a private company for work it does there but they are all wholly owned by the parent in the UK which is owned by the state.
BBC Worldwide's charter is to report the news and current events and make content about important current and historical topics. They're not going to risk their journos losing access to a whole country over something as stupid as tax evasion.
