Easier to maintain and train than the American counterpart and on top of that, less fuel consumption which is great if you don't have unlimited fuel.
The Abrams has a turbine engine that'll run on pretty much anything. It will literally run on vodka, molotov cocktails, or cooking oil in a pinch. It'll guzzle it like there's no tomorrow, but it'll run.
Tbh, if sending Abrams is the ultimatum for Leopards, the US ought to just give a handful and be done with it. It's not like they're being used for anything useful while in storage, and Ukraine doesn't have to keep using them once they break - they'll have the Leopards.
I'm pretty sure the ones that are in storage are being refurbished and sent to the Polish army. As I understand it the Ohio Lima plant responsible for making the Abrams tanks ready to go "boom boom" was only partially operating between 2014-19 and they weren't manufacturing any new Abrams tanks in that time. I don't think any new tanks have been built since then either.
Although a fantastic tank and by far the most battle proven, it takes a lot of logistics, and that includes other vehicles to make those things perform in combat as they should. It is also going to take 15 weeks of total training of the crew to be able to completely operate the tank, including firing it at the enemy.
