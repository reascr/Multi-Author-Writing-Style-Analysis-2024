Listen, im trans, I completely understand the threat you feel and I think you're valid for feeling said threat... But you can't be fucking serious about that "one wrong punch or kick" thing. Can you punch someone from 20 feet away? Can you punch 15 people in 10 seconds? Can you punch someone so hard they lose a limb? No. Comparing a gun to your fists is probably the single silliest comparison brought up in this thread. Find me the list of people who have died from a single punch and I'll find the list of people who have died from gunfire and we can compare and see that they're not nearly on the same level. GUNS ARE THE PROBLEM, and it's crazy people would rather go to actual war than just remove them outright. I'm not saying that guns are the only thing killing marginalized people, but it's absolutely the most effective at doing so.
