I like the story about the deconfliction hotline before the battle of Khasham. About 500 Wagner PMCs with tanks and artillery amassed and began closing on a small American special forces group in Syria. General Mattis calls his Russian counterpart and says "we see you have about 500 troops near the Euphrates River closing in on American forces, you might want to pull them back to avoid a conflict." The Russians say "those aren't our guys," figuring their 500 Wagner PMCs will smoke the roughly 40 Americans. Mattis again warns of the impending conflict, and the Russians again deny involvement. American forces call in air support and proceed to drop the hammer on those PMCs with B-52s, F-22s, attack helicopters, and an AC-130 gunship. They exterminated the bulk of the Russian force without a single American casualty. Future deconfliction calls have been heeded.
Holy fuck, that was in 1687! Didn't realize the armies even needed huge ammo dumps like that back then, though it's my bad for not knowing how fast artillery developed in the 17th century and how much its use was expanded.
