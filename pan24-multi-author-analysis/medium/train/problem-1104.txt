It's a leaked Kremlin poll, which means it isn't actually a leak and it isn't actually a poll. It's the Kremlin testing the waters to see how people feel about the possibility of negotiating a settlement. Throw it out there like it's a leaked poll with middling support and see how people feel about it. If there's backlash against it (eg - "we should find who these traitors are and put them in prison"), then the government knows not to consider negotiating a settlement. If there isn't backlash (since few people would outright voice support for it since doing so is a criminal offense), then the government knows that it can consider negotiating a settlement because the populace won't reject it or rebel against it.
I've consistently heard that Russians tend to answer such questions not with their own opinion, but with the answer that they think will result in them being left alone to live their lives.
If that's true, it'd be suggesting that Russians either feel very strongly about it, or think the government itself also wants a way out of the war.
