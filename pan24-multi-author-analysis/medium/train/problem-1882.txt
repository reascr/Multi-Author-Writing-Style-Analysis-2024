The Russians have been keeping a sphere of influence around Central Asia since imperial Russia. But they are now busy having a war. There's really only one country Tajikistan could count on while China has its own Tajik minority and always wants to have some influence on Central Asia not to say the economic consideration.
It's a potential future flash point due to regional water scarcity, climate change, and Stalin's purposefully bad map-drawing skills/infrastructure projects. Interesting to see China getting involved, could just be to protect their Belt and Road investments and to extend power in the region after smelling Russia's blood in the water.
Tajikistan has some more practical needs. The Tajiks are the sole non-turkic ethnic group who are the majority of their country among the stans. They now have a serious border conflict with Kyrgyzstan while they are the one with inferior strenh.
Yea, but I’m sure it’s not to provide real time surveillance of a US base there. I’m sure there working together on climate change or rights of Muslims…haha.
