I honestly wonder if republicans realize their actions post January 6 we're a tacit approval of what happened. I think that's a stain that is going to be hard to wash off for decades to come. Sure their base doesn't care, and for the most part thinks nothing was wrong with January 6th. However, approval of what happened on January 6th is poisonous to moderates.
