Ukraine was not about to join NATO in 2022, nor in 2014. In 2013 Ukraine was a very politically divided country and Pro-Russian interests were only able to win elections with a mixture of populism, support for federalization, and even a bit of compromise with some Pro-western politicians while extrajudicially persecuting others. Russia chose to escalate that turmoil into a Ukrainian civil war and when it was clear that their side would lose, they intervened to force a stalemate. Seven years later they came to finish the job. Claiming that the EU association agreement that started all of this was tantamount to American nukes being stationed in Kharkiv is comical and you know it. Russia is insecure over its lost prestige, it is NOT under threat from attack from anywhere. If Russia was genuinely terrified about NATO invading they wouldn’t be gutting their military capabilities to fight Ukrainians. They can’t stand to see Ukraine align itself with the west due to their own pride and sense of entitlement over its land and people. Ukraine was never going to invade Russia and neither was NATO.
Since when did a tyrant ever ask permission of his people to brutalize anyone. Only , maybe, if they believe for sure they will lose the next fair election but we hv seen how that plays out.
