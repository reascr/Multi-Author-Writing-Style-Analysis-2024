There's more to this than meets the eye. One big problem is corrupt middle commanders. They keep dead soldiers on the books so the families still get paid, and the commander gets a kickback. So any time Putin gets numbers about troop size, those numbers are inflated, perhaps as much as 80%. See the podcast I linked a few levels up in this thread.
There's a very interesting about this very issue. While a large portion of the public already no longer supports the war, there are other factions at play here. I hope Putin eventually falls due to this war, but it's not at all clear that that will happen. It will take more than just the loss of public support.
They don't care but this amount of death and injury is in the long run unsustainable. Every single dead soldier is going to not only need to be replaced but most likely all his gear, weapon, and any equipment they were operating. Losing 500-1000 men a day is going to eventually cause the public to no longer support the war, it hasn't happened yet but it will.
