The history of polish nazi-collaborators is being consistently downplayed in the entirety of polish society. People aren't taught about it in school nor in university - and actually.
Honestly depending on the topic, Wikipedia has become completely unreliable. On multiple occasions I've seen opinions inserted into articles linking to opinion headlines on CNN or Fox, as if something somebody said is now what actually happened.
And the text is not like "Some analysts say" but instead, reported as "This is what happened." On any controversial issue, you really need to look in detail at the way things are discussed and described.
An entire society decided "lalala can't hear you" is a good approach to tackling their own people's participation in the holocaust. Shameful.
Your "full stop" is hilarious. You sound like one of them keyboard warriors for truth who read a couple articles from dark side of the internet and now will school others about the "true history". If you ask the binary yes/no question then of course - yes. But that would be true for almost every european country at the time.
