Beware of the wishfull thinking. The fact that belarus is shit, or that people there could revel, or that russia could be weak and not able to atack from belarus could be true, but right now it is wishfull thinking. The only safe behavior in this situaion is to arm Ukraine wih atacms and heavy weapons as soon as possible and prepare for an attack from belarus, even if many people or experts consider it low chance. We cannot afford fail in here and have to be prepared for the worst esceranio. Even if in the end belraus doenst attack, the situation if there is an attack would be serious enough as to consider some kind of comments laughting at this posibility as russian trolls.
This is exactly what Russia wants, splitting the Ukrainian defences among the southern conflict and creating a new one in the north weakening the defences in the south so to continue plundering along the Black Sea on to Transnistria.
unless Ukraine leaves that entire strip entirely undefended, they aren't going to do much better up there.
