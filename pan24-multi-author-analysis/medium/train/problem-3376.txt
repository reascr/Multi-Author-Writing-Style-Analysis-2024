Going purely on the public information (which is the only thing we really can go off of) though, it looks like Biden's case was accidental. It definitely should be looked into and might result in some staffer being let go, but it doesn't seem intentional like the Trump case was.

The bigger issue that I'd like to see investigated is how the National Archives didn't know that these documents were missing for 6 years. If classified documents can be misplaced (or taken) and nobody realizes for years then what classified information was leaked and what damage has it done?
It's like some intern just scribbles it into a notebook that gets thrown away. Given our military budget the fact sensitive documents aren't tracked is blasphemous. I really doubt you can just photo copy some of Lockheed's current design plans and just walk out so why the hell is this possible?
If one wanted to go full crackpot, you could allege these weren't found earlier because Trump had gimped the system to hide his document handling habits.
