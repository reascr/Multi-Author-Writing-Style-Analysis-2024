it was the conscripts that got 2 weeks of training - almost zero weapons practice and mostly trained how to build trenches and sandbag walls, given a shovel , pistol and 60s era heavy machine guns which are actually crew weapons. So heavy it takes 2-3 men to transport and set up and their vehicles so low on fuel they weren't allowed to use them to transport the heavy guns around . Conscripts were sent to front lines mostly to try to secure defensive positions while the regulars and mercs push forward. But conscripts started to get completely rolled . Which cut off supply chains to regulars . Really bad planning . Large amount of conscripts just surrender positions or themselves immediately because they were also told they would be shot or jailed for retreating.
Plus, where is Russia going to get equipment to outfit these extra 500k soldiers? Their current army isn't properly equipped. It's crazy how far they are willing to take this farce. Every step they take makes them a bigger pariah on an international scale. The West is less and less willing to work with them, while the East takes bigger advantage of their poor standing for personal gain. All of which makes Russia weaker and weaker.
