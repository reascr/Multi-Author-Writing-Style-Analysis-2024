Edit: I did more searching and apparently in Latvia, France, Turkey and Ukraine they can jail you for up to Interesting.
Let's be honest, in the West nobody is ever jailing you for this, maybe except Ukraine because of the war, since y'know you might be recognized as a traitor, you don't do that stuff in war times unless you want some jail time.
But an Australian sports team has taken it and modified it to be their team song; does that count as an insult?
Who knows, those laws are pretty damn old and back then national anthems were a big deal, they're obsolete laws that are basically relics from the past that nobody pays any attention to because they're not enforced and thus they have never been removed or modified in those countries.
Quite a few countries have laws against "disrespecting" the national anthem but I do agree it's a stupid law. I also think laws against "disrespecting" a flag are stupid.
As a Canadian, I’ve long said my favourite thing about America is the anthem, powerful, relevant, triumphant and specific.
I always follow up with my least favourite thing being the currency, bland, dated, and somehow frequently way behind in payment processing technology despite inventing much of it. It’s shocking how many places still want a physical signature to validate a credit card payment, or were a decade later than anywhere I’ve been in Canada on chip/pin or tap. I like to complain about that occasionally.
