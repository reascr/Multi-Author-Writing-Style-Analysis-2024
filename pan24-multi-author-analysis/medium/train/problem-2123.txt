Mr. Intrater is the cousin of Russian Oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. He is one of the Executives that runs a company named Colombus Nova. That company is noted for giving Michael Cohen a half million dollars for "consulting services" in the timeframe between when Trump was elected and before he was Inaugurated.

Its disturbing that we are watching politicians take money from unfriendly sources and watching them turn around and do their bidding in shaping policy. Trump just repeated this week he doesn't trust our intelligence apparatus and believes Putins word over them. Its not a good look and his feet haven't been held to tbe fire over it.
