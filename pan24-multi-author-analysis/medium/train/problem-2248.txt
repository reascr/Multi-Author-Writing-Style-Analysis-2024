With the way things are going maybe we should stop treating native americans as a state-protected religion and as an actual democratic entity that would be required to have designated election districts drawn by Washinon, which could then collectively elect a tribal government that could then elect a representative to speak for it in Washinon. If it's not a single continuous unit then they should have more than 1 representative. Or just organize them as small states, if they have more than 40,000 people they've met the definition of a state in most understanding of the Constitution. This would also allow them to have a Washinon-supported police force, better access to tax subsidies, and much better financial accounting.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
