Truly great idea! He’s an old man who still rides a bike, so I think that’s a great example for all of us. Physical fitness is so important since our health is our true wealth. I also admire his stances on mental healthcare. He believes in it, and understands how essential it is to overall good health. I particularly love how supportive he was of his son struggling with addiction. It showed true compassion and understanding. It’s a really touching reminder of a father’s unconditional love and commitment to his son. Don’t you just love how Biden didn’t tear his son down for having an addiction illness, making him feel like a worthless failure, and instead tried to empathize and give his son a “safe harbor” where he could anchor himself in his healing process? Or maybe even the story of Biden’s struggle with overcoming a severe speech impediment to become an extremely skilled orator and masterful statesman. I was totally unaware of this part of his history prior to his presidential campaign. Pretty amazing, don’t you think? I’m sure there’s more but that would be a great start. Any of these things would make a great exposé.
