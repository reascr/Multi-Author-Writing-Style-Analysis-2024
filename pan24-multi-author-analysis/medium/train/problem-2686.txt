Twitter was in some serious debt when Musk bought them. And when he bought them he made it a Leveraged Buy Out (LBO). This put even more debt on Twitter and made it so that Twitter would have to pay off the purchase debt... which meant Twitter was now back to being cash poor. And unfortunately Musk hasn't been willing to pump any new money into the platform so they have to work with resources they have.
One of the big cost cutting measures was to stop paying rent on office spaces while also still using them (to the point of ordering employees to return to the office). Now these office spaces have been suing for rent non-payments and rather than pay rent (something they can't afford) they're going back to remote... office by office.
Unless someone with a lick of business sense starts making the actual decisions, I donâ€™t see Twitter making it to 2024.
It's not looking good for Twitter. As an outsider looking in, it kind of looks like they're liquidating the company to try and make as many debt payments as possible to prevent more big Tesla sell offs.
Seems like Reddit's gotten more big name advertisers start of 2023, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear that the reduced/stopped ad spend on Twitter allowed ad buyers more play money to experiment with Reddit as an alternative/replacement.
