“Russian missile strikes hit critical infrastructure in cities across Ukraine this week, as many parts of Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, saw the first snowfall of the season on Thursday,” it says here, and “President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address Thursday that more than 10 million Ukrainians lacked electricity, and that most were in the Kyiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia and Sumy regions.”.
They will also further solidify a solid block of ukrainians that will never forget what was done and this could even end with terrorist attacks against russia eventually.
The Kremlin has said these attacks are specifically to give them an upper hand in negotiations. In other words, they know they are leaving, and they want to do as much damage as possible. Which is definitely going to increase the reparations they're going to pay by billions. I am not sure we'll even be able to find any part of Putin's physical body once the oligarchs get to him. Probably there is no window in Russia high enough for him to accidentally fall out of.
Ultimately the power rests in the hands of the Russian people who will likely have to pay a very high price for change. Change that has a huge risk of history repeating itself.
As far as i know there is no country in history that gave up due to terrorist attacks during a military conflict that they were winning handily.
