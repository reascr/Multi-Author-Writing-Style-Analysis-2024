$10M/yr to sow doubts in the mind of the North Koreans regarding their regime seems a pretty good investment. Very little expense, and results could be world changing. If things go awry, the US is short at most $50M and no US lives are at stake.
They don’t realize how bad they have it. They are forced to believe they are basically in heaven. They are kind of like prisoners for life and it’s horrible.
But they spend millions to ensure American kids don’t know American history either. Republicans out here calling all history they disagree with CRT and they don’t even know what crt is. Republicans being against crt is gold and they don’t even understand.
Yeah you got me i really dont give a fuck about Canadian history it bores the hell out of me. I know a ton more about the US because im actually interested in their history and im not sure why but i just am. I can read about American history for hours and not get board.
Off the top of my head i can list 2 Canadian prime ministers and 7 US Presidents idk maybe im crazy but the US Influence is huge.
I mean im canadian and i could list way more US Presidents than Canadian prime ministers and know a ton more about US history then canadian history just because US History is plastered all over TV much more than any other history and I happen to watch a lot of TV. They are just trying to stop US Influence from doing what it did to me on a grand scale lol.
