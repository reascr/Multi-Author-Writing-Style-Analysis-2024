I also used to drive a truck, you are right. Trucks drive way to long and often to get fuled by electricity with the current available batteries. People seem to forget that they aren't busses that get put into depots every night. Battery tech isn't there yet and until it is, even thinking about replacing a whole fleet isn't an option, not even in 15 years from now on. It's a different story for caddies, sprinters and passenger cars, where a infrastructure can be build instead of gas stations. But a truck travels more in a year than most normal cars travel in their lifetime. Don't even want to imagine sitting in the middle of another country like sweden and calling my boss "hey boss, the battery seems to be undercharged and has taken some dmage. Don't have sun here, Solarcharger doesn't do more than 1% a day. Next replacement station is 500 km south of here. Can you send another truck and a forklift to replace it? Please hurry can't feel my feet any more".
I agree but it's kind of implied since everyone knows what they mean and it's the same date as what California is doing with new car sales. Since that goes with the year/manufacturing date etc.
It's a nice thing on paper but we really should workout the kinks in electric vehicles. Esp performance in cold temperatures and range issues plus battery storage and the need to mine rare earth metals to build the batteries to begin with.
