Enough of the bs: we need to ban lobbying altogether and enact term limits for all house and senate elected positions. While weâ€™re at it: ban trading while in office.

Should not lump Biden with Trump. Biden is getting results. Trump is just in for himself, not the betterment of the nation. A sitting president usually gets the party's nomination.
That being said, I think Sanders is more valuable in the Senate than he would be in the White House. The governor of Vermont is a Republican and Vermont has no law saying that he must appoint someone from Sanders's party if he leaves his seat early (not that it would mean much, because Sanders won as an Independent, not a Democrat).
To be fair, Biden also tried twice, failed twice, and was expected to fail again in 2020 until South Carolina and Super Tuesday.
