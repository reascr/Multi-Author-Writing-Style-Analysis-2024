It is NOT my intention to disrespect you, or your choices, or feelings. And so I ask the next questions honestly.
I do think Bibi does what is good for Bibi, and in this situation, he needs people that will help him overcome his legal issues. It so happens, that those people are his normal go-to parties to form a government.
I understand that the incoming government may not be as supportive of your choices, but how much will they actually change that affects you, and how much of what they change will put you in actual danger, and what sort of danger? (I have heard similar comments, but no specifics/details, and have not yet had the opportunity to ask someone who identifies as part of this group).
One of the far right parties already talking about canceling trans healthcare (in Israel it is known as "The Committee") which is in charge of surgeries, hrt, and the change of the gender mark in trans folks ID. If they get their way and the committee gets out of the general universal healthcare or even demonized it can lead to a lot of problems for trans folks mostly because the general public just don't care enough about trans people here, they just think of them as part of the lgbt community and that's it.
