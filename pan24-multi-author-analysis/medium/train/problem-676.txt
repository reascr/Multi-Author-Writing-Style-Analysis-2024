I wouldn't urinate on Mitch McConnell if he was on fire, but McConnell is not (at least not directly) the reason the red wave turned into a puddle.
The whole of the GOP and their decades long pushed towards anti-abortion is a major reason, and Donald Trump's dipshittery is the other. Now some of that was McConnell's doing because of his shady BS with Obama supreme Court nomination that opened up that possibility to toss out roe v Wade, but this election was a referendum on Trump and abortion not McConnell.
I say this as someone who despises Mitch McConnell, the right choice was made between those two horrible, horrible people.
Of course not. Donald Trump started the whole McConnell blame game because he was getting the heat for his shitty candidates and remember, McConnell had already called him out on it earlier.
Now, all that said, McConnell has reaped what he sowed. If he had wanted to he probably could have rallied up the votes to convict Trump and make sure he never held office again during his impeachment trial. Mitch deserves the failures of the GOP, it just is not necessarily on his shoulders.
