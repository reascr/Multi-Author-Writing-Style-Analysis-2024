It does extend somewhat to general speech. However freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences. Socially nor legally. Try yelling fire in a movie theatre, or yell bomb at an airport. These are examples of trying to create panic and is punishable by law. So is conspiracy, "il pay you x money if you murder so and so". You didnt pull the trigger but freedom of speech doesnt protect conspiracy to commit murder charges.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Once again freedom of speech applies primarily towards speaking about gov. Dont like a politician you have the right to say it. Many governments during the writing of the constitution severely limited or outright banned voicing any negative opinion on any politician or person in power.
