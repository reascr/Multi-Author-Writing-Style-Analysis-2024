Now after those months, I got a half a dozen employment search verification form in the mail all past due and dated due before they were even sent out. Had to schedule a call individually for each of them to get it sorted out. then for the next month every form was like that, and the ones that followed were usually due within like two days of receiving them.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
in OR it's by design. the state assumes fraud with every application. Just about everyone I know here that was eligible had ended up waiting 2-3 months for their claims to be processed. and that's after waiting on hold for hours and hours. meanwhile everyone i know i NY that applied started getting money within 2-3 weeks. I was denied twice in OR and there was no real appeals process. at least not one that was reasonable.
Its a little bit of all of the above. The system is also oriented to discourage claims, and to make it easier to deny benefits to applicants for no particular reasons.
