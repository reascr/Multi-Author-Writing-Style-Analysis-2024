The last time I talked to my fat right grandmother was the afternoon before the first Trump Biden debate. I asked her if she would accept it if he lost, I explained how trump was setting the stage to claim fraud if he lost and say it was because of mail in. I told her more dens we’re going to vote mail in. I told her if what I’m telling you know, is exactly what is said after the election, it should be obvious that the talking palmitate are being implanted now. She agreed with all of that, then said she would accept it “depending on the circumstances”.
