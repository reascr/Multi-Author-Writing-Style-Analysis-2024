Shukriya , so I saw October 1st to November 1st data , handful of European countries together imported more than India and almost to the level of China. By changing the discussion from Fossil fuels to only seaborne oil they are able to make it seem that they are not buying alot.
That is the objective. So their domestic population wouldn't blame their own politicians for not doing enough to stop Russia. They get something to deflect the blame.
Indian newspapers are free to write it. Jaisankar keeps talking about the quantum of fuel purchase by EU and India but no articles are being written criticizing EU for it, even from India.
Turkey is doing almost the same things as rest of Europe in regards to Russian fuel. So criticizing them is also criticizing EU. European governments wouldn't do that.
Since India/ Indians are not in favor of energy sanctions, it doesn't matter which other country is buying how much more.
> While Russian crude flows to the EU slumped 308,000 b/d to average a record low of 464,000 b/d in the month, Indian refiners stepped up their buying of Russian oil by 272,000 b/d to a record 1.17 million b/d.
The law of unintended consequences has allowed Russia to snap up a huge fleet of ageing oil tankers that would otherwise have been scrapped, to ship crude to India, China and the rest of Asia. While the shipping cost have increased the companies are making nearly $0.5M per day each, from these shipments. While oil for the West will soon increase dramatically, oil for the West's trade competitors are falling equally dramatically. Good for China, not so good for the West.
That is not really the case. Indian newspapers cover issues related to India. For majority of Indians, Ukraine war is too distant and it's effect gets attenuated due to increased trading with Russia.
