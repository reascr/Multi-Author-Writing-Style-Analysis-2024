She got into "politics" by joining local hate groups in Georgia and gaining popularity with fellow bigots and racists by filming herself sending death threats and hate mail to people like Obama and AOC.
She was the "CFO" of a company via nepotismâ€”a company she had literally zero experience for and her dad and husband owned. She did absolutely nothing in the 5 years she was there until leaving to become a freaking Crossfit trainer.
She (and so many MAGAs) are a product of boredom. They can't stand the thought that their lives are boring and meaningless and average, so they invent this apocalyptic battle against literal demons that they get to take part in because it makes them feel important and excited. Unfortunately we are all trapped in their delusion as well.
