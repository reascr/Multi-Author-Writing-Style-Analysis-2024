Again he is running for President of the United States of America. He’s not just some businessman with overseas holdings. He has an obligation to not only avoid corruption, but any appearance of corruption and you only do that with full transparency. He instead has fought for several years to avoid that transparency likely because of these conflicts of interest that he is unwilling to divest from. It’s not just a spectacle, it’s to inform voters who have a right to know who they are voting for. Anyone that doesn’t want this level of scrutiny doesn’t have to run for president.
