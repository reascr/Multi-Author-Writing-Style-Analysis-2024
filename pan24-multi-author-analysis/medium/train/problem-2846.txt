Yeah.. I think this is going to be more consequential than people realise. It might not lead to an immediate revolt against the CPP, but there is going to be a huge crack in its legitimacy across China. This isn’t like human rights abuses against a distant minority group (e.g., uyghurs) which the privileged mainstream can just choose to ignore. Almost every single family is going to lose an old person, there’s going to so much suffering by everyone over the next few months (just wait for the lunar new year when people spread infections to countryside) and if that sadness and frustration gets directed at the CPP, then the CPP has very much fucked up.
China is not modern at all, too proud, too much in control and culture wise they hate allot losing face; not admitting when wrong decisions have been made and do the opposite of what they did in the past is not possible for them even if that could save allot of lives. The risk is that the population will go fully against the government and we know with history that will be bloody.
