It's almost as if they are openly willing to allow unqualified terrible people to run as republicans because they would rather win elections and have power than not.
They would have 4 years to build a new party around anti-woke Desantis. I don't think they would have necessarily forfeited the next election.
And that's the point, trump turned out the pro wrestling and UFO / Bigfoot crowd that had never voted before. If the republican party pisses those people off they'll just go back to not remembering who the vice president is.
