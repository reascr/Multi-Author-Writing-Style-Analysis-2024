Remember in school when a kid brought a bomb in and we got to watch it be detonated on the rugby pitch, no where as exciting as this but was still the best day ever, at the time.
Edit for info: in the UK, was 13 at the time, teacher told us we were about to start studying WWII, boy said he had a bomb from WWII could he bring it in, teacher said yes , was quite happy about it. Next history lesson, Boy brought the bomb in on the bus, the teacher said he had something else planned for that lesson. Bomb went in the kids locker till later in the week. Teacher had something else planned again but the boy couldn't put the bomb back in his locker as he needed the space for his P.E. kit. So the teacher took it to store for him, ended up using it as a door stop for a few days, before we finally had a lesson on it. When asked where he got it from, he told us he found it farming over the summer. Bomb squad got called, they put it in a tiny metal igloo and set it off . Also the teachers name was Mr. Plows.
Genau. Far more still even now than I thought, yet nobody here considers that. How many times do we get evacuated from the neighbourhood? But that doesn't count here even if you and I weren't alive.
Tell me about it. On the plot where my house stands was a factory for artillery parts during WWII. Also, my town got visited by the US Air Force on a regular base during the war. The house only makes a small part of the plot, the rest I canâ€™t use for anything else but lawn because if I dug to deep chances are I either hit a big fucking piece of concrete from the factory or an aircraft bomb. This suck. -\_-.
