I hope this renews the focus on helping to repair a tattered and destroyed nation where the people are often bereft of any hope. The infrastructure is in ruins, the population are bedraggled and life has lost all meaning. But enough about the UK, I wish our Ukrainian friends all the best.
A lot of countries would benefit pulling a marshal plan to help Ukraine post war - like NO downsides. Benefits Ukraine, that country’s economy, great PR as will as how we help our partners in democracy. Also a nice little fuck you to russia as every month reaps compounded pain for starting this shit show war.
Russia will smash itself upon the rock that is the Ukrainian people. Death to the crime empire, and all invaders, rapist and thieves, who are mere cattle for oligarch cowards, high on their own egos. Ukrainians will stand strong for victory, may thet truimph!
This is the US, as well. I wish my American friends all the best; we have supported other nations before, and we’ll have to do it again. We won’t get healthcare, but they will.
We know our political systems need work when the best politicians are non politicians (before getting elected) and the worst leaders are career politicians. Biden I think, being a rare exception and not the norm.
What I find sad, ironic and funny was if Mr Z was a typical career politician he would've probably bailed on Ukraine, or at best, been half the wartime leader that he is.
