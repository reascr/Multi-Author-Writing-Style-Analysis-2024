I wonder if the bigger push back would be from media as it would really drop the total dollars collected resulting in a restriction to ad buys.
Think that's too costly? Just cut the value down to one dollar per voucher, whatever, I don't give a shit. Or maybe tax the rich to fund safe and fair elections.
