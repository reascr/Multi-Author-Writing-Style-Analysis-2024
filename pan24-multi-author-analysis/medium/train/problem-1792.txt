In Spokane County, WA the incumbent is retiring, so neither candidate is an incumbent and both candidates are Republican. Both endorsed by the guy who went out of his way to hire police who had been fired from their department for refusing vaccines and masking.
My logic with Sheriffs is that if there’s no clear “better candidate”, simply vote against the incumbent each time. Maximum chaos in the department to hopefully make them all miserable.
