"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pele.
I watched him play with the Cosmos when I was a kid. We went to Giants Stadium a few times per year for several years to watch him and Beckenbauer and Chinaglia play. Pele was older, but still a very VERY good player and it was a privilege to watch him play, even though I didn't know it at the time.
"A lot of people, when a guy scores a lot of goals, think, 'He's a great player', because a goal is very important, but a great player is a player who can do everything on the field. He can do assists, encourage his colleagues, give them confidence to go forward. It is someone who, when a team does not do well, becomes one of the leaders." -.
Yep. Attended a match in his final (NASL) season. Too young to know any of the players from a hole in the wall. Except Pele and Beckenbauer--which was the business model of the league.
I don't think you understand the degree to which I've ignored soccer. It wasn't even an option for youth sports when I was growing up, and it's pretty easy to not hear a word about soccer in the US if you don't intentionally seek it out. Though I do work with a few hardcore soccer fans nowadays and am actually somewhat exposed to soccer talk.
