Finland, Sweden, AND Ukraine all jumped to help them.... Ukraine who is constantly being opposed by Erdogan and is in the middle of being invaded is rushing to help them...
Erdogan is going to be in quite a bind diplomatically in a little bit.. not to mention that this disaster will CRIPPLE their economy (turkey just lost all its bargaining chips, they need MASSIVE amounts of outside aid, that aid does not come without strings - Edit: since the bulk of it will come from the EU, US and Nato).
If the country's leader has fits of pique that continually disadvantage people in three other countries, one of which is being invaded, at what point do you /u/actuallyimean2befair allow those three countries at the same time to apply political leverage on the first country?
The people also vote for their country's leader and this could help address that situation in a more peaceful and humane manner that respects other people's lives. Other people who are innocent and should not suffer because of one egotistical politician.
A few years ago, it turned out that the special taxes that were levied after the 1999 earthquake were unaccounted for. When pressed on the issue, Tayyip said, para-translating, "It went where it needed to go, I can't bother with such things.".
He's focusing helping the cities that has his parties in charge. That isn't right. This is not the time to be harsher on them, they need help and they deserve it.
