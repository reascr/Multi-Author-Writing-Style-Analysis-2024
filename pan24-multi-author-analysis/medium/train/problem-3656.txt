Because that is the only known solution? As far as we know, a society as large as a modern country needs to have a certain number of working people to support each retiree. The unfortunate truth is that all modern medicine does is keep you alive, not keep you healthy and working age longer. So we have an ever increasing rate of retirees and elderly who can not work, so we need.more workers.
Admittedly, I’m part of the problem. Life is too expensive to have kids now. It would be 1 child absolute max, if I can get to a point where I’m financially secure enough.
Certainly don’t want to just wing it, then attempt to figure it out along the way like my parents did. All that ended in was divorce.
A home is the primary one for me. Owning a property without a mind grippingly mortgage just isn’t attainable without huge inheritance, or other financial help.
People would have more children if they could just have reasonable homes and not require both parents to be working full time jobs to have a basic standard of life.
