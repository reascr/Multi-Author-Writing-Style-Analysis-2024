Funny how 2nd amendment freak will have wet dreams about fighting a “tyrannical government” but if something like this happens they suck the boots of the police. That being said I guarantee it was a cop who accidentally shot another one.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
And on top of that, this protestor decided to use it not in self defense but to shoot at police. The cops didnt even have body cam because they probably werent expecting to have issues dealing with protestors, much less getting shot at.
