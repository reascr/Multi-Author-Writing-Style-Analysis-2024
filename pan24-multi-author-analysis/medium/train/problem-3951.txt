He was Iran's former deputy defense minister. He was arrested in 2019 on charges of spying for the UK. He denies these charges, and says his confession was extracted by use of torture.
Historically, Britain has been very forgiving and merciful towards nations that kill their civilians… /s.
The suggestion from the chair of the UK parliament foreign affairs committee was that it’s partly a way of undermining his old boss (Iran’s Defence minister when he was deputy in 2005) who is now one of Iran’s leading “moderates”.
I'm quite familiar with the incident, and yes I would say it's effectively been ignored by the establishment in the hope that the British public loses interest. "Quietly dropped" is an apt description.
They’ll be okay though. I can’t recall a single instance of anyone ever regretting stepping on the British’s toes.
The Novichok incident, where a British citizen was killed while on British soil, was quietly dropped. You've got a skewed view on how these things are handled by the modern British government.
