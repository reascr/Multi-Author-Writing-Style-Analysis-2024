They don’t exactly want another war in gaza and refugees flooding into sinai for treatment because the last time they did that weapons and terrorist got in to fight along side isis in Sinai.
The last time was in 2020 or 2021 i think during the last conflict in gaza we opened the border to allow the injured to go into sinai for treatment since their hospitals were either damaged or didn’t have the capacity to treat the injured we slso sent ambulances across the border.
A third intifada probably destroys the PA - and possibly starts a civil war in the Territories after that.
Europe is tired after getting its share of terror attacks. It's focused on Russia. The Arab states no longer provide unequivocal support to palestinians after seeing years of maiximalist demands. . And the palestinian authority is inept and dying. The Israeli left has died after years of Israelis being, well, literally shot to death. And most importantly.
Henry kissingers philosophy was to promote equilibrium of power between entities. He was not promoting peace as an objective. He knew any peace agreed to would fail without balancing powers in equilibrium.
The West Bank is in danger of becoming ungovernable - especially once Abbas goes. I don't know who his successor would even be, but the Jenin raid was into territory the PA should be policing, but doesn't because it would weaken its support further... and with the PA suspending security co-operation, that's an intelligence stream gone that makes it harder for Israel to prevent attacks.
