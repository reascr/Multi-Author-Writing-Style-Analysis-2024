Russia started this war with a massive advantage in firepower, but that advantage is disappearing thanks to their wasteful strategy of throwing away lives and equipment.
Well, It is old soviet tactics designed to create the element of surprise in the era of spy satellites. Attack from multiple points so the enemy can't tell which attack is actually intended to break through. It is a bit wasteful, sure – but absolutely rational approach.
Well, they managed to replenish losses, to a degree, plus Ukraine is really not getting the sufficient number of weapons (or capabilities) for anything beyond replenishing their own losses, so that's not so simple and one-sided.
Edit - not going to respond to the obnoxious remarks from the ones who buy into their preferred propaganda.
Since most of you are brain dead and don’t really understand what most of what you read. I want you to comb through this list and tell me how many Mig29’s or Su-57’s were shot down and then tell me have they used all their good stuff.
