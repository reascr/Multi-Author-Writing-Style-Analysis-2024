Congress was the opposite party majority and passed legislation effectively taking away almost all power from the executive branch and began passing self serving legislation.
Yeah, we know the parliament was against him and tried unsuccessfuly to impeach him legally. That doesn't negate nor justify the fact Castillo tried a self coup, an extremely illegal power grab, and got legitimately thrown in jail for it.
So he tried to abolish congress . It’s pretty nuanced and a lot of people from Peru think his main issue was just his political inexperience.
yeah, when the president literally concentrates the power in his person, closes the parlament that was also choose by the people and literally wants to rewrite the entire constitution of the country and other country wants to give asylum to the same guy that wanted to be a dictator the oligarchs are the ones to blame when Peru doesn´t want him to run from justice.
the answer you gave looked like the popularity and the fact of Castillo winning a democratic election was enough to justify his decision to close the congress.
