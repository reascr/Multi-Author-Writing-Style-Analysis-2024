The Russian population won't just be ageing, it also be getting dumber, and the central Politburo that desperately desires Russian advancement ahead of the West technologically is the same Politburo that has ensured this will never happen. Not to forget that this isn't just a loss to Russia, it's a gift to the West, when you think historically of how great Soviet engineers and scientists have been. You're not just losing them, we're getting them.
