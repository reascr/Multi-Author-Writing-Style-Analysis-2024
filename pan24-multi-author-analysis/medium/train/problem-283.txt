That's a scary thought, but it helps to remember this is the message Russia wants to convey. It's clearly in their best interests to stir up public protest in the U.S. to end the war. That doesn't mean the threat is any less scary, but it's important to keep in mind who is the country escalating tensions this entire time. If Russia decides things are too scary for them, they can be the ones to back out of the fight they started at \any\ time.
I thought Lavrov already said they were at war with the West and NATO like once every other month since the war began. Now it’s almost a real war? As opposed to what? An ethnic cleansing conducted by Nazis that claim they are hunting Nazis, civilians, gay, witches, biological super soldiers? While claiming to try to disarm a country while actively supplying them with arms of their horrendous losses of which most died probably believing the lie they were told for their initial incursion/invasion?… I guess almost a war is a lot less words at least.
I don't want to go all 'Murican, but after watching Ukraine bring Russia to its knees, I think a "real war" with the west would be very very different than what Russia is having now.
