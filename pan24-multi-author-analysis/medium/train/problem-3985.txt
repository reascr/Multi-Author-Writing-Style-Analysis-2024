Hey, I'm a graduate of a Christian seminary school and I absolutely agree with you that no religious text from any religion should be used as a basis to create laws in the United States. I also feel strongly that if anybody is going to try to deny rights to anybody else and claim "The bible says..." then they also need to be put in their place by showing them that they are absolutely wrong even by the book they claim to follow. Every last bit of leg they can stand on must be eliminated, so that they are simply left with, "I don't want to allow others to do X because I don't like it.", which is not a solid basis for an argument at all. It sucks that this is something that we have to deal with in a country where supposedly there is a separation of church and state, but here we are. If the United States really were a Christian nation, then there would be a lot more social programs/safety nets that would have most so called Christians crying about the country becoming "communist", plus way more compassion towards immigrants, legal or not.
