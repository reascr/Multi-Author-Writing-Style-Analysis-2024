Some of it is totally valid. Like, the 'defending the skies' part is irrelevant as any bomber planes would be taken down before they even got near the mainland to need AA, and if were talking icbm's, almost everyone would be SOL. But yeah, it's been chronically underfunded and understaffed, and isn't a top tier armed forces. It's also comparing to armed forces of countries considered superpowers - those days are long gone for the uk, it would never be on par with the numbers then can field.
Part of me worries that us supplying planes will be the straw that breaks the camels back, so to speak, but the other part of me thinks 'fuck yeah UK' and makes me proud of my country for having the balls to be seriously considering sending the planes.
I've been saying this for ages, America is moving b-21s to Australia, China is spying, North Korea is in a heightened state of readiness. There is a war coming in the next 2 years, the west is stalling for time in Ukraine to train soldiers and build up stocks.
