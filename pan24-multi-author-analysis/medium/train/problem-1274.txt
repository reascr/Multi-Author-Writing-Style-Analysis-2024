(They blamed the war in Ukraine for the same in the 2 months before that, but I guess they have realized that the "wartime inflation" phrase has lost its edge.).
Taking over 70% of all native tongue media does wonders. Just an example of how much control this allows him:
Orbán hates communists supposedly but I am pretty sure that he would love North Korea. Everyone is very patrioatic there.
This narrative paints Orbán and his party as "freedom fighters" trying to keep a deranged Brussels in check, shifting all blame solely on the EU.
In the past 2 months, Fidesz has built a narrative about the EU sanctions against Russia being the cause of the Hungarian economy tanking and the value of the Hungarian Forint taking a nosedive.
This is possible due to a small detail about the sanctions being kept obscure in the media: Any one head of a member state not signing a sanction is enough to stop it from coming into effect. In other words, Orbán signed everything that he claims is hurting his country.
A (it's in Hungarian, not sure if there is an English version) revealed that a third of all voters (and half of Orbán's voters) were convinced that Orbán voted against the sanctions.
