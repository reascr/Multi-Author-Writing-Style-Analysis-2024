Yeah, my Ex-Nephew-in-Law-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named was the same way. Said he was the only one to survive a wreck, albeit with terrible injuries. My brother-in-law was a cop; no reports of accidents. And not a mark on him. Lied about stealing medications from me and my dying mother, although the bottles were found in his possession. Claimed that there was a contract out on him. At his wedding, pretended to have food poisoning; no one knows why. Even my niece finally got tired of him; he'd been banned from family gatherings for years. We were so thankful she never had kids with him.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
