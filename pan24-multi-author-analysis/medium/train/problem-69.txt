All this talk of Republicans breaking with Trump is just the same acknowledgement of the hold he has over the GOP, a tacit admission that Trump remains the most powerful force in conservative politics.
It is also a tacit acknowledgment that the crazies cannot leave the GOP cause they will not win statewide (or Prez) elections with support from moderate Republicans only.
Just the fact that the GOP leadership did not hold a press conference unanimously rejecting Trumpâ€˜s behavior having dinner with an anti-Semite and Nazi, calling for banning the Constitution, and the pending case against Trump for taking, concealing and lying about top-secret documents, putting our national security at risk, speaks volumes.
