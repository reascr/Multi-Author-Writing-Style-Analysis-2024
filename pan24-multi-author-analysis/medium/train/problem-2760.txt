I work for a municipality that tried to do municipal isp with a fiber optic network in the early 2000s. This would have been a huge benefit not just in providing low cost high quality internet but it would have been a huge boost in economic development. AT&T and others came out in force with massive marketing campaigns against the project basically saying you don’t want the government to see your browser history(porn). The campaign worked very well and the community didn’t get an option for commercial fiber until almost two decades later. Not sure the calculus that goes on in peoples brain that figures it’s better if a massive corporation has my data rather than my local government when the corporations have every reason to sell you information to whoever including the government.

We can easily see with USPS competing with UPS and FedEx that private companies competing with the government leads to better product/services and more consumer friendly pricings.
