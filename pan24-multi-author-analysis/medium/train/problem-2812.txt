When conservatives talk about small government what they really mean is fewer hands in government. E.g Authoritarianism. What they really despise about government is the power that government can bring to bear against them and their agenda. They freaking love government when they can wield its power, as evidenced by pretty much every Conservative who has gained power. Do they ever... EVER actually do anything to reduce their own power? Absolutely not, because that's not in their best interests.
In an ideal conservative world the only "government" power that could exist is their own. And we can even see that historically play out. When Democrats when Republicans try their damnest to reduce the power of the incoming Democrats. When the Republicans gain office they expand the powers of the office. Time... and time again.
