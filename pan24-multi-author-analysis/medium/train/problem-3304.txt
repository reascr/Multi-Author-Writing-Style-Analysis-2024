This was the 1 thing that Senate Republicans got wrong in January 2021. They could have voted to convict Trump on the January 6 impeachment charges ... and remove him as a potential candidate forever. But they were cowards, they couldn't wrap their heads around what the short-term fallout would be and look at the bigger picture. But for Senator Rubio, every $20 that Trump fleeces from some little old lady in The Villages (huge retirement community near Orlando) is $20 that Rubio can't get. So now Marco gets less money, or he has to go to Mar-a-Lago and kiss the ring.
