Jesus even when ukraine comes out victorious in the end such a mass migration of this scale could leave them a crippled nation for a while even assuming half of those people come back.
Refugees in most conflicts never ‘go home’ p. After the war they stay where they are or ‘move on’ to opportunities. This was the case of Poles, Vietnamese, Syrians, etc. now Ukrainians. They will look to countries like Germany, Canada, Australia.
Many won’t return. Ukrainians never had free movement to live and work in Western European countries. Now they do without having to meet EU and Shengen block standards. There’s no way, even if and when the conflict ends that countries like Germany can force them out.
Many Syrians are going back, in Lebanon I met 3 Syrian Christian’s who are going back after the war is over. A lot of the Christian villages in the province of Homs, as well as Aleppo, are filled with people again.
Yeah I met a ukranian guy and his gf both working menial labour jobs in Denmark (pays more than decent). They were staying permanently and making a life for themselves.
It wasn’t ‘free movement’. Ukrainians need apply for positions etc just like an American. It didn’t mean they could just decide to move to Berlin next week. Now they can.
