Reminds me of some (rather lame but entertaining) isekai web novel, where modern Japan itself is transported into another world where the other nations have different levels of technology, but they are all lower than Japan's.
There is a nation that has a Yamato copy (though they themselves dont call it Yamato). Japan defeats it with modern weaponry, but doesn't sink it.
They then tow it back to the mainland and begin working on retrofiting it by adding a ton of modern weaponry (CWIS, missiles, lasers, etc...). Its main guns are replaced with 46cm railguns, and they make the ship nuclear-powered.
I would think even a test missile fired over your country would be a legitimate target. Japan should test their shootdown capability in the real world.
Nihonkoku Shoukan. It has a manga with... not very amazing art to say the least (At least for the characters themselves). The manga is still far behind the novel.
That will tell NK nothing about Japans capabilities, and remind them not to piss off their wierd roommate.
Just have it circle the world twice, before deorbiting over Pyongyang depositing glitter, cocaine, and waifu bodypillows over the capital.
I don't even really understand why NK wants to antagonise Japan. Surely it's got enough problems already with SK.
Threatening them so much that Japan, SK (and the US) become aligned seems to be a terrible strategic play for both NK and China.
Also, I don't think that "big ships" are the way to go. Maybe a distributed network of smaller ships would be more resilient.
