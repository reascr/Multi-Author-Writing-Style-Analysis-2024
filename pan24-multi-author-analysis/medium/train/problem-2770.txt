Russian Empire still existed, as did Greater Hungary. both are just crying about it now rather than focusing on their actual countries.
I don't recall WW1 history 100%, but was Hungary ever an actual independent kingdom and not under some yoke? I thought Greater Hungary was pretty much owned by Austria back in the day, while also being fought over with the Ottomans a few years earlier.
officially it was the Austro-Hungarian empire, a dual monarchy. The Emperor was Emperor of both Austria and Hungary. Within this system the Hungarian nobility had immense power and the Emperor had to constantly appease them. If Austria gained anything Hungary had to gain something equal. At this time Hungary was also much larger than today, It held current day Slovakia, the Transylvania region of Romania as well as northern Serbia and a large part of current Croatia. In fact Hungary had sea access. They saw a lot of their territory lost at the treaty of Trianon after WWI but in most of the areas lost the hungarians were a minority population. Still ended up with some majority Hungarian towns ending up as part of other countries. This is the greater Hungary they miss and want back. They were a powerful partner in a powerful empire where they were too powerful for the Emperor to ignore.
yea it's sad, there's nothing left to be hateful about, no one is alive to remember how it was back then, but the hatred is still passed down through parents to children.
