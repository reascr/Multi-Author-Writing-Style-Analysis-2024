Ah yes, Nordic Monitor. Turkey obsessed news media that draws their sources from the places that only their writers know. The stuff they know... I bet Turkish government doesn't even know.
These guys are so afraid that they had to put "Nordic" there to put credibility on them because "loser Islamic faction who had to escape to Sweden from Turkey because of another Islamic faction in Turkey" sounds a bit less credible. They draw their news from their times in Turkey, and it's very apparent in their titles. They were in Turkey when Turkey had the idea of "Muslim Brotherhood". When it turned out Muslims had no business or interest in being a brotherhood, Turkey turned to Israel and other allies. Turkey doesn't care about Kashmir or Palestine anymore. SADAT is now at their lowest.
Actually, we use Kurds when convenient, just like the rest. That's all. They are not considered an equal, or err.. can't find how to say it politely and without sounding racist.
Nordic Monitor have to keep these "news" pumped up because if they fail to create a gap between Turkey and their new allies, God knows what will happen to their extremist friends in Middle East. Nordic Monitor is the old news, no pun intended. These are the guys that ErdoÄŸan wants to be extradited. You wouldn't miss them there in Sweden, believe me.
