"Hey, look over there Those guys are trying to steal your stuff" frantically stealing said stuff in the moment of confusion.
They'd be fighting a neighbour who doesn't require the bulk of their supplies and forces to be shipped from a long distance away.
Unless it's Poland. If someone placed me between our politicans and Russian troops, I would have a hard time deciding at which direction point my gun at.
If it wasn't bad enough, there is a panic on our subreddit because some people started getting letters from military to join "military drills", which people are forced to participate and make military oath under threat of jail.
If it wasn't for EU, the corruption and incompetence would be second only to Russia, but even with them I want to run away. You can look up the recent "patriotic benches" which cost enormous amount of money, but didn't survived a single rain because it was a money siphon for politicians.
That and PRL leftovers that still kick around in the goverment. There are few politicians that align with Putin, but it would be much more if it wasn't for widespread hate for Russian actions.
Don't even get me started how a certain politican (Korwin) said "Hitler never did anything wrong" and was still allowed to walk into parliament, or how the current goverment constantly breaks our own constitution, and drives economy into the ground faster than pre-war Putin.
