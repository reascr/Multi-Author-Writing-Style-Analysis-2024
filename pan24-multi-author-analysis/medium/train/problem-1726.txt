I mean I'm glad because I think de-platofrming works, and no one has a right to social media. However, isn't this super inconsistent with what Musk has said about free speech.
Correct. And it is preposterous that there is a sole decision maker and no policy on such a large platform determining whose voice gets heard when many do not deserve to be heard at all. We should not forget that social media is not meant to provide a forum for free speech. The sooner he drives it into the ground the better because social media is a huge problem when the communities are improperly moderated.
