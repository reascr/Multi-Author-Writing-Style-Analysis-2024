I’m just spitballing here but if there is loads of evidence in those returns of violation of tax law wouldn’t he IRS have reviewed them by now and come after him? Or are they looking for clues to other crimes.
The tax returns may be right based on information reported. But it's the information reported that may be wrong, so the tax returns can help decide if there was criminal intent to defraud on either side.
For instance, he applies for a loan claiming assets worth a billion dollars, but reports to the IRS that he only has 400K in assets.
There's also the matter of if he reported loans received or paid interest correctly. Could be he reported things on his taxes as deductions which he shouldn't have been allowed to report, particularly if he was falsifying other assets.
