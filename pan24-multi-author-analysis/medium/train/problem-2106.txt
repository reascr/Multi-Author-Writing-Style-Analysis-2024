The GOP revolt pits (GOPe) McConnell, McCarthy and McDaniel against (rightwing populist) Trump/maga-republicans.
The GOPe lost the narrative blame game on twitter over the weekend when the GOPe's deliberate funding fails/sabotages were hung out like dirty laundry for the world to see. DeSantis has kept his mouth shut and we have already seen Tom Cotton read the tea leaves to announce he ain't touching the 2024 cycle unless Trump bows out. The neocons have invested heavily in Tom's infiltration from neocons hero to maga acolyte which suggests the DeSantis push might have been less than a neocon leadership unified advancement.
If McCarthy wants that Speakership title next to his name in the history books he will have to commit himself to a Boehnering gauntlet because the Freedom Caucus rejected him in 2015 and they still don't like his ass in 2022. This standoff is old- Tea Party business.
If McConnell secures Leader then I would expect a lot of behind the scenes pressure for him to leave the Senate early. This is especially true if the Beshear loses the Governor seat in 2023. Rick Scott who has loyalties to no one but his own ego also wants to have Leader next to his name in the history books and maga/trump will happily use him as a chaos whirlwind.
