The exercise of the power of the Postal Service shall be directed by a Board of Governors composed of 11 members appointed in accordance with this section.
This guy participated in the coup-at-large, attempting to disenfranchise voters to swing the election to Trump. He took steps to dismantle and remove custom postal sorting machines and throw them out. How he is still in power is baffling. I think Biden needs to take stronger steps to remove him and people that did similar things in furtherance of the big lie and the criminal conspiracy to steal the election and end democracy.
The Governors shall not be representatives of specific interests using the Postal Service, and may be removed only for cause. (Biden can't fire them).
