Secondly, yes, 2016 happened. But as time goes on, it's more and more clear that Trump winning in 2016 was a fluke. Could DeSantis and the R's run a clean sweep in 2024? Sure. But it really feels like some people are stuck in the shadow of 2016, where Republicans ALWAYS win, and the public is against the Democrats at every turn, and the elections of 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2022 show that's just not true.

I really believe the Dems got so much backlash after Biden's pronouncement that Congress should force the unions to take the Temporary Labor Agreement as is, that it spooked them into this. The Dems will move if progressives pressure them. Same thing LBJ said to MLK, Jr. back in the 60's: "force my hand".
