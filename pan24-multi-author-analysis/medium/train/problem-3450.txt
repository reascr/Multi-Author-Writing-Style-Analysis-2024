As for Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, Hitler actually was not happy that the Allies folded and gave it to him. He never wanted the Munich diktat and wanted to go to war against the Czechs. The disintegration and occupation of Czechoslovakia happened after they were given the Sudetenland region (and the German high command was shocked at just how well fortified it was - stating that had they gone to war against them as initially Hitler wanted, they would have tremendous difficulty in breaching the forts. And this is a big deal in hindsight given how valuable Czech motorised vehicles and tanks, yes tanks, were for the Germans when they invaded France).
Unfortunately they don't need an army to continue to rain down missiles on civilian population centres and key infrastructure.
Germany was unable to land an army in the UK during WW2 but did plenty of damage with bombing raids and V1/2 rockets.
After the US and Russian troops entered Berlin. I don’t think we’re going to invade Russia to end the war!
