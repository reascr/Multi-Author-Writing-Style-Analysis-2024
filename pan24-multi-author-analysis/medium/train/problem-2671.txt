I think you could make an interesting TV series from everything George Santos/Anthony Devolder claims he did and what he has been documented doing. The lies are fascinating.
Simple fact: the Republican Pary's George Santos is displaying every attribute I've every read about regarding serial murderers.
I'm not saying Santos IS a serial murderer, but I am saying this guy gets my attention in ways that not many (even corrupt politicians) could.
