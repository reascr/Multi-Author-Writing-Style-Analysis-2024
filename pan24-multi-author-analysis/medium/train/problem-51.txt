American here, and from what little I've seen since Truss stepped down (Y'all got about a week of solid coverage here across the pond) the sense I got was that the Tories are extremely unpopular and they know it but also control the ability to call an election early so of course they'll delay it until the normal election time.
Basically, I'm guessing they know their cover is burned so there's really no reason currently to pretend they're doing anything that'd be popular in the public eye. Could be wrong though, would love insight from the good folks of the U.K!
LOL, I really can't see why people are scared of a letter on a piece of paper changing from M to F or F to M. I mean seriously Sunak, of all the shit your party has caused don't you possibly think that this would be well down on the list of things to "fix". Here's a start work on the cost of living instead, we may actually tolerate you if you sort that one.
Pro-UK Scot here. I don't really agree with this law change, but if the Tories stick their nose into this, then they might as well agree another Indy ref. People are not going to be happy about Westminster trying to block a legislation change that is devolved.
This fucking little Twot Sturgeon & her knuckle dragging party needs to be put on a leash. They don't have the right to create different tiers of UK citizens.
