Oh porcelain. That’s the kind of luxury I like to hear about on trains. Was served coffee in a mug once on an airplane, still remember the experience to this day. Less plastic waste doesn’t have to be a detriment!
My American brain melts at this concept. TSA would forbid such a thing because... it could be used as a weapon.
You want to get a knife on a plane? Easy. Smash the screen of the in-flight entertainment system. Or hell, smash the screen on your own laptop.
I give this "advice" because I know that it's useless to any real plane hijacker. The 9/11 hijackers were able to take over planes with box cutters because prior to 9/11, the standard was to simply listen to hijackers' demands and fly where they told you to. That only stopped being a viable defense when the terrorists decided they wanted to fly planes into buildings. Since then, knives have become useless for actually taking over planes. Passengers now know that it's best to just bum-rush someone holding a knife; at worst they kill one or two people. But the alternative is the plane may be flown into a building somewhere. The only actually meaningful security measure we've implemented post-9/11 is the reinforcement of cockpit doors so you can't just body-slam your way in there.
Moving from Germany to America to find out we couldn't get kinder eggs because kids were so stupid they'd eat the plastic toy inside really set the tone for living there.
