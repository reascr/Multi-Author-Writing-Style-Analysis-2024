Iran and Syria used the quakes to deliver a lot of weaponry into Syria. Yeah, a few civilians unfortunately died - but by that Israel (probably) prevented a much bigger attack with more losses on both sides.
Also idk if it's said here - but this bombing happened far away from the cities where the earthquake happened. So it probably didn't hurt anyone who was injured by that catastrophe.
Basically no one want to talk about this in /r/worldnews. How far has this this sub fallen into an American geopolitical echo chamber.
It seems to be a pretty big deal to strike the residential area of the capital of a country that's just dealing with the aftermath of a fricking earthquake.
Israel proposed helping Syria, but they decided they don't want to and preferred to get help from the likes of Iran - which according to intelligence, took a lot of the supplies that other nations brought to Syria, and gave a lot of "support" that went to Damascus and the area, rather than northern Syria where the actual damage happened.
The double standards that this sub has when talking about Israel atrocity (or from any other western country) and when talking about Russia is disgusting.
