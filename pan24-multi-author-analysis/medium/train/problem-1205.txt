Except it doesn't. The US and RU both routinely test ICBMs and notify each other in advance of such tests. This is at least the second time they've tested that missile this year. It's not an escalation of any kind. It's routine.
Lastly, you entirely missed the point of my post, which was simply about the "oh noez, the nukez!" angle. Good job.
You believe wrong. Inspections were suspended when covid hit, just like IAEA inspections. Still though, this is also irrelevant.
Not only is the military component interesting, but it escalates tensions even more when they are the highest they've been in 60 years.
They can't load warheads on them currently because New START and their active warheads / delivery systems they are loaded on are remotely monitored. I believe active monitoring is still in force.
The closest thing to news in here is that Russia happens to be testing a new ICBM model... which is also something periodically done by every major nuclear power.
Ah, so what you mean is a MIRV (multiple independent reentry vehicle) ICBM, which is decades-old technology used by every major nuclear power for basically the entirety of their arsenal.
>Russia carried out its latest test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile thatÂ can carry multiple nuclear warheads on Friday.
