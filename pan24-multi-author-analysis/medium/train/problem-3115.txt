The cultural aspect that always stood out to me was that the Lares had a method of augury that consisted of interpreting the forks in lightning strikes as signals of Jupiter's wills and wishes. Something really unique and evocative about that as a religious practice.
Agreed that they are also fascinating. I recently watched that Roman Empire series on Julius Caesar, which touched on them but not much really.
The etruscans are fascinating to me because they influenced the Romans so much and some say the Republic might not even have been a thing without them.
French Gaul and a lot of the Germanic peoples from that time period are such a mystery. We have evidence to believe they were barbarous savages and we have even more evidence that suggests their tribal semi rural lifestyles were actually incredibly nuanced even if they weren’t overly sophisticated.
Not barbarous savages no, really a complex people with extraordinary metallurgy skills and strong developed society. I’ve since taken to dislike the term “barbarian” when describing them and feel guilty for using it in the past in that way. I’m not calling you out by the way…I’m just saying they were a well-developed civilized people. But if course with certain features that we would now consider very cruel and nasty, but more or less normal among many cultures globally during those times.
