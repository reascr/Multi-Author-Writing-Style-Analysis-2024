That's not an attempt at deception or anything, though. Many "Liberal Parties" in the world are rooted in classical liberalism, which specifically refers to economic liberalism and not social liberalism, with "economic liberalism" being "complete and total deregulation of capitalism". This is why the opposition to Liberal Parties are often Labour Parties - the laissez-faire policies of classical liberalism are often disastrous for the working class in the long-run and thus organized labour is naturally the opposition to it. Classical liberalism is also critically built on "individual rights" to the extent that it rejects government protection of group rights (or government protection of anything, really), which is why with the "Big Tent Party" philosophy large political parties adopt, social conservatives often fall under Liberal Parties while social liberals fall under Labour, which is built around group protectionism.
most of their views are based on superficial understandings of the topics and kneejerk reactionary responses to anything new or different. they take their superficial understanding and build a worldview on top of it.
because it is something they actually say! i was introduced to RATM by my very conservative father. i also regularly hear things like "conservatives are the new hippies" ðŸ¥´.
