If you know anything about Indias history and it’s relationship with its Allies - you would know how difficult it would be for New Delhi to do anything about Russia.
When the West was arming (and is still arming) Pakistan to fight the Taliban, it was also arming India’s neighbor.
That was because america was focused on stopping communism and when india had a soviet inspired 5 year plan (that didn't kill off entire hoards of their population) the US saw them as a threat and started supplying the terror but US friendly state of Pakistan.
Then the US defending Pakistans genocide of 2-3 million Bangladeshi's and "declaring all women public property" and sending a fleet to deter India from continuing its liberation of Bangladesh. Meanwhile the soviets send aid and sent a nuclear sub to prevent the US fleet from doing anything.
No, Pakistan manipulated the US into getting what they wanted. All the while the cause of 20 years of war (bin Laden) was safely sitting in Pakistan the whole time. Initially Pakistan denied knowing he was there... but former high ranking cabinet ministers have let it slip that they knew he was there.
