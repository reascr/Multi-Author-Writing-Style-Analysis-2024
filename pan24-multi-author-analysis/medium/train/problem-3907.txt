Whaaat? I didn't realize our mitochondria had their own special DNA. That's awesome! Thanks for explaining this to me. I appreciate your skepticism about my diagnosis--I certainly hope I'm wrong about it. I'm seeking advice from a genetic counselor because I've been frail since birth and as an adult I'm still struggling to keep my weight above 90lbs. My general practicioner ordered a whole genome sequence which flagged two "pathologic" mutations, including that I'm a carrier of MCIID and suggested I might have a disorder like MERS or Leighs' Syndrome. My mom's side is french canadian so we've got a lot of weird neurological disorders in our DNA, lol.
Mitochondrial disfunction is also linked to aging. Imagine being able to get a mitochondrial rejuvenation and how good it would feel to have some of the energy of youth.
Hmmmm new dystopian plot: people rush to have kids early with similar-gened partners so they could harvest their matching mitochondria (yes i know bad science) so they could stay young forever.
I have mitochondrial complex type II deficiency (heterozygous) and I'm going to see a genetic specialist in March. Should I ask her about this? I'm a young adult so I don't know if it would work for me.
Anyways, I'm so glad this therapy works. I can't imagine the lives that will be changed from this discovery. Not just for the kids, but also for their families. This science is bonkers. I'm so relieved to know there are scientists out there looking out for those of us with rare diseases. Humanity's ability to empathize with one another is our greatest strenh.
