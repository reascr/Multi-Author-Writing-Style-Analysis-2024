I don't know if DeSantis can beat Trump but I think his little Covid grand jury move is not about going after Biden or Fauci but this is him going after Trump. If so I think it would be his first good move against Trump. But the base is a double edged sword. You need them to win the primary but you get them and lose the general.
Careful there Ronny. Donald Trump will challenge you to feats of strenh and humiliate you if you donâ€™t keep your head down.
Conservatives are people who are reluctant to accept change in society. DeSantis is a radical leader of the MAGA fascist movement, not a conservative.
