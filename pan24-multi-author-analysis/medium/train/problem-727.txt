They're scared to death because they know what is coming, climate change, pandemics and the Cost of Living crisis could come to a boil sooner than they think .
Exactly we're nearing a tipping point and they know their heads are on the chopping block but instead of siding with the future and the changes that needs doing, they keep accepting blood money bribes and think they can stamp out resistance before they can get to them.
It’s not just you, they neglect the people, people ask questions, they ignore us, we come back, they use force, we still march, they decide to make it impossible to speak up, it’s global but I believe it can’t win.
Having unelected bodies act as democratic backstops is clearly the superior option. The US has an elected Senate and elects judges as well and in both cases it harms democracy.
In contrast, both the UK and Canada have a strong history of their Upper Chambers, Judiciaries, and the Monarchy acting as checks on abusesof power.
Because that's the thing: These bodies all have such little democratic legitimacy that the only times they're functionaly able to act is when the actual elected body starts to abuse their power. They're incapable of co-opting the state for their own purposes and so only act as a check on it.
The bureaucracy, which is also less beholden to elected total politics in the UK than in the US, functions similarly.
You can't ask for people to look at things from different perspectives and call people who have a different perspective than you "mindless marxists". It's not reasonable.
