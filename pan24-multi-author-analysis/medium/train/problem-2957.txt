I’m an Iranian who immigrated to Europe with my family when I was 11 years old. I was against the hijab since a young age but I was forced to wear it in school. You would get punished if you were showing your HAIR. They told me I would be killed and thrown into jail if I don’t cover my hair, body or be non Muslim.
I understand it is possible to care about two things at once before anyone comes at me but seriously feminists this is the shit you should be going nuts about online.
Religion is optional in a fascist society, but I would also tend to agree that Iran is more of a theocratic than fascist society.
The crime is actually punishable by death with the exception of the family "forgiving" the killer, which apparently happened in this case. Crazy world.
You guys have no idea how much we wish we had the basic freedom of the west. Girls want to wear whatever they want without being jailed. Students want boys and girls to be allowed in the same classrooms. We want to access the internet and social media sites like YouTube without having to use a VPN. Couples want to hold hands in Public without the fear of morality police arresting them.
