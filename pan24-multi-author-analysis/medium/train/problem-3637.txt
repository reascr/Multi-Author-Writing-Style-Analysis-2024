Your definition of "convenience" and mine may be different. A 10-year-old rape victim getting an abortion is not convenience. (That's not a hypothetical example; we have real examples now of conservative politicians opposing abortion in such cases and going so far as to the attack the victim and her family.) A woman who is not ready to be a mother getting an abortion is not convenience. Furthermore, not all those who are against an abortion ban are incapable of moral nuance. I'm one and I don't say that a fetus is just a clump of cells over its entire development. An eight-month fetus is not the same as a three-month old fetus, which is not the same as a clump of cells a week or couple of weeks after inception. Look, the problem is that religious anti-abortion advocates push the view that human life begins at conception and any abortion at all is immoral, never mind that over half of fertilized eggs don't even implant to develop into a fetus. The religious stance against abortion is illogical and inhuman, in my opinion.
Democrats were fighting to solve problems ... but also protect our ability to make our own decisions about our bodies. These are fundamental, core issues,‚Äù Whitmer said.
