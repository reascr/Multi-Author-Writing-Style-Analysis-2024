Notice I didn't say equally all the time . If you think any set of humans are above others your wrong.its good the government has complete authority on power and I pray none of the groups on that list will ever hold any power.
It's a huge understatement though, like saying having a cold is bad like ebola is bad, but not equally.
We all know right wing extremism is way worse today because statistically they've killed a lot of fucking people. You don't see libertarians or socialists or democrats doing even half of what they do.
i don’t think we can regard the perpetrators of the Uyghur genocide as left wing tho, even if they purport to be communists. it’s a very fascistic rule.
In the past and present you do though like the holodomor, the Uyghur genocide, etc. The list just goes on and ones ranging from theocracies to utopian idealists. The reality is we don't have enough resources on this planet and have extreme levels of inequality and have had constant violence. Most people just want to live decent lives and try to build a better future for there children. Not have to deal with any extremists trying to force everyone to have to live a certain way so in that way I find it hard to compare any ideology to terrorism unless there is a correlation with all of them.
and to your other point, you can definitely put one group of humans above another, ethically speaking. no need to cite examples because we’re already dealing with a perfect one.
