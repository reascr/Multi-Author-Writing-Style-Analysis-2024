Only none of them exhibit any signs of being "mowed down" by a LMG. If you watch the second video you can see blood pooling under all their heads. A PKM would have torn them to shreds and the bodies would have had multiple other gunshot wounds over the lenh of their bodies. Also, the Judas soldier was standing above them. A controlled burst wouldn't have hit every one of those soldiers perfectly. Maybe one or two, but not all of them. These guys were 100% executed, and rightly so IMO. Fake surrendering is a war crime and calls into question every succeeding time an enemy combatant attempts to surrender. Once that guy started shooting they couldn't trust that one of the others wasn't lying in wait to pull a hidden pistol or a grenade, or were waiting on impending re-enforcements.
In the video circulating you can see the Russian troops surrendering and then the last Russian soldier starts shooting injuring the cameraman, pretending to surrender and then attacking the other party is a war crime and makes those other soldiers an active threat, not POWs.
...we are conscious of this attempt at propaganda, and can debunk it with additional footage from the same recording?
