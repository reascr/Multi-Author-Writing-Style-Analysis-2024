I’m reading Azimov’s Foundation series currently and it is eerie how the similarities are between his description of stagnation of innovative thought and the intellectual stagnation of the US’s economic blue bloods.
I’m jumping around a bit because the because Second Foundation isn’t available for awhile from my local public library. So I’m on to Prelude to Foundation now, it’s okay but so far lacks a little of the charm of the older novels.
