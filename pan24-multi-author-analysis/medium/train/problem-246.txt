I keep saying it and I'm gonna keep saying it. These mother fuckers learned nothing from the last 40ish years of cyberpunk media. It's all fun and games when it's neon, synth, and cool body mods but none of that compares to the total loss of the middle class, unchecked corpo greed, the destruction of the environment, and getting your dick shot off by robo cops that comes with it. These robot dogs should scare the shit out of anyone who sees them but instead it's "aww cute look at them dance". I literally have nightmares about these fucking machines.
