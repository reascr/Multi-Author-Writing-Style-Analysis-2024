To say nothing of the current games the Republicans are playing with things like the debt ceiling which could drastically harm the ability for the country to function. I think the issue here is that we've ended up in this weird place where the Republican constituency is so utterly braindead/brainwashed that their elected Reps are cheered on for doing things that harm America and then when it is done and people realize that harm was done those very same people blame Democrats for what their elected politicians did. Rinse & repeat over and over.
