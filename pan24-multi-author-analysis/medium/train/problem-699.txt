One, music taste is subjective. You don't have to like it but some people do. But that's ultimately irrelevant because of number two.
Two, they have a long history of civil disobedience. And in a country where people fall out of windows for less that's pretty fuckin' brave.
But honestly when people see these stories they may like the post or even share it but that’s where it stops. I just think they’re not doing much to further their cause, and worse to their own personal detriment. It’s social media activism without the results.
If not, I suspect your point wouldn't ring true for people living in Russia. At least not for everyone.
No I’m American and very much anti Russian, pro Ukraine. Maybe you’re right but at the same time I don’t think many Russians are standing up to Putin - with or without Pussy Riot’s help. Does the average Russian care about pussy riot, or do they see them as a lesbian trouble makers paid for by American CIA? Probably the latter.
Eh, all we can really do is speculate. But the simple reality is they openly resist the oppressive nature of Putin's regime when the punishments can be as cruel as they are arbitrary is admirable in it's own right.
The fact that they are openly lbq+ and women only amplify the risks of their civil disobedience. You may not like their methods or doubt the efficacy but it's easy to make that judgement from the comfort of a country that doesn't punish behavior like that.
