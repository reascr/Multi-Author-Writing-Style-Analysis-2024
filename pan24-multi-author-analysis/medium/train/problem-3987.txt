It seemed like such a strange move at the time, all things considered. NATO was somewhat of a beauracratic placeholder with decades of relative world peace under our belts and a general understanding that we can all get along with the advancements in technology where the general public had their own interests in mind and borders weren't actually that important. Before russias aggression, people were mostly free to travel wherever they wanted and the idea of NATO seemed to be more symbolic than anything else. Attacking NATO just seemed weird, but man, it all really makes sense now.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
