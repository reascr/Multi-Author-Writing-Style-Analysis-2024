so the GOP gets and EVEN LESS qualified candidate (who just also happens to be black and I grantee you some GOP half brain thought they REALLY figured it out when they saw Herschel Walker "we'll run a black guy too!") and he loses.
he didn't lose by much though. that's the point. If there was an "October" suprise for Warnock, or the issues with the sleep away camp came up again ( surprised that didn't ), we would have Senator CTE.
the problem isn't the republican candidates. its the party as a whole: their views, values and disdain for their own constituency.
The ultimate issue is that Republican primary voters are very different from Republican general voters, and even more different from the general populace. Republican primary voters are very extreme. I don't know how they can resolve this problem without essentially fixing their primaries.
