Not too hard to imagine when the film and media is heavily regulated into ensuring they don't conflict with state propaganda or make them a vehicle for propaganda.
"Wolf warrior diplomacy." The term was coined from the Chinese action film Wolf Warrior 2. This approach is in contrast to the prior Chinese diplomatic practices of Deng Xiaoping, which had emphasized the use of cooperative rhetoric and the avoidance of controversy.
Wolf warrior diplomacy is confrontational and combative, with its proponents loudly denouncing any perceived criticism of the Chinese government, its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and associated policies on social media and in interviews, as well as using physical violence against protestors and dissidents.
Depends on whether it's the book or not (unlike the film, the book has Rambo as a psychopath who murders possibly dozens of people just doing their jobs, Teasle - I don't remember him as any kind of bigot - originally moved him out of town because he correctly picked Rambo was trouble - I don't remember in the book that a friend lived there - it was the town where Rambo finally snapped and came back after being moved on unlike the previous towns - and Trautman had to be brought him in to put him down like a rabid dog after Rambo basically burned it down and killed numerous police officers - pre novel retcon, his last words about Rambo to a mortally wounded Teasle was something like "and that's why I blew his head off with this shotgun.").
