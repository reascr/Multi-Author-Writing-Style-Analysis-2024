It has been shown - even in Syria - how behind Russia technologically is. Their only path to any victory was volume, solving any issue with massive fire power and cannon fodder. They bombed cities and population centers with dumb bombs in Syria, Libya, and Ukraine.
When they faced western weapons, they first lost the air superiority. Then their long range cannons turned out to be shorter range compared to the western weapons.
Their next solution was attacking civilian infrastructure with large swarms of drones and cruise missiles. And they are out of drones now.
The writing is on the wall. They cannot beat Ukraine and there will be a regime change in Russia. What remains is a decision by Putin on how many more lives will be lost before he retreats to one of his mansions.
Two things - Russia didn’t attain air superiority even before western weapons poured into Ukrainian; Russia bombed civilian targets from the very beginning of the war.
It is not Russian Doctrine to acquire air superiority or supremacy. Also their inability to take out most of UAs AA and SAM systems during the opening salvo of the war, just made it worse. I don't think Russian command truly understands how important air superiority is in modern conflicts.
My layman thinking is that they didn’t think they will need it. They thought that they would decapicate the command and the rest of residence would crumble quickly after.
