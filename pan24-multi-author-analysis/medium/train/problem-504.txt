I have yet to hear a single person mention this outside of Reddit. It's scary the way people will completely ignore major shit that affects everyone but will argue about pointless culture war shit, exactly as planned.
A lot of the culture war posts and conversations are precipitated by bad actors, bots, and the media. It is why we are constantly inundated with it, and why tools like Chat GPT are being pushed into the limelight, as they give said bad actors the chance to inundate us even further with more of the same automstically.
I wish more of us could see it for what it is so that we could all actually get on the same page and organize against the aristocracies that are controlling us with these tricks and tools, but sadly more people are pulled into the fake bullshit than see through it.
This is a political choice of Macron's government, the impoverishment of the lower / middle classes for the benefit of the richest. The deficit is a choice this government made, they are basically stealing from the poorest to give to the richest (do your homework and you will understand how. Hint: government employees are being paid their extra hours as bonuses instead of salaries (on which the employer (government) is supposed to contribute to the social security on behalf of their employees). Hey, has it not happened yet in your country?
