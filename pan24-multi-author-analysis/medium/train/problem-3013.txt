Professional pollsters like YouGov and MorningConsult which were fairly accurate last year are showing the same thing. DeSantis took a lead for a couple of months after the Midterms, but Trump has taken it back in most polls.

GOP pollsters are notoriously unprofessional and, as a result, inaccurate, as we saw in 2022. So figuring out who this pollster is and how far off they were in 2022 is first order of business.
BUT interesting that Trump is so far ahead of DeSantis with GOP'ers as previous polls showed the opposite. Rally round the crook syndrome maybe?
