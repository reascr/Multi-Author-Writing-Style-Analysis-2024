I think I would prefer we elect a government committed to the arrest and trial of both Putin and MBS if they are ever dumb enough to step out of their countries. A criminal is a criminal and I don't care what title they hold.
If your average cop or State and Local Official have Qualified Immunity, it’s not hard to understand how a leader of another country would be shielded. In addition there’s the concept of Diplomatic Immunity regardless of what Lethal Weapons Riggs and Murtaugh think.
Most sovereigns are exempt from lawsuits in other countries by definition. This is standard and honestly makes sense. How could we have jurisdiction to enforce a penalty on the sovereign leader of a foriegn country? How do you penalize a nation's ruler without pissing off their whole country?
It would be nice if we could just allow the suit and seize crown assets to compensate the victim. But that is unrealistic given international politics.
