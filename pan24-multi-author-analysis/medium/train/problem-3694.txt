“We won’t scold you for being uncomfortable with social changes that are brand new, we won’t sneer at you for not having the correct media consumption and recreation habits” is the Trump Republican platform, I would not underestimate it. Dems should be running on labor unions, taxing corporations and the rich, abortion freedom, student debt relief, and the executing the CEO of every health insurance and pharmaceutical company at the reflecting pool right after the 2024 inauguration.
So if I'm keeping score correctly - without hyperbole, the entirety of the 2023 GOP platform is that they are against gender issue tolerance, against racial diversity education, against gender topics in any level of education, against same-sex equity, pro-Christian takeover of government, pro-censorship, pro- (sounds ridiculous, but here we are), against free-enterprise exercising their right to refuse service (unless in the case of refusing gay wedding cakes), against body autonomy in women, against support for education post-high-school, and the list goes on. All 'culture war' issues with no substantial legislative proposition.
