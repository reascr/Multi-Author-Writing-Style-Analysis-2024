I support anyone who is not hurting anyone else, to include LGBTQ, but none of the Canadian politico's responses did anything substantive to help that community in Russia, but they did help their own PR efforts, as well as the Russian's effort to make themselves look strong to the internal and external audiences they care about influencing.
St-Onge said in a statement that she was “profoundly offended” by the Russians’ anti-LGBTQ messages “while on Canadian soil”. “We will always always stand up for what we believe in, especially to countries that have no respect for human life, carry out illegal invasions and commit crimes against humanity.”.
One of main Russian propaganda is west is depraved civilization wanna contaminate "pure and strong" Russia into weak LGBTQ free dirty nation and Russians cheer for it.
Its great to mock Putin for his losses, but the majority of those dying did not sign up to fight. They were most likely forced to, or be killed. They have a family just like us.
So Russian tweets are the most pressing concern for the Canadian government? And how do any of the responses described change the Russian perspective? The Russian tweets are by design, and the bait was happily swallowed by virtue signaling politicians.
