Hakeem Jeffries represents the status quo of the old guard and the monied side of the blue aisle and neither of those should be dictating our party’s future.
At the end of the day, the House Democrats should stand with teachers and the progressives that have delivered them so much success.
If you go by Nancy age & his age, & if he is in power for as long as she has, he’ll be there for 30 years. I want a better leader long before that time. Don’t just throw away a generation or 2 on someone who mimics “the old guard”, of the Dems. Get better.
What was he supposed to do? Just stop taking bribes? Let the progressives stop him from taking bribes? Not while he still draws breath. He will fight for a long as he is able to continue the corruption and you should thank him he isn’t worse.
He’s a young politician who can fundraise well and will push back against a progressive takeover of the party. Those are the major selling points for neoliberals.

Wow, it’s pretty bad. I would hope someone like aoc or bernie would be leader. Pipe dream, I know, but I just hope. That’s all. Even if it ain’t gonna happen.
