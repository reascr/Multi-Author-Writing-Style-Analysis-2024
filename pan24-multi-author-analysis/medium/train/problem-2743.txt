Had covid just after Thanksgiving, I dont know which variant exactly. Woke up Sunday and had a tickle in my throat with a slight cough, then woke up Monday and the tickle was gone but had a massive headache and a fever of 101.7. Tuesday the headache went away but the fever went up to 102.7 and my nose got runny and stuffy but not so bad that I couldnt breath out of it and it was at this point I noticed I couldnt smell the coffee that was brewing in the kitchen and I went and stuck my nose in the coffee grounds and couldnt smell a thing and knew I had covid and had a test done. Wednesday early morning my fever broke and was like 100 ish for the day and my nose was still running then came back that night and broke again Thursday morning and after that it never came back. From that point on all I had was a cough from all the post nasal drip and a runny nose BUT it was then that the brain fog came on and it got so much worse at night for some reason and im still feeling that to a degree even today.
It's like the 2K23 version of COVID: same shit as last year, but people will all go out and get it anyway because the old one is no longer supported by our immune system .
