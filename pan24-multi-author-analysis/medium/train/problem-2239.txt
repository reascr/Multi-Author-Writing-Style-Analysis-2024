It's actually impressive how crypto has utterly dwarfed the sum total of every other confidence game in human history.
No reason why anyone would to listen to me since I’m a nobody, but I’ve thought that crypto was a hustle and a scam from day one. What gave it away, in my mind, was the mad dash of investors, most of them funds or already wealthy individuals, looking greedily to make more. Always more. From something that produced nothing and neither had nor created tangible value. That’s how all Ponzi schemes have worked since Ponzi himself was born.
I mean this isn’t a real crypto company. It a centralized bank for decentralized assets. So it’s just an unregulated bank. Regulators pushed and supported these guys because they were wealthy and it provided them back doors they could use. And with the massive amount of capital they got from VCs they could buy or force out any real competition.
Crypto is a big fad with a lot of money behind it so that mostly paralyzes any kind of sane response in democracies.
The sane people see this as an uncontrolled forest fire which will just have to burn itself out along with those foolish enough to go anywhere near it. When the fire is gone and everyone despises crypto and its politician defenders all have scandals, maybe then it can be banned.
