We are doing some truly horrific things to the world’s animal populations on land and in the oceans and if the systems start to collapse in major ways (they’re already collapsing…we’ve overfished a third of fish stocks in the oceans already for example) then we’ll be completely screwed.
Sadly once upon a time conservatives did believe in conserving the environment. Goldwater was a proponent of the corporate death penalty for polluters.
I wish more about the actual effects we see on the planet were highlighted more when discussions about climate change and human activity come up. We see talk about global temp changes and ice melt, but I wish there was more focus on what was happening in the oceans and why it’s some super scary shit that needs to be addressed RIGHT NOW. Phytoplankton is responsible for half of the oxygen we breathe and it’s the base of the food chain for ALL life in the ocean. Some scary changes are already occurring with phytoplankton and we need to reverse course immediately. The situation in the oceans is beyond five-alarm fire levels.
