When I was in the marines I always saw the marine corps times (I'm pretty sure its the same company) as kind of a tabloid for Marines. Entertaining to read but mostly focused on drama around the commandant or the government mixed in with "how to avoid a hangover” type articles. Also the crossword was easy enough to be doable for someone on a crayon diet so that was nice.

The instability that stemmed from this event continues to be a threat to our security domestically and internationally.
