Given what they'd just been through to secure independence, it probably shouldn't surprise you to learn that the founders were, generally, super horny for guns. That's not a joke. The Federalist Papers, which were supposed to be a sales pitch for why the U.S. Constitution was awesome, regularly reassured people that if anything too shitty happened as a result of various unpleasant compromises, there could just be another violent revolution. The threat of such a violent revolution was appealed to as a reason why, for example, an entirely-possible 'minority federal government' (sound familiar?) would not unduly abuse its position.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
