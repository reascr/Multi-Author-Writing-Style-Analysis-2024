But I’m joking about how it was done. Trump has claimed that the classified documents he held at MAL were declassified, by him, in his brain, the moment he took them from the White House. This is obviously not how it works, but if anyone ever wanted to actually try to enforce the Emoluments Clause, this would almost certainly be a part of his many, many assertions about the gifts and money he received in office.

They weren’t given to me, they were given to the US, but using the boundless power of the presidency, I decided that they should be given to me by the US. It happened the moment someone told me that accepting a gift violated the emoluments clause, whatever that is. Anyway, it doesn’t do that anymore, it’s beautiful.
