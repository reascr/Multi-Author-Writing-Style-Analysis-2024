It took a long while for Elon Musk's reputation to be ruined. It took years and years of being a billionaire asshole to do so. All the while until recently, he had millions of millions of fans, who thought he was a superior person because he had some sort of superior abilities, when in fact, he is just another born rich, sick in the head, anti-social billionaire living in his own King on Earth will all the toys, whores and millions of employees, who merely owns people because he has enough money not to even notice. These people are not heroes, they are sick.
We revere mass murderers, billionaires and the worst humanity has to offer all the time. To change how people view power hungry maniacs you need to do an honest accounting of history and tell the stories of how the people that destroyed lives, towns and cities weâ€™re disgusting and vile people instead of continuously holding them up on a pedestal. If you do that then people like Putin would never exist. He exist because his behavior is what has been acceptable in Russia and the rest of the world for thousands of years.
I agree. Billions and billions in advertising are spent to make us peasants and slaves think the billionaires are 'good people' for owning so many slaves. I don't get it, but I never really been well ingratiated into society and don't understand why people put up with having entire nations dominated by a few people only because they are evil enough to soak up all available resources and power no matter the cost.
