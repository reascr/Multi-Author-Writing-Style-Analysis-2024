Probably more so than any Democratic accomplishment, any direct Trump scandal, or any other issue the assault on reproductive rights is what made the Republicans only achieve a meager victory in the House and actually loose a Senate seat. I’m one of the biggest complainers about Dems snatching defeat from the jaws of victory but god damn have the GOP been trying hard to ensure they’re the party known for that. Between this, easy to understand and obvious fuckery with the tax code that clearly benefits the rich that’s on their platform, going after SS, and the clown show candidates they’ve been putting forward I just cannot fathom how they think this is a winning path. A small part of me honestly wonders if they aren’t intentionally screwing the pooch and trying to do anything but win.
