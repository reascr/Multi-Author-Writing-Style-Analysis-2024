... Are you seriously that dense? Have you not been paying attention at all? Putin, the top leadership and many medium-ranking government workers and related people were and are absolutely sanctioned. Most vital sectors of the Russian economy have also been targeted, some of them since 2014. The goal is to reduce the Kremlin's revenue for the war and make waging it difficult, if not impossible. I suspect another latent goal is to provoke a regime change, although that's a lot more farfetched, and requires a lot of favorable circumstances. Here are the sanctions imposed by just the EU:
He wouldn’t be wrong. Seized assets are normally held as, basically, ransom - the idea being that you’ll hold onto it and only give them back once demands are met (usually, cession of aggressions).
The US isn’t just trying to aid Ukraine - it’s saying they no longer believe negotiations will be productive.
That, or they think sanctions will be sufficient leverage by themselves. Which is also a decent possibility.
