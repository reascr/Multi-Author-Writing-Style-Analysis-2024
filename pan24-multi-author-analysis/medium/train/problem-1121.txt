Arguably (the arguments are bad, but they're there) it's not, which is why China is so annoyed with Putin. China has consistently said that because Taiwan is "special" in that they never established sovereignty on a global-scale (deeply flawed argument, but technically true since even the US has been slow to recognize them) they are different from countries like Ukraine and (reading between the lines) therefore can be invaded without violation of sovereignty.
By invading Ukraine using a slap-dash combination of reasons that includes this argument (that Ukraine and other former USSR states are "special") Putin has tied Ukraine and Taiwan together, which actually weakens China's position as a whole and exposes in real-time why it's an unacceptable argument. These countries ARE sovereign, whether their former imperialist regimes like it or not.
While I agree with your comment in general, I think your representation of Taiwan's political situation is wrong. In particular, it's not that "they never established sovereignty on a global-scale", it's that they lost such recognition. Taiwan (or rather, Republic of China) was the only China there was for decades, and even after the civil war and establishment of the PRC on the mainland, ROC was a permanent member of the UN SC until 1971. Your post seems to suggest that Taiwan is a separatist state trying to break away from "their former imperialist regime". No. Taiwan is the former imperialist regime.
If I'm not mistaken, the official position of both PRC and ROC is that there is only one sovereign state: China, consisting of both mainland and Taiwan. The dispute is over which of the two is the legitimate government, a bloodless continuation of the civil war that never formally ended.
