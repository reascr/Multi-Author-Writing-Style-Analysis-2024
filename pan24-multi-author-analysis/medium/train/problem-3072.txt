Oh absolutely. I’m guessing he got a phone call suggesting it would be viewed favorably if he were to make certain statement, and take certain positions.
Pretty sure Biden said something like “any negotiations are between Ukraine and Russia. The US won’t dictate peace talks for a conflict we’re not actively fighting in”.
Edit: Biden’s exact words were at the G20 Summit and they were, “I've been very clear that we're going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves – and we are not going to engage in any negotiation. There's nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, this is a decision Ukraine has to make.” [emphasis mine].
Any negotiations with the US would lend credence to Russian sentiment they are fighting everyone in the West. This is about Ukraine, and they need to negotiate a peace settlement as they see fit, when they see fit. Right now, they’re holding the Russians by their nose and kicking them in the ass. I don’t see Ukraine pressing for a settlement when they appear to be winning the war and want to press for Russia to leave all of the occupied territories.
