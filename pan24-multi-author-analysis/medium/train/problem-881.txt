The likelihood is just so so so low. We’re not just talking about the vastness of space, but also time. The amount of time it takes for a species to evolve to the level it would need to be, would be at least as long as human history, if not millions of years longer. This other species would have to evolve to the right level at exactly the right time we humans happen to be here on Earth, in just the last couple hundred thousand years, compared to the billions of years on the time scale of the universe. Even if there’s many many alien species out there on other planets… they’re probably either still just in the bacteria stage, or they died out millions of years ago after reaching the pinnacle of their civilization. The sliver of time that a species would be likely to be able to be at the right level of development to become a space-faring species… is SO incredibly unlikely to line up with the time that you and I are alive. It’s incredibly unlikely to line up with the time that humans exist. We’ve only been here a couple hundred thousand years, we’ll probably only be here for like another couple hundred thousand at most, and even if we do develop light speed travel, we’d still only be able to reach the one nearest galaxy in about 100,000 years.
If aliens are technologically advanced enough to travel the distance, they sure aren't going to let themselves get detected let alone shot down. Part of me wants it to be aliens though. That'll be cool to see lol.
