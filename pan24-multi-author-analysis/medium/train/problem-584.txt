The plan is to get rid of the platform (the LRU and the base M270s stocked alike) and replace them by a new long range artillery platform by 2027. There is no report about France sending its old M270s to Ukraine and there probably will never be. I don't know why anyone would think France would very publicly be sending its old stocked M270 systems that are only able to operate the M26 rockets, when it literally signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions that deems them inhumane to use lmao. Neither the UK nor Germany sent their old M270s. They signed the same convention.
More importantly, it is specifically what the French defense minister had spoken about sending a few weeks ago. It was reported by various outlets and what is confirmed to have been sent:
It does, but multiple MLRS vehicles can work together with command and control to form a larger system.
I think they avoid calling it MLRSS to avoid confusion...but because more than 1 vehicle is involved, MLRS system is actually correct.
