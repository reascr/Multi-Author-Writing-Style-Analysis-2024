I've noticed that in recent months, second half of this year I guess, Amazon has gone from being pretty damn quick to get items, to a very slow and arduous process. I will place an order and maybe within a week and a half it will post as shipped. Then I've got to wait for it to arrive which even with prime is usually about a week.
This is a weird article. No mention beyond the facts in the title, not a division, nothing. Thanks Forbes.
This was expected. During the pandemic Amazon were piping goods directly to consumers who could not leave their homes during the pandemic. They also saw huge business gains in their cloud offering AWS from a surge in demand for digital content, driving again by the pandemic and remote working / staying at home (netflix and of course amazon prime runs on AWS, Zoom and lots of other large service providers).
Now the world is out of lockdown, has seen its spending power limited due to energy prices / general living costs, Amazon no longer needs some of its 1 million + army of workers.
