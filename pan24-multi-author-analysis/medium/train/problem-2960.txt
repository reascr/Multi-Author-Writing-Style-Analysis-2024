What about Jordan and black september? If Israel acted like Jordan integrating the population providing equal rights and citizenship remove military law and release all political and military prisoners then the conflict would have been over, the fact that most Jordanians and most palestinians refused to take part in the fighting should tell you something, my grandfather refused direct orders from the king and almost got to court for it, but again it was in the past like more than 50 years ago.
2010 bruh, the issue was resolved and those fucks were all fired, but of course you prefer to only listen to a single news 13 years ago and not follow up on it because it fits you political agendas, ffs go to jordan and see for yourself.
This is why i hate it when people who have no idea about what happened talk about it, palestinians didn't try to take over it was parties both Jordanian and palestinian trying to take over, palestinians aren't guests who we are generous to give citizenship they are our brothers and this is their country aa well so if they fuck up it is the same as Jordanians fucking up and we did plenty of that we tried like dozens of times to throw the monarchy, the reason being is that many were pan arabists or syrian nationalists who preferred unity, it was troubled time but we got through it just fine.
Yes Israel should treat palestinians as equal or leave them be, the reason why dont hear about palestinians violence in Jordan nowadays is simply because they are equal, every single incident of violence since the 70a was by jordanians or syrians, had israel taken our approach then it would jave been fine.
Also the fact that you claim the black september was started by palestinians trying to take over jordan shows that you only heard about it from anti palestinian sources, it was started an organization led by nayef hawatmeh (jordanian of a family that lived in salt for millennials) tried to assassinate the king, hawatmeh was supportive of palestinian left wing parties and ended up dragging them along with the entirety of the plo, most of the plo fighters refused to fight and ended up surrendering and they were released soon afterwards, the man who led the gov responsible for the crackdown on hawatmeh and the plo on the other hand was a palestinian from a familt well known across the arab world, the head of the intelligence was also palestinian and half of the army was made up of palestinians, at the time there was a higher anti monarchist sentiment from jordanians while most palestinians to this day view the monarchy favorably even the ones outside jordan .
If israel got the same results as we have then the conflict is over, there is no more conflict, our mistake was allowing parties to be armed being to easy on their transgressions on the sovereignty while no one would think it was about if palestinians should have had citizenship, also palestinians were much better educated and were much better at trade and manufacturing so i hate to admit it but they are the ones to make this country turn from a desert not worth occupying into the most advanced and educated country jn the arab world.
Remember when both and the repeated their offer to Hamas for like the 100th time to disarm the smuggled rockets which they fire on civilian areas and got them blockaded in the first place ( And which get intercepted by Iron Dome anyway ) if they want Israel to completely lift their blockade, and even if they returned hostages and ceased hostilities?
