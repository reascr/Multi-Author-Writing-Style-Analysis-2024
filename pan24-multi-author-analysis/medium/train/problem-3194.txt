As someone not fully literate in economics, how is this measured? Inflationwise are there real life price comparisons and is buying power relevant or can inflation make it falsely look like number go big so economy goes brrrr?
Recession has 0 relation to inflation. A recession means 2 quarters of negative GDP growth. What this article is saying is that the German economy is going to continue to grow.
The term recession in general has 0 connection to buying power or the cost of living. It is literally just a term to describe the big picture stuff for the entire economy.
Thanks for trying to answer my question but I couldn't understand why gdp and in turn a recession should be independent from inflation. Turns out they very much are dependent, so like I thought the gdp is higher when inflation occurs, making a recession less likely to occur in the statistics while in fact the living standard is sinking. They actually invented a new measure RealGDP to calculate the inflation out, but there doesn't seem to be a standard way to do it...
When the economy is booming and unemployment is low there is high demand in the economy for goods. This bids up prices. This is why the Fed will usually raise interest rates to slow the economy to prevent inflation. When the economy is doing poorly, there is low demand and prices are bid down, this can cause deflation. The Fed then lowers interest rates to increase demand.
A recession itself just means 2 quarters of negative GDP growth. It can correlate with the above, but it doesn't have to.
