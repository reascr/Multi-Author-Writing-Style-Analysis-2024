Iran’s war plans against the US aren’t to face the US head on, fighter to fighter, tank to tank. They’ve trained their military to be professional insurgents. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps for example are known for setting up insurgencies across the Middle East. They want to leverage their massive 85 million strong population, massive territory and mountainous terrain to drag the US army into a second Afghanistan, another quagmire for which the American regime will be bled dry of political will to continue fighting. Moreover, there is also the possibility that if US warships enter the Persian Gulf, suicide boats will be employed to sink them for little cost which is as a strategy employed and validated in the Millennium Challenge 2002 war game.
One of the major issues for their Air Force isn’t a lack of planes or pilots, but a lack of munitions for their jets. Jet munitions are “smart” munitions and Russia isn’t able to make more of those with the sanctions. The only use their jets have are as kamikaze weapons since any intelligence application has been taken over by harder to target drones.
You’re getting upvotes because people assume you’re shit talking russias planes lol. Grounding a couple planes out of hundreds is a rounding error in countries that can afford maintenance for their planes.
