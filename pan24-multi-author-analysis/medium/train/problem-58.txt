Putin solves problems by chipping away from all sides. For a mountain of corpses it means leave some in the field, bury some, burn many, fly some back in secret, and for the rest lie that they weren't even there.
Similar as what they did with the mobilization. We thought it would be political suicide to do that. But with a combination of calling it something else, lying about the numbers, drafting from areas far away, not drafting all at the same time, keeping drafting after they said they stopped, and crushing the residual protests that popped up they managed to get over that obstacle as well.
Putin want tighter control on information concerning dead soldiers so he dispatch his private air fleet to discreetly send bodies back to Russia from Ukraine.
Also saw a video of Russian corpses being dumped in a mass grave by dump truck. Sadly didn't save the reddit post but it's out there.
I guess they can't handle the amount of corpses. Had seen a video of locals telling that they saw allot of smoke at their local landfill but where denied entry by the Russians. Everywhere around the landfill there was the smell of burned flesh.
