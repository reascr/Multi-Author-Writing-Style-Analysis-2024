The thing I’m constantly trying to point out to people is that the Democrats are the only ones even addressing issues like healthcare, wages, climate change, etc. Republicans complain and whine but never offer up any alternate solutions. It’s all about stopping the Dem agenda and culture war bullshit.

why must it always, always, always fall to democrats to make these overtures? i don't remember the last time i heard anything close to this sentiment from the right...i mean shit, it must've been Romney on the campaign trail in '08 or maybe McCain before he teamed up with that empty headed soccer mom.
I don’t always agree with everything the Democrats push, but it’s clear they’re the only adults in the room and the only ones who even care about important issues.
The republicans addressed healthcare -they repealed ACA. I think most agreed that ACA wasn’t perfect, but it was something. We are still waiting for the ACA replacement. Not holding my breath.
