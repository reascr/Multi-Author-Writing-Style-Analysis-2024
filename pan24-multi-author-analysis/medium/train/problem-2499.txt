DeSantis I think is banking on the possibility that Trump will be indicted. If that happens, then DeSantis will run. He's trying to position himself to be the MAGA-alternative that MAGA voters would fall back on if Trump can't run or is too damaged. But he's being very careful not to connect himself too much to Trump that it would damage him if Trump goes down. Under this theory, it makes sense why DeSantis would be quietly trying to distance himself from Trump. Trump obviously notices this happening and its bruising his ego.
