News about Bradley's and Patriots lifted my spirits a lot. You can't imagine how much people in Ukraine talk about American weapons. They are one of the symbols of our fight for freedom. We literally have parents naming their daughter .
I remember 1 kid on the playground would pull that shit as someone was shooting in basketball games. We ended up not letting him play. He whined to the school staff and after we explained what he was pulling the staff told him he needed to find another activity at recess.
I wish that were the case at my school, this one kid would fall over and pretend to start crying every time he was 'it' in tag so they banned us from playing. Fuck that kid.
When we were kids playing tag there was always that one kid whoâ€™d announce a safe base where they were standing just before being tagged. No one liked that kid. That is what putin is trying.
I don't think Ukrainians want to grab some russian land. However, personally, I do think that a DMZ on a russian territory close to the border would be a great idea.
russia bombed us on New Years' eve, shelled Kherson killing 20+ people, bombed us on our Christmas, and every single other day. And even when they are not bombing us they are torturing and killing people every single day on occupied territories so there is no way we can ever stop until people are free. They are waiting for us.
