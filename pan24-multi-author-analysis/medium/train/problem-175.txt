In other words, NJ used to have a law that banned carry in specific locations such as casinos. But when they passed their new law, they took out the language stating that certain locations are banned for carry and replaced it with language stating that all locations were banned for carry along with a list of places that are exempt from that provision. When the judge said "banning carry in all places is not okay," and enjoined the law, it doesn't revert back to the previous law banning carry in specific locations, that law just doesn't exist anymore. And when the law governing banning carry in certain places doesn't exist anymore, it falls back to "if it isn't explicitly banned, then it's allowed.".
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

The frequency of tragic events has no bearing on you stating that having a mass shooting linked to allowing firearms in casinos would somehow be a good thing.
