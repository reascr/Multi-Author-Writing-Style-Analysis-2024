All submissions to /r/politics need to be explicitly about current US politics. This means that if a subject has political implications but does not directly discuss politics it is most likely off topic.
To be explicitly political, submissions should focus on one of the following things that have political significance:
Information and opinions concerning the running of US governments, courts, public services and policy-making.
Private political actions and stories such as demonstrations, lobbying, candidacies and funding and political movements, groups and donors.
