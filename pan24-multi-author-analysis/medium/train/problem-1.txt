How is this comment considered okay? It wouldn’t be okay to say something like this about any other country. It’s my country, I was born and raised there, why do you wish it to be burn with its beautiful nature and people, instead of saying something like “I want the Russian army to burn, I want peace, and I want to see both Ukraine and Russia become democratic and prosperous countries”? If you really believe all Russians are evil, then you have no idea what’s going on there. Every Friday roscomnadzor bans a bunch of Russian organizations and individuals who are pro-LGBT/anti-war/anti-corruption etc. These are thousands of people working as the opposition to Pootin. If you check a telegram channel named “romasuperromasuper”, you’ll see there Taras Shevchenko’s (a Ukrainian poet) memorial in Saint Petersburg with flowers brought by Russians after the tragedy in Dnipro. There were numerous mass protests against Putin (Bolotnaya square, for example), or when brave journalists or leaders of the opposition were killed or jailed. There are millions of Russians who want this to stop. They want to live in a peaceful and prosperous country, but they have no leader, and a protest without a leader is futile. Armless people just get jailed for bringing flower to a Ukrainian memorial or doing literally anything against their government.
Also could be important as a lot of people think that Russia should not have simply just inherited the USSR’s position on the UNSC. Continuity of government sometimes matters.
