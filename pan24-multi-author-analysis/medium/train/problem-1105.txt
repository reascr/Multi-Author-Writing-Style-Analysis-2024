Reminds me of our former Prime Minister Najib (the famous 1MDB scandal) received some "gifts" from the Saudi or something back then.
As someone from Malaysia, it's not surprising that its the northern states, Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah that are ruled by the Malaysia Islamic Party (PAS). I'm a Muslim too but it's ridiculous they're implementing laws like these that are not irrelevant to the current situation.
Reports say that they were trying to control the lives of their counterparts through religion and acting generally oppressive and aggressive. One male commented:
“I don’t like this. We should do something about this, it is not nice to have women do these things. It is our job.”.
Kelantan is facing floods and the fucker Minister there said it's because of rain and it's normal , that's all and nothing else. I've been seeing a trend of fascists these fuckers been going, which they're partnering with other parties under the National Alliance coalition.
Edit 2: Also to let people know for general knowledge, religious affairs are state matters so the level of Syaria laws implementation on each states are different.
