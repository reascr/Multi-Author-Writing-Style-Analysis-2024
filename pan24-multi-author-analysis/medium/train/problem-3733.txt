They didn't mention the Home in Preservation computer glitch. I was doing that job at that time and I knew that there was something wrong when people that should have gotten modifications for their home loans didn't get them. People lost everything and then just a couple years ago they came back and tried to give them $10,000 retribution, to those people that lost everything because of a glitch in the computer system. The way I see it if the underwriters knew what they were doing rather than just going by a computer program, then they would have been able to tell that there was some kind of a glitch too. And I'm not a math whiz but the people that were getting declined, all of their stuff that they turned in said they should have gotten it.
