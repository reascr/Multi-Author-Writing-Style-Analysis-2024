i think we're pretty much already there, with some aesthetic play-democracy that as it stands now can only be meaningfully influenced if you're worth at least 8 figures.
The wealthy who own the congress and the papers are making us fight each other. The wealthy hope for a revolution where they can make even more money by picking at the corpse of what was the USA.
If you want to save the USA as a democratic country, you have to get rid of the ultrawealthy. There's no other way.
I don't know if that'll matter by that time. The wealthy have been quite effective in generating an army of fanatics to fight for them by subverting democracy. In ten years, I think we might be a neo-feudalist oligarchy with no hope of changing things except by direct action like the French and Russians employed.
