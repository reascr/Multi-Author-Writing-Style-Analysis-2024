Trump said if he got a second term he was going to pull us out of NATO. They were working in tandem; without a Biden presidency we could very well be in ww3 with the US on the side of Russia.
Millions of Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts until at least the end of March, the head of a major energy provider said.
Relentless air strikes have destroyed half of Ukraine's energy capacity as temperatures in Kyiv drop below freezing, President Volodomyr Zelensky has said.
Sergey Kovalenko, the head of YASNO, which provides energy for Kyiv, added: "Stock up on warm clothes, blankets, think about options that will help you wait a long outage.
Chaos is a ladder for fascism, Trump is a fascist who literally licked Putin's ass at all possible moments.
Trump also actively disparaged our allies over and over again, in my opinion looking to break ties with us allies as early as 2016/2017. Look what he did to the Kurds, he literally got them to take their defenses down and then purposely pulled out our troops out and allowed them to be massacred, and handed Russia a US airbase.
He was actively attempting to destroy our alliances and signal to other Western Nations that we couldn't be trusted.
