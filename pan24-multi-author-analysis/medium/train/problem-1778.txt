excuse me that is very rude ok, Ron DeSanctimonious, you know I said that the other day and even the Fake News loved it, and that's how you know that it maybe isn't so bad to the Democrats, and now you have, and we're saying this Very Loosely ok, Very Loosely, you have a Republican Party, and they're so strong under Trump, Incredibly Strong, but then you have Governor Ron, and if he were to do an Illegal Coup against me, just like Sleepy Joe did thanks to Obama and Crooked Hillary, then you would see me going up even way past 100 points. I'm already close to breaking so many more Records it's unbelievable. first you had Nixon, then you had Ronald Reagan, and I don't have to tell you he liked me a lot, and we all know why, but then comes President Trump, right out of the gate, Perfect Score. it's amazing. ok, thank you, have a good time.
