Almost like reactionary political actors are more international in outlook than they pretend to be. Hitler and Mussolini backed Franco. The America First Committee of the 1930s and 1940s blew up in a series of scandals when it turned out they were part of a scheme run by German spies to spread Nazi propaganda using the free mail congressmen get by right (and also that they were coordinating with a bunch of weird right wing hate propagandists and paramilitaries). The modus operandi of these types haven't changed.
There's a lot of paralells between fascist activity in the US then and now. Pelley's Silvershirts and the Christian Front have a lot in common with the Proud Boys/3 Percenters/Oathkeepers of our day, as do Tucker Carlson and Father Caughlin (the most popular propagandist of that era). There's also a lot of similarity between law enforcement being slow to recognize these groups as a threat for various reasons. A key difference though is that last time this stuff sprung up, there wasn't a presidential administration actively stoking the flames like Trump did.
They could maybe cut some places off from it for a time. But destroy it? of course not. 90% of it is probably hosted on servers that aren't even in Ukraine.
