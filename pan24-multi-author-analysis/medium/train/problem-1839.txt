Ukraine has been able to successfully utilize the GMLRS (HIMARS) missiles because they have hundreds of cheap unguided long-range artillery rockets that can saturate Russian Air Defense while the GMLRS missiles punch through.
But the Ukrainian long-range artillery rockets can't reach target areas that are this far away. Instead the West should buy up the cheap Scud/Tochka missiles in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and give to Ukraine. These cheap, old but long-range missiles will be used to saturate Russian air defense so the more precise GLSDB (and one day hopefully the ATACMS) can punch through.
I think it’s mainly because Ukraine isn’t really attacking much inside Russian airspace, they’re trying to take back what Russia has stolen. That was one of the main issues as to why the US and others were concerned with supplying long range artillery which would undoubtedly escalate the war. But at this time I think it’s safe to say Russia is fair game after they’ve continuously hit civilian infrastructure.
Yes, I believe both sides have good air defense systems. This combined with them not having a big air force means air support has been limited in this war.
