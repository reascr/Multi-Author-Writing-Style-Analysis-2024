For those questioning why the sale to Switzerland has been allowed to go ahead despite Switzerland repeatedly banning the re-export of ammo and weapons to Ukraine.
There is literally nothing the West or the US can do to compel Switzerland to fall in line with NATO strategic objectives or goals.
Switzerland is also a major arms customer for German, Swedish, British, French and American vehicles and weapons. Switzerland has interoperability with NATO on the equipment side of things.
Currently the same ships are all around EU coasts waiting... EU storages is full and winter didn't come yet ..
A lot of EU companies are relocating production to US and Asia, as Energie ist 8x the price compared to US.
It is quite simple 2 months ago it was more or less an open secret by an investment of 100 Mio gas in US including ship and insurance u could resell 20 days later to EU at 300 Mio.
Or maybe the us could stop exploiting this war while getting dirt cheap and with good profit an old enemy destroyed at the cost of a lot of Ukrainian lives and the future of European economies.
So again ask your government to start shale oil exploration locally. And if Australia can supply it a lot cheaper then go with that. Or force Shell and BP to sell it to EU countries at cost if that is possible.
