I'd rather they reported the scale of non communist discontent, gave an equal number of words to both sides of the story, provided external links to sources other than their own website, wrote a standfirst ( the top bit, that many people read in isolation - the most read bit) that demonstrated there are other opinions, and highlighted that a democratic government is banning information.
Much journalim that unquestioningly reports "influence if foreign agents" is in thrall to something/someone.
So your complaint is that this event is the subject of the article instead of other ones you’d rather hear about? Or that a headline with twenty or so words in it doesn’t describe several sides of an issue? Seems like a pretty weak reason to be alleging “McCarthyism at its finest.”.
My complaint is that this is shit journalism because it lacks balance and its sources are itself. Not even reddit thinks that is cool.
The headline is what you quoted. And you could make this complaint against basically any short article. It comes off as a really petty thing to be up in arms about.
No, Reddit doesn’t give a shit about unbiased journalism. I’ve seen the kind of rags this sub promotes. Half the time they’re complaining that it isn’t biased enough in their favor.
I’m guessing what then mean is the local communist party holds some local or regional political power.
Kinda like if an American outlet ran a headline like “Socialist-Ruled Seattle fails to stop local student organization from holding public reading of Das Kapital”.
When a government suppresses stories that it fears will do it harm, they limit the electorate's opportunity to decide for itself. That is anti democratic. It is an early step in the development authoritarian government.
