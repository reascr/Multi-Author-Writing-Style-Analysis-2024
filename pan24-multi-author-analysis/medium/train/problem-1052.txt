Eighter that, or he's pretty much dead. Taking down (and what's more important - humiliating) a dark-net marketplace can piss a lot of people.

I am pretty surprised he was willing to share a town he lives in, especially since he is a foreigner, which makes him even easier to find - I don't suppose there's that many Ukranian cybersecurity experts in Wisconsin, who left UA in the 80s. Hell, I don't even think there's that many foreign Ukranian cybersecurity experts worldwide (I'm not implying that Ukranians shouldn't be good at cybersecurity, but that there's rather not that many good hackers worldwide). I'm pretty sure that it's probably a 27 y.o. woman living in Europe, or something like that. At least that what I'd do, if I ever released info like this - be vaguely specific about who I am while trying to appear carefull about my fake identity, so it's plausible.
On top of this, getting to Wisconsin, getting weapons, and getting out safely is likely to be a challenge.
