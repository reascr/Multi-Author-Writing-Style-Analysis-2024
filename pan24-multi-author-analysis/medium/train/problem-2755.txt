I get the hate but y’all need to brush up on history , Pakistan has been a US ally since it’s creation and both US and Pakistan were instrumental in building the mujahideen to fight the soviets , once the Cold War was over , the US went home and Pakistan was left to take care of the mujahideen which by then had grown really unstable and splintered into different groups , one of those became the taliban and certain factions that Pakistan army still had control over , had other geopolitical problems and then you see US returning back to Afghanistan and more extremism happening and once the war on terror is over , the US throws Pakistan to the side and starts cozying up india and Iran so Pakistan also makes more links with china to prioritize their national security interests and it’s a really complex topic . But tldr the Pakistani army has for decades been very pro US and a US major non nato ally , just that they grew abit distant with the war on terror . And for the ones who have been saying bin laden was found in Pakistan , US has done nothing to Saudi regime when there has been evidence that the house of Al saud directly funded 9/11 and bin laden was Saudi not Pakistani , and all the hate towards bin laden goes to Pakistan for some reason.
Pakistan, the country that let bin-Laden live in a walled compound in a wealthy suburban neighborhood?
Fair point. Problem is this is all just media play without any actual possibility to enforce anything new in Pakistan. It's a country of 250million and as large as nearly half of the USAs east coast. Much of the areas have poor infrastructure, zero surveillance capability, and rampant corruption. The ISI also doesn't cater to foreigners much unless really pressed. Not to mention they could be standing on the elephant in the room and not see it.
