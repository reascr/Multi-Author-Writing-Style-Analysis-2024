It was a completely asinine video and I pointed out the problems with the video, that nobody is genuinely talking about gun control to that extent. That we want to prevent this sort of thing from happening. She then brought up the Boston Marathon attack and basically said "well should we ban pressure cookers because that was a weapon!" I don't remember what I replied but a family member of this former classmate basically said to the classmate "you know, maybe you should be more selective about who your friends here are" (implication being "don't be friends with teh libz").
I remember after some other mass shooting a longish time ago (maybe around 2013, I think it was after the Boston Marathon terrorist attack; this will come up a bit later here) a conservative former classmate of mine (we went to the same high school but this was after we graduated) posted a video on FB titled something like "teenager DESTROYS lawmaker's arguments for gun control." I watched the video. And the argument was basically "if we have gun control it will make it harder for me to go hunting with my dad.".
It's not a cult, guns are used to project political power. So of course the right wants their militia to have lots of guns. We should try to match their firepower if we don't want to be powerless to stop them from taking over our neighborhoods.
