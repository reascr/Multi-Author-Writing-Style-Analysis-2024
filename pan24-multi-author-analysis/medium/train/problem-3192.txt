China has about as many people as India. When BA.2 ripped through India, we saw three new VOCs emerge.
It's a pretty good guess that we'll see three new VOCs (give or take) come out of China, from this infection wave. It would behoove us to avoid importing those VOCs.
Really, though, proof of negative test should be a prerequisite for travelling, regardless of whether it's from China or not.
China has been locked down for a long time, with only short spurts of somewhat being open, due to their "zero covid" strategy. So this wasn't needed for chinese citizens going to other countries because no one has been traveling to or from China much if at all, they were banned from leaving china. Now the flood gates are open.
Chinese residents were not allowed to fly outbound. So my point stands. Restrictions on Chinese citizens to covid test in other countries was not needed because Chinese citizens were banned from flying out of China. Again My point stands.
There have been continual flights between Canada and China. Not nearly as many as pre-covid, and not as many cities, but there has never been zero in any week.
