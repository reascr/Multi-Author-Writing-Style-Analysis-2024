I think it’s gonna be tough bc the Republican governor and legislature shortened early voting days very drastically after Ossoff and Warnock won last time. This has made lines so long. It’s really hard for a lot of ppl to wait in line for hours when they have little free time anyway, or if they have health problems, or small children.
I don't think it's going to be as tough given that Kemp won by a wide margin, but there was obviously a lot of split-ticket voting since Herschel lagged behind immensely. On the other hand, Warnock out-performed Abrams. There's going to be a chunk of voters who just aren't going to show up for Herschel again.
That said, it doesn't matter if an election is going to be tough or not. If you're a GA resident, vote!
It's fairly hard to accept when you look in total at Walker's issues - there are just so many. I admit I vote party line, and could never vote for a Republican, but I'd never vote for a Dem if they were like Walker. I'd probably just leave that race blank.
