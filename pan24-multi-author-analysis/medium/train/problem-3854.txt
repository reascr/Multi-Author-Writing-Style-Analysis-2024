I was shocked at the expanse of sea grasses. The importance of capturing carbon alone should be enough for them to be protected. Hopefully that can occur before the great vampire squids of the human race exploit it to its death.
Can you explain what you think was the context of that phrase in Austin Powers? Because everyone else on the internet is on a different page than you.
Trying to claim world domination and only asking for a million dollars in todays society is laughable unlike 20-25 years ago. Doesn’t sound evil enough? Hence why it just doesn’t quite hit the same.
Rewatch that scene, after he asks for a million he gets laughed at by everyone because it also wasn't much money back then. Your reaction to the phrase (it's not much money) is literally how the world leaders felt in the movie, and he DID up his asking price. That's why someone replied whoosh to your original comment - that was the whole joke in the movie.
Imagine a weapon that in half a second can permanently blind over a thousand people by just firing randomly into a general direction of a crowd. Completely silent and no warning whatsoever.
