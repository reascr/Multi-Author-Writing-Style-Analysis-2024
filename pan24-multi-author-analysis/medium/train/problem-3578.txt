I don’t think Americans understand just how close we go back to a live war on an almost quarterly basis. I left the Air Force not that long ago, I was on the ‘18 QRF when Kim was threatening to invade the south and use nuclear weapons. The North would often put a million troops within 3 miles of the DMZ which obviously scared the crap out of South Korea and would force the US to drum up an response force. Those chemical weapons they have are no joke. And the fact a ICBM overflew Japan is terrifying. Kim says he will strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. We should listen to dictators when they say they will do something, history tells us they actually measure up on those promises (see Putin’s remarks on invading Ukraine a year ago).
Putin picked on a smaller state in a (utterly failed) bid for empire building. Kim attacking the US would be signing his own death sentence. He will just rattle the sabre and continue to hope for sanction relief / domestic propaganda wins.
You presume he acts with complete rationality. But how often has Kim been rational? He’s had people put to death by mauling, he’s building nuclear capable ICBM’s, he has families imprisoned for generations. Does not sound like a rational clear thinking person. Kim has openly said he wants a war, I’d listen to what he wants ( and then be ready to push back).
If building nuclear capable ICBMs is irrational, then the US, Russia, UK, India, China, France are all just as irrational - since they also have nuclear capable ICBMs.
