It is literally only one month. Bureaucracy and red tape get in the way of everything. The only way things can change that fast is if everyone else in power is willing to put in the time and effort to make his policies come true as fast as possible. Well, since Bolsonaro still has fans everywhere, guess what: you can't accomplish things in just one month.
Easy to point fingers at Brazil but it's a crucial part of their economy and our global supply chain. Europe lost about 93% of the great European forest to mostly agricultural developments, and despite no attempts to reverse this, we take the moral high ground when in comes to Brazil.
There is no simple solution to it and just stopping it isn't neither feasible, nor something the West is in any position to demand. After all, we could first start with the reforestation of our own land. But this will of course never happen on the scale we expect from Brazil because it would bankrupt Europe and, with the globally growing population, lead to famines.
