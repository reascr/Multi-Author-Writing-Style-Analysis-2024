Honestly like 10 years ago when I was technically anti trans, even then I then didn't question the bathroom thing. I just didn't understand the whole trans thing but y'know, I gained some trans friends over the years and got my questions answered pretty nicely. I feel bad for having doubts in the first place but at least I learned from it. it really is no ones business whatsoever and the GOP really is a bunch of bullshit. I'm sorry to everyone because I voted republican in 2016 and that I got suckered into their shit. I'm so fucking sorry god damn I can never let down that regret. I've had a few drinks and I'm going through shit right now so like sorry guys once again. dark brandon will rise above all.
It's just odd. Show of hands. How many of us constantly need to know about underage girls and their periods. Or obsess about the how, what, when, where and why for people going to the bathroom and their particular apparatuses? Or now with the inordinate fascination these men have with this other man's member.
Please show yourself some grace. It's okay to not be an activist about things we know little about. It can often be okay to not have an opinion about everything. What's not ok is what many politicians, from grassroots to federal, is actively acting in such a way that continually marginalizes and dehumanizes others. Learning from our mistakes in a way that will positively affect others is important for our growth and progress.
