It's the only move they really have here. They don't have a land route to Transnistria/Moldova without going through Ukraine (and boy are they trying), and the black sea fleet has been devastated by Ukrainian missile attacks with no way to reinforce it (Turkey closed the straits to them) so they'd struggle to escort/support an amphibious assault (the sinking of the Moskva essentially ended any realistic threat of a Russian amphibious landing in Odessa for example). Doing an invasion at all in this kind of position is a terrible idea, but then again so was invading Ukraine and that didn't stop them.
However i do have confidence in the moldovan people in resisting. So it'll be an even more embarassing time for them. The poorest nation in europe, with barely any standing armed force managing to resist a russian invasion which is entirely a possibility as there are still trained security professionals despite the lacklusterstate of the moldovan military. And i am all for humiliating the kremlin more.
