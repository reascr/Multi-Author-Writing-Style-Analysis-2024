Also, recently with the return of Blink-182’s original band it got a lot of attention a couple weeks ago. I heard some tickets were 600+. Not sure what the lowest prices were, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was 100+ for cheap tickets.
I had the pleasure of taking my little sister to see her. I wish she preform more songs from her early albums but she’s fun to see live even if you don’t know her music all to well.
For comparison in 2002 at the Pop Disaster Tour, I saw Blink-182, Green Day, and Jimmy Eat World for $38.50 with Ticketmaster “convenience” fees of $7.50.
Not just screwing people for tickets, live nation also owns a large percentage of venues too, so musicians are essentially shut out of the whole live music industry if they don’t want to do business with live nation. I’ve read about bands trying to book shows at venues and then live nation basically buys the venue out from under them. Horrible. A total monopoly.
Ticketmaster also often buys and resells tickets for their own shows. When tickets sell out they direct you to other websites where Ticketmaster resells tickets under another name.
