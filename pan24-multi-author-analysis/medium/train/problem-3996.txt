Being a lawyer is one of those professions where you're required to be impartial to your clients. The whole everyone deserves a fair trial notion and not letting your personal prejudices get in the way of doing your job, which is to provide your client quality legal representation and advice.
What's really moronic is that it turns out the parents have allowed vaccinated blood transfusion for a previous medical issue.
So when nobody is willing to defend your antivax view except a prominent antivaxxer, that really should be ringing alarm bells.
I got in a spat about vaccinating my grandmother with my mother. When it escalated to the point of getting lawyers involved, she couldn't find anyone to represent her -- I know because I used to pay for her cell phone, and saw that she called a dozen law offices to no effect.
Can a lawyer be legally compelled to take a case though? Can't they just say that they can't take a case if they find the clients actions indefensible.
Because when you donate blood for a transfusion the blood needs to be screened for diseases and other things, which is a standard process. This takes time that the kid doesn't have.
