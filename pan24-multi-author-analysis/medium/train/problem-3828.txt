Despite the brain drain, they are a fairly advanced civilization. If North Korea can occasionally hack stuff with their 386 processors via 1300 baud modem, bet your ass the husk of what was once Russia will still be able to hack stuff with their 486 processors via 2600 baud modem.
Half the reason they are in the position their in right now is because of them trying to hack US servers and interfeiring with elections. I'm sure the reason we are supporting Ukraine at the level we are is to teach them a lesson. Sort of a fuck around and find out type of situation. US has been looking for a way to retaliate effectively and Russia put right out there for us. Hopefully they get the memo and quit their hacking schnanigans.
They've also ramped up disinformation. 2022 was the worst year in modern Swedish history in terms of misinformation being circulated that originated from russia and the ilk.
It fucking blows my mind that no country is immune to that bannon/trump/facebook/idiot style of shitty .jpg's and "every fallacy in the book"-'arguments'.
