Both are going to try to peal off a smaller and smaller set while the ideology makes a purity test and throws out others. When appealing toward the extremists, how do the other parts of the party respond? Trump is already bullying his former Jewish allies for not sticking with him when he met with holocaust deniers, who gets that group now?
Just another instance in my opinion that demonstrates how unfit this man is when it comes to holding office. He has no qualms playing whatever political stunt he can to gain favor, notoriety, and power. His base just eats this sorry ass crap up. The ones that are especially troubling are those when it comes to things like Covid and vaccines which actually can affect whether people live or die. Transporting Immigrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard aren't necessarily life and death but certainly do make things much more difficult for those involved. Then you have those which no politician in a Republic should be allowed to do which revolve around him taking retribution out on Disney for criticizing his LGBTQ policies.
