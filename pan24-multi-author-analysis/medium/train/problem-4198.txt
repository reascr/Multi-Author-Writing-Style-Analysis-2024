Shouldn’t have filed for re-election if he was so sick, now he gives the GOP six months of wiggle room because that’s how long the primary and election will take to fill the seat.
It's easy to say that he shouldn't have run in hindsight, but I don't think he or anyone else could've guessed that his health would take such a rapid turn.

To be fair, . Sure, he was battling cancer and had lost a lot of weight, but he hardly looked like he was dying.
Cancer can take a turn for the worst really fast. My grandfather had prostate cancer and for years he was totally fine, he even ran marathons. And in the space of a couple months it took a huge downturn and he was bedridden. Out of the blue.
You can live with cancer for many many years before anything happens, and it can happen very quickly. My grandfather lived with prostate cancer for 30 years totally fine before all of a sudden things took a downturn. Like one week he was walking around normally doing normal things, the next week he was in a hospital bed for 4 months before he died. He had actually run a marathon not long before that. It was totally out of the blue.
