So there's actually a good reason for that , even tho it's spent less than 1 out of the last 30 years at sea; and with probably little surprise, it has to do with russian logistics.
If you've ever been in a western port (or just about anywhere but russia really) you'll notice they offer shore services (power, clean water etc). In their infinite wisdom, russia decided that they don't need to do that, the ships can do things for themselves. So when a russian ship sits in port, it's boilers are always running, wasting bunker oil, trying to desalinize it's own water - all that stuff.
As a result, even tho the thing has only been on like 2 tours, the mechanical is just as shot as if it had been patrolling for the last 30 years. Now add in how russia doesn't really do maintenance. It's a great recipe to make all your ships worthless floating garbage scows that can't leave port even if they want to. And that doesn't address the combat part of combat readiness.
On top of that, US carrier doctrine states a carrier operates only within a carrier strike group. A CSG is roughly ten ships, including everything from destroyers to submarines to fleet oilers. A CSG is logistics at work.
Also doesn’t the UK have two full size carriers now? I remember the queen Elizabeth II (?) recently got commissioned didn’t they have two though?
Russia, and the Kuznetzov….uh….can’t do that. It’s literally the biggest target in the ocean anytime it leaves a Russian pier.
