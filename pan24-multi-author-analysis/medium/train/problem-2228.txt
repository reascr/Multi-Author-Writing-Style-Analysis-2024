But it is revenge. Republicans have spent a lot of time and money telling a story how Democrats are The Enemy. In their minds you can’t let an assumed attack just go without a counter attack. Because The Enemy and all that jazz. I mean, what would Fox News Propaganda say, which is really 90% the reason Republicans keep getting voted in. Republicans are in burn it all down mode and are at the extreme end of desperation. Republican voters are fueled by ongoing outrage entertainment. If government is working, if people’s lives are getting better, that’s a problem for Republican politicians. Doubly so if Democrats get actual credit for it.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
