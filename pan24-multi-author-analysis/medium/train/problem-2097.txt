Really? Because the Tories and Republicans told me teenagers just going through a phase are getting their breasts and penises’ removed and 10 year olds are being given hormone treatment because of their crazy liberal parents…… /s.
ITT: People who didn't read the article, and so believe that teens will be allowed to undergo sex reassignment surgery.
People don’t understand that they are not simply letting kids and teenagers legally change their gender or letting doctors give them gender hormone treatment. Most of the time it has to be diagnosed when they are young (like 8-10 years old) and then they observe them for close to a decade before they decide to actually move forward.
Being transgender is not some simple, quick process like the haters want you to believe. You spend significantly more time diagnosing than treating it because obviously they (doctors and patients) don’t want to get it wrong.
All this BS about kids wanting to change gender then getting surgery and a name change a week later is just propaganda. It literally takes years to a decade for any meaningful progress to be made on an individual’s transition.
