The oil and gas lobby are now fully behind nuclear as it will take decades to kickstart the industry after Fukushima with everyone realising what a liability the nuke industry had become. Money that could go to renewables is being spent on nuclear projects that wont be producing electricity for a decade or so. Small reactors, the hope of the nuke brigade will soon be seen as the folly that it is, reactors were made big to use economy of scale, small reactors will cost just as much to run as big reactors if not more.
Most ppl will get way more radiation from an airplane flight than swimming on that coastline. Radiation scares are often paid for by oil and gas companies because it's a direct threat to their industry.
During my years in service I had a team of radiometrics under my command and we were required to wear personal dosemeters to check how much radiation were were exposed to during a given period.
I took mine to the plane (accidentally) and it turned out that a radiation dose during a long haul flight was greater than a dose received during several panthomographic dental xrays...
