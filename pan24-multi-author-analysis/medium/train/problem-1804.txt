I think most countries that take part in Olympics have National Olympic Committees. I don't know if they can vote on the issue but surely their opinion would matter if majority of National Olympic Committees were against Russians and Belarusians participating.
I may be wrong but the only way is to boycott the Olympics. It has been done before. Let the Russians compete with North Korea, Venezuela and Belorussia. And yes, I admit it’s awfully unfair for the athletes.
While I agree, I don't think this is the best justification. The better one is: As long as russia is killing Ukrainian athletes, russian athletes should not be allowed to compete.
Olympics is just as dirty as FIFA anyway. They want money and will justify themselves into pretzels before giving away chances at foreign cash, no matter how worthless it is. If it’s a petro-state or a military-industrial state, the IOC wants to rub shoulders.
That’s why you hear about doping “consequences” for russians usually 2-3 years AFTER the last set of events (gaps for summer - summer olympics and winter-winter olympics.) so there’s just enough time for the public to get outraged and then not care when their flag comes through the promenade in the stadium.
