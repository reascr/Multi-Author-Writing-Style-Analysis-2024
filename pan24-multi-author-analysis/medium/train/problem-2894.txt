Good point. I think he was trying to send the message that the Kerch Straight Bridge is still useable and they can still get supplies into Crimea, blah blah blah.
Wonder what would happen if he did an unannounced drive over on the same day it got attacked again, and got blew up, but if it was purely coincidence.
The only issue with that take, is that places like Russia would require the next person to take Putins spot, to use a show of power and strenh to really cement their place.
Whoever takes over after Putin, isn't going to suddenly pull out of Ukraine. They very much could just bomb it harder.
If Russia wants a prosperous future the Navalny guy in prison is probably their best bet. I’m sure he has a few bad skeletons in the closet but at the very least he seems about as ‘friendly’/kinda progressive as Gorbachev once was. Then again this is Russia and.. they don’t take the obvious choice for prosperity (or rather, the choice is never offered and is taken through violence. I pity the next round of Moscow apartments to be blown up to consolidate someone else’s political power).
