I'm getting that from a few news articles, and it's also backed up by North Carolina residents on other threads.
It's likely they didn't literally pray with her. The police said they went and had a "word of prayer" with her, which is apparently similar to having a "come to Jesus moment" in the local vernacular. Basically, they were just saying they went to have a serious conversation with her about her comments on social media.

This is not a phrase used in NC. I've lived here my whole life in rural NC this is not a thing when he said had a word of prayer they prayed with her. This man is a buffoon and any kinda explanation as this being a cute country phrase is lying. Like 10 seconds after in the video he's asked how he knows she's isn't involved he stutters then says good police work and you hear an audible scoff. The investigation before outside agencies got involved was a joke. The only good thing with this situation is that the fbi got involved and maybe they will actually do something.
