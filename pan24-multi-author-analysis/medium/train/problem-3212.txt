Weighing in....my entire family spent the past 2 days trying to get TS tix. We had 2 pre-sale opportunities, but neither was successful. My 1 daughter managed 2 score 2 crappy nosebleed seats. We still need 4 more tix. 4 people each day trying to access the ticket master site managed to get only 2 tickets total. The rest of us spent hours with crashing websites, codes that did not work, and tickets that literally every time we went to buy them except once said "someone beat you to those tickets" . If someone beats me to every ticket I'm offered did you really offer me any tickets?
