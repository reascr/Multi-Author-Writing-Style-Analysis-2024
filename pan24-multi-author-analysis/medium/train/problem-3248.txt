The "Foundation for Economic Education" is a well-known corperate think tank/propaganda outlet so I dont encourage anyone to take anything they say seriously.

Also, we should probably separate trade schools from academic institutions and make them more of a "standard" option. In a perfect would a person could get job training at a technical institution and get an academic degree from an academic institution if they so choose. Or be fine making a living without that if they dont have the interest.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I dont think a person with no interest should be forced to take, and pay, for classes in art and philosophy just to get a job in physical therapy. I know having a basic level of liberal arts education seems like a good idea, but I've lived long enough to realize forcing people to do, and pay, for things they don't want to do never works out. They won't actually learn anything. I do, however, think a physical therapist should absolutely be able to take classes in art and philosophy if they want to and they shouldn't have to take out a loan to do so.
