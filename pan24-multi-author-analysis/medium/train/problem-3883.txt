This gets into the whole argument Republicans make about things like the Senate, and the Electoral College. Things that inherently skew things away from one person one vote.
They argue that it's necessary to prevent urban needs from drowning out rural needs. Some tyranny of the majority bullshit. The thing with that is - some of the most important rural needs that we need to ensure don't get drown out is farming. We all need food. We rely on farmers.

So many of these states with disproportionately greater voting power for their population are sustained on farming and they turn around and use that power to elect politicians who use illegal immigration as one of their main dog whistle issues.
