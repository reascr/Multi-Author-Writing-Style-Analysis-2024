This is a FAKE NEWS article, because in reality Allen Weisselberg has consistently testified that Trump was not knowingly engaged in any type of fraud. Allen is taking a bullet for Trump, just totally covering for him.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
But if you just read this worthless piece of sh\t headline, you'd think that Allen was throwing Trump under the bus.
>Weisselberg said Donald Trump, or at times Eric Trump or Donald Trump Jr., signed checks to pay up to $100,000 for private school tuition for Weisselberg's grandchildren. Weisselberg said he then instructed the company's controller to deduct the $100,000 from his salary, allowing him to report a smaller income. Copies of some of the checks signed by the Trumps have been shown in court.
It doesn’t it just makes it more difficult because it could be seen as a political arrest since the DA is a democrat. It just makes it even more sensitive.
I agree. It is important. We live in a democracy and no one should be above the law. There should be a tight seal around the investigation into a former president but shouldn’t prevent the law from prevailing.
