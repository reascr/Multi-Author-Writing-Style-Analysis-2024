It´s interesting because while growing up, every single time I have been bothered in the street, threatened for a cigaret, threatened for the keys of my scooter, threatened because I allegedly stared at them, it was always young dudes from North Africa. Never an Asian, never a European or a South American or a Hindi. I don’t say that everybody should be put in the same bag, I just say that it’s quite a coincidence that it’s always the same who create problems for no reasons.
Problem building their identity just like in most of the Europeans countries. Born and raised in Europe, 4th to 5th generation but still not considering themselves european so hating the countries and culture they live in. Same in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Germany. But don’t dare talking about it, it’s a forbidden topic.
That ! Never heard of any problem by Asian people. They come, do their things, work, don’t complain about how they were colonized 100 years ago and suffer from systemic racism. They just move on and study their ass off to get a better life.
You’re totally right. It’s a clash of cultures and for these kids they’re stuck in no man’s land. Having to jostle between their cultural identity and the culture of their home country.
