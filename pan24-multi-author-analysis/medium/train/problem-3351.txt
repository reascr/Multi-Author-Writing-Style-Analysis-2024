Don’t panic … it is very unlikely that you’ll contract those protovirus. Those virus was very big in size and humanity was exposed to it for a verrryyyy long period. In our genome we also find adaptations dating back to those viruses. Mostly animal related too. We are mostly shielded against them since the first ages so stop panicking. Paranoia is the nitrofuel of conspiracy !
The permafrost is melting, so it’s a good idea to research these viruses as they’ll probably find their way into the population soon enough. Better to know what we’re in for than to just wing it.
Honestly I’ve gone through quite a few virus books in the last couple of years (I wonder why) and I’m sure it coming out of the ice has been in a couple. But World War Z is a good example. Think was implied to be at the bottom of a lake actually but close enough!
A vaccine would probably be better. Besides, it might be one of those viruses that make people leak blood from their eyes instead of other things from other places.
