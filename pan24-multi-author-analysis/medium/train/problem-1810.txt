And the Minsk protocols called for withdrawal of all foreign armed forces but Russia denied having any military presence at all. Russia had no intention of following the Minsk Agreement. It was just the pretext for another invasion.
Denying the Russians' participation eight years ago at Danbas is like denying the participation of NATO troops on the Ukrainian side now.
The Western side, on the other hand, obviously concluded this peace agreement with completely different goals.
You cannot compare NATO involvement in the 2022 war to Russian involvement in the 2014 war. Russian troops were directly fighting in the Donbas. There aren't NATO troops are fighting Russian troops in Ukraine. If that were happening Putin would be holding press conferences every day because any direct conflict could escalate to nuclear war.
The Minsk Agreements were to useful propagandists to justify the 2022 invasion like you are doing now.
Why does the West need a justification to send arms to Ukraine when they have already been doing it openly after the 2014 invasion?
