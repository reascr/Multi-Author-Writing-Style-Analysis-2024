Exactly... They are conducting MASS KIDNAPPING on a scale we haven't seen since the holocaust. It's so sad and fkng pathetic that ppl can do such shit in today's time. Look i know it's war and shitty stuff happens, and there is no way around it. But the fact that you pretty much kidnap almost a whole part of a city is outright enough reason to be fkd up as a leader of a country. He fkng deserves to be sniped out by one of those predator drones just alone for the kidnapping.
That's why they threatened the use of nukes and when Biden didn't flinch, they have been quietly toned that down and stopped.
What was shown with the polish incident is that the West is more willing to fight Russia more than ever. So Medvedev does the other Russian foreign policy move of trying to frame the West as warmongers while Russia is invading its own neighbor.
Man, this just sums it up so perfectly in a nutshell I really just cannot believe how fucking stupid the russians actually are. Hahah they are talking about us wanting to start a world war when they invade their unprovoked neighbors and literally terrorize the ever fucking shit out of the Ukrainian population by bombing and shelling the shit out of them. They are terrible at playing the blame game.
