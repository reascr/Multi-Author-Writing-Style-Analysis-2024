I think it's more that China wants the world to accept this accept an action that should spark a WW3. They want Taiwan, they want to control chip manufacturing, and they want to shape the narrative where the US is the bad guy for trying to prevent that.
Russia is their next Africa project: sweep up assets for cheap after the war is over, and stuff the country with Chinese workers and infrastructure.
I read that the initial capital outlay for these projects was fairly successful but that they’re struggling with maintenance costs and the projects were built fast but not built to last. I don’t recall where I read it though.
Would happen to have a source for that? I'm not trying to be antagonistic, just curious. I've been in some of the countries China has invested heavily in (e.g. Djibouti) and they had a significant presence there. What I've read online as well has shown me that they are making steady economic ties to many African countries with their Belt and Road initiative.
That doesn't really matter because the real built to last structures will come in when the payments lapse and the land gets turned over to the Chinese. Which will probably still end up being a kind of net good to the locals, but with a price...
