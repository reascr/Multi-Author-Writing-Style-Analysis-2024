Itâ€™s so discouraging to see those who seemingly found their voice on justice for immigrants during the Trump administration stay silent while Biden enacts the same cruel policies.
Immigration activists (the same ones who criticized Trump's policies) are calling this move harmful and inhumane. What makes you think that they are wrong or lying?
I mean, this article lists some of the people upset with this. It includes the head of an immigration activist group, a current representative, and a former Obama official. That seems like the same group of people who were upset about Trump's policies and isn't that far to the left. Again, what makes you think these people are wrong or lying?
