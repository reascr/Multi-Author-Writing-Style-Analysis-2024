And if anyone finds it odd that a tribe in the middle of the Amazon is unable to live off the land and needs help from the government, their territory is under siege by land squatters and gold miners, many whom will attack or kill them just for the fact that they are indians, because their objective is to wipe them all out of existence to have all the land for themselves.
Bolsonaro himself during the 2018 election vowed to get rid of land demarcations and offer no aid whatsoever, which only intensified an already existing problem, so he has direct responsibility in this genocide. The only people he actually sent to the region were a bunch of biblethump missionaries that only made the lives of these tribes even more insufferable.
I am so thankful Lula was elected President & that he is looking out for the Yanomami people that Bolsonaro treated so cruelly:
>Lula, who became president on 1 January, blamed his far-right predecessor for forsaking Indigenous communities and emboldening the thousands of wildcat miners who flooded the Portugal-sized Yanomami enclave during Bolsonaroâ€™s 2019-2022 government.
