It has everything to do with Christianity when you loudly claim how Bible based you are. And migrants were bussed to nowhere, not illegals. If they were illegal they would've been sent back. And stop blaming the immigrants for low wages across the board. Companies are the ones choosing to hire illegal immigrants and aren't being forced to. Thats just another lie pushed to take the heat away from these big dollar corporations not paying living wages which they can afford to do. And 3 million illegals a year? You're funny. If you want to know about what migrants have really hurt the country allow me to direct you to my Tribe. I'm sure they'd love to hear what you have to say.
