"Officials have done a public health risk assessment, including working through scenarios of potential case numbers among travellers from China. This confirmed these visitors won't contribute significantly to our Covid case numbers meaning entry restrictions aren't required or justified,".
Iirc the west hasn’t been locking, welding, or zip tying, people in factories or apartment buildings to protect the reputations of officials responsible for fielding the “zero COVID” policy.
New Zealand shut its country down the time so this doesn’t align with their previous “lock the country up at all costs in order to have ZERO cases in the country” now it’s open season all of a sudden. Even if they already have rising rates, having those rates rise faster isn’t going to help.
Because it'd be kind of ridiculous when our covid rates here in New Zealand are also very high right now. Frankly, we're lucky that other countries aren't requiring us to provide a negative test before flying.
Well, that, and the fact that New Zealand’s population is… what, 5 million people? China is going to have significantly more people traveling internationally.
