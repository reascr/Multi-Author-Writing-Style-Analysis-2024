Of course he is. Russia has a long and colorful history of winning wars not thru Amazing Military Genius but thru counting on two things:
In the case of Ukraine, the Russian winter seems to be hurting Russia more than Ukraine this time around. But they still have the advantage of warm bodies for canon fodder.
In the PAST Russia had a lot of people to send into wars. That is true. However that was a pre-industrial Russia where 80%+ of the population was agrarian. They had way way way more young people than elderly.
That time bomb is global warming. If there is a silver lining here, it’s that Putin’s antics are motivating investment in green energy, away from Europe's dependence on Russia’s fossil fuels.
Russia of today is far more concentrated in the far west of the country (always really has been…) and less agrarian. Their move to urban living made the birth rate fall off to the point where older people vastly outnumber men of fighting age. They literally can not afford to do war the way it was done in the past.
Also, the Russian tactic of overwhelming opponents with sheer numbers was only ever about 50% effective. Which in terms of a modern military doctrine is so bad it should be unthinkable.
He is constantly trying a lame and pathetic version of a blitzkrieg which even if done right, it wouldn't work I modern days..he just doesn't understand, he is literally crazy with power another Mao pretty much.
I have thought about this a lot, that if NATO ends up joining, other Asian countries would join and and once Russia looses (which they would) we would see another "Berlin Wall" but China would keep a lot of territory while Asians and NATO that fought together would divide the rest.
