Anti-ballistic missile treaties have prevented nations from deploying (but not developing a'la Regan's $60bn Star Wars program) defense systems. However, that ended 20 years ago (thanks Dick Cheyn - I mean Dubya). This being said - there is only so much you can do to prevent a warhead traveling at mach 8 on it's way in, much less 50 missiles containing a dozen warheads each. This is a physics problem and there are no cheat codes or clever solutions. It's like trying to hit a bullet with another bullet, while blindfolded, riding a horse.
Yeah you're right I don't think they do - but more a figure of speech because they're such a big country. And also good point - because submarines too.
Exactly what i came here to say. I doubt Putin and Russia as we currently know it will be around by then. I don't see them building any new nukes. Hell they might not even have an army when this is over.
I have no idea of the condition of Russias nukes and how effective they are. But there are some guesstimates we can make.
