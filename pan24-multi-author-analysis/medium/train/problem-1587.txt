There's another article or video somewhere that showed the shape of the column and how he likely got in and it essentially started off wide so he lowered himself down into it not knowing it would get more narrow as it went down, trapping him.
Edit: looks like he's unfortunately been declared dead, R.I.P. little man. Hope you didn't suffer too long (.
>Authorities "are not sure about the current condition of the boy. He has stopped interacting with the outside though oxygen had always been pumped into the" hole, the Vietnamese Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
Mind you this is a 35m depth hole which equal 10 floors building. I just hope the kid did not suffer long. The diameter is only 25cm so not much breathable air, probably only enough for 15-30mins.
The kid only respond in the first 15mins, no sign of him after. They later drop camera in to check and only see mud and dirt. I think it's muddy inside and the wall are smooth so the kid probably suffocated then sinked into the mud.
Poor kid, can’t even imagine how horrifying that would be. I really hope he’s alive but would be shocked if he was….
