Anyone else tired of coming to the comment section about the war in Ukraine only to find a thousand shitty jokes and sarcastic comments adding nothing of value that don't discuss the article?
Yes-everything is Putin pooped his pants and let’s storm Moscow instead of holy shit we have a major geo-strategic disaster playing in front of our eyes right now. Seemingly overnight, the Cold War is back on, this time with China fully in it’s own corner and Russia with what appears to be a troubled and desperate former KGB agent heading up the world’s largest nuclear arsenal (yes, it works), a United States losing its grip on supremacy, and in the backdrop, as always, the never-ending pandemic and climate change, which seem to be….yesterday’s news. I come here for information and this is the first time I’ve said anything in a while, just to say that I sympathize with you and I’m sick of finding the Reddit comment sections filled with copy/pasted drivel on serious world issues.
For the record I don’t mind the Reddit generals, that counts to me as a discussion. And I’m all for jokes but come on, this makes me feel like a lot of people are completely disconnected from reality!
