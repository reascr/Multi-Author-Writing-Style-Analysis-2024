Partnership only work if it is beneficial to both countries. At the rate Russia is sinking both economically and militarily, Xi must be thinking is it worthwhile for China to maintain relationship with Russia or dump it to lessen damage and possibly earn brownie point with West.
I doubt that the west would be willing to give China any point no matter what it does. As soon as Russia is dealt with, the west will focus on China. I don't see China has much choice other than trying to keep Russia in play while minimizing its own cost.
This isn't an accurate quote of the poster above you. You can directly quote them by using a \> followed by the text from their post, and then you don't look like an idiot because you don't get it wrong.
You're probably right. I never trusted China in the first place with their way of coercing companies setting up China to hand over intellectual property which enabled it to jump start its own economically.
China really ruined their own chances by stealing everything they could from the west and producing shit knock offs instead of innovating on their own. The US is the sole reason why China is the powerhouse it is today and instead of working together, they stab the US in the back every chance they get. And that's not even touching on the fact that their current regime is perfectly fine disappearing citizens who speak out, slave labor, and literal concentration camps for people they don't like. Even right now they're drooling at the thought of invading Taiwan and stealing the machines used to produce semiconductors because they're incapable of producing them on their own.
China has dug themselves into this position and their only way out is to build their own shovel and apologize. But, they're unwilling to do either.
