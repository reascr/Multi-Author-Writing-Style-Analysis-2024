I’ve been saying this for ages. If you want to get more people (especially conservatives) on board with green energy, you need to make it a national security issue.
They might be unwilling to go green for CO2 levels. But there’s a persuasive argument that oil, gas and coal can be in short supply. But nobody can switch off the Sun or wind. Self-reliance appeals to conservatives, so this idea of making our own energy is sensible IMO.
Iirc the US army actually tried to get extra funding from Congress for research into green energy because they deemed that relying on countries like Saudi Arabia was not a reliable source of energy and a national security risk.
However, the steady diet of oil and gas corporate PR, swallowed and regurgitated by bought and paid for politicians stifled the the idea for years.
They need to make it a PUBLIC issue with conservatives. Remember, behind closed doors nearly all of the Republicans (and a healthy handful of democrats) are in bed with SA and other oil entities and will absolutely not invest in anything that will mess with that without major public backlash.
