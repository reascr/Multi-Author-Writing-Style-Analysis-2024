He's absolutely correct. Do you see military recruiters set up in Beverly Hills, CA? How about Greenwich? UES/UWS Manhattan? It's what we've done for the longest time. Reason a large population of our military comes from rural. They do not want intelligent soldiers, same reason law enforcement doesn't either. LAPD is a perfect case study. After Rampart fiasco, they went on a squeaky clean with college degree requirements. Wound up with a majority force that couldn't tell a drug deal from a Girl Scout cookie deal. Intelligent people questions direction and orders. That or they get bored and they wind up causing trouble.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
