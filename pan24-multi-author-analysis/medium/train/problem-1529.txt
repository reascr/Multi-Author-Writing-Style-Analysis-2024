The USA does military exercises in the South China Sea that are nowhere near Taiwan, and are simply a show of force. I assume the Chinese incursions into Taiwanese waters are what you are referring to.
Funny how when China does hostile and aggressive actions, western media presents it as bad, but when it is us doing the hostile and aggressive actions, they present as normal, and as if we haven't even done anything wrong.
If it is bad when China does military exercises close to other countries waters, then it is bad when we do it. That's called basic consistency.
lol, they hardly just all randomly bumped into eachother whilst practicing military tactics. pearl harbour was planned in advance. my cat biting my arm earlier was planned in advance.
Okay, so say it was accidental. What about all the times the USA has for certain intentionally violated other countries sovereignty? E.g. the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, or the illegal drone warfare program. Like I say, can you imagine the reaction if it was China doing these things?
