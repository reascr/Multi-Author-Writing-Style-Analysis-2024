>Verra’s former director of programmes is a carbon offsetting manager at Shell, while the oil major’s former head of nature-based solutions has just co-founded a new carbon credits rating agency that helps companies find supposedly high-quality credits with a Verra advisory group member.
In the US for every every barrel of fuel oul the oil refiner must buy a carbon credit to fund renewable fuels (like ethanol which is sketch af) but if it’s exported they don’t have to!
They have always been worthless, it's been a scam from the beginning to pretend to make efforts to curb climate change. When in reality it actually makes climate change worse.
Just like Tesla, a scam. Tesla’s fastest-growing business isn’t putting owners in its Model S and Model 3. It’s selling carbon credits to large automakers to avoid fines. As Tesla only sells electric cars, it receives these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other automakers who can't meet regulatory requirements. Tesla relies on large automakers to purchase credits from it. For example Stellantis bought about 2 billion euros ($2.43 billion) of European and U.S. credits from Tesla between 2019 and 2021. Eventually, however, Tesla won’t be able to rely on these credits as automakers begin producing their own EVs at scale.
