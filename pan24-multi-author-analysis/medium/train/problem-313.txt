Except your idea there is extremely unlikely due to how the EU itself works. One member "suffering catastrophic consequences" would have a knock-on effect on neighbors. That something could be overwhelmingly benificial for 90% yet "catastrophic" for 10% doesn't even make sense when you actually think about it in the context of the EU. On the contrary, it means 90% of countries could have popular and highly needed reforms blocked by just one member. The will of 446,5 million people could be blocked by Malta's 500K. And then you also keep in mind how no country's population is a monolith, and you'd likely see a split about any given issue even inside the Vetoing country.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Wednesday that the European Union could no longer afford to have decisions blocked by individual member states.
"Qualified majority voting can lead to fairer...results for all of us," Baerbock told a conference in Portugal's capital Lisbon. "We must be capable of acting efficiently and swiftly.".
