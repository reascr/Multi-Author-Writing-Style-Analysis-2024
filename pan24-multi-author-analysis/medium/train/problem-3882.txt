I've not seen it mentioned yet, but an important point to make is that this wasn't just the SNP passing this bill, it passed with a supermajority - support from each party, including 3 tories!
Yeah, the word "controversial" is a massive stretch in this instance. The vote was passed with a large majority, only thing controversial was known anti-trans MPs throwing a hissy fit over it.
I can't remember the country, but there is another country with a very similar system and they haven't had any problems with such things.
It's probably also important to note that scotland has been big on these kind of changes recently. Years ago gender neutral toilets were introduced to public places such as schools. Some private business such as clubs and bars have followed suit. Again, no major issues have been reported from these changes.
Also, this is going to be an unpopular thing to be heard but I'm going to say it. If someone's going to abuse/exploit woman, they are just going to do it regardless. If the UK government want to concern themselves with such an issue, maybe they should first address the underfunded police service that is no longer investigating such crimes due to lack of funding and man power.
