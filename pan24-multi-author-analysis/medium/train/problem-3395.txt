This war has been complete disaster for the Ukrainian and Russian people. Meanwhile the EU woke up, India raked in profits, and China set the dinner table for the feast of central asian power coming it's way.
That's a brilliant and interesting take. How about the US, what does it gain or lose from the current scenario? Really eager to see your comments, thx.
The true elite of America know it's days as sole superpower are numbered. They're trying to influence a sustainable international order to carry on afterwards.
I'm going to say this every time, I'm still don't trust any surveys on Putin's approval, regardless of whether they're state funded or indpendent. These people have lived in a society where for nearly a good century where if you tell the truth, you can die.
Somehow this doesn't fit in the rhythm of your first comment when I read it, lol. US comes out every major event stronger, more powerful, so no much worry needed. Thx for replying.
I have a hard time imagining ukraine repelling a quarter million troops. Even with a hundred lep's and 31 m1's. Its alot of people. Its likely they will break through somewhere. I hope kiev holds out.
What i dont get is why they wouldn't make a run for kiev itself. If kiev itself fell then the ukrainians organized resistance is for the most part kaput. From belarus to kiev seems like an easier approach than from crimea/donbass/Donetsk to kherson. Trading possession of the rubble filled eastern cities again doesn't guarantee the ukrainians wont take it back anyway. Like when america invaded iraq. Baghdad or bust take the capital and let your enemy deal with no leadership.
The russians invented the helicopter gunship, designated marksman rife, infantry fighting vehicle, they have 5th gen fighters and the largest tank force in the world. Nukes. They aren't like a joke dude. I think the initial invasion was more of a mistake in hubris and leadership.
