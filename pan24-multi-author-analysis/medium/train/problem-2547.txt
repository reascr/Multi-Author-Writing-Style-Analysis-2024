If a particular firearm is banned in Maryland, then what does it matter what neighboring states allow? The gun is banned in Maryland. The fact that it was brought in from West Virginia or Pennsylvania or Delaware doesn't change that. The person carrying that gun is in violation of the law as soon as they cross the border. If bans work, shouldn't those people somehow magically understand that they're breaking the law at that point, and just stop, or flag down the nearest cop and turn themselves in?
This idea that the gun manufacturer somehow marketed the gun to the goblin who murdered everyone at Sandy Hook overlooks some critical information.
So why are the families suing the manufacturer over the criminal actions of a third party (who didn't even buy the guns in the first place)? What other products do we allow that for? Do we allow families to sue AB InBev and Ford for the criminal misuse of their products by a drunk driver? Did anyone sue Home Depot and the truck manufacturer for their actions in the 2017 NYC truck attack? Did anyone sue ? ? ?
