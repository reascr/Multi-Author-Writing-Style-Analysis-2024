This is way oversimplifying more complex issues. The US can't just send the M1A2 Abrams because it has a far, far more complex logistical trail (I am not even an expert and this is obvious; the Abrams is a jet engines vehicle using jet fuel, whereas the leopard is known as a reliable vehicle that runs on basic diesel). The Germans suggesting that the US Send this type of tank strikes me as a deflection and a way to make their objection seem more reasonable (despite the fact that Germany under its latest prime minister has dragged its feet at literally every single request for cooperation from the rest of the west on this conflict-- at the beginning of the conflict they were refusing to share existing supplies of NLAWS and Javelins along with any lethal aid, only agreeing to send kits to build field hospitals and a shipment of helmets).
> Asked in an interview with French television LCI what would happen if Poland sent its Leopard 2 tanks without German approval, Baerbock replied through a translator: “For the moment the question has not been asked, but if we were asked we would not stand in the way.”.
