Normal people maybe, but crazy people? They like power, they like anxiety and than they come and enjoy the disaster they created....he is just an mass murderer in various ways.
Escalate to deescalate is the principle of Russian geopolitics, but the issue is that the threat of escalation doesn't work if your opponent doesn't believe that you actually gonna do it. So the only option for Putin is to try to make himself look like a lunatic in talks with Western leaders.
Why do you think India and China, who each have their own goals on the globe, remain neutral, maybe slightly pro-russian in a passive way, in this conflict despite the risk of the global devastation by a crazy neighbor? Because in talks with their leaders Putin shows level of sanity enough for them to remain neutral, which means no global devastation on the table.
In the same way, why do you think each time Putin gets into conflict with Turkiye he's forced to back off? Because Turkiye doesn't care for Putin's bullshit. They know that Putin is all talk.
