They tried to do things the overzealous way and that doesnt work too well due to systems in place, so you game the system. Remember, the GOP isnt the republican party, its the "Grand Old Party". backed by republicans to own the libs and dems. The GOP doesnt back the republicans either if you look at the more recent house issues with GOP members refusing to back republicans unless they get something they want. Its LITERALLY the republicans getting shot in the face because they are crybabies and backed the bad guys. Then the bad guys tried to rob them too and they were like " but we paid you?". "i" yes... "just ...".
