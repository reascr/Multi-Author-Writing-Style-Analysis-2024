Georgia: Republicans gerrymandered and the district court upheld the new map resulting in democrats losing at least one seat.
Court decisions like these are important because otherwise Democrats would have likely held the house.

It’s fascinating how blue maps are deemed unfair and red maps are approved. Yes, gerrymandering was the difference in Congressional control in the 2022 election.
Ohio: Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to avoid partisan gerrymandering but Republicans did it anyway which resulted in elections being held under the improper map. Result a Dem loss of 1 seat.
Another case of one party playing fair while the other fights dirty. The fair districting is the right thing to do, but it hurts the democrats if the Republican states don't adopt the same policies (which they never will by choice).
Utah: Utah voted to create a redistricting commission but the GOP legislature changed its role to “advisory only”. Result a Dem loss of 1 seat.
