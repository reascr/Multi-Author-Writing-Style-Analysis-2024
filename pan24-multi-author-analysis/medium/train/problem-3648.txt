So there’s this Russian dude, yeah, and he moves to Africa. He’s really into trolling on the internet, making up fake stories to outrage people and such. He decides to go online and pretend to be Belgian, so he can fuck with the Belgians. He decides the best way to do this is to pretend to support Joseph Stalin, good ol’ days of the Soviet Union or whatever. Then someone finds him out, next thing you know he’s outed as “Belgian stalinist revealed as Russian fake news tsar in Africa.”.
No, this guy Luc Michel really is a Belgian self-identified Stalinist in Belgium. It's the Russian fake news network that's in Africa. It should be noted that although Michel calls himself a Stalinist, he was the founder of a Neo-Nazi group and is currently the leader of a Belgian National Bolshevik party, which as an ideology is basically Nazism plus Stalinism. It's Stalinism but with Nazi-style antisemitic rhetoric.
The story is that it has been revealed that a Belgian Stalinist is the person behind a network of fake news websites spreading Russian propaganda to French-speaking West Africans. The websites are ostensibly based in Africa and independent from each other but their purpose is to drum up African support for Russia, namely support for the Wagner and so on.
It makes sense if you think of this branch of reality as an experimental laboratory for the main trunk of reality. We are answering all the "what if" questions the main trunk has regarding things like "what if we let CO2 emissions go out of control?" and "What if we enabled unfettered misinformation on the internet?".
