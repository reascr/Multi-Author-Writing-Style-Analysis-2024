This will be the first cup i will not watch due to all the bull dung and politics as well as the lack of history of soccer Qatar has. Combine that with all the human rights abuses and all the people that have died building the stadiums, it feels wrong in so many levels. I will not be part of that cycle.
This is the first world cup I won't have watched in my life. There's obviously been loads of questionable choices from fifa, but us fans need to show them that we've had enough. I definitely should have done this before, but it's never too late to tell fifa to fuck off.
Then maybe dont let countries like Qatar host the games? Both fifa and qatar have unrealistic expectations of how they want this to play out. As an American it's the only time I get excited to watch soccer is the world cup. But I cant support this.
If that’s the case FIFA should have banned the USA for human right abuses. Especially during the Iraq invasion. You can’t just pick and choose a country when it fits your narrative.
