It's a march held one day per year. The March has no relevance with anyone's current desire of "producing more children." Different kinds of people - men and women, old, young, and ages in between - participated to raise awareness for a polarizing issue.

Why are they wasting their time marching when they could be at home producing more children? I'm assuming they all had the maximum number of children their body was able to produce right?
