Extra easy to not spot them 'from inside' or if those cultures output lot of media / clothing fashion popular in region, or have some divides that only differ incertain kind of things between them, or they are spread widely in north-south kind of area (resulting in differet temperature zones, for seemingly different kind of clothing), or are large enough, or have grown on average to not think that much about religious aspect, or at least have larger regions where they are starting to mostly just culturally be that group, instead of religiously.
I never said there weren't religious people, just that the Nordic countries aren't typically religious countries, my country of Sweden is believed to be about 80% atheist.
The Kerala Yuktivadi Sangam motto seems to be "Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda Manushyanu (No Caste, No Religion, No God for Human-beings)" and their publication is called " The Secular Humanist ".
They only have about 3000 members but my question is, how can they be Muslim without believing in a god?
Well, nordic countries celebrate all the Christian holidays, marry in churches and get baptized but I don't know a single person here believing in God.
