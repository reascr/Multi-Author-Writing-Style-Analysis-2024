I feel like Swiss neutrality is kind of pro-Russia. It feels kind of like a crime of indifference; just think back to Nazi Germany and how we call out people who lived back then and didn't support the Nazis yet decided to do nothing. We mostly just blame them for going along with the Nazis due to their indifference.
Also, one of the main reasons why the Swiss haven't been invaded is because of their country's mountainous topography, not just neutrality. With high tech missiles, drones and jets those mountains don't matter as much as they use to. They still do matter but just no where near as much. It's not like the Swiss will be invaded in modern times though.
By not allowing arms that are going to Ukraine to pass through their country the Swiss are complying with the Kremlin's demands via indifference imo, even if they don't realize it.
Just trust me, Hitler wanted to at least concur all of Europe. If those mountains weren't in his way he would have sent Nazi troops all the way up to Bern. Just look up operation Tannenbaum.
This, as the article says, is a rough estimate. The difficulty is to identify and trace those kind of account as many oligarchs used third parties and third persons as hiding method. We are unable to just close ALL russian accounts as we cant justify against all of them.
I am unfortunately not allowed to specify, but I can personally attest that there are special departments in the Banks working on identifying and freezing those kind of Accounts.
It has everything to do with the Swiss holding a TON of Putin and Russian Oligarchs money in their banks.
