RTPCR should be taken 5 to 7 days after exposure. Surely some of them have false negative results. The positive results are probably those who already have the virus before the flight.
Same, took me like two weeks before I hit positive. Rapid and PCR showed negative over and over while I was running a 103 fever. My boss probably thought I was milking it but I finally was supposed to come back when it came back positive lolâ€¦got another four days after that.
did your symptoms manifest only in your throat/chest at first? my family tested positive but they all had congested sinuses except me who only had a "sore throat" and the rapid/pcr was neg since the test site is the sinuses. a week later when the symptoms moved to my nose, i tested positive.
theory 2: sore throat made me vulnerable to covid so i was relly neg until covid finally go ahold of me lol.
We got it a week before I was to transfer from our NY office to our LA office. Boss was super cool about it, but I could tell it was annoying the hell out of them.
