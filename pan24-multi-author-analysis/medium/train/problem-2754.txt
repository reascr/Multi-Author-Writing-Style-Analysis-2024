Remember when One of Donald Trump's advisors got added by email leaks as being an extreme white supremacist, and Republicans just pretended to not see it? Even when Trump didn't fire the guy or have anything to say about it?
The GOP created Trump and they lost control of him. They are literally going to put up with him for the next two years because they're afraid he'll start his own political party if he loses the nomination. Sit back and enjoy the show. It's impossible for him to get elected now.
