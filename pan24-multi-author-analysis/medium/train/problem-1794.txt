We clearly are angered by their government, Putin, Oligarchs and the populace who are indoctrinated enough to support them.

I'm secretly very excited for the world post Putin and to see just which governments, world leaders, ceos who bend over backwards to help out these oligarchs.
It is very easy right now to denounce Russia. Even those who are sympathetic to the oligarchs and their wealth hoarding.
Once the war is over, the people who run to help those poor oligarchs are definitely those we all need to weary of.
All of a sudden they become suicidal and decide to fall on several bullets as they jump out from the 8th floor.
