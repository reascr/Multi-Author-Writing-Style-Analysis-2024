Ukraine’s been dealing with the huge variety of ammunition and weapons systems pretty well so far, and there’s little reason to believe that would change in the near future. This talking point has been trotted out for every damn bit of aid they’ve received by those who oppose giving them anything, and it hasn’t been an issue so far. They know how to operate a complicated supply chain.
It is “impossible” in the sense that it wouldn’t protect against the high velocity of Russian missiles or the large number of artillery.
From what I know about the iron dome(which isn’t much granted), it’s primarily meant to stop low altitude, low velocity projectiles like mortars, artillery, RPG, etc.
And these suicide drones cost 1 million times less than if costs to maintain an iron dome which would not be able to cover a large enough area for a country aa big as Ukraine.
You don't need to cover the entire area of ukraine, only some of the largest cities. And cost doesn't really matter here when they're being backed by just about the entirety of the civilized world.
