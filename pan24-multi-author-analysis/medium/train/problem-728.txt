Where the fuck did you get this nugget of information from because I for the life of me, can't remember anything like this and I was there.
He was the leader of Pakistan during 9/11, which means he was adjacent to and tenuously involved in the US response. He was in the news every day for years, having to balance a population that was kinda happy about 9/11, with cooperation with the US to destroy terror networks. Not an enviable position.
This is incorrect. Indians and Pakistanis hate each other because we are conditioned since births by our elders to hate the other. The propaganda in our history books, media, art, sports etc all contributes to that. To say 'just terrorism' is a gross injustice to how deep hatred based propaganda runs.
He also didn’t do much to crack down on the same people who caused 9/11, Bin Laden lived in his country for the better part of his entire presidency albeit somewhat cut off from the larger world. But even as a military general who had a successful coup he couldn’t overcome the ISI.
