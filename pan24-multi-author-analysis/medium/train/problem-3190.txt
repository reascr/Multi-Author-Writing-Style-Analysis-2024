Our Democratic party is in shambles and the playing board has been made unfair from top to bottom. The 15-week ban flies in the face of our constitutional right to privacy and the 2008 ballot measure that failed miserably to carve out an exception to the right re: abortion. Our very popular measure to restore voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences was hamstringed by the state legislature. We voted for recreational marijuana back in like 2012 but the legislature screwed is over on that, too. We voted to increase the minimum wage.
