King Charles III, sovereign of the United Kingdom, is the Head of the Armed Forces, with officers and personnel swearing allegiance to him. Long-standing constitutional convention, however, has de facto vested military authority and associated royal prerogative powers in the prime minister and the secretary of state for defence, with the former (acting with the support of the Cabinet) making the key decisions on the use of the armed forces. The sovereign retains the power to prevent the unconstitutional use of the armed forces, including that of its nuclear arsenal.
This is a good deal for the government who get a profitable deal for eternity in exchange for paying all the royal's debts one time a few hundred years back.
They own lots of land and make money from rent, farms, and now windfarms. All that money goes to the government, and the government gives the royal an annual sum.
The crown is going to make more money now by having wind farms on their land. That goes to the government as usual, normally they'd get some back, the king has requested he does not.
