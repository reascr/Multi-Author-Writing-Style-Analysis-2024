Help a non-European understand how expelling a country’s embassy is tantamount to declaring war? Where I’m from, it’s used as a public punishment for countries that have acted egregiously badly.
Start standing up forces on the Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Finnish and Norwegian borders.
These people aren't going to back down and they are using the threat of brinksmanship (not actual brinksmanship) to keep us from bringing them to heel. It's time to show some courage and to risk something to stop something that is to me, even worse - a world where rogue billionaires who control nations engage in completely unchecked aggression.
Saw a video a bit back, interview with a US commander. His force is in Romania, on the Ukraine border. Said they're maintaining full combat readiness, could be headed to the front within an hour or receiving the order. All that's not yet happened is the order being sent.
To some degree this has already happened though. NATO has moved tens of thousands of troops to bases bordering Russia. Most of the countries you name currently have way more foreign troops on their soil that is normal for peacetime. They're ready in case Russia amps the crazy up even higher.
