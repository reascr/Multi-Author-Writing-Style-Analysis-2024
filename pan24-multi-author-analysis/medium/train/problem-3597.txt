mexico is absolutely a racist and discriminatory place for central americans. if you actually knew people that have made the journey, you would hear stories of cutting hair, changing appearances and vocabulary as they pass through mexico in an attempt not to be singled out for being a migrant. anywhere you have to change yourself so much to be safe in, is not a safe place. another thing you would know would be that small mexican gangs and bandits often rob and beat, sometimes rape or kill, migrants traveling north, using the paths migrants take to their advantage. you would also know that the fastest way north is on , and when it passes through towns, sometimes people throw rocks at migrants riding it on an attempt to knock them off, which would result in severe trauma, and death if youre lucky. what about that is safe?
