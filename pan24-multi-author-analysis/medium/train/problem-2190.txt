I think this is a bill enabling a single person to easily reduce communication freedoms masquerading as a national security bill.
If it's really necessary, why don't they just do it as a regular bill, for Tik Tok, and he can sign it?
Presidents already have too much power. Giving one person the power to decide what apps jeopardize nation security is just nuts.

You know that’s because China has been pushing the East palestine event heavily to distract from the weather balloon. China has all kinds of industrial accidents so just because in one case they don’t ship it as far doesn’t mean they have better regulations.
TikTok has been feeding me tons more information on East Palestine that is more detailed and less sensationalized or dumb as what Fox News and even the major nightly news shows. Often they just cover the horse race of it and don't get into the specifics. TikTok even once gave me a video aboit how in China most pvc is made without transporting vinyl chloride at all. Something it seems we should probably be doing.
