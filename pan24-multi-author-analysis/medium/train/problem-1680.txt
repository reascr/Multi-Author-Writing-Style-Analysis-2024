Putin is a lying sack of shit. Ukraine was becoming a self governing democracy so he had to attack it, so it would never become part of NATO or be its own country with a strong economy. If Russia has authoritarian political influence in every former USSR country then they call the shots. Every leader from a former Soviet republic would have to bow down to Putin. Zero west influence not part of the European Union or NATO. Putin thought it would be easy to take control of Ukraine and he’s been fighting a stalemate for almost a year. Putin threatens nuclear war but his tests failed. His army is depleted and wants the Russian people to join the war effort but I think when children are put on war front the Russian people will eventually stand up to there mad dictator. Putin can’t win this war.
He admitted this during his long tirade the night of full scale invasion. He went on about how Ukraine was an accidental country. He mixed it with denazification then desatanization and now leans on both less, leaving bare his original justification.
