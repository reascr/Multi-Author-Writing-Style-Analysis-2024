Man who barricaded himself in home he does not own insists he must be acknowledged as the legal owner of the home before he'll negotiate with law enforcement.
In some ways it's like breaking into a home, being forced out, and running away screaming, "I want that house that's not mine, that I'm not even occupying anymore, before we can talk.".
"For you, the day the forces of the Soviet Union came to reclaim the land you're on was the greatest shitshow you'll ever bask in the greatness of.
And burglarizing all the other homes in the neighborhood, sexually assaulting and torturing the people living in them and then burning them down when you leave. That seems fair.
What's crazy is that Russian nationalists will say Russia CANNOT LOSE. That Ukraine being whole and independent would DESTROY RUSSIA. Germany was actually destroyed, occupied, cut in two, lost a bunch of territory. It is now the leading political and economic power in Europe, far more prosperous and peaceful than it was when it was a "mighty empire". These nuts are so obsessed with guns and bombs and "real politik" that they're ignoring the reality right in front of them.
Heard this interview yesterday comparing how Germany handled its Nazi history vs the US and how it "handled" its slavery history. Thought it might interest you.
