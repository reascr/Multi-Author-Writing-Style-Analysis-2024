But, for how long? If OPEC decides to cut supply the oil prices skyrocket again. At this time of the year, if oil prices rise again, world economy falls.
Then US gave out more fracking licenses and let Chevron exploit Venezuela's oil reserves. Supply rose, as price fell.
The pricing of oil seems reasonable, however natural gas prices also fell in Europe. I think EU has stored some portion of the natural gas they bought from Russia, and they are using their reserves. They were supposed to economise and limit their usage, but they did not need to use gas as much as previous years due to the abnormal heat they have been experiencing this winter. Now, the EU must be increasing the supply of gas, hence the price drop.
If OPEC decides to cut supply to the point where it affects the world economy... Well, a lot more non OPEC countries are gonna ramp up production, the USA has a ton of tar sands and fracking fields just waiting for price to rise enough to be worth operating again and basically its gonna hurt the world economy much more then the US economy.
