NATO and Poland determined it was a Ukrainian air defence missile. There’s no conspiracy/false flag going on there.
They didn't want to. They just thought a live anti-tank weapon was a cool gift from a war zone, and the police chief decided to try it out... in his office.
Has to be a false flag. A gift sent from Russia disguised as from Ukraine. Why would Ukraine attack an ally? The Russians' mistake is always thinking other populations are as dumb as the Russian government.
Something like a false flag, after the missile dropped in Poland I immediately saw a bunch of russia apologists trying to demonize Ukraine for it. Obviously their goal is to demotivate aid to Ukraine.
The gift was directly from Ukrainian officials and military commanders and was an RPG launcher that the police chief had to have manually fired.
Think about it logically; you think it was a Russian false flag, from the facts that have come to light that would mean ….
A: that the highest echelons of Ukrainian leadership must’ve been infiltrated for the saboteur to have physical access to the Polish delegation to gift the RPG.
B: That the Russian false flag operation relied entirely on the Polish police voluntarily shooting anti tank rockets at themselves. Next level war strategy if true.
Polish police were gifted war souvenirs, one was an RPG that they were playing around with and they accidentally fired it.
No conspiracy, no false flag theories that relies on the Polish harming themselves. No need to do mental gymnastics.
