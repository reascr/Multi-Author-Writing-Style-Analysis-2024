I think it’s interesting that the comment at the very end says “I think he’s an idiot. I asked my father who had fought in the war if he had killed anyone and he was reluctant to say.” Uh ok so he’s morally better than Harry because he doesn’t talk about it!? Harry is only voicing what the military TRAINS and brainwashes soldiers to do. Yes they train them to view the ones they’re killing as “bad” and “pieces on a chess board.” My sisters ex was trained in SERE and I know stuff about training that the average person doesn’t. All you are to the military is a killing machine. The “training” up to that point is to get you mentally to what Harry said. And that is why I am against imperialism and the military. He should voice that so more people know the truth about what being a soldier does to you.
Me too; plus the hilarity of news outlets publishing articles about the Taliban giving their commentary on Western celebrities (ex. Andrew Tate, Prince Harry). It's like that one episode of South Park where Al-Qaeda saves the town from New Jersey.
