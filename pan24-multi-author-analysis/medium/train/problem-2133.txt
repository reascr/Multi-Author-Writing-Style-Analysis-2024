We may be wealthy, but we're cutting costs in health care like crazy, and I don't understand why.. teachers are striking (?) etc.
Dane here. Norway is probably the only place on the planet where it is better to live than Denmark. Out of the extremely well functioning Nordic states, Noway is the wealthiest by a good margin.
But for all our faults, we still have among the lowest crime rates, lowest wealth inequality, greatest social mobility, highest purchasing power of lower and middle class, best availability for healthcare, most robust public finances, best educated and most organized workforce, etc.
Exactly, we have problems but instead of seeing each and every one as a mortal threat to our way of life maybe we ought to work at bettering them instead. It'll never be perfect, but it still gives by far the best results for the population.
entirely depends on where in Norway you're at. Imagine all the dialect variations of the english language globally, now apply that same variation to a language spoken by 5.5m people...
