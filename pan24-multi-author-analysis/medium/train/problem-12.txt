The 2014 situation had nothing to do with the discovery of new resources. The US wanted a more anti-Russian government in Ukraine and orchestrated the overthrow of the corrupt Yanukovich government to allow the rise of rabidly anti-russian far-right Ukrainian nationalists. It was a geo-political move aimed at furthering US interests in Europe both economically and militarily. Destabilize then profit. Same play book used in Iraq, South America and Africa.
Good point. I definitely don’t put it past progressives to be influenced by Putin (e.g. Tulsi Gabbard), but I chalked a lot of their opposition up to a general distaste for war and the arms industry. So while I disagree with them about helping Ukraine, I don’t see their opposition as hypocritical.
What’s ironic to me is - the same people who will defend the colossal expense of the arms race in the 80’s because it helped to defeat the soviets are opposing sending this relatively small amount to a country that’s basically being murdered by Russia. Meanwhile, it’s having the effect of putting a halt to most of the rest of Russia’s belligerent bullshit. Seems like we’re getting off cheap….
