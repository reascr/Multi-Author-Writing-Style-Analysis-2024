Which republican senators do you think would codify it if more join? Murkowski, Collins obviously. Maybe Mitt, he’s a moderate-ish(he also convicited trump twice so he’s not afraid of breaking from his party), the kind of guy I think you could convince in the end, he did vote for respect for marriage act and he has supported reproductive rights in the past, and especially if he doesn’t run again he might support it. Thom Tillis? Could he since North Carolina is pretty even democrat and Republican and maybe Shelley Moore capito could be involved in a compromise What do you think?
