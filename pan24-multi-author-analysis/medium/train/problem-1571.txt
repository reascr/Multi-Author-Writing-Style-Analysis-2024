He'll probably be isolated along with all the other diddlers and child murders for his own protection.
Very true, long term convicts are sue crazy, any prison putting a inmate in known danger will incur a lawsuit from them or their families. Most of these awful humans are thrown together in isolated, single person cell pods, they will have a different rotation of yard time ect. As sad as it is the idea that there is some kind of “honor amongst thieves” and that these dudes will get what they deserve thanks to the faceless other of prisoners is a myth we tell ourselves to not see the reality.
I mean, this dude's continued existence is just a waste of taxpayer dollars at this point. He's not going to be set free ever again.
I was raised to forgive, and to trust the system. Sometimes in cases like this, it really makes me question that rationale.
No, it’s more expensive and irreversible to kill someone. Just keep them in prison for life. It’s not the job of the government or victims to seek vengeance.
If you agree to pay my share of the taxes that keep all those sick fuckers alive, I'll agree with you.
If you had read what I said, capital punishment is more expensive than incarceration. Also taxation doesn’t work on personal preferences or New York would stop funding cheap southern states that don’t pay for their own citizens.
2) This person obviously doesn't value human life, IMO, there for the value of his life is forfeit by his own hand.
3) The government doesn't determine guilt or innocence. That's why a jury is made of selected and screened people.
