A majority of the US population cannot afford a new EV SUV, or any EV, even with the tax credits. In contrast, the vast majority of the US population would use electric bikes daily if there was no barrier to ownership.
Govt needs to push for much cheaper electric cars. 55k and 80k thresholds for credit are insane. How about 25-30k so ordinary people can afford one without going into debt for 10 years.
The idiocy of this system is shocking. We should be applying tax credits for electric bicycles. You could get roughly 7x as many commuters on electric bikes (without them paying a dime) for the same tax credit applied to an SUV. 8k lb EVs are not the answer.
