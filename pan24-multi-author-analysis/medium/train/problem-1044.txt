Pinning this comment to address people's questions and worry around article 5 being invoked in light of the 2 killed in the Polish border town.
Initial findings suggest that the missile that hit Poland was fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile, Associated Press reported on Wednesday, citing U.S. officials.
Polish Foreign Ministry confirm a Russian-made (important wording, they're not saying Russia necessarily was the one that sent it) rocket fell on the territory.
A S-300 was found at the scene (), but it's a missile that both Ukraine and Russia use. It's also a missile that the vast majority have been made in Russia/Soviet Union (hence the Polish Foreign Ministry's "Russian-made"). Russia's been repurposing them as ground attack missiles (seen in Kharkiv - ) and Ukraine has been shooting Russian strikes down with S-300s as well.
(The information below is no longer pertinent in light of what NATO's assessment of the situation has been.).
This is NOT the start of WW3, folks. Calm. However, Poland has a lot of options to make things incredibly unpleasant for Russia without kicking off WW3 if it's confirmed Russia was the source of the missile.
Article 4: The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.
Just to make things clear, making a serious no fly zone declaration is basically the same as sending NATO troops into Ukraine to enforce a no soldier/tank zone.
