a bear is a brave and solitary creature that can endure with patience the winter. Russia on the other hand is a slithering creep, that lives of attacking thing smaller than them and trying to poison things larger than themselves. cowardly, weak and unable to survive without direct sunlight to aid them with their body temperature. this an attitude reflected by all those loyal to the ghoulish cabal we politely call the Kremlin.
I know a woman in the us involved in charity work that has helped Ukraine and they even tried hacking her. And they weren't even a large donor nor solely for Ukraine.
I don't understand why Russia has not been geofenced already. There's almost no reason for any person or organization in western world to have traffic flowing to/from Russia. Just cut them off completely from the internet. Along with their buddies - N. Korea, Iran and Syria.
Fine, but allow it at individual level. I want my home router to filter out all Russian traffic completely. I don't give a fuck about internet fair laws and such - I just want Russia blocked out of my home.
