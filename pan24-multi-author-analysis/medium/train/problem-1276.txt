Jonathan Davis owns 50%, and his wife is the President of David Jang's Olivet University (not to be confused with Olivet College, which is a legit college), and both are followers of Jang's "Community".
If I remember correctly, Jang was kicked out of the moonies after claiming that he was the one true messiah. I don't know if the other co-owner of Newsweek, Dev Pragad, is still involved in the cult, there are conflicting reports on that.
Surprised me too... and makes me think sometimes that we are all being manipulated, left and right. It seems that behind closed doors Congress is one thing, in front of the cameras and microphones, they are something completely different. I wonder if, inside those conference rooms, they plan and decide who will say what to media when.
It does, and it's posted here a lot, too. I guess the cult that owns the Newsweek brand now really needs the money from the ad revenue they get from it to fund their operations.
