Yeah. Too much back-patting for my liking in the media. The Democrats SHOULDN'T be underdogs. These patriotic BS articles don't dissuade from the fact that despite all the lies, the law breaking, the diminishing of abortion rights, Republicans still essentially have half the country behind them. This even with the addition of Gen Z voters, and many red state voters dying of COVID, the GOP is still standing pretty even with the Democrats.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

You know i find it incredibly telling that the republicans are talking about how to further restrict voting demographics and democrats are talking about how to make everyones vote more powerful. Really telling.
