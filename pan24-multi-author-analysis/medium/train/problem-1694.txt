There are plenty of countries with football heritage that practice Islam that deserved it more. They built all these stadiums so these rich douche nozzles can have a plaything for a month. An incredible waste of resources.
You could say that the Qatar government is evil and its people are negligent and should be ashamed for not caring about basic human rights. But you can’t say “All Arabs are bad, Islam should be extinguished from existence.”- that’s the tone many hold in these detailed comment sections.
I don’t condone what Qatar is doing but to be frank there have been a lot of Islamophobic/racist comments on Reddit recently. Any comment thread about Qatar eventually derails into Redditors cursing the entire Middle East region and its Arab populace.
no more than any other controversial comment on any normal thread & the hates been coming both ways ... just look at the comments section when beer got banned.
Redditors quarreling about something as mundane as beer, or which football team is the best is perfectly fine. When the same quarrels derails into racism, homophobia, transphobia or whatever discrimination against a certain group of people passes the line in my book.
I'm sure these people on here wouldn't be spouting their shit online if they had that 1 neighbor/friend that's the same as those you talk shit to think about when typing.
Which is gross and I blame their upbringing for such stupid views on the world. When you aren't exposed to certain people you've got no "proper" way to interact/learn about/find out what they find offensive and/or why they see it that way.
I grew up in a cultural melting pot (Queens, NY) and I quite literally have guyanese + t&t, indian, chinese, black, white, and spanish neighbors all living next door to each other.
