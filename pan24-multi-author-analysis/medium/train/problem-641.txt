The GOP is the party that Trump is determined to punish for not overturning the 2020 election, not restoring him to the White House, and not doing more to protect him since. Now they're saying he's dragging the party down when he's already furious. Trump doesn't forget who badmouthed him.
Hahaha good luck with that. They can distance all they want, but when they do, their shitty policies will be all they have.
Henceforth, the GOP will maintain that they're moving beyond MAGA. They can't. That's the party they built. That's the world they created, and they've made that their party since long before TFG came on the scene. He is a symptom, not the disease.
