Shitty article as it doesn't list the biggest reason it's a false comparison - your household can't issue its own currency that your vendors have to accept. The US government can.
Well, doing things like that all the time turns the US into Zimbabwe. Not that you have an invalid point, but it's a pitfall that you might want to pay attention.
