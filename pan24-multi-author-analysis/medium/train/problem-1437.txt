Whats the difference between this and faking your resume and credentials to get a job? I seem to remember some article about a city civil engineer who lied about his credentials and the bridge broke; that was a bridge and this is a district/country. I know McCarthy is saying “he was elected by the people so we have to keep him” but that’s just restating what happened as a reason to not ask him to step down.

I feel like if McCarthy had literally anything positive to say about him he’d jump on it right away, so he must not if the best he can come up with is “sucks to suck”.
