We need sensible gun regulations in this country. But this shit will back-fire and promotes fundamental misunderstanding, and while I do not believe the 2nd Amendment outlaws sensible restrictions, this is overreach this is unlikely to stand. Semi-automatic is far too broad of a classification. That's basically any pistol that isn't a revolver, as well as a many hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns. "Semi-automatic" isn't some crazy military technology, it's just the way regular-ass guns have worked for like a hundred years. I have a .22LR varmint rifle that's semi-automatic, for Christ's sake. All it's good for is shooting pop cans or if I have the bad luck to have a sick small animal in my yard and I need to take care of it.
I'm sure I'll get some shit for this. Whatever, I'm a gun-owning lefty, that places some degree of value on the 2nd Amendment but don't believe it's absolute. This country does need some degree of gun regulation but this ain't how to approach it.
