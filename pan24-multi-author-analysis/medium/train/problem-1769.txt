I think you’re simultaneously right and wrong. Yes, there are a fuck ton of reds moving here, and DeathSentence is an extremely effective demagogue. That being said, if more time/effort/money went into highlighting cuts to social security and Medicaid that the GOP pushed, the aging population here might break parties to show up against that. We should show how the war on woke is actually holding us back. We rank 30th in the country for student success. Teachers are paid the worst salaries in the country. And finally, I don’t know, maybe try to not use the same failing strategy over and over again. Try energizing the blue by NOT HAVING CHARLIE FUCKING CRIST a-fucking-gain….
