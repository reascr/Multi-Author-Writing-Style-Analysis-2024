Borodyankya was like nothing I’ve ever seen on earth. I thought trench warfare was done with WW1 but seeing it personally makes you realize just how fragile we all are.
Russia strafing and bombing obvious civilian apartment buildings and schools. Forcing old women off a bus to line up and mow them down with a machine gun.
Iran and Iraq used during their war from 1980-1988. That war is also the only war since WWI where chemical warfare was used on the battlefield on a massive scale. They mostly used sarin but mustard gas was also deployed. Iran also made extensive use of "human wave attacks" across no-man's land which was also a WWI phenomenon. They even had bayonet charges. It was also the first time nuclear reactors were attacked. It's the first time two sides mutually lobbed ballistic missiles at each other.
Any notion that this wasn’t the 21st century version of the holocaust is dispelled quickly after 10 minutes in borodyanka. I’m glad he got to see it. Everyone should. Ukraine will build something amazing from it as they always tend to do. But the price they paid needs to be recognized and remembered. Freedom is never free. We all just live on credit.
