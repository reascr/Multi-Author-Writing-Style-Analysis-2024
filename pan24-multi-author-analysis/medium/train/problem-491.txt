Intelligence is probably overall more valuable than any of this. You don't want to compromise your ability to gather intelligence because you blew something up. This is more relevant to attacks on power grids than anything else, but could still apply.
Would Russia believe independent black hat hackers are capable of a cyber attack causing physical damage? Probably not, and if so what does Russia have the capability to do as a response? Regardless of that answer there's a reason nobody is rushing to set these precedents.
Edit: These are things to think about moving forward, and not that relevant to this story. With Gerasimov now in control we could see more asymmetric warfare(such as cyber attacks) against Ukraine and its allies. There are many unanswered questions about what constitutes an act of war in this domain.
Russia could look to take more action in all of these gray areas including cyber attacks, 2024 elections in many countries, acts of terror outside Ukraine etc.
Of course Russia would believe that, theyâ€™ve been happily watching their own citizens shut pipelines and hospitals down with ransomware for years now.
Well, that's the thing, governments can't prove that it's state sponsored which is why they haven't done anything about it even though they did say cyber attacks against critical infrastructure is a casus belli.
