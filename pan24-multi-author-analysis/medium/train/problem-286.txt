For other lovely wonderful things an "unarmed"-but-expecting-that-capture-will-lead-to-death protester can carry or make to defend themself or attack the regime, consider >homemade bombs, caltrops, knives, targeted independent acts of sabotage beforehand, vehicle sabotage, homemade chemical munitions from cleaners, acid bottles, cyberattacks, homemade guns, or just real guns if they have them.< Nasty, nasty stuff. Do not quote me or put me on a watchlist, don't shoot the bloody messenger here. The punishment "death" for something is usually a deterrent, but this is not the situation where doubling down is a good idea. And it's a sign things are spiraling out of control badly for the regime when they're pulling out such insane measures, it's not working, and the grievances of the protesters are growing.
Remember Florida's 'three strikes' laws? It provided a pretext for grand escape attempts with no hesitation to fire on cops, hold citizens hostage, ... whatever it took to escape. ... The penalty was known.
It was a grand failure. ... These guys want to hang little girls. I suspect it will be a much grander failure.
