Russia on the other hand has a history as a player. Much as that position is waning, it's still true that they have cards left. For example, Europe still has to consider their oil and mineral resources in the equation. The US and the west in general still have to worry about what the China/Russia variable is going to look like tomorrow. Etc.
True. But, there's a little more to the difference. North Korea is still just a little piss-ant country with a nut in charge. Yes, they have more of a military than that would normally suggest, and they have the potential for actual nuclear capabilities; but, they have little else. They have no position or even a history of a position at the table with the rest of the world as a player on any front other than as a loud mouthed little bully shouting from the sidelines.
I think these announcements are now in the style of North Korea - they are merely posturing on the world stage just so their national news outlets can tell a story about their hypothetical strenh. The rest of the world rolls their eyes.
