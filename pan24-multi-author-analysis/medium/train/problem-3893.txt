Thought we were getting one in 2015 when they got raided and a bunch of VIPs were arrested/banned. But the new guys that came after are just as inept and corrupt.

Story goes that Stalin used the term for an American journalist who helped cover up the famine going on in Ukraine. Journalist got a Pulitzer for his articles. Define “free”.
The problem is they own a ton of brands (in the US at least). It's like coca cola, if you see Budweiser on tap, there's a decent chance most of the other beers are also owned by Budweiser.
I try to buy very local beers for home, but at restaurants and bars it can be hard. Sam Adams is one of the few big mainstream beers that is still independent.
Except pubs and sports bars have to pay exorbitant fees to show games. They pay a rate based on capacity. Their sports packages are thousands of dollars.
