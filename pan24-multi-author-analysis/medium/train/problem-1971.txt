However, there are a lot of west friendly citizens, especially the younger ones. On top of that the government has been investing in higher education schemes and teaching English as a second language, which leans to the idea that they are thinking of a future within the EU. Most of the people I worked with there had a bachelors or masters degree, and almost everybody I talked to anywhere could speak good English.
I think if European teams sat out you'd get countries like Australia/Canada/USA joining. Maybe Korea/Japan. I imagine some less LGBTQ friendly European states like Poland and Serbia might not take part.
I'm just saying that as an American I wouldn't even have mixed feelings about our team forfeiting as a matter of protest. It's the morally right thing to do at this point, but also, we suck at soccer relative to our normal performance in athletics, and so it's not like we would be sacrificing sports achievements by protesting. I also like the (hypothetical, of course) opportunity to stand in solidarity with our European friends.
