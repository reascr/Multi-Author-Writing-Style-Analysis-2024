Not really. Borders have been open for quite a while and so has the requirement for pre departure testing for all countries. The travellers coming from the northern hemisphere winter have not caused any sort of bump. Once Omicron got in the tactic changed and it would be illogical to not treat it as endemic now and to change anything. Should some new varient pop up that poses an existential threat then I'm sure they would revisit things but that is not the case.
Travellers from China to Australia would be required to have a negative pre-departure test from today, joining the likes of the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
ESR scientists would also pilot wastewater testing from international flights in the coming weeks, which could replace the targeted and temporary voluntary testing announced yesterday for travellers from China.
A negative test from China basically means nothing. Italy started testing on arrival and found that almost half of air passengers arriving from China were positive.
