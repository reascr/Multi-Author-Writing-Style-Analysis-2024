The remnant is more than 15 feet by 15 feet (4.5 metres by 4.5 metres); it's likely bigger because part of it is covered with sand. Because of the presence of square thermal tiles, it's believed to be from the shuttle's belly, officials said.
Divers for a TV documentary crew first spotted the piece in March while seeking wreckage of a World War II plane. NASA recently verified through video that the piece was part of the shuttle that broke apart shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. All seven on board were killed, including the first schoolteacher bound for space, Christa McAuliffe.
I was in 5th grade when this happened, the two 5th grade teachers at my school had applied to be the teachers on the flight, and had garnered a fair amount of community support in their pursuit. Neither advanced terribly far in the process, but both used the launch as a teaching tool that year. My entire class was watching as it blew up. I can still remember the looks on my teachers faces.
Did your class realize the seriousness of the situation? Obviously the teachers did, but I just wonder about all of those kids that watched it in schools.
