> Earlier in the day, Florida Senator Marco Rubio strongly condemned Trump, saying there were "consequences" to his words.
I mean he literally started his campaign encouraging supporters to "knock the crap out of" protesters...
they're basically using him as a battering ram to push the country further right...there have been a number of republicans who have realigned themselves with dems, but the long haul GOPers put up with it because it lets them be more crazy cuz "at least they aren't Trump"...i had a FOX news watching family member tell me he wouldn't vote for Trump again, but would hope someone more reasonable "like Tom Cotton" gets the nod...like holy shit if Tom Cotton is a mark of reason...we're fucked.
It's not just the things he has personally said and done, but he had a cabinet full of Federal officials who regularly told folliwers to buy up all the guns and ammo they could find because when he refuses to leave office, "that's when the shooting starts.".
