I suppose thatâ€™s true, but Biden also happened to be VP to a very photogenic, highly visible, and history-making President Obama.
So my theory is she has staff around her that are doing what happened to Hillary, trying to make her seem like a boring male candidate/politician, and not letting her be herself. When you see behind the scenes stuff and her around normal people, she's actually really likeable. I saw some cell phone footage of her doing the WH Trick or Treating event, and she seemed to legitimately be having a blast with the parents and kids--and they really liked her too. But the second she ends up on a debate stage or in a scripted interview, she just seems like the most basic, sterile, unlikeable every day politician imaginable.

If I'm being honest, they should just let her do and say whatever the fuck she wants. If people don't like her, so be it. At least they will know it's the real her.
