The big picture debate acknowledges that the immigration system is broken and needs to be fixed. One party want to fix it and the other refuses to fix it before stopping all illegal immigration.
I get why you wonder if this is the hill to die on but if we have to compromise on values it shouldn't be for a bad faith argument like 'first build a wall then we can work on fixing what's broken.'.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
The end goal would look like an immigration system that is appropriate for commerce and capitalism and all that big L liberal stuff. It's a big spoonful of medicine that is unlikely to produce political wins imo. Especially with bad faith grandstanding bigots poisoning the well with great replacement nonsense.
Edit: I mean stranding down would lead to political loses. Standing firm is at worst a wash I think.
