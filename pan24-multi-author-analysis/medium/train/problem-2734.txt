I think you’re over-estimating the amount of non-western international support there is for the Ukrainian position. There are many countries that are neutral in their view of this conflict. As the war continues to go on, I would be surprised if countries didn’t begin to align with China/Russia as they look to break away from Western influence. Countries like South Africa, UAE, India & Indonesia come to mind who have stated a neutral position in regards to this conflict. Even EU countries have shown support either monetarily OR with weapons, but very few have done BOTH.
What a terrible shame it would be if US businesses were forced to manufacture their products in America, Mexico and Canada. We need a green new deal? We talk about forcing consumers in the future to use electric cars.. look at how much fuel it takes for a single container ship to take its cheaply made bullshit from China to the USA, then truck all that crap from the port to the warehouses, stores and finally the consumer.
