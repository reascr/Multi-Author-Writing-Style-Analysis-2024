A lot of new neighborhoods in the area where I live are for rent only, which means larger and larger numbers of people will only be renters and never own a home. The entire neighborhood is owned by one person and/or corporation.
We are having the same problem with Chinese owned developers buying up huge chunks of land and putting up as many houses as possible. Source: me. I work for a consulting firm in the DC area and these are most of our clients. The get away with by being only %49 owned by Chinese investors and having a bunch of these type of companies.
how could building more homes cause prices of existing homes to increase? You're adding supply. What about families that own their houses; They don't deserve to see the increase in their home value?
These aren’t really affordable housing. They are expensive, which drives up the property values in the surrounding areas and makes it too expensive for most people to live without renting. These same investment groups will then begin to buy these properties and drive up the rent even further. Meanwhile a large percent of the revenue being created by the Chinese companies doesn’t go back into the American economy.
