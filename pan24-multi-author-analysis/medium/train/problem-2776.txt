Every picture of Tucker Carlson looks like he just sat on a pinecone unexpectedly. I don't think he's capable of actually closing his mouth long enough to get a picture of it.
Meh, builds character. I have a good friend who is in his thirties and he literally can't listen to opposing points of view. I tried to show him a 10 minute clip that I knew was contrary to point of view but I believe was a well reasoned counter point. He started shaking his head, his knee was vibrating and he only lasted about two minutes before he had to leave the room he was so upset.
That’s like saying it’s nice to have your urethra pierced with a shit smeared bamboo sliver because it helps remind you what it’s like to not have a septic wound of your penis.
Subscribe to r/conservative and lurk so you can understand another point of view. I don't participate often (because then I get upset and they just down vote you anyway) and when I do I try to be courteous.
Grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, but Dad decided he wanted to live "a simpler lifestyle" upstate as I was becoming a teen.
