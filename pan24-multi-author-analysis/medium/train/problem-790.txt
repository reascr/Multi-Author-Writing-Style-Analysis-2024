Maybe Dr Oz will run in AZ after he looses in PA. Dr Oz says it's important he runs in coastal states, says it is one of the reasons he is running in the "coastal state" of PA. You can't blame him though, for not knowing about states he doesn't live in but likes running for office in.
Good luck AZ, may peace surround you this Nov. PS: Pro Tip, hide your puppies when Dr Oz enters your state; he has a penchant for killing puppies.
I don’t live in AZ but is it normal for armed people to just stand around to menace the public? Are they gonna shoot someone in broad daylight? I don’t even want to visit a place with such desperation for violence.
Lives in AZ- yes it is. Guns are everywhere here and lots of people open carry. Was in the self check out lane at Walmart yesterday, standing next to 2 guys w ar-15s.
