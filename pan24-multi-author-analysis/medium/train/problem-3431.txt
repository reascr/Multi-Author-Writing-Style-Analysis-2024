Yes and no, if you’re willing to invest time and effort it’s less gambling and more taking an educated risk. My appetite for risk is fairly high which is why I’m not going to tell people what to invest in because I am prepared to take losses, most people aren’t. So I tell them to invest in low fee mutual funds, ETF’s like VOO and VTI and retirement plans. I only put extra effort into one coworker who was adamant in only using savings accounts. I explained that not investing in retirement accounts or even worse his employer provided thrift savings account with 5% matching equals never retiring. He’s have $250,000 total at 65 and he thought that was a great number and no, he did not plan on buying a house. I explained he could easily have 2.5 million if he invested the money in a low or no fee mutual fund or ETF and he said it’s too risky. And then explain that his work thrift savings plan doubles every year plus inflation because of employer matching so even if the market goes to hell you make money, he said he didn’t think so. And then explained that that $250,000 would only be worth about $120,000 today and that he would burn through it in approximately three years. He said and I quote “I don’t think that’s right.” I told him have fun retiring poor then, I was so pissed that someone with zero financial education wouldn’t listen to somebody who has some.
The most telling part of this 'Trump profit' to me is - this is the sale of property Trump inherited from his father. This was inherited profit - not profit from Trump's own investments or business acumen.
