Do you think that anyone whos not convinced that climate change is real after 25 years of climate change protests in all shapes and sizes would have been convinced tommorow that he does need to do something? The time for convincing is sadly over and anybody who is still debating wether climate change is real is largely immune to facts.
Ah, so they’re going after relatively easy, ineffectual targets to make themselves feel better because they lack the courage to go after the actual cause of the problem. Got it.
Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have the courage to go after BP or Shell either. But I also don’t attack paintings to assuage my climate guilt. Because that would be fucking stupid and pointless.
There is no bad publicity, since we are talking about it here and even thinking about what else they could do. So I’d say they are accomplishing their goal of raising awareness.
You don’t fight these corporations by attacking their facilities, you fight them by building awareness and influence politics.
