LMAO you really don't know shit about these things. Even if Sino-U.S conflicts break out into a war over Taiwan, none of the NATO allies are obligated to get involved, because Taiwan is not a NATO member and no U.S territory is under attack. And no, U.S air bases and carrier fleets will not "all be used"; only the bases at Philippine and Korea will be activated, and only 1 or 2 fleet will be needed to prevent a complete lock-down of the Taiwan strait by China.
I hate the CCP too but frankly there's no way I could claim to know what will happen to the PRC over the next 5 years. Or any country for that matter.
Why would the US announce it? Upgrades that affect one country's strategic capabilities are a matter of national security. There's really no need to classify this kind of intelligence.
And your last question: war. China is prepping for war with the US. They're militarizing faster than any nation in history, they're building weapons systems with the sole purpose of hitting US ships, carriers, and planes, and they believe we are on a collision course for war.
