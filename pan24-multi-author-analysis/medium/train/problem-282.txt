I mean, when it comes to storing classified documents, both are totally improper handlings. There were documents at an office space and in a garage for over 5 years. Both of those places had people in and out of them who were not cleared for classified documents. Having documents in a storage locker and in a bedroom at mar a lago is also improper. But it's really not very different. People on the golf course or in the restaurant aren't in Trump's residence in mar a lago (where the documents were). They were close to where documents were kept. I'm sure a lot of people walked by the office where Biden's documents were stashed over the last 5 years. Would you say Biden is even more reckless since he had documents in a place where regular people are nearby?
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
