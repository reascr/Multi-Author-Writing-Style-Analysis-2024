I 100% agree. When it gets to September, Biden should announce that he will sign a clean debt ceiling increase and nothing else and dare the Republicans to refuse to pass one. As soon as the deadline passes, announce that since Congress already approved the spending, and since the 14 Amendment requires him to protect the full faith anc credit of the US, they’re going to just ignore the debt limit. Also observe that the Supreme Court can say whatever they want, but they better figure out how they’re going to enforce their rulings before they make them.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
