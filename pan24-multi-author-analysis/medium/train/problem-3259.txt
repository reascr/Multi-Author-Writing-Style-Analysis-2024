Both Countries have elections in 2024 , Biden would love to get some Indian American votes that may help him win and Modi who's guaranteed to win just loves to travel and score more dimplomacy PR points.
Whoever you are this guy supports you and would love to come for a tour, just don't be China or Pakistan.
Also, we need to figure out where exactly India will sit during WW3, as the lines have already been drawn and they have a complicated relationship with many parties on both camps.
To those who wonder "why": Much of the gasoline in our cars today comes from India which buys Russian oil at bargain basement prices (reportedly way less than the cap). This is exactly why we're not paying $8/gallon.
I also am not sure how country's politics will play into this. Many seem to have not forgotten Modi's 'Abki baar Trump Sarkar' chant/slogan in US. One of the hilarious and lame stuff I have ever seen.
The RW boys here are not going to like this, almost part of their ecosystem is busy making videos about alpha Putin videos on Youtube(with the usual Rasputin song, i have no idea how they chose that one).
Finally, India has come to the conclusion that their arms strategy needs a complete overhaul and this is absolutely going to be part of the agenda.
There is immense hate for western countries here from right wing and ofc mainstream media which has become a huge pile of shit.
Imo, India might just continue to stay on with the Non-Aligned Movement. But then again you are right if shit goes bad like WW3, I am not sure about our position.
