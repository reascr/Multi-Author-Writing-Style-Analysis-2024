Ukraine, early war was not known for a exotic air defense capability. Also there are just so many technical issues with flying at those speeds leaving routes to need to be preprogrammed. So you have to have a thorough understanding of the AA network as it stands and the approach to target is very straightforward. Obviously it cant maneuver as it enters lower atmospheres and there's evidence that at least the Russian munitions are not capable of hitting at those speeds which can be judged with a fair amount of confidence from the kinetic impact of test munitions in March. Regardless of all of that, even if the tool worked perfectly and they develop heat shielding for electronics to improve the munitions ability to detect unforeseen threats and receive radio waves, there is a problem of production and cost. These things cost as much as 10-20 cruise missiles to carry the same amount of ordinance as 1. While money isn't a end all be all saturation has a value in and of itself.
If you sleep on your enemies youâ€™re at risk of being shocked. It is better to assume your competitor is capable. This is how big name brands have been beaten out by smaller more nimble businesses.
