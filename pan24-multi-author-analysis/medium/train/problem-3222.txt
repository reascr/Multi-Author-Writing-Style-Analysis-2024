Research into gas stoves was begun in the 1990s when the Gas Research Institute was asked whether there was a connection between high rates of asthma in Native American children and the use of unvented gas stoves as the primary or only source of heat in homes, often under crowded conditions.
Myself and my colleagues were involved early on with the instrumentation part of the project, but we never saw the final report years later. I would think that the present 'war on stoves' began with this study or something like it.
