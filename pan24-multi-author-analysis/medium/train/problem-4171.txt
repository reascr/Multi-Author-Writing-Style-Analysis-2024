People don't comment just because they "feel required to". It doesn't matter how ostensibly positive a comment is if the comment itself is vapid and useless. Say something supportive, sure, but say something usefully supportive instead of just taking up screen space. Check out my comment for an example.
This news published in HK two days ago and no body really cares about it in local chatboard. When someone realize he wrote the word "freedom", it gives a masturbation for all the fantasy of "freedom of speech".
Oh I see... so you must have a great evidence based explanation as to why "the real authoritarians" have half the prison population with quadruple the civilian population.
I like your idea, none of us for sure what will happen but you are so sure it's a restriction of freedom of expression. You are so sure that it's because of what he wrote. I just dig inside and read some local news and local comment about this news and yet, you research nothing but you can strongly believe you are right. Reddit is so funny.
So mr. Chinese agent. Do you think the Chinese government wouldn’t have arrested him if he put up posters with the word freedom? Just gotta understand if you truly doesn’t think that China has an oppressive rule.
