However the difference is in quality - Russia is using even the oldest stockpiles made in 1940s. With the shells there is not that much of an issue - scrape the rust off and off you go. Their main issue, however, is propellant charges. Those are literally sacks with gunpowder. They have to be stored in controlled environment and even then they have finite shelf life. A lot of Russian propellant charges weren't stored properly and there were cases they didn't work at all or they didn't perform as they should (resulting in missing the target by almost a kilometer short and hitting their own troops). So artillery fire intensity is very similar on both sides, however Ukrainians can usually hit the target with pinpoint accuracy, where Russians half of the time are sending shells in general direction of the target.
The US has been increasing munitions production again and again and trying to exhort western allies to increase production as well. The past year has definitely caused the DOD to reassess munitions stockpile levels. The fact of the matter is, Ukraine is in a fight where they are greatly outnumbered and there isn't a realistic amount that will be enough, nevertheless, collectively, we need to give Ukraine what they need to win.
