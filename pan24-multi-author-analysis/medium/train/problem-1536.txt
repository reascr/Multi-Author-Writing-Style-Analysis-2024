If you don't believe me just go to Holland. All the affirming churches are dying a slow and inglorious death. Go to the states - all the mainline denominations that have liberalized are shrinking at a spectacular rate.
Either lose your members in drips and drabs over the better part of a century as people drift away one by one, or maintain a hard line and keep the engagement of individual members to their last breath - but lose members in abrupt generational chunks instead.
There's also an option where you decrease the focus on doctrine and shift more towards providing moral support and sense of community. Quite a few churches are finding new purpose that way in a modern world where people are struggling to connect.
the Netherlands isn't a particularily religious country to begin with, 55% is non religious. It has nothing to do with "churches becoming more liberal", its that more liberal countries just aren't as religious.
And the churches that don't do those things are growing. Far right politics is not biblical. Abortion and same sex marriage aren't biblical. Giving me a bible church. Not a politics church.
