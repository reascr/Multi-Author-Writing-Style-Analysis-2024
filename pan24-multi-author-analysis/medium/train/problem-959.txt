Long hauler, long COVID really is a thing in my opinion, my wife has started seeing a neurologist for the brain fog, and they do exercises every few weeks to help, but her cognitive function really was affected, the problem is no one knows if it's permanent or short term, but three years later we're not really holding out hope it's going to improve that much.
I was diagnosed with asthma when I was in my early 20s, my family and I got COVID that Oct of 2020 prior to vaccines and all, and it tore us up. I was already using an inhaler for my asthma nightly, I honestly feel like that lessened the affects I had, but I'm far worse and my lung capacity seems to have gotten less, I still have trouble taking deep breaths after exercise sometimes, never had that problem until COVID diag.
I still have adult-onset asthma that I developed only after getting the Swine Flu in 2009. That shit wrecked me. I never had respiratory issues prior to that.
Covid was a mild cold for me but my sense of taste and smell is still super messed up over a year later. Most things taste sour to me. I like bland foods a lot now because at least they donâ€™t taste bad.
