No kidding. 37 million people in one day sounds like a headline from something like Contagion, almost surreal. (Which, since that film is on my mind again, was terrifyingly prescient about the dangers of misinformation, conspiracy, etc in a global pandemicâ€¦) And the hazard of this thing mutating further is quite worrisome.
My family in China almost all got infected, they all think it's COVID and have COVID like symptoms probably a new strain and their vaccines are not effective, it's all fucked up.
I will be shocked if China tries to hide their numbers or dampen the blow in anyway. The people protested against everything that the CPC did to counter covid. They will most likely show the reality of that.
no clue, it is so odd. as soon as they stopped the zero covered policy. everything went to hell, outside of forcing people to quarantine, people still distance themselves and wear masks so not sure something else is going on.
They have cities with a bigger population than some European countries have people... And that is just ONE city.
Some of their cities has a population from 10-25mil. With Shanghai (The highest) at 27milion people.
