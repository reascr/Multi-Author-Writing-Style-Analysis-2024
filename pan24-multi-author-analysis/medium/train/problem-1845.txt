The resources simply don't exist. There's nothing simple or easy about treating mental illness. It's a process and it's physical daunting and frustrating. I had to see my medical doctor every 30 days for the first year because I flagged too high on the might unalive questionnaire. If I didn't make the appointment, I would run out of pills and suffer the detox effects. They would not renew without the appointment. This appointment was not free. Eventually, we were allowed to space them out. If I need to change a med or add med, I had to do multiple 30 follow ups. Pain in the ass and costly. The pills aren't even $1.
