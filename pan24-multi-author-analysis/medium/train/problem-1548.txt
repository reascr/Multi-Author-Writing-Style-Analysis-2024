Im sorry, I didn't mean to imply anything was ok in any way if that's how you took it. That's just how war was, and it was extra terrible for the serfs of the region. There was a war, one country took a county or two of new land after invading. This ruzzian behaviour today is very 18th century, and that is the point I was working toward. The hostile actions were not ok then either, but the people who lived there had very little say of who their masters were. Ukrainians are their own masters now, and forever more. The ruzzians need to move out of the world that existed hundreds of years ago but is not reality today before we shall or even can allow them to live in our modern world again. In the long term they will lose the war and become North Korea. China is surrounding itself with pariah states.
Whenever the world suggests that Ukraine negotiate a settlement with Russia, THIS is the reason why it will never occur so long as Putin is in charge of Russia.
It seems they expected something from meeting like negotiations which didn't happen so they launched revenge plan with probably largest air strike ever on Ukraine.
Ukraine was right at the end of September when they said they would be willing to sit down with Putin's successor.
