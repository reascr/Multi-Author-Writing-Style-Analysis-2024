I fucking absolutely hate the fact that reddit makes fun of Marvel movies for quipping every second and then every comment on every thread is someone making a quip to be funny.
Now further down that thread it says the Kerman regional governor made claims that unused ammunition was detonated in a base about 20km outside of Kerman, which would be quite the ammo stockpile to rattle homes in Kerman itself.

Loud Noises are reported all over the world daily. Sometimes the noises are from the operation of construction machinery. Sometimes to the noises are from cattle body slapping. Doo dah.
