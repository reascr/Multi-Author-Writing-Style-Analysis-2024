We're talking single digit majority here, and a lot of these people's lives were unequivocally put in danger by Donald Trump, so this actually seems possible, but probably a pipe dream. I guess The GOP would have committees if they had the majority, but The Speaker could form her own as well?
But these people all just ran as Republicans on the overall party platform of: 'Fuck Joe Biden,' 'Trump, Guns, Jesus' (and all the hate that entails). Not sure we'd see many pure defections right away, and voting Cheney as speaker is probably approaching pure defection.
And if it did come down to 1 or 2, the more likely result is that control of the chamber flips when a member or two pull a reverse-Lieberman or something.

This same scenario happened in 1923. It went to nine ballots before the renegade Republicans finally voted for the Republican candidate, and only after they were promised concessions.
Should have never said anything about calling Trump on the 6th, Kevin, and you certainly shouldn't have acted as if he had some responsibility to call off his murderous mob. Should have made sure that every person who may have overheard you was ready to fall in line no matter what, but you were all in true peril, so even in that building, it might be hard to find a decent sized group who'd keep totally quiet in those circumstances.
