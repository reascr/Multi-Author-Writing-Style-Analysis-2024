However where Kemp seems to be leaning more towards the center, Desantis has took a nose dive into far right and Trump is in the middle of both. Granted it still remains to be seen but more infighting for Republicans is good.
Kemp is a traditional republican, business first. He's willing to throw red meat to the culture war mob in exchange for their votes but only so long as they know their place.

He just doesn't think he needs to stoop as low. We have more evidence of Kemp being directly involved in election fraud and post-election cover-up than we do from either Trump or DeSantis, and we have plenty of evidence for them.
He seems more moderate than Trump or DeSantis. Desantis also too dropped Trump from his association in Florida which contributed to his win.
My analysis is that if he wanted to be more toward the hard right he'd double down on "republican values". Idk we should wait to see how this progresses.
