Funny, not that long ago there was a series of articles in Russian press propaganda about Yellowstone volcano being close to eruption, thus burying most of the America under ashes. It would be somewhat ironic if that would happen with Russia instead.
Thanks for the scale estimate. As per Wikipedia, A VEI 5 would be comparable St Helens, while a VEI 6 would be Krakatoa-level. Based on its location, either would seem capable of disrupting regional shipping, including petroleum.
This beast has erupted like 60 times in the past 10,000 years and the last few eruptions have been VEI 5-6's, thankfully it is in a fairly remote part of the world, that being said it still can affect air travel if its plume gets high enough.
We got similar pieces about the desert in Iraq producing sandstorms that were said to threaten Europe and such.
it is one of those pieces where the editor went "is there anything else that is scary about Russia we can publish? geography department, you have anything?" And they came up with this.
