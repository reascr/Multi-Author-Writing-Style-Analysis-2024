These headlines over criminal-referrals are simply to drum up public-awareness of what's going on more than anything; for these criminal-referrals from the committee hold no teeth whatsoever and, like you said, the Special Counsel and Garland's investigation(s) are well-ahead of this and are the ones that can actually indict.
