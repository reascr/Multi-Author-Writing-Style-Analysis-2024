Powder cocaine is cocaine +HCl. Basically bonded to a hydrochloric acid molecule. Crack has the HCl removed, making it a base. In the base form it is no longer water soluble, making it only consumable through smoking. It also then hits faster and harder when compared to the HCl version. It could be argued that this higher peak in the blood due to this consumption method leads to higher addiction potential.
The only difference is the population that used powder v rock. In the 70s, 80s & 90â€™s powder was considered a rich, upscale white persons drug that was used to socialize, even though that was a myth.,whereas during that same period of time crack cocaine use was at an all time high and devastated generations of urban POC, much like meth has done to some urban poverty stricken areas of the US. When the US declared a war on drugs it was a war on urban crack addicted POC with all the lasting effects. It was not until the use of opioids began to overtake the use of crack and it began to seriously effect the parents and kids of the upper class suburban areas that it was decided that we had lost the war on drugs and needed to refocus because now it was starting to effect a different group of people.
