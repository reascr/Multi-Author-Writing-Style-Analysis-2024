The theory of both the UN and the Olympics is that by bringing everyone together it fosters a more interconnected world to shed various caricatures of perception.
But that was all constructed prior to the mass media age where it's not the unknown driving people to hate, but moreso the reality.
That said: the UN is where power is supposed to be brokered to prevent war, yet Russia doesn't give a fuck.
At some point these orgs become complicit in normalizing and allowing Russia to think it'll all blow over.
Ukraine will currently call anything short of completely supressing or banning any Russian person, object, idea or item of culture "promoting the war".
Even if the IOC aren't exactly angels, letting Russian athletes compete under a neutral flag is hardly "promoting the war".
Russia won 71 medals in Tokyo Olympics. 45 of them were won by athletes who are also members of the Central Sports Club of the Russian Army.
I don't disagree with that at all, but that's a matter of proper background checks, and, I guess, to find out in what way exactly that "sports club" is tied to the Russian army and their actions in Ukraine, but not one of participation in general.
