While Congress lacks the powers of enforcement, DOJ is already running an antitrust investigation into Ticketmaster/LiveNation. We now have multiple branches of the federal government simultaneously honing in on one company for anticompetitive practices that blatantly violate the terms of its merger, it doesn't seem like they're keen on just letting this one slide.
But isn't the point of govt intervention to ensure that the company being investigated is no longer being illegally dominant? Although MS wasn't broken up, govt involvement allowed everyone else to expand, to the point where Microsoft is not the most valuable computer operating system company and no longer has the most dominant web browser.
While absolutely true that decoupling the browser from the OS was one of the remedies the Justice Department sought, it was far from what the whole case was about. If it was, the precedent would have prevented Apple and Google from building browsers - that you cannot uninstall - into their operating systems. It was the anti-competitive practices Microsoft engaged in that earned them the judgement. Yes, using private OS hooks in IE was a part of that, but leveraging their market share to lock Netscape out of OEM pre-installed software had a lot more to do with it.
