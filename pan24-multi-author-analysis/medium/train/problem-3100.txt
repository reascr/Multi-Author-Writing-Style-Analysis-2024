Yeah. Now. Right. Ours are grown up and I won't get my wife to do it again. We were hurtful poor with our first baby, 22 years ago. Of course, now they do it. I bet, marijuana will be legalized here in germany one day after I died. Fuck this country. Seriously. Many governments are kinda slow, but this one is so slow, a hair more slowly, and they move backwards. The legacy of the Kohl/Merkel time will haunt even the children of our children's children. Oof. I told my kids to get away from here, they were all brought up at least duolingual and they all speak English in parts even better than german. Yes, there are benefits to be born here, you'll never really starve, but what does that actually mean if nobody thinks about the future and everybody just wants more money and even more money. The AFD is getting more and more followers because the other politicians just fail. To do nothing here is more beneficial for them than doing anything and by chance losing a few votes. That greed is so pitiful, it could almost be funny, if it weren't so sad. Nevertheless, at least ONE step into the right direction. 40 years too late, but whatever...
Wonder if part of the incentive isn't genuinely to try get folks in Germany to have more kids. Would make total sense given Germany has a below-replacement birthrate?
