In my opinion - It's too late. This also isn't a matter of us doing it to ourselves. Foreign adversaries have created this mess with a lot of useful idiots and blackmailable officials. There's no 4-D chess being played here our country is on it's way to being rotten to it's core if it isn't there already. The attacks from extremists on critical infrastructure will continue, and our intelligence apparatus will fail us, just like how it did on J6th. We're in free-fall, and the ruling classes attempts at smash and grab white collar robbery and political debauchery are a only symptoms of this.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
