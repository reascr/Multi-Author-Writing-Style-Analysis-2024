This should come as no surprise to anyone. The Cuban government has always, and will always take Russia's side over anything that involves the US. It's the core of their propaganda.
There are many of the older generation, however that truly believe all this crap and support the government, while simultaneously asking themselves why they can't put food on the table. (Usually, the US gets blamed for it, even as those at the top live luxuriously).
But there is one truth that prevails in Cuba: if you disagree with the regime, better keep it to yourself. Should the wrong ears hear you speak against it, you probably won't see the next sunrise.
In retrospect, that's how Castro maintained his grip on power and brainwashed so many. Internet access in Cuba and cellphones have been inaccessible until relatively recently. For most of Castro's regime, all Cubans had as a source of information was national TV and word of mouth from outsiders (family in other countries or tourists).
They expect countries near Russia to stay in fear of Russian invasion rather than ensure their security through joining NATO, so it was wrong of the US & NATO not to appease Russia.
Putin probably gave him some money to help start another Cuban Missile Crisis. It would be the leverage that Russia desperately needs right now, and didnâ€™t the US just vote down rescinding the embargo again?
