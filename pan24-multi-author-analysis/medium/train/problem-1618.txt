Given that the other article was talking about the global 1%, the income threshold is probably a lot lower than you think and would include some of the middle class in developed countries.
credit suisse released a report last year saying that for the first time, not all millionaires (in USD) were in the global 1%, i.e. the threshold for entry into that 1% is over $1m, so no, the middle class of developed nations are not meaningfully included at all.
You understand that millionaire means having a net worth above $1 million, right? That definitely includes middle class people near or in retirement in the US.
$1m USD net worth is the top 6.3% in the UK, and 8% of Americans. That's still rich, not middle class.
also note what i said - the middle classes are not meaningfully included. even if a few people scrape into the top 0.999%, its largely an irrelevance: when we're talking about the top 1%, its not the middle class.
That's the problem with using the 1%. Might as well use the 5% or 10%, because all of them do include the middle class. Organizations like this need to start talking about the 0.1%.
I'm the one providing figures here which justify my saying that, and you're just "nuh urh"ing me without anything to support you at all.
if you're worth over $1m and don't think you're rich, you need to recalibrate how you think about yourself and your status, not the way the world talks about money.
