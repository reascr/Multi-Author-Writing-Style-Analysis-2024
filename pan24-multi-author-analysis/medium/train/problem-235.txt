I always check out /r/conservative to see what their take is on stories like this, but of course, the hardcore curation there doesn't allow stuff like this to be posted. It's all Jerry Springer style "gotcha!" articles based on alternative facts and literal fake news. Every thread is a safe zone, erm, I mean "flaired users only". Once in a blue moon someone will make a rational comment but then they are immediately eaten alive and the McCarthy-style accusations start flying. They cry about "libs brigading" because the idea of tolerating dissent/other opinions is foreign to their cult's structure.
