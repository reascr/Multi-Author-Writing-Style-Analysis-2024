So… army keep “buying” the weapons… but for some reason mobics always get rusted surplus from WW2… where all new guns go?
They are getting both new and surplus old stock right now. Even with the production ramp they don't build enough to meet the current demand.
Eventually they'll catch up but how long that takes depends on how many units they are short. I have no idea how many units they are producing right now but back in 2014 they were able to manufacture in excess of 200,000 rifles a year total.
What else needs to be thought about is most of Russia's weaponry is Soviet era and was made by factories in countries that are no longer part of Russia's territory. Tanks were made in Ukraine for example, so they've had to setup whole new production lines.
They are having this issue across the board though. All Russian defense manufacturers are ramping but they still are not producing enough to meet the demand of the current conflict.
Disclaimer: I do not poses any “special” knowledge, besides been borne in USSR and having pretty good connections to Russia, which give me solid understanding of how Russian “economy” works.
Based on above, I would guess that price of AK47 on international black markets will go down soon due to oversupply.
