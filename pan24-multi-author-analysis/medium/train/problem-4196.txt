I believe the 10 included Harrisburg and upper York under Perry’s tenure, not exactly sure with the new districting. But I live in Lancaster and only ever hear the region referred to as south central PA, don’t really ever hear people refer to it as south east PA, and the 10th was/is more north west than Lancaster.
As someone who also lives in PA, mid state is accurate for State College, but not Harrisburg. Harrisburg is about 100 miles from Philadelphia, and 300 from Ohio. Harrisburg is about 40 miles from Maryland, 300 from New York at the north. Am I wrong, or is the 10th surrounding Harrisburg?
