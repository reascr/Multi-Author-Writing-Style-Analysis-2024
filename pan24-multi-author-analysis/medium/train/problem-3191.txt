Sure, but my point was that it didn't even meet Tagesschau's threshold for having their app display a breaking news notification.
Some people genuinely believe that occupying whatever is the equivalent of the throne will make people obey them.
Yeah this is what I almost find funny about this. Like ok some weapons and terrorist act will surely hand the country into your hands. What even was the plan?
Which is so odd. Maybe it wasn’t sensational enough for mainstream reporting? I can promise you if this was a group of immigrants or brown skinned people plotting the same thing, all our phones would’ve gone bing…a few times.
BBC News deemed this important enough to have its app show a notification, but Tagesschau (German public broadcaster news) didn't.
It's a matter of how Reichsbürger pose a risk in terms of occasional violent acts, which is of course still a serious concern, but it's not an actual threat to the democratic order. Or put differently, imagine you had been planning to overthrow the government, already saw yourself as the future Reichsminister for Matters of Utmost Import, and the media doesn't even consider your attempted coup to have been important enough to make users' phones go "bing".
