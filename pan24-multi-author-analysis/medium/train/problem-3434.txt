I’m not shocked but it’s interesting that Romney signed, I recall how much money and effort the LDS put into blocking California prop 8 a few years back to try and stop gay marriage.
They changed their stance on legal recognition of gay marriage, specifically in terms of this bill as there were protections for "religious liberties" incorporated, but they still do not recognize / approve of gay marriage more broadly. So a win and progress for sure, but not all the way there yet.
I’m surprised we been seeing the Mormon take the side of the Dems a couple times. I still don’t like him but I am surprised he is trying to act as one of the few bipartisan Rs left.
