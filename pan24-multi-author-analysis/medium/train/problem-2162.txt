In a tweet published Monday, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense listed the names of 50 brands that continue to operate in Russia despite the war, which it slammed as "sponsoring a terrorist state." The list includes Abbott, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, P&G, Sanofi and Unilever.
Mostly food and medicine which brings up the ethical issue of is it ok to deprive Russian people (who may have little or no control over this war) of food and medicines which may in some cases be necessary for health.
Most deal with healthcare save for a few. I don't care about the russian government but at least the people should have access to medicine.
ever notice how people only say 'it's just business' when something truly awful is happening and everyone knows it?
"It has been more than 8 years and 8 months since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine, and these companies still haven't left the bloody federation," the ministry wrote, referring to the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2014. "They call it business. We call it sponsoring a terrorist state.".
