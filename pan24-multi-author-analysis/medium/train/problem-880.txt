Also, Brazil is in the top 7 of the largest consumers on earth, it's great both for imports and exports which is something every country needs right now with the inflation we have. Argentina comes in 24, Colombia 32, Chile 41 and Peru 47. Every other South American country is below 60ยบ but it has over 65% of its GDP in consumption. This is the main reason we have inflation in most SA countries right now, they only consume and have nobody to export to because of corruption/horrible lobbying since Lula left the office. Dilma was ok with foreign relations for the 1st term, nothing exceptional, but it went downhill after the 2nd term and the countries were left alone to negotiate. The results are clear as day that most of Latin America has no tact for lobbying like Lula did and included them because it was better for us.
A deal with between the EU and Mercosur has been on the table for so long but never quite seems to materialise. Though this is a good way for Lula to frame it, it would give Mercosur leverage versus the Chinese negotiating position (which is something that's in the EU's interest as well).
