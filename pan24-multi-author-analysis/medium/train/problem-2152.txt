Tbf the article uses the term "confrontation," which doesn't have to be understood in military terms. Saying "conflict" would have been much more problematic.
Until we start sanctioning the leaders of the country individually rather than. The state as a whole, this will continue.

I agree. And this time, we will learn from the mistakes of Iraq and Afghanistan. Focus on eradication of military targets (which can be done primarily by air and sea, boots on the ground should be kept to an absolute minimum), and leave civilian infrastructure completely unharmed (as much as possible). Perhaps a targeted decapitation strike to the Islamic Regime leadership. Afterward, pull out.
We shouldn't stay there and nation-build, and we don't need to. Unlike the Afghanis, the Iranian people actually care about fixing their country and making it better. And with the Islamic Regime eliminated, I expect they will do so quite well. And then, with a secular, fully democratic Iran, they would join the West as a strong and valuable ally in the Middle East.
Nothing would make me happier than seeing Saudi Arabia have a surprised Pikachu face at seeing America pull out all support for them and give it to Iran, their arch-enemy.
