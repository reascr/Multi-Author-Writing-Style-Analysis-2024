Japan's prime minister isn't even pro-LGBT. He was on record of saying Japan needs to be "cautious" about legalizing gay marriage (still illegal there) because of supposed negative effects on the family. Anti-LGBT literature was also privately circulated among politicians of his political party last year, though Abe died shortly after that scandal occurred.
No one has explained to me, logically how gay marriage affects the family dynamic. Gay people are not going to marry straight, at least not without a lot of suffering and ultimately a bad marriage.
The reason why this guy is fired isn't because the government of Japan is pro-LGBGT. It's because you never say the quiet part out loud in Japan.
May be true, but there's still many in these countries that are sadly lumped in with their government's way of thinking. Like when Trump was running the US, he did not at all, speak for me on any of my beliefs. I expect that for many Russians, Chinese, and even Middle Easterners. If the world could simply be peaceful without crazy-ass leadership, I feel like many would prefer it.
