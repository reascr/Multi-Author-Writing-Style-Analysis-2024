The EU sanctions were devastating for the Russian arms industry and a number of Russian oligarchs. That being said the European strategy of targeted sanctions that would only harm oligarchs and industries involved with the takeover of Crimea, without impacting the Russian people, sorta backfired. The Russian authorities simply responded by banning European food, medicines and machinery, which both harmed the European export economy and made Russian peoples’ lives more miserable while still being possible to blame on Europe. Now in terms of extra backfiring many corporations countered this by simply manufacturing for the Russian market in Russia and smuggling in whatever couldn’t be locally produced through China or Central Asia. This in part is why many Western companies that "pulled out" of Russia really just sold their local subsidiaries to a Russian replacement.
It made an impression on me that on multiple occasions before and shortly after the invasion people in the Russian government accused the Ukranian leadership of taking drugs. It seemed a really bizarre accusation me and I immediately wondered if drug abuse was perhaps rampant in the Russian government.
