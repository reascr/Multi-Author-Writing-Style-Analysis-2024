Yeah Ukraine should just bend over and take some Russian peace I’ve been reading lately about the events that led to WW2 starting and placating Germany by allowing them to take over Czechoslovakia without a shot being fired just emboldened them to invade Poland and other countries. It’s unfortunate that Russia has displayed the same tactics with regards to Chechnya, Georgia and the Crimean annexation. Their military isn’t all it’s cracked up to be so one wonders if the Ukraine invasion would have come to pass if Russia had been held accountable earlier on. Unfortunately the US had other concerns since 9/11 and Chechnya and Georgia were strategically not worth much to US interests.
USA has practiced plausable deniability, meaning it is not 100% clear what exactly would happen if a conflict happens. But US and its allies having success in helping ukraine means, the US will likely be more proactive and more confident in the taiwan question.
There’s the Taiwan Relations Act where the US says that it’ll come to Taiwan’s aid. However, that aid has never been officially defined.
A Taiwan Policy Act has been introduced, but hasn’t been made law. It would designate Taiwan as an ally.
