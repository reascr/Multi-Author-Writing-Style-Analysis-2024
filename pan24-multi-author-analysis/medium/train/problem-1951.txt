I know that this is probably just a move by the gop to discredit young influencers and make everyone who tells young people to vote, look like Chinese paid agents.

But the amount of data collected by TikTok is truly concerning. Sadly, these soulless opportunists will just make it another whataboutism.
We don't actually know that TikTok is delivering that data to the CCP. There are something like 13 trackers and 12 of them are third party trackers and we don't know where they are sending the data they collect. It could be sent to China, but it's equally likely being sent to advertisers or the NSA.
We don't always know with whom they're sharing! If I can slap together a certain person to target ads to, and get them to click a link or read an article I can funnel them to the CCP, or Putin or wherever.
