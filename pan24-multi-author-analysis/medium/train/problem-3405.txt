Hogan has been anti-Trump since my favorite part of the shit show, when he was absolutely certain MD would get the FBI headquarters because he was such a good little Republican. Like one day after the inauguration Trump said lol fuck you and cancelled the entire move. So the nicest thing I can say about Hogan is he recognized where he was governing and didn't like having his face eaten, and gently frowned at Trump for 4 years.
