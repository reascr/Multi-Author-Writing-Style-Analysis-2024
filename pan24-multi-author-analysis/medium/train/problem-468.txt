I would agree most of the time especially in private industry but a lot of public service jobs are going to need strike restrictions or else they could potentially cause a mass loss of life. It’s why it’s illegal for cops to strike and heavy restrictions on nurses unions. Teaching is a lot different and the main reason is that the public treats them like childcare instead of people responsible for our future. Had an old teacher reach out saying they got a 2% raise last year which is fucked all thing’s considering.
