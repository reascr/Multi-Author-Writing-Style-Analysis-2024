Because, while they screamed about the economy & gas prices for a year, they never had any plan that could address those. They do not care about legislating. They do not care about governing. They only care about scaring people to stay in power, and attacking people who are unpopular, because that also helps them stay in power with their bigoted, xenophobic and homophobic base. They are bottom feeders of the same type as George Santos. Their only gripe with him is that his lies are too easy to spot.

"But that's stupid. What do the froggies have to do with the changing climate? It hurts them most of all The froggies didn't make anyone poor, they live in the marshes I'm starting to think that these idiots just scream 'froggies, froggies' and hope that's all people think about. They've never even talked to a froggie, or the torties, or even us I bet when they stub their toe, they still shout 'those damn froggies'".
