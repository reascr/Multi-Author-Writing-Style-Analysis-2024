Ten years ago the Ukrainian government made a decision based on staying close to Russia and their ideals instead of an economic decision to become closer to Europe. Then the citizens of Ukraine got rid of that government and now they aren’t just economically tied to Europe but ideologically too. It isn’t as black as white as ‘lol economics will never affect russias decisions’ hell they are losing this war so badly partly because of their economic circumstances. I don’t know how anyone looks at this situation and thinks Putin is playing some 4d chess that Europe can’t understand… I think it’s pretty clear that Europe is the powerhouse and it is putin who misjudged and misunderstood Europe, and it is much more costly for him to misunderstand Europe than it is for Europe to misunderstand him who. It is less like putin is a mastermind and Europe a victim, more like Europe is a parent tired of dealing with the little stroppy boy that is putin.
The Russian Military Industry can't keep up with the war demand and Putin won't stand for any pathetic excuses like "We can't source parts because of sanctions", or "We're broke", or "You sent most of our trained machinists to the front and they're now all dead or defected".
