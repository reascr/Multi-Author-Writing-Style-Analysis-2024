Well it's not just that he just Spat in a fan and then wanted to build a wall. The Fan was going crazy at edge of the stage so Waters spat on him in disgust, and then became more disgusted because the Fan liked it and started going crazier. Fan is short for "Fanatic" after all, and Waters then kinda dissociated and realised these huge stadium concerts (vs the small private venues they used to play at) were basically akin to Nuremberg rallies, that the masses would just blindly cheer everything the people on stage did and follow them, even if the people on stage were just random people I masks (which is what the band would do at wall concerts, send out other people in masks for parts of it). And so Waters wanted to build a wall and just hide away from all that, and that ultimately led to the Wall as a concept album.
I mean, Waters wrote a bunch of anti war songs (a lot more than Gilmour) and his own dad was killed by facists. Yet he still somehow ended up as a Putin and Hamas supporter.
Trust me, it's not about supporting Putin or Hamas on their own merits, but rather supporting anyone the US doesn't like because he thinks the US is the root of all evil in the world.
