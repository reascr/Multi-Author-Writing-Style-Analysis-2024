The question is, if the west is now really willing to support a offensive ukrainian army. That would mean providing planes for air support and alot more tanks.
Which means they had already begun training the crews before they publicly said they would send the tanks. I'm expecting and hoping we'll see air power following really soon.
Yes it's starting to make sense why Ukrainians have been allowed to die waiting. It was to give them time to train on these systems. Most likely they are finishing aircraft training as well. The political battles are separate from the military, the training has most likely already been completed.
It was estimated that it would take 6 weeks to train Ukrainians on modern MBTs, if they had prior tank experience. I don't see how starting training at the end of January is incompatible with sending tanks in late March/early April.
But i have my doubts if the german/US-government is really willing and political able to provide such capabilities in a meaningful way. The 50, or what, tanks the west promised till the end of the year arent even close to the 300 Tanks ukrainian Military asked for to do thier job.
The benefit would be, that an Ukrainian Army, with offensive capablities, could cut the russian supply lines into occupied territories - shortening this war, by forcing Putin into negotiations.
