The goal of increasing nukes isn't to "survive" a nuclear war if it happens, it's to have enough nukes that, in the event it happens, guarantee to annihilate all your enemies, even after factoring in all the contingencies that can happen in the fog of war. If some (or even most) of your nukes are destroyed in their silos in an enemy first strike, and of the rest, some fail to launch, some are refused to be launched by rebel/dissenting officers, some are shot down in-flight, some fail to detonate or fizzle, some mistakenly attack the wrong target or the same target twice, some are left in reserve for second-strikes or any allies that might join the enemy... there's still enough left over to destroy one, or several, opposing superpowers. And not just a few cities (which hypothetically could be seen as "survivable casualties"), but to wreck the whole country so thoroughly, there will be nothing left resembling a nation-state in a military or economic sense for the foreseeable future.
If they didn't have Nukes then all of the countries supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself probably wouldn't have to add the stipulation of not attacking Russia back with said weapons.
