E: Sarcasm aside, what you're talking about is a fundamental change to a 200+ year old system. I have worked for gigantic corporations in the past and currently do as well. Even with a unified leadership and a clearly defined plan, they tend to make aircraft carriers look nimble, so a significant change, even with full buy-in, takes a long time to execute. That's with an S&P 400 company. The country is exponentially larger and is far from unified in terms of leadership and the population. It would be generous to call what you proposed a concept when it's closer to fantasy.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
