The GQPers are never going to change their votes unless all their demands are met, which are mad, and would cause even more discord in their party and bring the speaker up for vote quickly.

Holy shit man, bow out lol. No one’s gonna have reverence for the leadership of the most undesired Speaker in House history. Besides, if I forced a girl to reject me this many times I’d be legally required to tell my neighbors about it.
He's promising things that would instantly cripple the House should they take effect. At this point a McCarthy speakership would be just as (if not more) chaotic than what's going on right now.
The democrats seemed to have learned that making deals with the GOP makes no sense as they'll never honour them.
So that leaves, what, enough republicans leaving and not voting so that Jeffries gets in? The democrats actually buckle and 'compromise' with the GOP which will come back to bite them in the ass?
If Dem's never (rightly) compromise and the GQP never compromises, then realistically there can not be a speaker right?
