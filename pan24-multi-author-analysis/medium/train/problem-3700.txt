Of the potential candidates, Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and Ankara mayor Mansur Yavas are probably the strongest candidates. CHP party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu is another strong possibility.
Not all of the opposing parties, the main Kurdish party (the HDP) is sitting on the outside of the alliance, though it is probably quietly supporting it.
Turkish voters are very nationalist, and any independent Kurdish representation gets inevitably accused of links with the PKK, so letting the HDP formally into the alliance would be electoral suicide.
There’s an alliance of six parties that are planning to put out a joint candidate to oppose Erdogan, but it’s not clear who they’ll pick yet.
I would definitely vote for an inanimate object over a dictator. The inanimate object would just not get anything done, which is clearly better. Any and all actions taken by an authoritarian like Erdogan are self-serving, so they rarely do any good for their people.
show him losing to several different candidates, and I don’t think recent events will boost his chances.
If he wins, it will probably be because he cheated in some way. Since his party controls the Electoral Committee, they could probably get away with a lot of fuckery short of outright fraud.
