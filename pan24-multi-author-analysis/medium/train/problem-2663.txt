The Biden administration is finalizing plans to send US-made Abrams tanks to Ukraine and could make an announcement as soon as this week, according to three US officials familiar with the deliberations.
The timing around the actual delivery of the tanks is still unclear and it normally takes several months to train troops to use the tanks effectively, officials said.
An announcement about the tanks could be part of an attempt to break a diplomatic logjam with Germany, which indicated to the US last week that it would not send its Leopard tanks to Ukraine unless the US also agreed to send its M1 Abrams tanks.
Der Spiegel reported today Germany will not object to sending tanks by Poland and will also send tanks themselves.
Does the Abrams not need huge logistics for it to operate which would be difficult for Ukraine? Sincere question about an article I read months ago.
But there are a very large number of countries around Ukraine that field and service the leopard. So hypothetically while the Abrams logistics are being figured out countries can focus on getting Ukraine set up and using leopards.
There are also questions of air superiority, training on more advanced systems than are present on Leopard designs, and how the limited number of M1â€™s will fit into an armored combat doctrine that has traditionally been built around the technological parameters of Russian designed armored vehicles.
