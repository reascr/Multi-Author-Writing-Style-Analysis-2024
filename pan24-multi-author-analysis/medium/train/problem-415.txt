this is exactly what was happening in late February early march. every "ceasefire" theyd just stop firing but move up and surround their next target. and break the ceasefire.
They could just leave. Negotiations won't do them any good, so there is no reason to show up. (they won't want to pay reparations, and realistically that is all they get).. North and South Korea are still at war even though realistically the war ended more than 70 years ago.
Honestly I expect that to be what happens here. Russia is unlikely to be able to hold any terrify in the face of Ukraine attacks, but Ukraine won't attack Russia. Since Russia has nothing to gain from surrendering they won't, just continue to claim the land is theirs while being unable to do anything about it.
In general Ukraine isn't going to attack Russia, other that military targets that are attacking them, they won't be able to force Russia to agree to anything. Though if Russia persists in attacking Ukrainian cities eventually the world may give up and allow Ukraine to attack.
