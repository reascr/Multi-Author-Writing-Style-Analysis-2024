And no one goes "I like my beaches with more bottles washing ashore", or goes "smell that mountain air, smoggy just how I like it", or points to a landfill and thinks isn't that just lovely we should have more of those around.
People that profit off those processes and pay to avoid their consequences have done an amazing job convincing people fixing those things be bad for them.
Green solutions would ruin the life of millions if not billions. We already see it with gas prizes driving people to homelessness and thats a relatively small "change".
Again no one believes climate change anymore. Shut the fuck up about it holy shit. Its just letting wierd fucking bigots into governments cause people are tired of this doomsday cult.
These the same gas companies that earned $205 BILLION in profits for 2021 all while being government subsidized? Amazing that them making "a relatively small change" to their pricing, I assume for entirely nice reasons, is causing people to go homeless. Almost makes you think we should do something to, idk compete with that to make sure they're not driving people to that or is them making $200 BILLION just not enough for you? Are those execs just hurting too much and they had to make those price changes?
You've elegantly supported my point, the rich make you think the systems that support their wealth and deny it to the world are valid.
There is also shit like green parties shutting down nucelar power and replacing it with super unpopular wind shit that doesn't work half the time.
It's much dirtier than that. It's all about the money. In Brazil there's lots of money involved in the cattle industry and that has been why they've been cutting down the amazon down Bolsonaro. I can't say how it will be under Lula.
Green parties haveade sure that's impossible. They are a bunch of upper class asshats that have destroyed the lives of millions. All to reach some vague goal and avoid some "apocalypse".
