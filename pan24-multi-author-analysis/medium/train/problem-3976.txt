There's a big difference between "I feel like there's a lack of evidence to support that it was strictly a war crime, but it happened" vs "YOU JEWS NEVER HAD GENOCIDE PROBLEMS STUPID JEW JEW JEW JEW".
When you're with your family or friends inside your home you can deny the holocaust, war crimes, everything you like. When you are on a stage and try to incite violence by denying those things you're going to get charged.
I think that these things are way more important and rightfully outlawed than having to pay a fine for showing your boobs in public which is also part of freedom of expression. Every country has it's own rules, it has nothing to do with thought crimes or not able to speak your mind but it's about vile content which is only spoken to divide and sow hatred.
I know that my american friends have a completely different take on freedom of speech and what one should be allowed to say but germany has long standing laws against those types of language and in my opinion rightfully so. Apart from all of that, it's also in compliance with EU law.
When I look at the global germany is in the top percentile and I don't think a law which goes against inciting hatred and violence will take any of those freedoms away but in the end will add to it.
