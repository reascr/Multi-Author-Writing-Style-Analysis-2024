Bro every war and Invasion US started was a business, this one you didnt started but its good for you for the reasons i said, i mean its logic, its good for you if Russia doesnt fulfill their goals, as for weapons corporations in US, they are big deal of your politics because they are the ones funding campaigns for your politicans, they are maybe the biggest reason why you invaded Iraq, Afghanistan or any other country, war is business.
Because they are selling weapons to Ukraine and other European countries, war is a profit and when your enemy is fighting you make sure they keep fighting.
Well, if he really is going to fight to the last man then it won't matter if conservatives win or not. The point of not wanting conservatives win is that conservatives might pull out funding and then Putin won't have to.
They will have to eventually. 100k are probably dead or terribly wounded. Eventually this issue will become front and center for the rest of the planet. Unless of course conservatives get too much power. In that case Putin can fight to the last man which is the only way he can win.
