I appreciate your comment here. But I must disagree. One of the defining features of the OT was the eradication of the local populace upon the Israelites entry and conquest of the Promised Land. It wasn't just they were going to take control and then try to live peacefully with Canaanites, Edomites, Hittites, etc. Moses commanded them to destroy every last vestige of them, their culture, religion, history, etc. Complete and utter annihilation, even as a memory. Those tribes attacked and killed were nothing more than indigenous peoples living where the Israelites decided to go.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
