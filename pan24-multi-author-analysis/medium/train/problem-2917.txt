I'd just want to add to this because while right on the surface, it's not completely accurate. Many Bulgarians, young and old, absolutely despise Russia. Many of them though moved to Western Europe in the 90s and are just starting to return. But even then, the "old" cohort that is pro-Russian is really old, the cut-off is generally around 50. People who integrated well into the capitalist economy, people whose family had their property stolen by the communists, people who had family members killed by the DS or fled abroad, liberal activists and politicians etc. hate Russia like no other. Some of the biggest opponents to Russian influence in Europe are Bulgarian and there's a reason people like Petkov and Vasilev too charge of getting the rest of the EU to respond at the start of the war. Pro-Russian parties get about 20% of the vote every election, they've never been the majority. For most of us Russia is what destroyed our country's potential.
The USA carried on selling military vehicles to Nazi Germany for months after they declared war on them. It takes time for all the gears in such big and complex economies to shift.
