every one since 2020 knows that the smites (Arabs and jews) are forming a union because they understand the broader scheme , that is combating iran.
Not really, Trump and Netanyahu arranged a peace agreement between Israel and the UAE, they are friends now.
Trump and Netanyahu really didn't get any credit for this breakthrough in bringing peace between Israel and the Arab world.

You're overstating the Abraham Accords. While it was a historical breakthrough in normalizing relations between Israel and many Arab countries, it didnt "bring peace to the middle east." The Palestinian question is still unanswered, and the Accords clearly favored Israeli interests there, which is why the Palestinians didnt show up to sign. But it certainly warmed Israeli-Arab relations overall.
