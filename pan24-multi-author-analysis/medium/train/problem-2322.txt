In that book there's a soldiers prayer with a line that's famous here that went "please also look after our leaders so they wouldn't hit their heads into a Karelian pine tree for a second time." Well Russia has been hitting their collective heads in trees throughout their history and haven't learned anything.
Zelenskyy: "A year ago, on this day, from this very place, at about 7 in the morning, I addressed you with a short statement. It contained the two most important things. That Russia started a full-scale war against us. And that we will defeat everyone. The longest day of our lives.Â We woke up early and haven't fallen asleep since. We didn't know what would happen tomorrow, but we realized for sure: every tomorrow is worth fighting for!".
"I thank all of our partners, allies and friends who have stood side by side with us throughout the year./I want to address our citizens who are now under temporary occupation. Ukraine has not abandoned you, has not given up on you. One way or another, we will liberate all our lands.".
