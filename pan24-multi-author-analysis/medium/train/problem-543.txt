It was already the biggest single electricity source in the past and even by a larger margin than October 2022. I could find data from February 2018, where it was already the single biggest source and many times between then and now. Nothing new here.
Ireland is quite a windy place, so I'm surprised they don't have more. Perhaps once the Celtic Interconnector is complete, they'll be able to expand even more without needing to shut down turbines on particularly windy days, by selling the surplus to the Continent.
It's only the second time this year that it's been the single biggest source after February 2022 but larger % than ever.
I love my state of Iowa, we will produce likely over 60% of our electric energy from wind alone this year, last year was 57%. People complain it's not reliable like down in texas when they had blackouts. I've lost power three times in the last 20 years, the first it was when a tornado came through and was at work we still ran off backup power working from the basement till main power came back after an hour, the second time it was out for 5 minutes during a blizzard, the third it was out for 20 minutes also during a blizzard. Reliability comes down to maintenance, upgrading and redundancy all of which texas lacks. My utility company does an amazing job and personally think costs are very reasonable with the service they provide.
