The main thing is none of this actually matters that much. They can't find ICWA placements, the need is so much higher than the number of foster or adoptive families its just really a dumb ritual 99.9% of the time trying to find an ICWA placements for the kids. All the lawyers involved pretend maybe well.find one someday because that's the law and they have to mention it but nobody ever gets an ICWA placement unless it's family. There are not thousands of stable native families with room for kids that are not already being used, not that there are zero people helping but their capacity is tapped the second they enter the system. Even the quiver full evangelicals that want to convert the world aren't enough to help all the kids, you can't adopt 12 kids. Being stuck in care for a long time is not good for the kids. Indian kids often get stuck in foster care situations for longer than kids of other races even if their foster family is willing to adopt because they're legally not allowed to.
