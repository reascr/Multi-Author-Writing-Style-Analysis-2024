not really. There was a case of one girl dying I think. Most people who die by tidepod are elderly senile people who mistake them for pills... which actually is a problem. The tidepod challenge was never really a killer. People did dumb shit before tiktok and will do it after it as well.
I have a friend who is in HR of her company & she actually received a resume with words written like "skillz, ty, enuf, tho" Like what the actual fuck? I text with the best of them but that shit stays on my screen!
I'm autistic as it gets and this /s thing fucking pisses me off, and absolutely kills any humor left on this internet.
This annoying trend of a person being required to state that what he/she is saying is a joke or sarcasm originally started on TikTok afaik, so that people with autism or other conditions who are unable to detect sincerity don't feel confused, ditto with being required to c3nsor alm0st anythng "triggering", a carryover from Tumblr.
Edit: I know that this /s thing is not new, but it was not until around 2019 when its current incarnation returned in full-force on reddit and elsewhere due to the influence of TikTok and the Tumblr refugees who fled to Twitter.
I know, this is why I called it a trend, not an invention, it wasn't until 2019 that all jokes on reddit started to be written with a /s, and when YouTube rules became even more strict.
So that even serious adult-centric videos have to censor the most basic of words like "death" or "war" to avoid being demonetized, this forced infantilization of social media is terrifying in my opinion.
This /s thing is old, sure, but go read any reddit thread from before 2017 and try to find people who are telling jokes with this /s thing - they aren't, this is a new trend.
On the flip side, it's annoying af to get downvotes & ridiculed in following comments bc some dipshits can't tell a joke from their asshole.
