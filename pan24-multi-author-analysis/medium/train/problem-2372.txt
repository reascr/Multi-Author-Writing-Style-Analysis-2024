I can only guess their some numbers that we need to have to be a "Recession" but what I've been seeing around me for the last year has made me feel like it's 2006 all over again.
We have been needing to do this for decades because this is how a recession starts. Eventually it will become so bad that the poor can't afford anything, and the rich don't want to spend anything, and we will be right back in the 2008 recession again.
This receciom we are going into is just the aftermath of 2008 delayed 15 years from money printing, everything in the system is catching up right now to what shouldâ€™ve happened 20 years ago.
