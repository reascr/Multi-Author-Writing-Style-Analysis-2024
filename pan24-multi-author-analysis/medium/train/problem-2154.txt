Trudeau is shown not abiding by normal political discourse. The thing is oftentimes talks are a form of negotiation, nothing is settled yet. But by leaking everything prematurely, media can spin thing positively/negatively as well as spread fake news (whether intentional or not).
" Trudeau, who interrupts Xi, responds by highlighting the importance of "free and open" dialogue in Canada and the freedom of the press.
"In Canada, We believe in free and open and frank dialogue and that is what we will continue to have," Trudeau says. "We will continue to look to work constructively together but there will be things we will disagree on."".
Just look at the 2 killed in Poland. Without evidence media was already hinting at Russia doing it, then day later it was discovered it was Ukraine's bomb that killed the 2 Polish residents.
I'm not a Harper stan by an stretch of the imagination, but the guy who said "I guess I'll shake your hand but I have only one thing to say to you: You need to get out of Ukraine" right to Putin's face would drop to his knees?
