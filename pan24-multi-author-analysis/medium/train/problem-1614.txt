“Up to 40% of the capital district is underwater at high tide, and the entire country is forecast to be under water by the end of the century.
Kofe said he hoped the creation of a digital nation would allow Tuvalu to continue to function as a state even if it becomes completely submerged.”.
The local sea level here is rising by 1mm per year... when I studied business a well regarding climate science book said it was going to be between .5m and 1.5m by end of this century...
The data says somewhere between 0mm and 6mm pa for tuvalu depending on what set you read... worst case that's 720mm in 80years... we have engineers for that.
My point is, even 0.5m, or 0.72m, is a lot for a coastal cities when you think of how most of them aren't that much higher than sea level. Are they supposed to put a big wall around their entire country? What happens when it rains?
Well shit. Dark future when you have to start 3D mapping your country so your ancestors can visit it 80 years later because it’ll be gone.
If you consider between 0mm and 6mm per annum being "swallowed" then I guess you can get worried on their behalf.
You can read the words, but you can’t understand what they’re saying. It’s true that the amount by which it will rise is not much, but for places already at or near sea level, it does not take much to submerge them because they’re already so close.
We use engineering solutions across the world to deal with endless issues, with success, every fucking day.
I hope one day when you realise the world is way more nuanced than you seem to think it is and the doom and gloom has not come true, you will remember this interaction.
You fail to understand that we adapt and change. The sea has been higher before and will be again. This is a fucking tiny island and using it as some "panic now" motive is just hyperbolic.
Just because you have been propagandised/manipulated into believing the world is ending doesn't actually mean it is.
