I don't think most people understand heroin addicts or heroin addiction, IMO morphine is not even that good of a pain killer, it shifts the mind set of people, it does diminishes pain but it makes you "feel good" and that is what's dangerous, especially if there's history of depression or shit like that, the "makes you feel good" becomes stronger. So if you know anybody going through that shit and you have the balls to stand by them do it, without methadone they will need You.
It's fine, the cartels will just offset the shortage with cheap and readily available fentanyl the way they have in the states. That's gone swimmingly so there's nothing to worry about.
__The Swiss Society of Addiction Medicine (SSAM) has warned of a possible shortage of methadone tablets in the coming weeks. It is therefore calling for the importing of these tablets to be simplified.__.
Importing from abroad is currently very expensive, Enea Martinelli, a hospital pharmacist and board member of the pharmacist association pharmaSuisse, told SRF. Each authorisation costs around CHF200 ($215) and applications can only be made individually, he said.
The shortage affects 9,000 people in Switzerland, addiction specialist Thilo Beck told Swiss public radio, SRF, on Thursday. Methadone is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a vital drug for the treatment of people addicted to opiates, such as heroin, he said. “The existence of these people is threatened,” Beck said.
