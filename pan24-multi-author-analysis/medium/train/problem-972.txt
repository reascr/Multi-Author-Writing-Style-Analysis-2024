Ohio is different in that the Amendment that voters passed has no way to enforce anti-gerrymandering actions. All the commission that the Amendment sets up is be deadlocked, have a Republican break the tie, send the map to the Courts who can send it back to the commission, and the process repeats itself until the commission runs out the clock. The Ohio Supreme Court doesn't actually have the power to draw their own fair maps. I think Wisconsin's can if it wants.
They do have a Supreme Court election next year that could determine control of the Court, iirc. If the Democrats control the Court they could challenge the state maps and get them redrawn.
