My own experience around classified information has been that the government definitely over classifies a lot of documentation, but given we live in a digital age, accessing that information should be exclusively limited to specific devices in specific areas, keylogged to the user accessing them. Printing and taking those documents home should be completely impossible/illegal. I can’t take patient medical records home with me from the VA, and every document access and interaction, only possible in specific areas in the facility, is logged and tracked. Its frankly insultingly stupid that we haven’t already implemented similar policies for our leadership, especially given they’ve demonstrated a complete lack in trustworthiness and competence, while entrusted with knowledge that could seriously harm their and other’s constituents.
And there was that time we flew a payload of nuke's over multiple major cities because someone forgot to empty a bomber's bomb bay after a transport mission (that had a far safer flight plan). And it wasn't even that long ago, the closing year's of the Obama admin.
