I used to live in Spain, and as an Estranjero I joined the Spanish Socialist Party PSOE more than 10 years ago. I decided to leave the party today. I can’t be a member of a party who treats animals like dirt just because of being afraid of losing votes in rural areas because of the Spanish Hunting association. It’s over PSOE.
More abused Galgos getting clubbed to death, starved, or abandoned. They're viewed as only being "good" for one to two seasons, then the owners abandon or kill them. It's monstrous.
The law is absolutely nuts. Nothing like it exists in any country in the world. Some of it is great. A lot of it is totally crazy and stupid and it would not apply in any civilized country to any animals. Not hunting dogs, or any other working animals or pets.
I really like Hiking in Spain, and many times I did encounter, some sheds houses with 10 to 20 dogs crying and barking in desperation, living in horrible conditions. And nothing is done about it.
All was needed was a reasonable well worded law that helps animals. They tried to go way too far with lots of ignorance and extremist views. As a result, which would be excellent news for all animals has turned into bullshit and none of it will apply to hunting dogs, while sone of it would be crucial….
