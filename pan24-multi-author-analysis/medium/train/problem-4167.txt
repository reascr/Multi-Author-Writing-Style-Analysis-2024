Yes they are at fault, but context matters and they consequences change depending on it. Firing on Poland and firing on Ukraine and hitting Poland by accident are 2 diferrent things.
I doesn't make sense that Russia did this on purpose (if they even did it in the first place). You don't risk a war with NATO over something like this... Of course, the possibility exists, but it just doesn't make sense.
russians are not dumb enough to attack NATO country when they can continue destroying Ukrainian infrastructure.
and Ukrainians are not dumb enough to attempt a false flag operation with AD missiles which would leave wrecks after an explosion.
it's either a Ukrainian AD missile that malfunctioned(which is most likely what happened), did not self-destruct, and continued to fly until it hit the ground, or it was russian cruise missile(but we don't need to know) that went astray after an unsuccessful attempt of shooting it down. like happened in Moldova around a month ago. in either case, it was unintentional.
