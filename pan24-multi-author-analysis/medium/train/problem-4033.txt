"Maxim Grishin, a Russian-born Akhmat MMA fighter, was scheduled to fight in Las Vegas on Nov. 5, but his bout was abruptly canceled just days ahead of the bout. Grishin said in an interview with a Russian news outlet that he struggled to secure a visa.".
Wouldn't let me read the article but I'm assuming the sanctions forced him to spend more time with his "buddies". Case closed, all wrongdoing cleared /s.
Khabib is akward around Khabib, he has no choice. Meanwhile Chimaev acts like his best friend. Kadyrov even sent his helicopter for Chimaev's wedding photo/video shoot.
Yeah but you don't see mexicans fighters suck on the cartels like khabib suck on kadyrov , he's an extremist and think like kadyrov and such . Few days before he was seen with Zakir Naik ( you should look into him) another terrorist weirdo who's good friend with khabib .
Even before the UFC he had shady ties with notorious billionaire who invested in khabib and his team , a guy that's now facing 20 years of prison due to scams and human traffic .
Khabib is also notorious for sending his goons after fighters ( like colby ) or even regular civilians : he send his buttboys literaly beat up a russian rapper because he made fun of him in a song .
He's also really ok with terrorists , in france few years ago a professor was decapitated in the street by a russian muslim for showing a picture of the prophet in class . Khabib basicly said that he deserved it and trashed france for supporting this professor .
He's a really good fighter but you guys need to stop defending him , he's clearly extremist and have the same view of the world as kadyrov , daesh and such .
