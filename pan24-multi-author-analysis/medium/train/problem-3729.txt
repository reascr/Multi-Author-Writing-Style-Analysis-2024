I’d prefer Dems to hold the house but if it’s a 1-2 seat majority then you’ve still got the potential for a few defectors to help get things done (or not done in the case of bullshit impeachment hearings. Think about how frustrating Sinema and Manchin have been in the Senate and then imagine 218 of them running around on the Republican side. It won’t be as good as a democratic majority but it might prevent things like disbanding the Jan 6 committee.
I hearby announce my bid for Kevin McCarthy to eat a dick. Every time he talks in front of people he sounds like a terrible actor, he’s so disingenuous and doesn’t seem to have any actual principles he believes in other than republicans either controlling power, or voting against everything democrats want. Like not an ounce of contrition or willingness to compromise.
I don’t understand people complaining about nothing ever getting done in government, and then voting for people who refuse to compromise to get things done. Fuck the tea party for making obstinate obstructionism a party virtue.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I third. Started with Gingrich though. And the right wing radio “revolution” headed by noted scumbag Rush Limbaugh. And forwarded by idiots like Sean Hannity. Who looks like face sloppily drawn on a thumb.
