It’s not a hard concept to understand. Trump should be crucified for his handling of classified documents, elevated in severity due to the nature and circumstances surrounding it. But that doesn’t mean this isn’t terrible either. That’s not whataboutism. These are classified documents. If it were you or I it wouldn’t be whataboutism. We’d be in jail. Full stop. Anyone who has had experience handling these docs know it doesn’t care for a persons politics. The chain of custody for these types of things are a big fucking deal. And Biden should also answer for it. Also, wtf is going on where Classified docs are hanging out in random places. There needs to be a better process for this. Maybe it’s just me but this is un-fucking-sat.
