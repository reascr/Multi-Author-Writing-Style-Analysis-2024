You are hearing what he's saying with the liberal reality-based definition of the phrase "free speech". it's a word that has a completely different meaning to the right, and they understand him perfectly.
Edit: Particularly the fact that he is doing all of this, and is being cheered on for it, because of an “out” group (LGBTQ). Fascism redirects societies frustrations at economic conditions, and government failure into another group. So people will call them “patriots” as they dismantle the legal system that protects democracy, and not ask why their representatives aren’t doing anything to fix the issues that are truly causing their frustration. Fascism plays into nationalism and populism, but is always backed by big money. It’s their yolo. They’d rather destroy the current system, rather than concede any wealth or power to economic reform.
Fascism is more a means of taking power, which requires certain economic and governing conditions (failure of government and regulatory agencies). The result of fascism is often autocracy, oligarchy, or something in-between. What is fascist about this is the messaging, money, and special interests allowing people like DeSantis to gain popularity, and power.
Why Putin is a fascist. Why Donald Trump is a fascist. Why Donald admires Putin. And it's why DeSantis is a fascist.
