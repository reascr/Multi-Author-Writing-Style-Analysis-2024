Lol, this is Reddit. As soon as he hadn’t put the /s he would’ve got the downvote brigade, because the first few idiots took him seriously and the rest of Reddit just saw a negative comment and decided to go with the flow without deciding for themselves if there was intended sarcasm.
It would be a pitty if Lavrov, Medvedev, and Putin had to spend the rest of their days constantly looking over their shoulders and worrying if that moment was going to be their last simply because Russia, in its unwavering descent into absolute stupidity, went and trained and motivated enough citizens to eventually overthrough them. /s.
I agree. There are no 'men of steel.' WW II vets regularly broke down and sobbed when recalling the war, and not just because of their 'buddies.' War is horror, pure horror. Only a sociopath wants it or thrives in it.
Not that simple when the guy next you is there to make sure you do your job.. people in the rear or these blocking groups would be people with the most to lose.. either family members or something else.
