It’s also because these states have huge cities with huge economies and lots of executives and the like, who are all super buddy-buddy with the state to get as many kickbacks as they can, so we end up with a lot of corporatists.

Frankly, Hochul has always been somewhat… suspicious. She was endorsed by the NRA, for example - which is very strange for a democrat. During covid, she made enemies in the state because she was trying to basicaly force everything back open ASAP and telling people it was time to stop working from home, because their commute fueled the economy. She also was involved in a retaliatory firing where someone at an organization within the state tried to whistleblow a suspicious deal, so they were fired.
