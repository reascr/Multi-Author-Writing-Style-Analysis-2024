I'd imagine that made it a bit too real for his liking. He absolutely knows the West are desperate to avoid a nuclear war. Hearing 'we don't need to, we'll end your military in a week anyway' is a bit of a wake up call. He probably also worries that the 1st volley is simply shot down and then he'll have to justify sending more.
Yeah, Medvedev gets rolled out on a two-wheel cart and propped up in front of a microphone whenever the Kremlin wants to say its most ridiculous shit.
He serves a purpose. He is an opiate for a very rowdy subset of Russians(hard-liners) and additionally sows confusion and fear(though this doesn't land like they think it does) by letting the west hear his speeches as well.
Russia has cooled down a bit with the nuclear threats since the US gave them a talking to some months ago. They still make them but not as frequently.
He knows firing nukes back is the last thing anyone wants to do. Wiping out their military with conventional weapons is a lower bar than nuclear war and he's seen how much weaker his military is than he expected. It was an excellent threat to make.
Each level of escalation risks the West rapidly taking out their bases, wiping out all military targets in Ukraine, and perhaps also in Russia.
