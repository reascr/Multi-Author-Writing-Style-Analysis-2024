"...the ministry did not disclose details about the contents, method of delivery or schedule of Finland's military aid package...".
Just wanted to point out the monetary size of the packages does not correlate to the real value of the material being sent overtly and in most cases covertly.
There is a ton of Finnish material that has shown up in Ukraine without any announcements from Finland and i assume these announcements are just to have public paper trail for after the war.
The Finns have been sending way more than they publicly acknowledge likely as to make it more difficult for Russia to assess how much Finland has left.
The aid from Finland has been appreciable - based on what's been confirmed on . Finland's showing their commitment to joining NATO by keeping deliveries of aid prompt and consistent it seems (but maybe that's just the Finns being Finns). .
Great. Frankly we should send even more, though I’m in favour of keeping it all a secret. Our whole military inventory was bought to battle Russians, so I’m just glad this material is being used for its intended purpose.
