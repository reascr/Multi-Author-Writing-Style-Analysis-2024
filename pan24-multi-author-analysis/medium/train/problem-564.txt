Haha, the US should stop the aid money to Palestinians as well and if anything pressure them to stop the denialism and accept a two state agreement with security guarantees for Israel. Once that is done, hell yea, Palestinians might have a thriving economy and hopeful future. I could see them being an ally like Jordan even. They just need to get over the whole “kill all the jews” vendetta.
You tell ‘em Thank goodness for Obama and his brilliant move organizing the nuclear deal. Had he not done that, one of the most radical countries in the world who slaughters their citizens for dancing and wearing their hair free would never have the world most powerful and destructive weapon.
Yeah let’s not bring Iran into this they’re not a great example of who we want to have a nuclear weapon.. most of us don’t want anyone to have a nuclear weapon.
Uhhh...they use that money to purchase US military equipment. Withholding US aid to Israel would be punching US weapons manufacturers in the nose, not to mention kicking the stock market in the dick.
