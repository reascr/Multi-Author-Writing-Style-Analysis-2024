It's finally Friday! That means it's time to sit back, drink cheez whiz, argue about the best Garfield side character (honestly... probably Jon), and talk about whatever your heart desires.

Rant: My life went to shit and I'm struggling. Single dad that can't find decent mechanic work or work at all that allows me to provide properly because no one will compromise with me on hours that I need to take care of my autistic son. Barely scraping by doing delivery app jobs. Daycare costs me $800 a month on top of my $600 mortgage +food for us, and bills. a broken windows from vandalism, my heat doesn't work, I'm starving myself on ramen so my kid can eat right and I just don't know how much longer I can take.
Have you gone to the local food shelves? A) food. B) they might be able to point you in the direction of other resources. There are many overlapping state, city, and federal programs that can help struggling families. Lots of them go under used because they aren't well publicized. There are org and programs to help with heating bills, repairs, food, etc. I know time is probably one of things you have the absolute least of but a trip to the shelves might be very helpful.
