Someone will attack me, I will go full military, kick his ass, and get a message from him that he was just joking...or attacked me in error.
That is when I take over most of his planets and THEN give him a ceasefire and blockade his area, just waiting for the next attack. I didn't know that the AI in the video games were so accurate with evil leaders until I observed Putin.
Funny enough, the game that I still play quite often, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri has just about the same exact scenario. A lot of the times I would play as the Gaians and be a pacificist civilization, to a certain point.
I'd build up my land and create cities all over the planet. I'd advance my science and technology and work on my society. Just about always Lady Miriam Godwinson and her church nation would attack me.
My forces would then rise up and stomp a mud hole in her ass and leave her 2 or 3 bases left. She'd then messages me, telling me she was sorry about the attack, that it was a mistake on her part, she had only attacked me because of my civilization's blasphemous nature, then ask would I stay my hand and leave her be and she would never bother me again.
It's funny that leaders are likely so "busy" or whatever that they would never spend time playing Strategy games and simulations that would have given them experience and knowledge.
My favorite and most played of the 4x4 strategy games. Unfortunately i have exhausted the game so much i can still remember everything about it, even so many years after i stopped playing it.
