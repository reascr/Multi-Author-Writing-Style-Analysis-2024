Well when the worlds 1 supplier of potash fertilizer and wheat (and the 2 supplier of ammonium for ammonium nitrate fertilizer) invades and decimates the 5 supplier of wheat, mass starvation is unfortunately the likely result. My heart goes out to the people of Africa and Asia. We thought the pandemic was bad, 2023 just might top that.
People were excited when we got out of 2020, but people in the future will call this decade the 2020s, so it will be a while before things stop continuously going to crap.
Whelp I would say India and China are about to find out what not being able to feed their gigantic populations is like.
That’s not what’s been written by many Indians on Reddit. It’s been “India is looking after its best interests and we have no choice but to support Russia as they supply all the fertilizer and 500 million people will starve. Also, Russia’s the only one that’s had our back all these years. Oh, and we don’t care about the plight of white people since you don’t care about brown people.” Yada, yada, yada. Not a word about giving two shits about other nations that I’ve seen.
