Sawant wins here because she has historically attached herself to just about every liberal or progressive grassroots effort in the city. Except, once she expresses support, she then railroads those movements into supporting her own agendas.
Sawant is a Seattle City Council member in District 3, which encompasses Capitol Hill. Lots of nightlife, big apartment buildings, and tends to be a younger crowd. Single family homes here are old and some are in historical preservation areas. It's as progressive as it gets for the city.
Conservatives don't like her for the obvious reasons, but even the most progressive Seattleites are done with the way she sabotages things for her own benefit.
