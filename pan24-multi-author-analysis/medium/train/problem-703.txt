Yeah ao was trying to work this sentence out in my mind. How does a country deport citizens from a different country back to theirs? That doesn't make any sense lol.
Well when the world sits by unwillingly to cross a red line no matter how many war crimes a country commits this is what you get. I’m not necessarily condoning the World tag teaming Russia, but we don’t really have a method for holding Nations accountable when they become monsters like this.
So what exactly is stopping Russia using nukes on Ukraine right now? Almost 12 months into the "3 day operation" Russia is losing the war, what is Putin waiting for?
The fact that they'd be nuked back. Come on, dude, this is basic shit. Nobody wants to be the first to push the button because everyone knows nobody wins.
But if NATO fully commits troops to Ukraine to help them beat Russia in Ukraine, then Russia will use nukes first.
I would have thought either outcome was equally catastrophic to Putin, but only one of them will make him use nukes first. Why?
