I've worked with one of the tribes of the Haudenosaunee (the Oneida), and for what it's worth they are absolutely happy to have institutions commemorate their people's history and culture, they just ask that it be...you know..done in consultation with them and not involve stolen/looted artifacts.
The reason I support returning items to the area they came from is so the descents of the local people can see the item without having to travel thousands of miles. But I think it makes sense not to have all the culturally significant items in one area because a war, an earthquake or a flood could easily destroy the items and it would be a loss to all of humanity to have items destroyed. We saw the Taliban blow up two ancient Buddhas in 2001. Turkey just had a major earthquake that killed thousands and destroyed some cultural significant structures.
So you aren’t familiar with the horrible snowstorm where Buffalo, New York area received 52 inches of snow in 2023? Or the earthquake that occurred today? I doubt we can awesome that anyplace is always going to be stable. Concentrating culturally significant in one area runs the risk that it can all be destroyed in a catastrophic event.
(When it comes to bodies, I don’t think any of them should be displayed without permission of the deceased. Because this is Reddit I will clarify that obviously the permission must be given before death. There are too many cases where bodies were snatched because the norms at the time allowed it.).
I am not opposed to items being returned. The problem I have is how do they determine who to return items to? Many First Nation tribes were wiped out. How do you determine who should get the item? The other issue I have is many of these significant culture items below to humanity and not to one group of people. As long as it’s preserve for posterity does it really matter if the item is in Nairobi, London, Amsterdam, Mumbai, Rio de Janiero or Anchorage? Many of us have multi-cultural heritages.
