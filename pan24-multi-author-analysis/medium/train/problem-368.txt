No, this is wrong thinking terrorists attacks against civilians is terrible and the people responsible should be tried and punished as severally as possible. This is indiscriminate killings of people and an eye for an eye is barbaric and makes whatever political statement moot. I am sorry that innocent people died living their lives.
That being said i would like to know how accurate the evidence is against whatever group the government is pinning this on. Could this be from the putin Chechen playbook? If it is really the PKK or just trying to drive support to eradicate the kurds. If this is really the PKK then f them.
Again the people that died from the terrorist blast didn't do any of this or had anything to do with this. You need to separate the government from the victims of this atrocity. Turkey has a lot of shit to answer for and they should but has nothing to do with this terrorist activity, just ask any Armenian.
Turkey lost pretty much any sympathy from me after Erdogan sent his bully boys to beat up American citizens exercising their right to protest on American soil, then smuggled them all out so they couldn't get arrested after their diplomatic immunity was revoked.
Yup, they want to be able to oppress minorities like the Kurds with no consequences, the US says that's bad, and they start crying about terrorism when the minorities stand up for themselves.
Turkey's image will start to improve if they actually vote out their fascist strong man. Most of the world seems to hate Americans, especially after Trump. If we are all accountable for the actions of our government, why is Turkey any different? I think it's absurd to tell me not to call out the poor Turks when their best known export for the last 200 years has been genocide.
