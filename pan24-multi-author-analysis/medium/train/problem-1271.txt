I remember reading years ago that some private prison/jail corporations have contracts with various states that say the state has to maintain a 90 to 95 percent occupancy rate. If that isn't contractually maintained, the state has to pay huge outrageous sums to the private entity or some shit like that. It was an article I read like back in 2005.
This is a terrible proposal. This creates perverse incentives that can cause harm to inmates who feel that there is no way out other than to donate organs. We shouldn't create incentives like this that make people have to weigh donating organs vs being treated with dignity. This is completely unethical. I'm more in favor of community service, rehabilitation/therapy courses, or heck even working in a high demand sector in exchange for reduced sentence such as paramedic, fire fighter, rural doctor, educator in low income areas ect. I think giving people options to become productive members of the community is a far better way reducing the number of people incarcerated than organ donation.
