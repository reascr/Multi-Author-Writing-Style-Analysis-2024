I’m not sure what the republicans are thinking here. The democrats are going to keep him in the news and use him as a political cudgel for the next 2 years. If you are looking for a way to showcase republican extremism and hypocrisy, his name is Santos. Is that really worth having a 4 seat majority, as opposed to a 3 seat majority they can’t do anything with anyway? Looking the other way guarantees that seat will flip in 2024. I can’t imagine the republican voters in that district will have any motivation to get to the polls. The only one with any smart long term strategy left in the party is McConnell.
