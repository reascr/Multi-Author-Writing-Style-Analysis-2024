i was slightly to old to enlist after 9/11, but i gave it a go. while i agree the list of war crimes posted is pretty awful; compared to how the military behaved in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, Korea, etc the modern military is not the what it used to be. i think if you add up the deaths in the list above it still wouldn't be close to the Mai Li massacre. and some of the worst offenses in the last 20 years have been from Blackwater contractors, not active duty military. I'm not going to defend drone strikes here, but i will say things are not nearly as cut and dry at the moment as they are in hind sight. and we almost never have the full picture.
