Notice the article mentions nation guard troops. National Guard is classified as state militia and is differen than federal armed forces. National guard report to their respective state governors and not the POTUS. That’s why national guard troops can be deployed to the border, but regular federal armed forces aren’t. They’re also prohibited from making arrests, if they see illegal border crossers all they can do is call it in to border patrol who have to come out and arrest the suspected individuals. Basically getting paid to sit in a truck in a remote location and stare at endless darkness for 12+ hour shifts. You should check out some of the articles that have been written about the impact it’s causing on NG soldiers that have been sent to the border, not too many good things coming out of this.
For those who didn’t read the article, the troops weren’t exactly sent to the border, they were sent to a city that happens to be on the border, for reasons that have nothing to with the border.
