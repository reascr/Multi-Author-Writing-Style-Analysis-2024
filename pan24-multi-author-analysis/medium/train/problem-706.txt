I've never been more proud to have my "I voted" sticker. Well...aside from that time I helped vote out Trump, that was cool too. Oh and that time I taught some guy's kid to ride a bike in 30 minutes after he spent weeks trying and I saw him yelling at his kid so I helped. But that's it. 3rd proudest I've been in a while.

I think our county went blue, but I swear there are so many Trump flags flying around here I was getting kinda worried that we would literally elect Doctor Fucking Oz.
It's like when you are so nauseated that you just KNOW you are about to blow chunks all over the place but then your burp and you feel 100% in 10 seconds. I really felt like PA was going to blow chunks there for a while.
