I mean it shows the character of Americans. All the Russians are scared to death to speak out. Yet an American who has everything to lose says fuck it, I’ll show you I’m not scared and speak out.
You realize this person wasn’t protesting the Ukraine war, right? Very short article. She saved a cow from slaughter and took it downtown to show it off. She was there on a tourist visa. She’s done so in several other countries as well. She seems to be a vegan/animal rights protester or something like that. I still personally wouldn’t be protesting in russia, but that’s the least of their concerns and I wouldn’t chalk her behavior up to “courage”….
And to everyone saying this is an “international incident”, she got 14 days in jail and a fine. This isn’t even newsworthy.
Well we aren’t lead dictators and people acting like religion gives them the right to manipulate people. It is unsafe tho. I’m surprised you aren’t making fun of the USA for police violence or drug addiction but either way, we are safer and we’re proud of it.
Next thing you know she starts to cry about it and asks USA to trade some other dangerous person to Russia in order to save her stupid ass. Honestly, some people...
I have problems with idiots who go to NK, Iran and Russia. They need to use what little brains God gave them. I mean really, who thinks it a good idea to visit North Korea for vacation?
I'm sure she will. Just saying it's not exactly the best moment to do this kind of stuff in Russia. And if the punishment would have been more than just 13 days, then what? It's just irresponsible.
