No, Mastodon is a completely different concept. It is not hosted by a single company. Instead, it is hosted by many different servers. So, you only need to join one server (with a distinct domain name) and you can see the contents of all other servers that are connected to Mastodon. If you don't like your server, you can migrate to another server with a completely different "local" community. Just move your data over to a new server. So, essentially you have a local community and a global community.
I only used it to keep track of video games or books I was interested and, more recently, I started using it to stay informed about Ukraine. Dropped it a few weeks back after Elon was dumb enough to break 2FA. Twitter is being run by a manchild and an overworked skeleton crew of a staff that either can't leave thanks to things like work visas or who got suckered into drinking that charlatan's kool-aid, regardless, it's a security nightmare waiting to happen and I want no part of it.
For an alternative to Twitter to exist, it needs to be as basic bitch as it can get so everyone sees it as an easy alternative to jump ship.
