On a micro dose or small amount, basically unnoticeable. A slightly larger amount leads to giggles and a feeling of lightness, and mild nausea sometimes. Larger doses (for me) was a joyful laugh filled come up, feelings of lightness, appreciation of nature and connection to math in nature. At the highest dose I’ve tried, ego death, which gave me peace with my existence and place in the world and universe. Deep visuals in my minds eye when eyes closed. My favorite part: the beauty in nature and big laughs I waited until I was older to try them, and I’m glad I did.
