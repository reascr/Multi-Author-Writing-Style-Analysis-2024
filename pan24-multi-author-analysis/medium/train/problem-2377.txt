Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:
I too have reached the "everything is Reagan's fault" level of political awareness. Also lol @ the Green Day shirt you're wearing in the first panel. too real, too real.
1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.
Only read the headlines? Carter inherited a decade+ of monetizing the debt to pay for 'Nam from LBJ, Nixon and Ford. The Fed refused to continue this practice and when the US had to borrow to pay for the worthless war, it literally sucked up all the available cash, reducing the supply of money for other borrowers, who (like happens in times of serious shortage) drove the price of money (interest rates) thru the roof, and the price of everything else followed the money.
Carter's boy Volker cut inflation by a third by the end of 1979 with the most aggressive Fed policy in history. The rest of the economy was improving, and Carter was looking better and better, until Iran seized our embassy and drove the economy out of the public's eye. Then Reagan cut a deal with Iran to release the hostages AFTER the election.
Ronny's suck the rich taxscam drove inflation and unemployment back to near record highs and more than TRIPLED the National Debt (+340%). Reagan's economic policy had four key pillars: reducing government spending, slashing taxes, reducing regulations, and tightening the monetary supply through higher interest rates, all of which shifted the burden of "fixing" the economy on to the backs of bottom 90%.
The harsh prescription spurred a significant recession from July 1981 to November 1982, which was at the time was the worst economic downturn in the United States since the Great Depression.
