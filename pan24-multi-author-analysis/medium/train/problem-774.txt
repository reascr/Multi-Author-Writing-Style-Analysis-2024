Iran is supported by Russia, Saudi Arabia its Sunni rival in the region is supported (even with current tensions) by the west.
So weakening Russia is something Saudi Arabia would like very much, in addition to needing to clean its image (not judging the efficiency here just stating) I can totally see Saudi starting to pump cash flow in Ukraine.
Economic investors are starting to take more notice of Ukrainian commodities and future ROI. Most of the World understands how important keeping that Democracy going is to the rest of us.
Pretty much always needs to be at difference with Iran. So if Russia is going to send Iran a fuck ton of money for drones the Saudis are obviously going to see that as a red line and support the opposition. My prediction with this support is that whole oil fiasco we had over the summer has no chance of repeating with Saudis siding with Ukraine and at large the west.
Guarantees the us remains interested for a long time. If there is one thing the GQP love more than the military industrial complex it's Saudi business interests.
