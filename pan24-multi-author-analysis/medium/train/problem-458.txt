Trying to see this from a Republican's perspective, why exactly should I NOT want to shitcan Ronna ROMNEY McDaniel ASAP? She's presided over how much losing? Granted most of that losing is much more Trump's fault than hers, but timing is valuable, and she timed her rise so terribly that it screams her lack of useful political instincts.
I mean if I were an insider, I think I would want her removed. I know she isn't Trump, but she was put there because she was team Trump. She even dropped her hyphenated last name to appease Trump(as you reminded us above). If I am an R and I want to fumigate the house of the Trump stench, that includes removing those who showed they would debase themselves for Trump. Although now that I think about it...which Republicans didn't?
