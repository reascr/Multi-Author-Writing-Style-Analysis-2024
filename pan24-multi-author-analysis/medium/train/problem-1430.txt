Most people don't expect to be specifically represented in their congressional district or by their state senators. They don't think that these people will do anything special or targeted for them outside of the general overarching federal level goals of the party. This is why people will vote for the R or the D, regardless of the quality of that candidate compared to the opposition, because it isn't about that candidate. They think that federal level candidates are are a collective, that they accomplish nothing more than pushing the general party agenda with their individual vote, so it really doesn't matter who it is, they'll still vote in the senate or in congress how the party tells them to. They don't understand how committees work, referendums, addendums, motions, nominations, etc. They think that the party crafts the legislation, hands it off to someone and everyone will just vote for or against based on who put the legislation up.
