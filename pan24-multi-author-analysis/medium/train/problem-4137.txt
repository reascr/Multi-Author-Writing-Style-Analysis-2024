We in the west also have our own problems with authoritarian kleptocrats. We managed to get one out of office as our electoral system and courts had not yet been damaged beyond repair. But it was a close call.
I love the presuppositions in the title of the piece. Atlantic Council can latch my fucking taint and CHUG, absolute btches.

Kleptocrats frequently have one big weakness: no succession plan. Putin doesn't have an obvious successor, because he doesn't trust anyone to shield him should he step down. This would make the inner circle of any dictator nervous, because a dead leader surprise could easily lead to a mad dash for power, which would leave many elites out of power, if not dead. I wouldn't be surprised if Putin's circle in particular has a contingency plan to oust Putin on their terms, should he not announce a successor.
Biden's a decent improvement, obviously foreign policy never changes because only billionaires, weapons manufacturers, and the elite criminals who hold sway over the CIA have a say in that. I hate the fucker but if I'm being honest he's the best President of my lifetime, and of most people still alive. Which is fucking harrowing.
