His war strategy was literally to graft as much as possible from the lend lease act, hoard the supplies, wait for America to come and win the war for him and rule as dictator. He was so bad, he was kidnapped by one of his own generals because he was forcing a suicidal attack and needed to be stopped. The only reason he was released was because there was no one to take his positon of supreme commander.
Also cck is a coward and an imbecile so please don't hold any reverence for him. His great grandson seems to be cut from the same cloth based in his debate performance.
Another fun fact. Chiang Kai shek contracted syphilis cause he is a man whore so his only son was from his first wife who was a peasant. He later remarried su Mei lin who was a wealthy aristocrat and the sister of sun Yat sen's wife, who is considered the founder of the republic of China.
For me the most interesting fact about this election is that is Chiang Kai-shek's great-grandson, who only learned who his real grandfather (another ex-president Chiang Ching-kuo) and great-grandfather are as a high schooler, when his dad, who was product of the president having an affair started legal proceedings to get legally recognised as the late CCK's son.
