Yep. I woke up today at 03:00 and worked in 50C conditions for 18 hours, was fed scraps, and was beaten (yet again) for trying to escape out of the slave camp. I've got a tooth infection that's getting worse, and I can't get any medical attention so I'm thinking about just ripping out the tooth before it spreads.
I'm seriously wondering if the guy was on drugs at the time he gave the interview. Him "feeling" what it's like to be these people just seems so insanely out of touch - I'm thinking that's exactly what it is. Insane, likely induced by drugs.
Oh yea of course. Just saying it’s not on the same scale of, for example “I know what it’s like to be discriminated against because I’m a rich white guy.” Gingers do get shat on.
...I mean, the idea of “the red-headed stepchild” exists for a reason. And again, I’m not saying they’re the most discriminated group. Just that they actually ARE discriminated against.
Crazy how that wasn’t at all a thing growing up in the USA (probably as the red-headed kids were white and our bigotry here tends to be more race based.).
