In an interview with Funke media group newspapers, Paulini pointed out that “radiation does not stop at the borders,” and claimed that the ongoing military conflict between Moscow and Kiev has “made it clear to the German residents that we have to be and remain prepared for a wide variety of nuclear emergencies.”.
“Lessons learned from past radiological and nuclear accidents have demonstrated that the mental health and psychosocial consequences can outweigh the direct physical health impacts of radiation exposure.”.
It's not “the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date.” "The most important health effect is on mental and social well-being, related to the enormous impact of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident, and the fear and stigma related to the perceived risk of exposure to ionizing radiation.".
So it sounds like more of a general preparedness thing that's been talked about for months and not some new development.
Judging by how their history is riddled with fear mongering, divisive posts that plays both left and right. This definitely seems like a bot account posting this…..
