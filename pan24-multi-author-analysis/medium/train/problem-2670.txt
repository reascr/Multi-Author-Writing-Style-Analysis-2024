It's apparently very hard to prove that you actually suffered monetary damage in libel lawsuits in the United States. Doesn't matter if Musk ruined his reputation. That's not enough.
I also read that they used the "he's a good guy, and this shouldn't tarnish his good reputation" argument. I've also read that arguments is more believable the more money you have.
He's mad that they are reporting that LAPD knows nothing about the Lil X attack thing, never reported to LAPD. Probably all fake. Because he's a drama queen that lies.
He lied to that reporter in 2018, trying to tell him "off the record" that the "pedo guy" he was smearing had married a 12-year-old girl in a particular city in Thailand. Story was completely made up. So Musk definitely has a record of lying to cover his ass.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
But there were some other weird claims Musk's lawyers made that the jury apparently fell for. I remember one was "Nobody takes seriously anything they read on Twitter.".
