that's the point of this communication. The next Ukrainian (offensive) move that makes sense is to take back Crimea through a southern offensive. The fewer Russian assets are located on the peninsula, the better. Give them as many reasons as possible to withdraw.
Typically yes, not letting your enemy capture a bridge is a big deal because then you can stop their advance. But there's no way Ukraine is going to push through Crimea into Russia. They would quickly start to lose the moral high ground and international support.
dude, if russia doesn't demolish it the minute the Ukrainians enter Mariupol, as in shelling range - they would be dumber than what they have shown already.
From Russia's point of view it would seem to make more sense to leave it intact. Blowing up your own bridge would be an admission that they are losing and are not planning to regain control anytime soon.
Ukraine has reason to let it live for now. Let it live until they push into Crimea so the Russians have a way out. Sure it means the troops can be used to re-enforce Russian lines elsewhere but you generally dont want to leave an enemy no escape route unless your plan is to literally eliminate them.
the symbolism of the bridge being demolished by ATACMS and ceasars would be far more humiliating then blowing it up on their own. a false flag that kills civilians in fact might help them since the bridge was going to be destroyed regardless.
If the Russians are really planning an offensive then it's just much better to sit behind your defenses and let them rush across the open fields instead of attacking yourself.
