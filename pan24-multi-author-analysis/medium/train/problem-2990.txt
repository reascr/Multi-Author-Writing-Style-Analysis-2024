Yeah but that's okay though, the longer China is distracted and running around chasing zero covid cases, the longer they'll take getting prepared to invade Taiwan.
They can't any release from it would be seen as a failure by the party and they cannot allow that. This is what happens in every totalitarian communist country eventually they have to squeeze harder and harder to maintain control.
It was a good policy with the original strain since it was way less infectious and relatively more lethal. With nobody having immunity it also kept hospitals from overfilling. They didnt approve any foreign vaccines and data suggests that their own ones are not as good for preventing severe disease so maybe they dont trust their own vaccines.
Vector vaccines are pretty much dead at this point because of bloodclotting risk, one time use of vector, preexisting immunity against the vector and possibility of vector replication due to low quality as with sputnik v. China is definitely not gonna use that one.
