In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Name and shame every Republican legislator that “doesn’t believe” in climate change. How fucking convenient is it that all their donors have a vested interest in ensuring they can pollute as much as possible? The Republican base hates money in politics. Trump ran on “draining the swamp”. They have the same ideas we have in many cases, they just have no fucking idea who the good or bad guys are.
