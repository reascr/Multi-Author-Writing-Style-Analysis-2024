We are? Seems that my original point in reply to your comment was that it was republicans that overwhelmingly approve of business credits like the ERC and forgiven loans like the PPP, but immediately cry about expanded Child Tax Credits and how much they cost when in reality the CTC pales in comparison of costs. You replied that the expanded CTC wasn't popular. And yet, in the NYT article you used the author admits it was the fear of cuts to SS and Medicare that took priority for older Democrats. Who is advocating cuts to SS and Medicare? So, in my opinion, had republicans not demonized the expanded CTC as unaffordable like they always do the public approval of the expanded CTC would be high enough to necessitate inclusion in the spending bill. Republicans are the force moving against it because any Democratic policy that helps voters makes republicans look bad and they just can't have that. The expanded CTC has public support, what it doesn't have is bipartisan support. Because business tax credits>CTC./s.
But of course Republicans got the cuts to the IRS they asked for. Strategically zeroing out the technology upgrade budget, kneecapping any improved enforcement initiatives.
This wasn't "tyranny of the minority", it was a program that people didn't want to extend/make permanent so politicians focused on other priorities.
