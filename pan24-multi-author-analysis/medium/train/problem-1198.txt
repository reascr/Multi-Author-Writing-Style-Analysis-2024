Know a family who bought a house all cash to take advantage of the lower market. They borrowed from friends and family for something like 3%, basically for their relatives it's better investment than savings account and for them they get to buy a house "cheap" without dealing with the high interest rate.
Oh we are in Texas and I think the house they got was something like $400K? But yeah I doubt they can come up with $1mil from friends and family but then I may be presuming much regarding their relatives lol.
I do agree though that having relatives that can trust each other with money like this is really advantageous.
I am glad i already own (i bought during a crash) because my house has skyrocketed in price; however, others need a house, too .
Oh wow - what area of texas are you in? I have some friends in the austin area that tell me houses exploded in price over there, too. I am in southern california where cities refuse to build housing, heh.
Housing in Texas anywhere other than Austin and Dallas is pretty cheap. But in this case they live in Houston. And $400K can get a good normal 23K sq feet house in the suburbs depending on quality of the house.
I am in a suburb in LA/OC area with a 1600sqft house; houses within 1-2 streets from me are currently on the market for 850-950 - i live in the "cheaper" area (one more street over is the jump to 1M+). It has to feel impossible for new buyers .
Yeah they're definitely not the norm, since you need people who has this kind of money lying around and that they trust you with it. Just saying that in some cases, especially if you can afford a house just using cash, it's actually a good time to buy.
