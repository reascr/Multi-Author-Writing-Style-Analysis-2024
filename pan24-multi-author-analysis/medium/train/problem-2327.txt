"Men cannot be lesbians" was a statement targeted at a trans woman who identified as lesbian - the potentially offensive nature of the statement is that this filmmaker referred to a trans woman as a man.
Norway's hate speech laws include hate speech based on gender identity, which might cover this statement.
"Faces up to 3 years in prison" means "under investigation to determine if a crime was committed, and if so, the maximum penalty for that crime is 3 years". As far as I can tell, no charges have been filed, it's entirely possible this does not qualify under Norway's hate speech laws, and even if it is a crime, there will likely be a much lighter sentence than 3 years of prison, which seems to be the absolute maximum penalty for hate speech in Norway.
More accurate headline: "Norwegian filmmaker says trans women are not really women, comes under investigation to determine if this is hate speech".
Who gives a fuck, how someone identifies him/her - self Keep your identifications for yourself, if it is important to you. Why does the whole world need to forcefully acknowledge it? There are whole nations that get no recognition of independence.
