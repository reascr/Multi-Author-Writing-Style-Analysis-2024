The thing that Republicans don't get about Democrats (and everyone else who isn't an asshole): We actually want it to be OK for a Republican politician to dress in drag The problem we have is when they dress in drag then turn around and marginalize and criminalize others who do so. It isn't the drag that's offensive or shameful - it's the hypocrisy.
Oh, right. Forgot about that. Homosexuality, or distress about about it remained in the dsm in some form or other until 2013. Homosexuality itself (if you aren't distressed about it) wasn't removed until 1974.
The thing Democrats don't get about Republicans is this: Republicans want to be able to dress in drag, and do lines of cocaine and have gay sex and low maortgages and get abortions and free healthcare. They just don't want you to have those things too.
I feel the same way about the pics of me dressed as Dr franknfurter for Halloween that I've made zero effort to hide on social media. There are so many other reasons I'm not electable, lol.
