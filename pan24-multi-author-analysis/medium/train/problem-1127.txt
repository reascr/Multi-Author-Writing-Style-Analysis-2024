The lawsuit by defeated Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake challenging the results of her election have been tossed out by a judge.
The former news anchor-turned-MAGA politician lost her election in November to Democrat Katie Hobbs, 50.3 per cent to 49.7 per cent.
She’s doing this to continue the grift of her supporters. There are probably emails being sent out that the election was rigged and “true patriots” need to donate to help. She will do this for like another month or so then fall off the face of the earth when she realizes the hype died down.

Kari Lake is ashamedly the worst person in the world I’d still probably fuck. Boebart ranks. MTG is a dick killer tho.
Edit: I could care less about your votes. She’s a trashbag impersonating a human, but she’s still a pretty face.
