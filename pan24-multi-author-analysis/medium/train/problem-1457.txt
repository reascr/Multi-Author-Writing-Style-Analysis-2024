> It’s no wonder people clamored for a different system of money. Unfortunately Bitcoin is not it. It might be rare due to its fixed circulation, but it’s not fungible. One can’t instantly pay for a variety of goods with Bitcoin. It’s still tied to the debt dollar and it must be ‘cashed out’ first. In fact, all cryptos remain tied to the dollar. When you hear, ‘What’s XYZ coin worth today,” you know they mean what it’s worth in debt dollars. Of course, gold and silver face this same problem. It’s difficult to pay for anything with gold and silver coins without ‘cashing them in’ first. Still, gold and silver are precious metals that people can hold in their hands or store in their sock drawer. You can’t store crypto in a safe; it must exist on an ‘exchange,’ or kept in a digital ‘wallet.’ In other words, they exist as ideas and electrons stored who-knows-where and hacked by who-knows-who. If the electricity goes off, you won’t have access to your so-called crypto ‘money,’ but your gold and silver will always be there.
