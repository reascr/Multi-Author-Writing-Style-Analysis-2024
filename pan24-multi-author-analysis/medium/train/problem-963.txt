It's not just about surplus, it's about general trade, i.e. volume. Germany is Russia's largest trading partner by far in those lists. They didn't just take Russia's money, they gave them products in exchange. What that shows, is that despite massive imports from Russia, they gave them even more useful products in return. The only good exports to Russia is the type that will make them dependent on you, which happens to be American electronics and software, since that's the one thing Russia can't replace through China or India.
Well, it's worth nothing that the West, especially Europe, especially Germany, kept turning a blind eye to Russia's misdeeds, and kept giving them money instead. Hell, is from 40 years ago... now Zelensky is just doing anything and everything he can do minimize the suffering of his people. It's easy to get annoyed with their requests from the comfort of our homes, but weapons can be rebuilt, your loved ones can't be un-raped and un-killed.
So Germany made Russia 56 billion poorer while the USA made them 301 billion richer from 2000 to 2021.
The USA gave Russia way more money than Germany in the last two decades. Germany made Russia poorer though trade.
