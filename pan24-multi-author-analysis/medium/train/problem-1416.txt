roughly 1400 years. Prior to that, Persia was predominantly Zoroastrian followed by many other local and imported religions like Bahai'i, Judiasm, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and even Sikhism.
Every major Iranian holiday predates Islam and are Zoroastrian traditions dating back to the Achaemenid Empire. We don’t see our poets, philosophers, authors as Muslim but as Persians. Our heroes in folklore are all Persian not Muslim. There’s also a poll that shows only 30% or so identify with Islam.
I know a lot of folks that Identify as Iranian simply because their culture is still distinct from Persian. Some cultures are precursors that had lived in the region prior to the Achaemenid. Persian kings of antiquity have been known to bring artisans and scholars of other cultures, settling their people within classical Persia. For example, Assyrians are a minority group in Iran, but they have a fantastically long history in the region going back to 2500BC. The Sasanian Dynasty brought Armenian craftsman to Persia after the conquest of Armenia. Likewise, Persian Jews have been in Iran since the Babylonians.
I've known a lot of Persian folks, and they describe it pretty simply: If it's cultural, it's likely Persian. If it's national. Then it's probably Iranian. If it's older than that, it's something else.
It's the dumbasses that use islam as an excuse to cause all these deaths. Separate the people from the religion that actively denounces the very things they do.
