It's weird to hear right-wingers talk about reality when they live in a fantasy dystopia universe where they see a pedophile hiding around each corner and still fail to realize blue states are by far more productive than red states.
Oddly enough the only place they don’t see pedophiles are the places where there actually are pedophiles. Show me the last time a drag queen or a democrat was busted for pedophilia? Because I can get you a dozen Republican politicians and Christian priests who’ve been busted for it. But family values, am I right?
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
But I'm sure that if even Republicans haven't been able to prove anything despite their willingness to bend and break reality, a congressional committee will for sure impeach Hunter! /s.
The laptop is real. The contents of the laptop are a nothingburger though. Back in 2020 Giuliani offered to bring "bombshell documents" from the "laptop from hell" to Tucker Carlson - head of the republican propaganda machine - and even Tucker had the good sense to dismiss the whole thing as nonsense.
