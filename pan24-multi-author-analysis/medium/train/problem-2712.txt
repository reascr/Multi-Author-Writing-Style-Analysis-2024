But I ask my conservative family every now and then for a single bill republicans came up with to help the average american in the last 15-20 years, and they have yet to give me an answer.
The last time republicans passed any legislation that purposely helped the American people, was the during the Eisenhower administration. And even that’s a stretch.
Even then, they had to call it the "National Interstate and Defense Highways Act (1956)." That was back in the days was Wisconsin, a reputedly blue state, sent us Joe McCarthy, the kind of guy who could make Kevin think he was Gene.
I think "no child left behind" was an actual attempt to help people, despite being a disaster. I'd maybe give that half credit.
It’s wild. Republicans in office never go for a pay cut themselves. They want less tax payer money going towards things like public education, food stamps, and prenatal care for poor mothers. But never their own salaries.
They forget that poor people pay taxes. It’s already their money. The idea is that you pay taxes to maintain social services. Republicans love that shit when it benefits them. Not having to pay back GOVERNMENT-LOANS? Hell yeah. Capitalism. Free school lunch? No. That’s a hand out.
I’m sick of republican shit. And I’m not even getting into the Christian fascism states like Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma, etc, are getting up too.
