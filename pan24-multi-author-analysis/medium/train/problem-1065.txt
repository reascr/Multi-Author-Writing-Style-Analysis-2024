The more fair comparison is not OIF and OEF, but the first gulf war. OIF and OEF were mostly fought against insurgent type forces and not organized militaries. Ukraine isn't a hodgepodge of insurgents, they are a standing military nation backed by a government. Desert Storm was the US lead coalition versus the standing Iraqi army. At the time, Iraq was supposed to have the 4th largest army in the world behind the big 3 super powers of the US, Russia, and China, and they were battle hardened after wars with Iran and an invasion of Kuwait. The coalition absolutely mopped the floor with the Iraqi army. There was never a question of who had air superiority and the US defeated the elite Republican Guard in less than a day during the Battle of 73 Easting. The whole ground war was pretty much over in less than 100 hours. You can read the official details of each movement . That's the war Russia expected to conduct, but they found out very quickly that they were not the US and their allies.
questionable, if they're really ethnic russians, more likely from 170+ minorities in federation, who think they're russians, until they visit Moscow or Petersburg...
But we havenâ€™t seen the full extent of the impact of this war on the people living in territory held and attack by Russians. Ukrainian civilians are likely paying a steep price.
