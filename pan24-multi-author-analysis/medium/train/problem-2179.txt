We worked there for like 15 months. Total. He bread and butter is stupid daily jobs like the Sackler(Purdue pharmaceutical) family house' changing light bulbs. And this was 20 years ago now, but 25,000 Sq ft of never turning off lights. For 5 hours we changed light bulbs. One at a time. When done, he says "pick a 5 digit number above 2000, under 4999" I said 34something. He says "watch this" writes an invoice for 34 something. $3475.99 as an example. We take the invoice back in, the wife's assistant filled out the check, then handed it to the wife for her signature. She never looked at the amount. Just "hi guys" and signed. And left. My uncle said he could've done any amount. Anything under 10,000.
Of course it's much better not to release them at all (need to reduce train derailments!), but once some airborne flammable chemicals are released, unfortunately burning them is often the less-harmful option than letting the raw chemical spread. With methane, for example, it's many times worse for climate change if released unburned. With things like the Ohio chemicals, it might've been a difference between people getting sick from the smoke vs dropping dead from unburned fumes.
