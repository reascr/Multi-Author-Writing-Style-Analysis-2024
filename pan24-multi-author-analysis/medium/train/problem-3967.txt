With good long-term policy planning (yes, I laughed typing this), you could gradually ween the market off private and mostly public. Then, at that point, what you would pay for Healthcare would essentially be a healthcare tax. Now, since the government would negotiate lower healthcare costs, likely the profit driven healthcare provider system would likely strain. At this point, the government would either need to heavily subsidize the industry or absorb it since providing health to the population is a critical service. This would also likely reduce government spending costs as the cost of providing direct healthcare is the government. Going back to government does not need to make a profit on a service, the Healthcare could just be free to citizens and paid by taxes, likely at a lower rate than a person would pay private and other related costs.
