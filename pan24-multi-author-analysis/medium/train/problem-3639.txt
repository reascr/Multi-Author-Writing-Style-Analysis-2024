If true, I hope it is the death that Batman deserved. Not being blown up or stabbed or poisoned. I hope he died in bed surrounded by those he loved and whose life he made better.
Adam West would be offering heartfelt condolences along with the rest of us. He knew Batman contains multitudes and was happy to be our Bright Knight while others played the Dark Knight to perfection.
Conroy WAS Batman. For many he was the introduction to the character, and certainly the most well known - even if people didn't know his name they knew his voice. He captured the empathy, the compassion, the intimidation, the grit, the tenacity, the badassness.
I had the opportunity to meet him a couple of years ago as a park in the Bronx was named after Bill Finger and Conroy attended. I really wish I hadn't been so lazy and had gone to meet him.
Have a good journey, Kevin, you made so many animated pictures more real and more atmospheric during my childhood and youth. You were the one and only, the sincere Bat Man.
