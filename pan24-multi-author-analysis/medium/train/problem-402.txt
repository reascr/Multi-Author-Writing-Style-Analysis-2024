Maybe, but the West going in and nation building for them (again) isn't going to be any better. It didn't work in Iran, it didn't work in Afghanistan, it's barely held up in Iraq.
Cause the last time few times the west's has gotten involved in revolutions in the Middle East it hasn't blown up in our faces at all.
It's harsh on the people there, and will probably see more bloodshed before it's done, but the only way there's even a chance of this ending well for the people of Iran is if the rest of us stay the hell out of their way and let them fix their country themselves.
What he doesnâ€™t get is we never in the history of ever attacked anyone because we wanted to help the people. There was a profit to be made. We help get shady terrible people elected that will line our politicians and corporate pockets. We make the rich so much richer after war profits are in. More of our tax money going for corruption instead of funding the betterment of our own people. Americans are paying the most and getting nothing back and you think suddenly our government gives two shits about brown foreigners? Right my guy right.
