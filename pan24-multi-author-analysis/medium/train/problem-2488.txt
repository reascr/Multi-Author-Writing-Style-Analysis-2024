"Defund the police" would be one. It was so bad it's speculated that it was actually the right wing which propogated it. Others would be the psycho God hates fags christians. Some times protests have more to do with virtue signaling to an in group in order to cement one's identity than effectively bringing about change. I think these protests have more to do with how the individuals have constructed their identities rather than a tually believing they're changing anyone's opinions. If they do think they're changing anyone's opinion by throwing tomato sauce at a painting, they're seriously deluded.
You have to know you're doing it wrong when people who support your cause think you're a fucking idiot for the method you're using to get your message out.
On the contrary - decades from now when there are wars over migration/water/liveable climates and people ask “why was nothing done to stop this”, people will point to instances like this when people tried to shift the conversation and the response they got was “yeah but they damaged a drawing, and that’s what was important”.
