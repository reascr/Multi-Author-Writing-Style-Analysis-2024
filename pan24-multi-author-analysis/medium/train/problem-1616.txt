I think s that has her at 18% favorable in Arizona, and only 5% favorable amongst Democrats. She was going to lose a primary challenge in the Democratic primary. This was she can contest the seat as an independent. In a three way senate race, it's possible the winner only needs to run in the high 30;s to win. If Arizona Republicans run another fringe far-right candidate, and the Democrats run someone too progressive, she could squeak through. It sucks if you're a Democrat, but it's a pretty smart gambit if you're Synema. At least, since she has shredded her relationship with Arizona Dems, it's the best she's got.
