I mean until wind and solar power technology becomes more stable its hard to keep up with their needs for energy as the worlds manufacturing hub and over a billion people.
They took the bag when it came to becoming the world’s manufacturing hub. Can’t use that as an excuse since they’re economy and it’s people have benefited substantially from western capital inflows.
Then developed countries starts pointing at developing countries saying "hey man" this pollution is getting kinda bad could you do something about it, but continue making shit for us.
There is extreme editorial bias here, since other countries (including the US) have also previously declined to pay into Climate Fund type programs to offset the historical carbon emissions by currently wealthy countries that have baked so much carbon into the climate already.
This article is from Voice of America news, a Cold-War era propaganda service founded, operated and funded by the US government. VoA was founded during the Cold War to destabilize 2nd World countries via pirate radio transmissions into those countries. Their founding charter is literally as a mouthpiece of the US state.
The United States contributed . The current is a $11b, of which $1b has been received in the past year.
It goes both ways my guy. You dont want to pollute your own country so I will export it to you. I get things cheap and $$ and so do you except I won't get the negatives which is the pollution.
And while the VOA is government-funded, it’s widely regarded as reliable, just like NPR, PBS, the BBC, etc.
