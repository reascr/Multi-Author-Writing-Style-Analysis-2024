The Media built very heavily on the narrative of Diana the young princess - and as it turns out she was a fantastic woman. Then she and Charles had trouble due to it being an arranged marriage - and the Media built up her side of that story and made bank on the results. When she died due to being pursued by those same Media people - they turned up the blame on Charles. Public opinion has never been on Charles' side and now that he is King, the media continues to ride the unpopularity they generated and the public is swept along with it.
I too have stopped the use of foie gras in my own properties and also have tried to be instrumental in a wider ban across all of our royal residences.
I get it, I do, but it is kind of annoying seeing everything King Charles does and has done be ridiculed despite him pushing for more positive environmental change and acting on more change than any government we’ve ever had.
Like I get that he’s incredibly privileged and I get that so many people are against the monarchy. But he’s cutting down drastically on costs and taking pretty big steps (for an ancient entrenched institution) in the correct direction. Receives nothing but shit for it.
