I was there a couple years ago and holy shit man, I didn’t even tell em I was from CA and I can’t tell you how many people just started bitching about California unprompted. The libruls live in their head rent free. Although there’s plenty of people in CA that are basically the same.
I lived in portland for about a decade and it was always weird hearing people complain to me about how the dumb shitty Californians don’t fit in and aren’t welcome.
