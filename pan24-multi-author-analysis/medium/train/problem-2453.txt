Hit the nail right on the head. Yes, she faced the same issues that minority women face every time they run. That is only part of the story, especially because she has shown she can overcome that and over perform in her previous matchup with Kemp. She lost because she failed to realize that the message she had been pushing for the last four years stopped being meaningful to voters nearly two years ago - and quite frankly I'm not sure how effective it ever was. I agree with you, it was an entirely reasonable message, but beyond it no longer being relevant after Kemp stood up to Trump, it gives major "sore looser" vibes to make your entire platform "my opponent cheated me last time". Again, I agree with it, but ultimately I don't think it would have continued resonating with independents even if Kemp hadnt stuck up to Trump.
