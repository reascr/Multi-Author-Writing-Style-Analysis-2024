While listening to some lecture courses on the classical Greeks, specifically the Spartan oligarchy, I was introduced to the concept of being ‘homosocial’. That is to say, to prefer the company and companionship of your own gender for not necessarily sexual reasons. In the case of the elite Spartan warrior class, men basically lived in super fancy mess hall/barracks compounds together. They got to play grab ass while their icky-soft-why-can’t-arm-wrestle wives ran their slaved based agricultural economy. All over Greece, the public Gymnasium was a ‘homosocial space’ for aristocratic men to talk business and flex their sick gains.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
