> The University of the Arts London, University of Bedfordshire, and Wrexham Glyndwr University join Birkbeck, University of London, which was the first to adopt a fossil-free careers service policy in September.
As it happens, the universities mentioned were all set up as technical /community colleges to educate working people. They're all now part of the general university system, but try to keep to their founding principles.
At the end of the article they mention other industries including tobacco. Are they ok with alcohol companies?
There was probably strong internal pressure from students. Artists are quite often liberal and the University of the Arts London probably did the napkin math and knew that setting aside a booth for the fossil fuel industry wasn't going to result in more than a handful of job recruits anyway.
I doubt there is much student-driven pressure to ban alcohol industry recruitment, and I can imagine a lot of internal backlash if they tried to. I'd like to see the global stats on blood-alcohol content while defending a thesis.
The corporations are already run by idiots and the corrupt. Look up Dick Cheney and Koch and the fat oil executive Trump appointed. Then there's Saudi Arabia, CanaDUH, and the rest of the world, and Putin's collection of subservient oligarchs.
