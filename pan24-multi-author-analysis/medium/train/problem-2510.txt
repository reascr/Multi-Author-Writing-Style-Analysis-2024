Most Chinese people are pretty aware how their government works, it's hardly North Korea out there. They support it anyway because the economy is still growing and living standards have improved more than almost any other country since the 80s. And also because of nationalism, it might be an authoritarian government but it's their authoritarian government.
So in other words if Elon didn't want to be a Muppet for Pussy Putin he could request authorization to share the technology with the Ukrainian military but we all know he won't do that because why? He's a Muppet for Putin.
Sounds a lot easier than it is. A low-earth orbit may run at any angle N-S-E-W and also altitude, which can vary with time, ie. it doesn't have to have a circular orbit. To hit it you need to match trajectories. To do that using something you already have in orbit (on some other trajectory) that something has to have tremendous delta-v capability, ie. thruster, & fuel for said thruster. Sats can change trajectory a little but to completely warp around to match something else is a whole different ball game.
