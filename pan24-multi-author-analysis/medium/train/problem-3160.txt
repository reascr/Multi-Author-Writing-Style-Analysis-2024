Why? He has just done his part in a little pantomime, exactly as MiniMan wants. He's also set himself up as a future scapegoat. So right now he is probably one of the safest of those close to Halfpint.
Yes it's the centuries old russian way of pretending anything bad is not because of the Czar but because of those under him. It's the varnya of a lie everyone pretends to believe. It makes it safe for the people to criticize the scapegoat when they'd be shot for criticizing the czar himself. Many do actually believe the lies because they've been conditioned since youth to save their own skins by telling themselves they believe. They've internalized that. And of course everyone scapegoated actually is corrupt. The whole society from top to bottom and back again is corrupt. it depends upon corruption to function.I've seen interviews with russians who say it's great and very efficient. Because you can just bribe the right person and all your problems go away.
Such systems and cultures aren't unique to russia but for sheer scale and endurance theirs takes the Gold in the corruption Olympics.
