The bill was incredibly unpopular in Scotland and considering devolution never gave the Scottish Government the power to to so this in the first place it's obvious to a blind man that Sturgeon wanted this to happen so she could have her little showdown with Westminster.
This is a blatant power-grab by Westminster to keep the cultural-war wedge firmly inserted for upcoming elections.
The poll you linked was conducted before the bill passed. I explicitly stated that every poll since shows that it is unpopular, which they do.
"The BBC poll found that more than two-thirds of people (67 per cent) have not been following the debate closely." - Taken right from the article you posted. Once people realised what the bill actually meant they changed their minds.
Ok, so this is transphobic, thanks for clarifying that lol. People are already getting their documentation changed, so removing some of the barriers isnâ€™t going to cause the sky to fall like the transphobes are yammering about.
Aside from the fact that the bill is extremely unpopular with the electorate which was shown by repeated polls and section 35 being written into the Scotland Act meaning it is part of devolution there is nothing in the bill that safeguards the people most affected by it, Women.
The believe trans women are sexual predators is nothing but transphobic and is in fact a pass down from 60s-80s homophobia.
