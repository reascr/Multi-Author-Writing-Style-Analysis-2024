Upside is if the Pope is concerned about losing a Church in a country than that makes me happy as the shit edifice is crumbling. All hierarchic organized religion is a cancer on the world without exceptions. The only just faith is one exclusively between you and your deity that no one knows about and you don't ever once impose it's values on others. Anything that crosses that absolute hiddenness and touches on anyone else's life I have no qualms with letting it be destroyed and smashed to pieces. The fact of the matter is simple: my life and pursuit of my true self is infinitely of greater importance than any made up relationship with an imaginary sky being.
The funny bit is it looks like an old monument, the kind you'd see dedicated to someone, but really it's like a billboard ad. It just says "get 40 days of indulgence for one Pater and one Ave prayers".
In a small village in Britanny, I've seen a church with an engraved stele in front of it. No idea how old the stele is, the church itself is 19th century, but the stone probably came later.
