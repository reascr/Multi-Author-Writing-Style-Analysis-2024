Comments out here literally saying we should withhold medication from people. Without medication there will be waves of death across the country of mainly children and the elderly.
So lets them have their own medicine - you don't want to play by rules of civilised countries, so you also don't get to reap their benefits.
Only way this will stop is regime change in Russia, and only way that happens is when population is so desperate and pissed that they fear for their future more than they fear their government. Se lets stop being naive, this deifnetly will get much worse before it gets better, and I would like it to get worse for the Russians rather than for the Ukrainians.
I fully consider any politician wanting to do that to be pretty much a murderer. Food, water, medicine, basic shelters and such should not be sanctioned, under any circumstances.
The way Russia is targetting civilians and civillian infrastructure, weaponizing food etc; which threatens the survivability of the Ukrainian and poor countries around the world and would be quite similar here, so shipping medicine to Russia is just taking a moral high stance.
Putin is a sympton of a larger problem in Russia so the population is not blameless. Possible suffering among the Russian population is not really a high priority for those in charge there and shouldnâ€™t really be for western leaders either.
