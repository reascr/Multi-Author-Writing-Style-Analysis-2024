An interesting detail not mentioned there is that in the pov video you can see one of the Russians on the ground looking back at his armed comrade, knowing what’s about to happen. In the drone footage of the aftermath you can see that same dude managed to run a few steps before being gunned down. To me that makes it very clear it wasn’t an execution but a return fire that was over in mere seconds.
I'm not sure if he knew what was going to happen (i lean toward it being an om the spot ambush rather then planned), but he did know one of their number was and so undermined the surrender process more then I imagine he was willing to risk. But play stupid games win stupid prizes.
I might need to watch the video again, it was hard to tell whether there were any cuts to it. It looked like it cut forward a few moments to show the point the Russian soldier appearing and taking shots. So i got a slightly different impression based off how the continuity came across. So in that case I may have interpreted incorrectly.
I also thought he was in on it but I don't think so anymore. I'd love to hear why you think he managed to run a few steps.
I suppose you're referring to 8 (beginning to count at the one closest to the ukrainians). In the last frame before the camera pans away, it seems to me he's looking down again. Also, in the aftermath he still seems to be about where he was (his head roughly at the hip of 7).
