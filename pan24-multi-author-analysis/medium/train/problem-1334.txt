It's true. It was more indirect calling it the lynchings based on Hindu nationalism fake news, having his ministers visit convicted lynchers etc. He's way smarter than doing it openly, he's more like Trump, in that he encourages hate while rejecting the fact that he does it. Like when Trump meets extremist neo nazi leaders and then says that they aren't that bad or that he just sat by their side.
After modi became PM he couldn’t be able to say/do extreme things as much as his supporters wanted due to the position as a PM and relationships to the Middle East.
Now they aren’t satisfied as they need more extreme guys as leaders and things are going out of the control of shah-modi.
But modi-shah team is on a mission to reduce the power of democracy, first it was media and laws, now they are strategically attacking judiciary to fully hijack it as well. Anyway their supporters are dumb enough to even understand this, what they need is open extremism and open toxic Masculinity leaders like Yogi.
