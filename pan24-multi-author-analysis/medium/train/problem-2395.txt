Ok the graph is accurate, but that’s also not the purpose of the senate to have equal representation. That’s the purpose of the house. Now if you want to get into some of the bullshit that’s gone on that creates graphs just like the above for the house, then have at it, because that issue should have every person enraged.

The purpose of the senate is to prevent an excess of democracy, and it has served that purpose very well. It’s important to remember how few people actually voted for the Republican minority throwing a wrench into things. Gerrymandering has the same effect on the house (states are basically large gerrymandered districts without the requirement of roughly equal populations), though it would be a much more complicated graph with a smaller effect size.
Certainly recent immigrants are treated no better, but Hispanic Americans who've been in the US longer than immigrants from eastern Europe (in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and surrounding states) are a target demographic for Republicans.
