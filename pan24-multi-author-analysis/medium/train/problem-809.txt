It's crazy how much Russia relies on radioactivity for relevance and clout. Article says they wanted to capture Ukrainian nuclear plants - to threaten Europe with accidents.
That's the only issue with nukes, once you're exposed as being all bark no bite, you're a laughingstock. But if anyone ever bites with nuclear radiation, not only do they likely poison the very thing they want but they've just set the entire world against them and risk surprise regime change.
It fits their MO and desired image though - silent, unnoticed, deadly. Too bad no one perceives Russia that way anymore. Russia used to be like radiation. Now it's more like North Korea.
(Over and above invading Ukraine and so making any country ever willingly giving up nuclear weapons again a sadly unlikely prospect).
Another consequence of Russias threat filled rhetoric about using nukes is that if sometime down the line they ever find themselves in a position where they truly face what they regard as an actual existential threat nobody is going to believe them if they issue a sincere ultimatum. They’re now like the ‘boy who cried Wolf’.
