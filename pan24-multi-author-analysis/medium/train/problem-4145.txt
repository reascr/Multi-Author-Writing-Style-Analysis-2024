Plus the dems have a chance to pull the ole reddit switcharoo and say that because the nation was founded by the use of the smoothbore flintlock musket during our revolution that should be the national gun. Or maybe the Kentucky rifle giving the south a bit of a bone.
How does that even make sense? Aside from just being absurd in general, it isn't practical. We'd need to keep changing it as new guns are made. Can you imagine if Barry here was born in the 1700's and was trying to make the flintlock our national gun?
We have state and national things. state flowers and animals and even the national bird. Yeah it's dumb and just pandering but it isn't like having a national "thing" is entirely alien.
Personally I would say that the national gun of America should either be the classic 1911 or the M1 garand. Because of their history. Something a bit more special than the Honda civic of rifles.

Sure. But while it may not be classified as a firearm, it's clearly a gun. And all that other stuff just makes it even better to be our national gun. Flintlocks for everyone!
