Of course it won't get better. The House is a republican-filled circus and most of their platform was crafted on a whim for the optics. They want to muddy the water so that the actions of the Trump administration and the republican party that stood by him somehow seem less egregious. Most of their so-called platform are non-starters for democrats, so what you are left with is gridlock and optics votes, and that's what the next 2 years are going to be.
