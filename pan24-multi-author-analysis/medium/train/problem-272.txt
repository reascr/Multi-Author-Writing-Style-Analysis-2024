I've been following the conflict as best as I can and am definitely concerned for Ukraine (obviously I guess). My biggest fear is the West in general losing steam on its support and Russia dragging it out. As a direct threat to the West though I think Russia has set itself back pretty significantly. While they were never meant to fight a war of this magnitude at partial mobilization, it's hard to argue that the Russian military has underperformed to a pretty big degree. Recommend any of the War on the Rocks podcasts with Michael Kofman, he's a terrific expert on Russia.
"A Pacific aircraft carrier enters a time warp and finds itself transported from 1980 to 1941 - just before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The captain is forced to decide whether to strike at the approaching Japanese fleet and change the entire course of the World War II.".
It's a cheesy 80s SciFi movie. I liked it but I grew up watching all those c list cheesy SciFi channel movies. If you like those kind of movies probably.
