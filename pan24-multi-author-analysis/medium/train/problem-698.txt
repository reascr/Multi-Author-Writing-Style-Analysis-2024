We also had another one in Canada yesterday and another in Montana, with reports from South America and Asia of sightings coming in too about Uap sightings. Montana was of such worry in fact they scrambled a bunch of jets and closed the air space for a while, and according to the senator of Montana the object is still there and they are waiting till this morning to shoot it down, according to the senator.
The other two UFOs are very different, but none of the info released seems to indicate whether they are also balloons or are instead drones. But I guess that's not the important part: what matters is their purpose.
this is such a fascinating story. the few details they have shared seem to almost purposefully make you want to imagine something pretty out of the ordinary as if it was just another spy balloon I feel they would have said that by now.
