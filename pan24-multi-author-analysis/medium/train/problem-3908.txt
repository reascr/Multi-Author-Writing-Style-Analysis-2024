If they would be threatened with jail time, i think it would be a very different world we live in. The CEO likely wouldn’t have approved these cuts and let trains not following strict security checks if 20 years of his life was on the line.
Or they should just nationalize their asses. If you are a threat to national security, which they clearly are at this point, then they should not be allowed to operate idependently anymore.
There are certain regulations which are required to follow operate at all. Sure you can attempt to ignore them, but it’s your business you’ll lose and not just a few thousand dollars.
I'm not sure why the carriages derailed or why such dangerous chemicals weren't better protected, but we need these companies to improve their practices, and if fines help, then that's surely a good thing.
