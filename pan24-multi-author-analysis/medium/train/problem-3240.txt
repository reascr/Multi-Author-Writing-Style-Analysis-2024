Turkey would sustain huge losses If they were to try something and that's without even counting NATO's response.
I’ve just spent time in Turkey and there still seems to be some resentment at the Greeks and what they did as they were forced out.
Very popular, at least with some groups. This isn’t the only thing Erdy does, he also plays up the dying economy, panders to islamists, and conveniently gets to respond to the regular af pre-election “terror attack.”.
Greece also has a very functional armed forces, with air force that is more modernized than Turkey's right now.
It was also the 100 year anniversary of the liberation of Izmir and the people came out to celebrate in their millions.
If Turdogan dose anything to Greece can we then get rid of him and the bird country? I know this is likely just bluster for the election, but still how ma y threats against a nato and EU country will be accepted.
Sure, but Turdogan is threatening to invade another Nato county. Surely you don't get to stay in the club if you do that, at least not if he actually follows through with the threat.
