As others have pointed out the audience for the article is clearly the indian public, and the speaker is Russia. Just scroll a little further down the page to see headlines like "Putin strongly praises indians." This is a great in the wild example of actual government psy-ops attempting to alter military outcomes by manufacturing wedges to drive between allies.
I hate to break it to you guys, but the attitude is mostly apathy and indifference, and the rhetoric is usually in response to a specific event or article. As far as any thoughts and attitudes towards Hinduism, it’s pretty close to absent.
That was a weird read, as someone in the “The West”… because outside of articles that mostly Indian people post on subs like this… we rarely think or talk about India. If there’s a disaster or some big event, sure, and recently when India decided to stick with Russia, there’s some talk. Even then, it’s mostly in response to Indians, Hindutva brgades, and others using the “India is for India, stop criticizing our choices” articles.
yeah the article has no grounding in reality. frankly most american's are completely ignorant not just about india, but of india.
