"The Justice Department has a longstanding policy against divulging private information on ongoing investigations — and it’s not about to start making exceptions because some far-right members of Congress have some weird conspiracy theories.".
You don't run the DOJ, we don't answer to you. In fact, you are currently under investigation. It wouldn't look proper to give a subject of a criminal investigation control or input in said investigations. In short, we invite you to pound sand and keep your poncho on because you're in the splash zone of indictments.
