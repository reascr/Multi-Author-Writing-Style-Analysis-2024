Well they were on the verge of launching nukes into Ukraine when cooler heads prevailed and they can either start nuking Ukraine or attempt to attack the US, NATO, or other allies escalating a war that our president has no hesitations about supporting.
From the beginning they threatened utter immediate destruction like the world has never seen ... if the West gave ANY military aid ... after the West already had.
I'm sure we did similar signalling over Iranian drones, it costs very little to sabre rattle in this situation and if it works you save yourself a lot of pain.
I don't see why we don't supply the longer range rockets for Himars (ATACMS), its range is no greater than existing Ukrainian weapons, and it doesn't violate arms control agreements as far as I know. Compared to the Iranian drones they are short range. Think Putin out psyched the west.
We are dying for them to do it. Those systems will be so full of analytic software to gauge success in tracking and engagement of what the Russians throw at it... we probably have a wish list for them to shoot...
It wasn't hippies that warned of the "Military/Industrial Complex"... It was Dwight D. Eisenhower, former commander of allied forces Europe, in this famous speech as president in his 1961 farewell address.
NATO has loads of Gepards in storage, although rounds are scarce because it isn't used much any more. Ukraine is already using them, seems an obvious choice, but possibly maintenance is an issue as no one was planning to use them.
