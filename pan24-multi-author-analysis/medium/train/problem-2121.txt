While it is still hard to say how many tanks Russia had pre war, it is certain they have lost a shitload of them.
If we got just by visually confirmed losses as tracked by the , Russia has lost 1733 tanks. 1020 of those being destroyed, 80 damaged, 86 abandoned, and 547 captured.
Now is russia building more of their "modern" systems such as the T-90Ms? Yes, but at a seemingly reduced capability as they have been .
According to Grigori F. Krivosheev: "All losses of arms and equipment are counted as irrecoverable losses, i.e. beyond economic repair or no longer serviceable"[16].
- 83,500 tanks lost: 5,200 heavy tanks, 44,900 medium tanks, 33,400 light tanks (including 11,900 Lend-Lease tanks and self-propelled guns lost[17]).
- 37,600 Armoured car and half-track (including 5,000 Lend-Lease armoured personnel carriers lost[17])".
Most likely they themselves do not know how many tanks they have that are actually operational. The Soviet Union had immense reserves, but most of those fell victim to technical cannibalism and simple rust. And they have to defend an insanely long border, some of it they share with China.
Hey, you can't lay all the blame on Russia. Ukraine is using a new technology - super duper secret magnetic mines. Russian tank drivers are helpless as their tanks are drawn right into a minefield, one after the other.
