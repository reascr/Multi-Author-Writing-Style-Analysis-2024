This source must be right wing, they attempt to pretend for several paragraphs there is opposition to helping Ukraine on the left, when there really isn't.
"With their message, several Republicans atop key national security committees are trying to show that not only do they support Ukraine, they will do so more enthusiastically than Democrats and the White House. ".
Good to see republicans supporting Ukraine and not siding with Russia on this. The article points out that people like gaetz and Greene will still probably be against funding, but you won't see a majority of republicans be against it.
I do not think those reps care what the best interest of the United States is. That is not why they are elected. Look at their districts, the people there do not see Russia, China, North Korea as their enemies. They see democrats as their enemies. What is best for the country doesn't matter for people in those areas, what matters is fighting democrats.
The US continuing to support Ukraine in concert with our allies is critical. Fucknuts like Greene, Gosar and Gaetz who (rightfully) warn about China don’t seem to understand the broader implications of a Russian victory — only one of them being the message and the rewards it would send to a Chinese regime licking its lips over a similar invasion of Taiwan.
