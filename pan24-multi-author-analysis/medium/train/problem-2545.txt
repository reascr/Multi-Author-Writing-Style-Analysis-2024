i lose all desire to drink for like weeks or months after i eat some. super helpful for us alcoholics!
I do mushrooms a lot. Still alcoholic. Tried Vivitrol shots which worked great for the alcohol but made me dizzy and started dropping things.
Then you just deal with baclofen withdrawal later as well, which often times resembles the same type of withdrawal. Although I donâ€™t think death can come from baclofen like alcohol and benzodiazepines.
In his 2008 book, Le Dernier Verre (translated literally as The Last Glass or The End of my Addiction), French-American cardiologist Olivier Ameisen described how he treated his alcoholism with baclofen. Inspired by this book, an anonymous donor gave $750,000 to the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands to initiate a clinical trial of high-dose baclofen, which Ameisen had called for since 2004. The trial concluded, "In summary, the current study did not find evidence of a positive effect of either low or high doses of baclofen in AD patients. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that baclofen is an effective medication for the treatment of severe, heavy drinking AD patients not responding to or not accepting routine psychosocial interventions.".
have had success in the past with Kratom to help with drinking, since you can take it all day every day, and it's not intoxicating. dependency no worse than regular marijuana use.
1x per week shrooms, hasn't helped me quit drinking, but its certainly works as an anti-depressant and more effectively than 1x per day Prozac did, when i had health insurance.
note, recently found out that Kratom will block shroom intox if you take it the same day. supposedly SSRIs do the same thing too.
