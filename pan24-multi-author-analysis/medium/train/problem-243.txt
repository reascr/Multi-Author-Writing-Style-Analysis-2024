The Model 3 is on the list for Midsize Luxury cars, and the Model Y is on the list for Midsize Luxury SUV, and both have Top Safety Pick + ratings, the highest rating category on that website. Note, they're not listed at the top of either category's list because the listings are in alphabetical order, thus placing Acura at the top of each category list. Both models have the same highest rating for last year, but the Model Y isn't on the 2020 and earlier lists because it didn't start being delivered until Q2 2020, too late to make the 2020 tests for that year. The Model 3 has the Top Safety Pick + rating every year back to 2018, the first year it was available for testing since the first deliveries weren't made until Q3 2017.

The IIHS and HLDI are not the only entities that do safety testing on vehicles, there's also the National Highway Traffic Safety Institute, a federal government agency. A search at the NHTSA ratings database for Tesla Model S and X indicate that all years and variations of those have five star safety ratings in all testing categories, the highest available rating:
