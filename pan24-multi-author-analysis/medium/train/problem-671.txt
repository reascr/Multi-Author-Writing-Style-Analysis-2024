I still believe it comes down to how logistic and production fare on the battlefield rather than firepower and tactics. Sure these tanks would help however russian logistic is still holding.
Russian logistics are holding (mostly, the lack of quality steel is really hurting them) at the strategic level, but they're struggling at the tactical level.
I don't know if it was by design or not, but NATO slow-walking artillery in stages to the Ukrainians has been devastating to Russian supplies. Every time we roll out a new artillery system that increases the range of Ukrainian fire missions, Russia loses a whole mess of ammo and supply depots and is forced to push them even further back.
We can't do much about Russia's ability to railroad in supplies from all over their country, even the far reaches in the east, but it's becoming increasingly hard for Russia to move shells from the unloading points to the front line. It's one of several reasons Russia's artillery usage has fallen off heavily.
My worry is that Russia is using this as an opportunity to rework their critically worn barrels. I wish we had some more information on that. We had all kinds of stories in late Q3 and early Q4 of 2022 about Russian artillery barrels reaching end-of-life, but very little since.
