There's also a big sampling bias. The idea that "Police-submitted request to the ATF" is a direct corollary to the rate at which ghost guns are used in crimes is a rather large leap. It's as much about whether police bother submitting the trace to the ATF as it is their actual use.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
