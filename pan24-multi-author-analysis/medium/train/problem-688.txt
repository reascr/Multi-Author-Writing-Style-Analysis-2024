I sincerely appreciate your empathy. We need more of this. I a have a family member who was a vehement COVID denier and anti vaxxer. He almost died and is now tethered to an oxygen bottle. Wife and kids got vaxxed on the QT. Hamstrung the rest of his life. It amazes me how "small government" folks are willing to enforce how the rest of us live, but sure do want flood, hurricane and tornado relief and want to send our people to brown countries as a weapons testing ground without limits of in addition to somehow being against letting Medicare negotiate prices. Gonna need joint pain medication from the gymnastics. We can do better.
