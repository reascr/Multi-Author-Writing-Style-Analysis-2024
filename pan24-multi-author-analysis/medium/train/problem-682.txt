The exit polls showed big differences in how people think inflation is effecting them depending on party affiliation. Other voters aren't immune. Fact is the media has been emphasizing inflation and falsely tying it to Biden all year, while rarely covering the great parts of the economy like quality job growth.
We could have inflation drop to 0% and most Republicans would still think inflation is high and creating severe burdens for them. Republicans in particular consistently view economic conditions through a hyper-partisan lens. The stock market soared under Obama but most Republicans think it either dropped or stayed flat. Most Republicans think Trump was great on jobs despite weaker growth during his first 3 years compared to Obama's last 3. Jobs under Biden are outstanding so far.
