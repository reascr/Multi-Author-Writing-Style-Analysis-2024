It’s actually for their ears not ours as the shooter. A well designed rifle caliber suppressor is supposed to mask the report of the rifle to those being fired at, making it harder to decipher which direction the incoming rounds are coming from.
I watched a video on how to load an AK drum magazine, it looked like a hell of a lot of effort for the results. You don’t just push them in from the top one at a time like a regular magazine. You have to remove the back and load them in from behind in a way that seemed a little tedious.
Yes, I’m sure that one of many reasons. Doesn’t change the fact that even a suppressed 5.56 rifle can still be greater than 130 decibels, remaining to be not hearing safe without ear-pro. Hearing protection certainly not the main reason for their invention or wide spread use, more-or-less a happy side effect.
You’d still not want to use drum mags over normal mags for the same reason that’s always agreed upon. Storing drum mags is a pain in the ass, they are big and heavier. In the same space you can put a few drum mags in you could put many more normal mags.
