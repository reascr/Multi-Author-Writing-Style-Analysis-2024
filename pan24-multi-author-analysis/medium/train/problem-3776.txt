When the little first aid kit I’ve thrown into all of my vehicles ‘just in case’ is more more than what’s given to someone headed to combat, yeah I can’t imagine.
Maybe the tactic is to get it so low that it loops back to super high.(like Gandhi’s meter in the old civ games when make him mad once instant nuking).
Russians aren’t stupid people. Just as in Soviet times the propaganda isn’t believed as much as it seems, even though the majority pretend to take it at face value. The reality though is that due to the culture & systems in place people are too afraid to speak out against what is said or to even admit they don’t believe it. In that same regard, they are relatively powerless to do anything about it unless the masses mobilize against it, which is something their government is designed to avoid. I think once the masses start getting deployed from Moscow and Saint Petersburg we’ll start seeing more unrest as people grow more confident speaking out & the most gullible begin to see the reality. Until then they’ll happily keep sending minorities and the farmers & the like from rural areas. The current playbook seems so dead set on military victory they are forgetting that even if they somehow won, economic stagnation and decline will leave them worse off, new territory or not.
