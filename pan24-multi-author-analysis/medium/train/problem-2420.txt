I'm still flabbergasted by the cognitive dissonance it actually takes to think abortion isn't interconnected to the other issues these people claim are more important. They want us to believe the economy and environment and health care are not connected to reproductive rights?! Uhm, one of the biggest changes to the economy was Roe v. Wade; people could actually decide whether or not to go through a pregnancy versus whether or not to leave or take a job. The environment is impacted by humans and having a system in place where people who don't want to add to the humam count, is environmentally friendly. And obviously, reproductive rights of all kinds are health care, and yet some people treat it like it's not. The list goes on with how having control over ones body is definitely a huge top ticket item. I'm glad young people came out to prove the point.
