The people in Davos generally don't run their businesses. They own (shares in) corporations and/or portfolios and have hired managers to do the work, most of whom have very different philosophies than entrepreneurs (shareholder value). Anyone that is aware of the way things have developed at Boeing after McDonnel-Douglas bough them with their own money, as an example, will know the difference. Increasingly these people have inherited their wealth and have not a single entrepreneurial cell in their system. They do not work hard, except if it's a hobby. We now have an economic system of inherited financial wealth, not entrepreneurial, earned wealth. Kind of like feudalism. Big difference. So you won't find many traditional owner-managers of SMEs in Davos because they really aren't rich enough and too busy fending of corporate competition or meeting the requirements of their corporate customers (e.g. suppliers of car manufacturers having to reduce the cost of the same parts by 3% annually, which is a real thing, or having to compete with copies of their own products on Amazon, made by Amazon and promoted by Amazon on Amazon). SME owner-managers are, in effect, a part of the middle class now and a threatened species. Imao.
This is just a safe comment from a few to make them look good, it’s just rich people virtue signaling.
They realize that the mega donors for the DNC and RNC won’t let those things happen, even if they ask for them.
