Why release this at Christmas? The break was a mistake, IMO. I was intently watching the hearings...and then they stopped...for months...and I wasn't as interested. Strange to now turn this on the public = no fanfare headlines. They really fumbled the momentum of those early hearings and probably could have recommended criminal charges in July. Now, we're not as interested because it's almost 2 years later and we don't need to be convinced of what we saw. Charge him or STFU.
