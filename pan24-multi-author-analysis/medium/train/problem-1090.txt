Pictured is a non-disposable vape with someone filling new juice, while the article talks almost entirely about disposable vapes. Thanks Guardian for not bothering to differentiate between the two.
Disposable vapes are awful and need to be banned worldwide. Too much plastic and battery waste for a couple hundred puffs. Refillable pods and coils go way longer.
Well said and Agreed. Always thought those disposables were convenient but horrible long term. Those bottles seem recyclable l. Just plastic and lasts the user a long time from what I've seen. Not to mention how demonized e cigs have become and yet saved thousands, millions of lives maybe for former smokers. Saved millions in hospital bills probably.
Yep, this is exactly how my mom quit smoking. Cold Turkey / tapering never worked for her so she bought some rechargeable & refillable e-cigs (w/ extra batteries), got various strenhs of vape juice, and just gradually diluted it over time until she got all the way down to 0mg Nicotine then just forced herself to put it down for good.
ETA: TBF, this was before disposables existed but I think she still would have gone this route since I donâ€™t think you can have such fine control over the nicotine content with disposables.
