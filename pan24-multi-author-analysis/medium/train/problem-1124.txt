“Undercover drag queen is going to destroy ultra right party through infiltration, subterfuge, and endless stream of queer flamboyance!
This is amazing...I could give 2 craps if someone dresses in drag. But how the far right republicans go after drag and then someone who aligns with them is secretly doing it is just comically entertaining. This movement doesn't know what it stands for but it knows it hates something and just wants to be angry.
It’s not that they’re scared of what they did/do, it’s that they’re bad people and bad people are two faced, hypocritical, lying sacks of shit. They shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near government jobs..
