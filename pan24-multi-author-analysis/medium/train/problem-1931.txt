Seen your "military tech" first hand in Serbia when the pride of your aviation, the invisible, one and only F117a littered the fields around Belgrade with the help of a soviet anti aircraft system made in 1961, operated by a baker. The entire campaign was a disaster as Serbia, which is like 5 times smaller both in terms of population and military budget, than Ukraine held the front line vs Albanian side trained, equipped, and supported by USA + entirety of NATO members' aviation, artillery and special forces mercenaries, who made huge advances of 1km into the front only to get pushed back, then USA did what it does the best - it resorted to international terrorism and bombed civilians and infrastructure (the very same thing they are accusing Russia off now) to make the Serbs sign the capitulation. If they came via ground invasion they'd need a bigger wall than the one they use to write all the names of those who were bringing peace and freedom to Vietnam.
Amazing how well a motovated defender with proper supply lines is against a conscript forced out with the bare minimum (if that) gear and supply lines.
