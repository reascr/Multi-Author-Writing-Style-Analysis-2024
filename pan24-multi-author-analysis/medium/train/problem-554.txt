At a meeting between President Putin and Russia's top military officers, Defence Minister Shoigu recognized that the Ministry had been confronted with difficulties following the President's command to call up 300,000 reserves to fight in Ukraine. \\\"Since the commencement of partial mobilization, the Russian Defence Ministry has had to contend with certain issues\\\", the Minister commented in Moscow.
What's more ridiculous is that their media treats everything that Putin says as a fact and a final decision, then as soon as he does or decides something else, they pretend that it was already that way or come up with an excuse.
"Look, we're not starting a war, Putin said we are only holding a military exercise. The West gets worried about this for no reason".
"Look we weren't going invade the entire country and capitulate the country, we are now focusing on our main plan to get rid of the Azov fascists in eastern Ukraine".
Russian troops retreat from Kyiv and North of Ukraine, Putin announces that their next phase is focused on Southeast of Ukraine.
"Look, it says partial... PAARTIAAL, not full, so technically it doesn't count and there wont be anymore mobilisation efforts.".
"Guys... look at the priorities... these things are common in a war. I'm not saying that this is one.".
Isn’t it a jail-able offense to disagree with putin or their military as a citizen? I’d hate it. They do something stupid and you call it stupid, go to jail. So it seems like a shocking amount of their lives is saying as little as possible, to avoid saying something that sounds contrary to the party-line and boom… jail. Zelensky said it well that their citizens need to defeat the kremlin “in their minds”. They’re mentally enslaved.
