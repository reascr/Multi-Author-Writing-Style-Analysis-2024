Technically you are correct. All that happens at the point of zero emissions is that the rate of heating stops accelerating. There is hope when we get methane emissions to net zero. Methane contributes about 50% of the present heating and has a half-life of around 12 so there is a prospect of reducing the rate of heating from that point. Shame we are only targeting 2050 for the turnover point. We should aim for ASAP. Another28 years of accelerating heating and worsening climate impacts will be disastrous.
They weren't talking to us millennials and younger, they were talking to our parents generation, the ones who refused to believe it was going to be a problem and kept(keep) voting for criminals who are actively making the problems accelerate exponentially.
Hahaha we are the kids and grandkids of the ones who exasperated the issues. Like this has been a long way coming, it's just now the snowball became an avalanche.
Chances are the people complaining about ‘issues will be seen by our kids and grandkids’ were Baby Boomers.
And they’re quick to blame their kids and grandkids for all the world’s problems instead of taking responsibility.
