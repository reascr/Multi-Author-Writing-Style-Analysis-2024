The reason is loss of face. The great leader is always "correct". I was living in Shanghai during the time when they were demonizing western vax. They've dug themselves into quite the hole here.
Five minutes later refusing to import western mRNA vax even though they've been shown to be more effective.
So, where are their rhetoric of respecting other countries sovereignity ? If China don't want other countries to meddle in it's internal affair or violate their sovereignity, they should have hold on to that ideal themselves.
Five minutes later releasing some propaganda video on state media touting that they have the most high-speed rail lines and advanced infrastructure or whatever.
Well, there's a pretty good little video from that can give you an idea, but tl;dr the NYPD has stations and offices all over the world (like, 14 different countries or something), and has a budget that puts it (depending on the source) somewhere between the twentieth and thirtieth largest military budgets in the world.
