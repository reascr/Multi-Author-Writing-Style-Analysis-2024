Being upset at israel is not hating jews. And the fact that every time someone says something critical of israel someone calls them anti semetic is so fucking stupid. The government of Israel is commiting genocide on Palestinians, but apparently pointing that out means i hate jewish people?
Lets be honest, shootings will only be allowed whin in danger OR there are no cameras present. If someone is shot, deny it. Then say Palestinians did it. Then say militarily needed, no matter the circumstance. And anyway, even if found guilty, worst is some community service and a smack on the wrist with a soft rag.
It’s a tragedy when anyone resorts to shooting or rock throwing, but if I have a gun and you are throwing rocks at my head…you should probably expect to be shot. This is common sense.
When I was young in the 60's and 70's Israel stood for something good. No longer. Basically a racist state. I cannot see much difference between modern Israel and South Africa during the worst of apartheid. And Netanyahu's government is just going to make it all worse.
