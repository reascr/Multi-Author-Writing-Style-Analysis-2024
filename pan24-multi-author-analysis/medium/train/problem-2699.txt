As good as it would be to see her out, even if she wins, watching her sweat for the last few days has been delicious, after her predictions of the Red wave on Twitter. It will continue to be delicious through a recount, followed by the next two years spent screaming about nothing and failing to impeach Biden given the razor thin House majority.
Then a much more difficult election for her during the Presidential election cycle in 2024, especially if she continues to do insane things, which she invariably will.
Yep conservitive blood is in the water and we are going to be chomping at the bit to get a taste. She is vulnerable and we will get her seat either this time or next time.

Colorado election rules trigger a mandatory recount for any race where the difference is less than 0.5% of votes received by the winning candidate.
Ballots can still arrive from overseas and be counted until Nov. 16. Plus ballots that need verification will need to be counted. So until then, with such a slim margin between the candidates, the race won’t be called. Those ballots could make a big difference in the outcome.
Depending on how the recount process plays out, that could mean weeks’ worth of delays before the winner is officially announced. On top of that, due to state law requiring vote verification, a recount can’t be ordered until November 30 at the earliest.
