Further, for practical purposes, it would make it harder for the Supreme Court to implement the legally correct but unpopular decision. The Court has usually (not always) been a force for progressive change if anything, and when it has ruled in a bad way (like in Plessy or Korematsu) , it was usually to rubber stamp something already happening, not to change the law for the worse like it did in Dobbs. On the other hand, in cases like Miranda v. Arizona, Brown v. Board of Education, Worcester v. Georgia, and Roe v. Wade itself, the Court came to a VERY progressive but probably unpopular or controversial positions that would have been jeopardized had the public, Congress, or the President known what was going to happen. Congress even passed a law trying to undo Miranda after it was decided, but the Court struck that law down (iirc weirdly enough a conservative justice who was AGAINST Miranda wrote the opinion saying Congress had no power to overturn it). In my opinion the idea that the Justices shouldn't deliberate in private is something that sounds like a good idea but would have been disastrous historically. On the other hand, if the Court was doing anything too crazy you'd likely see a leak... which is one of the things that makes me think that the leaker was a well-meaning pro-choice supporter, though I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was a conservative clerk, especially given how they've completely trashed all the respect for the Supreme Court.
