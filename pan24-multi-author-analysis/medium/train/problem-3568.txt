It's hard to keep up with the ongoing atrocities but this one really hits hard. Who in their right mind could possibly look at these actions and argue that they're simply trying to maintain law and order?
No man you are reducing what those iranian women are going through getting gangraped by guards every day in cells on a large scale with no legal recourse and nothing that they or anybody can do even if exposed. And then I have many friends in iran and have friends who were imprisoned under these circumstances, you cannot compare it to anything in western countries. There are truly shocking stories even if you are aware of the worst american police abuse. Young girls shaking in shock with bleeding anuses from getting raped, getting dragged out of hospitals by their guards. Every young girl in iran is terrorized by these cases, they are all afraid to be abducted by the government for any random reason. Sorry for being so graphic but these ridiculous comparisons to american police should stop.
