If the electricity company can supply 10 electricity and buyers demand 5, they can drop the price to encourage more buyers into the market or existing buyers to increase their demand. Either way, they want to sell their electricity.
They'll come down when solar or gas reach near total of meeting the U.K's needs. To have replaced a quarter of the country's energy in a decade is phenomenal but U.K customers have been the financiars of this transformation and will continue to be if the country wants to replace all fossil fuel generating stations.
If the electricity company can supply 10 electricity and buyers demand 15, they increase the price of the 10 until some buyers are priced out and they get the best price possible for their 10 electricity.
That’s not necessarily greed, it’s more that price is what we use to represent the value of the electricity to a buyer. Rather than allocating via price, alternatives would be rationing, supplying favourite buyers, etc.
This is open to abuse when electricity companies artificially constrain supply which keeps prices higher than they need to be for longer. In theory a competitor could undercut them, but they might all choose to independently keep prices high _without needing to collude_ (typically illegal) because it is in all their interests to do so.
The main problem is that energy underpins everything so when demand massively outstrips supply and prices.
rise, they have to get astronomically high for enough buyers to say “actually, I don’t want/can’t afford energy at that price” to set a ceiling on the market.
