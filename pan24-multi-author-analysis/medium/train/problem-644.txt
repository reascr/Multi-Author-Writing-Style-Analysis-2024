The Han Dynasty of China won a war against the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, which ruled much of modern day Afghanistan at the time. They were in it for horses rather than territorial control though.
And unlike the West, which still tries to not commit too many war crimes, China would care very little about that. Civilian deaths would be intentional, not accidental or collateral.
It’s kinda the problem with conscripts, especially when the conscripts are coddled only children who are used to their parents and grandparents treating them like little emperors.
If families start losing their fathers, husbands, sons etc wholesale the party will have a much weaker grip on power.
They don’t want to fight. They want other dudes to fight and die for them, so that they are the ones who survive long enough to find a wife.
China absolutely would not send its people to the meat grinder. The Communist Party remains in power because it receives the tacit acceptance/indifference of the majority of people, while quickly suppressing the display and spread of any dissent which threatens their power.
