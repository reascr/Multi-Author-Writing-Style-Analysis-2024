Obviously, it is crazy that Ukraine and Russia would negotiate in the US, let alone Arizona. But more importantly, it's reprehensible that he imply the US is treating Ukrainians like cannon fodder. They want this fight. They are fighting for their land, their children, their very existence. Of course the human cost is high, but if Ukraine were to not fight, the cost would be even higher. From listening to Ukrainians, both through the media and in actual human interactions, they accept the need to fight. Of course they would prefer not to, but they know no peace with Russia can be lasting, at least not with the current milieu.
