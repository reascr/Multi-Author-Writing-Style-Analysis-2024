During 2007-2008 particularly, our ER swelled with patients who’d either had their hours cut or lost their job entirely as well as their health insurance that went with it. They had nowhere else to go, with no money for cost-prohibitive COBRA plans, and/or they were refused insurance altogether for ‘pre-existing conditions’ (this Republican supported practice is especially evil). Toward the end of ‘08, elective surgeries at our hospital were exploding, with patients claiming they were losing their health insurance and had to have their surgery quickly before it was gone. By early Jan.’09, the OR was practically empty and the hospital began mass layoffs—even staff with 10+ yrs seniority.
