It’s very sad to me that my gay friends risk gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, AIDS, monkeypox, drug overdoses, etc. for the purpose of brief, momentary enjoyment, and I genuinely wish they’d chill with the sex parties and the escorts and find somebody who makes them happy to wake up next to every day. That doesn’t mean I think any less of them for choices other than that. I realize however that I focus more than most on the ultimate outcome rather than the immediate. I don’t want to yuck anybody’s yum, and I think human beings have the right to do anything that doesn’t cause harm to other people, but as a compassionate person it’s impossible for me to think back on my gay friends who have contracted HIV or who are trapped in suicidal despair from sex addiction and not think “I wish you’d have chilled a little bit on Grindr.”.
I feel it's different cause Jay is a name (proper noun), whereas Lady is just a noun, a descriptor, we know A is a lady but still don't necessarily know what's being described.
