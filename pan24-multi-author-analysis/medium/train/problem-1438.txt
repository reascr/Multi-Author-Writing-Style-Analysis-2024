Ever heard of an “editorial”? Every major news publication has them. Often they allow “op-eds”, which this likely is. The Nation is a solid publication. If you’re going to start canceling all your news every time they have an op-ed you don’t like, you’ll have to cancel NYT, WaPo, and every other major publication. But this is Reddit, so I don’t expect most folks to care about that whole “truth” thing. Take what you read on r/politics as gospel. It’s never wrong, and the takes are always from foreign policy experts with deep experience in the field. You can tell from the nuanced “we should bomb Russia back to the stone-age” arguments from all the galaxy brains.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
