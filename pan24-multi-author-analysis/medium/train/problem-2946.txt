>Laws imposing Afrikaans played a role in the oppression of black citizens during the apartheid era, and the language remains controversial in some sectors of society today.
I assume thr 6-7 million people who speak it kind of would be irritated if they gave two fucks who she is. Instead we get to hear from Twitter fuckwits who would be better off keeping to themselves.
lol She isn't a fucking linguist she should keep her mouth shut. Linguists consider a language endangered once it reaches less than 20,000 speakers, and only if few of the next generation are learning to speak it. They eventually get to Critically Endangered (less than 5,000 speakers) then Moribound (only those who learn the language as non-natives are fluent, with no native speakers alive) then Extinct or Dead (no one learns the language to fluency, no one uses it for any daily reason, and there are no native speakers left alive). Afrikaans has 8.4 million speakers. 8.4 Million speakers is far from "dying", and if I'm not mistaken, much better than a lot of languages.
