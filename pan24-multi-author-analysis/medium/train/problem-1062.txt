It's extremely common practice for senior military figures to play up threats and the need for military spending in peace time, in the US and plenty of other countries.
I'm not saying everything is rosy in the world, but I would take everything with a very big grain of salt that is being said by people, who have a massive interest in getting more people to join. Fear mongering is an effective way to do so.
This! Hasn't the US military been complaining for a while that interest for the military was dwindling?
Is the world in a hot mess? Yes. Are there ongoing tensions and conflicts? Yes. But for America, this is officially peace time. You're not at war with anyone. Or have I missed a conflict?
True, it's officially peace time. But only for as long as Russia or China still see America as strong enough to deter them. Western Europe has been too complacent and Russia doesn't see Western European powers as more than a speed bump in terms of protecting NATO's eastern flank. If America were to take the same approach in failing to modernize and increase its military capability there would be both an invasion of Taiwan and an invasion of the Baltics in the next few years with more invasions to follow after that.
Is it really "peace time" when Russia has declared a holy war against the West threatening to attack Nato countries, China is building up to invade Taiwan and threatening the US with war in case US were to interfere, North Korea is doing missile tests it claims are simulations attacks against the US and Iranian regime is acquiring nuclear weapons while its leader is promising death to America?
