Probably the only way it shifts that much (unless there still are some 3k+ votes left) is if some shady shit went down in a county. It seemed odd although certainly not implausible, that while Frisch was leading by <100 votes for a number of days, more than an expected number of votes came in for Boebert from counties that leaned her direction. Multiple parties predicted based on votes left Frisch would hold a lead and then Boebert slammed through that. Again certainly possible, could be nothing, but if this flips I'd guess something shady. "Oh did I say 2,000 Boebert to 500 Frisch?" ... "I swear I said 1,000 Boebert to 800 Frisch!".
