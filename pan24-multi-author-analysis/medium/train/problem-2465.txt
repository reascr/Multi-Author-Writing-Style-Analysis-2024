The ruling party in Delhi brought this on itself. You rightly pointed out that they have done the same thing as their predecessors, nothing. All the blame games, while the citizens of Delhi ruin their health.
Just a week back the chief minister of Delhi had been proudly proclaiming that Delhi isn't in the top 10 on the list of the most polluted cities. The irony of not understanding wind patterns is coming back to bite him.
A large component of this pollution is due to stubble burning in Punjab. Previously, the Delhi govt used to point fingers at Punjab for not taking steps to reduce pollution. This year, the same party is in charge of both the Delhi and Punjab govts, so the onus is really on them to implement actions. Looks like they've failed spectacularly, and are now searching for someone else to blame.
Man, i got downvoted to oblivion when I spoke for farm laws addressing this issue. I had PMs and death threats saying that I was a capitalistic knucklehead and I am wishing death on poor farmers. And now, I hate to be right.
