Prior to being used as Cannon fodder in the ukraine invasion. Most conscripts in the army were often used for basically slave labor to build Dachas and other things for base commanders.
Wouldn't be surprised if the military was partially involved in building thr palace just because the oligarchs and silovhiks use the army like a minion.
In Japan, the raid served to help the navy and the army put away some of their differences and realize they had a bigger enemy to fight than each other. Was it perfect? No, but it was a slap in the face to force them to realize they would have to somewhat act with a common objective.
US morale was terrible becuase they had suffered defeat after defeat in the beggining of the war in the pacific. The raid was not just a way to show the Japanese that there would be consequences, but also to show the US population that it was not a pointless fight.
In the US the attack was a enormous boost to morale. Up to that point, the US had had no significant gainst in the war in the pacific, just defeat after defeat after defeat.
So, no material significance, but people often forget that morale can have much higher military significance than material losses.
