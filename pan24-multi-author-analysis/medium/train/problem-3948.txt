It is so wild seeing the pro Kate brown pro Ted wheeler defund the police crowd vote to give cops the authority to approve or deny gun rights for every individual. What could possibly go wrong. A common theme I hear from Portlanders is that the cops are basically white supremacist slave patrols. Yeah let’s let them choose who can and can’t exercise 2A rights. Doesn’t make any sense.
Yeah, I don't know if OR law makers just weren't paying attention. CA's attempt to greatly restrict CCW after Bruen was very careful to avoid any discretion precisely because of Bruen.
I'm in eastern Oregon, where the cool thing for sheriffs to do has been announce via Facebook that they will not enforce this "unconstitutional" law. Hence, anyone concerned their identity will hinder obtaining a firearm under this law should just enlist the assistance of one of our "constitutional sheriffs"!
Do they actually draft the legislation though? Usually I see the ballot question is something like "should we require a permit to buy a gun" and then the state writes a law that's 200 pages long after the ballot initiative passes.
