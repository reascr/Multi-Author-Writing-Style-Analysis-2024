The way it reads to me seems pretty specific to loans (“requirements”) and the student financial assistance programs. I’m looking at the actual law now. You’re right, people can read this and argue over what exactly was meant for each and every potential case, just like any other law. But I don’t think it’s broad… here, see for . To me, that’s pretty specific and seems to fall right in line with the EdSec’s arguments to allow this go forward. I honestly think the only way to attack this is for the Supreme Court to reeeeaaaallly step all over a co-equal branch of the government. This law was introduced in the house, by the power of the purse, and sailed right through the senate without amendments and landed on the presidents desk. COVID has killed more Americans than any attack on our country ever, and all people experienced hardship (and still are). The law was meant for a moment like this, so it would be fed up for the Supreme Court to intervene.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
