I have a religious coworker who is voting red down the board PURELY because of republican's stance on abortion, they don't give a single fuck about anything else. The person asked me who i am voting for and i said democrat down the board and they asked me why i support murder and i said my stance on abortion is largely irrelevant (i am for it up to the point where the baby can live outside the mom on it's own) i refuse to vote for any republican because of the shit they are doing. Republicans can promise me the world and my stance won't change, their actions have cemented my decision for NEVER vote for them.
