Others have pointed out other things, but the really big recent one was their coverage of an attack on a bus full of children celebrating Hanukkah. The kids got of the bus and were dancing around, and a nearby group of people started making fun of them and acting aggressive so they got back on the bus. When they did, the group started yelling slurs and spitting at them and other things at the bus, again filled with children and their chaperone. The video from inside the bus shows people speaking Hebrew and English, and one person says to "Call someone" in Hebrew. When the vide was broadcast the BBC claimed that this was a racial slur directed at the men attacking the bus and refused to deny it even after multiple groups of native Hebrew speakers said that it was them saying to call someone. BBC then ran with it and had some very biased reporting around it refusing to even entertain that it might not have been a slur until legal action started.
Like that a Palestinian said he wanted to rip a Jew’s head off and BBC intentionally mistranslated the word “Yahudi” (Jew) as “Israeli.” Because it was actually just anti-Zionism, not antisemitism. /s.
