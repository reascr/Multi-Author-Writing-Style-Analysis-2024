The head of the Revolutionary Guard wasn't sanctioned up until this point? What is diplomatic core doing?
The person who benefited most from that assassination seems to be, in retrospect, Putin. Trump's Iran policy left the nation isolated from the west and with good cause to be angry at us.
This situation with Iran in Ukraine is a perfect example of how the United States foreign policy under Trump was so disastrous in so many ways.
Pulling out of the Iran Nuclear deal, drone striking one of their military leaders, and just generally being incapable of conducting diplomacy in general due to loss of career diplomats and inability to appoint effective leadership have driven Iran to the point where they couldn't ally themselves with western nations of they wanted to.
That's not to say they would have done something differently had we handled the diplomacy differently, but I think it's important to note that the Trump administration basically gave them only one choice and forced them to have only Russia to turn to.
Trump systematically destroyed Iran's possible diplomatic ties to the west. Diplomacy likely would not have not prevented them from supporting Russia but it would have given the United States better access to Iran and far more ability to pressure them from assisting Russia.
This is tin foil hat land, but it almost feels like the goal was to intentionally lock them in to being dependent on Russia, especially after the seemingly nonsensical assassination of the Iranian military leader.
Even if it was unintentional, this is clear evidence of how disastrous Trump's foreign policy was for the west. A lot of people will give Trump a pass on foreign policy for some bizarre reason, but this is a concrete example of how terrible it was.
