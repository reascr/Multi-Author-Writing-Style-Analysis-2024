I am seriously starting to believe Musk is purposely trying to destroy Twitter. Twitter has become a major tool for pro union and other activist to organize and that scares the billionaire class.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I'm in the camp that believes authoritarian regimes and the billionaires are colluding to destroy platforms where masses of people could organize to criticize them and expose their lies/crimes. These platforms are not that profitable, it'll take a sponsor with deep pockets to build new social media platforms once facebook/twitter finish imploding, and said conspirators are probably waiting in the wings to be there and control the narrative.
