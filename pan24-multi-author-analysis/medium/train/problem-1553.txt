So what they should do, surrender and don’t push them far enough? Sacrifice territory because russia has nukes? Wait and look how Russia kills them, rape, looting, kills children and deport Ukrainians? Just accept genocide, right?
yes. Have deal with chinease not allowing send planes exchange removing russian nukes. so US have they to many air rockets and no way to use them in ukraine. would solve lots of problem.
Boeing/Saab pushing to send GLSDB to Ukraine. Basically ground launched guided GBU-39 (small diameter bomb). Range 150km and takes unused, relatively cheap 40k, aircraft bombs and mounts them on m26 rocket engines (HIMARS, m270).
Back in 1999, when NATO was bombing Serbia, a HARM locked on Sofia's airport powerful radar, but ran out of fuel and crashed into a suburban house upper floor without exploding (no injuries). That was an expensive way to do something a trebuchet could.
Honestly, this is not an option. If they will sacrifice territories because of nukes, every small and big country in the world will start nuke program immediately. Because nukes is the answer, why you can’t be invaded or why you can invade and get some territory. China will invade all neighbors immediately. World will be even worse then now.
