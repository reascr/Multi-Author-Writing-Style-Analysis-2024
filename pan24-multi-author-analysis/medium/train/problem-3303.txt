I didn't realise the EU was a league system. Are there home and away games? Three points for a win, 1 for a draw? Bottom 3 relegated at the end of the season?
I'm pretty sure the idiots that set up Brexit made sure if UK ever managed to get back in the EU, there'd be no chance of getting their rank back.
This of course would indeed mean they dont get their old privileges like "opt outs" from stuff as the common currency back. Same for stuff like the budget rebate negiotated back then by Thatcher. Those would be gone.
Like, they can't just "go back to normal" they have to start at the bottom and get like no say in anything. And it's impossible to move up in seniority unless other countries do something that stupid.
The number of seats and votes inside the EU for the uk almost certainly wouldt change, however, since these depend among others on the size of the member state.
Don't worry, they'll win the next election when things have gotten slightly back to normal because people in this country are either thicker than pig shit so remarkably gullible in falling for culture wars.
