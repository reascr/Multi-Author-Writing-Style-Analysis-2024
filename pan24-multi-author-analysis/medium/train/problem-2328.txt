Worth noting that he immediately caved in the very next sentence, saying that this pretty much won’t change anything “unless US tests nuclear weapons first”. We know US won’t, so there’s that. Yet another empty threat designed to provoke a response.
So one of the interesting side-effects of the war in Ukraine is that it has shone a light on just how deeply corruption is established in the various Russian military arms and just how poor their equipment readiness is.
One of the reasons Moskova sank was because the fire extinguishers were all locked up to prevent theft….
Now one of the misapprehensions about nuclear missiles is that they are “break glass in case of war” store-and-forget systems. Quite the contrary, they are temperamental, maintenance-heavy divas that need constant attention to keep serviceable.
There is absolutely appetite within NATO for Russian regime change. There is similar appetite for Russian denuclearization. There is little appetite for a general nuclear strike - a "glassification".
Unless the Strategic Rocket Service is the one shining example of commitment and stewardship in Russian service, the odds on any given warhead/delivery system successfully launching, reaching the target, and detonating are extremely low. It may well be that not a single Russian ICBM of any flavour is capable of full operational use.
Where this gets interesting is that the design philosophy of strategic nuclear weapons changed over time, moving away from a “single big bomb per target” paradigm to a “multiple overlapping small bombs per target” paradigm. More, smaller bombs does more damage and makes it harder for a defender to shoot down the re-entry vehicles. But it also means more points of failure.
