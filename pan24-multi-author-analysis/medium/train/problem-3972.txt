The real reason they want to "reform" Social Security is because the system is about to be inundated with disability claims from folks suffering from Long Covid.
Social Security has absolutely nothing to do with the national debt. It is funded by employee and employer contributions, not through income tax money. Republicans want to privatize SSI, so that their Wall Stteet buddies can steal hundreds of billions of dollars in commisions and management fees. Anything you hear about the national debt wirh regards to Social Security Insurance is complete BS.
