The fun thing is that farm subsidies are public information. A few years ago, a farmer from my hometown was going off on an "all taxation is theft" rant on Facebook. A quick search showed me that his family's farm had received an average of $20,000 per year in subsidies over the previous 5 years. I didn't even need to throw out numbers, just mentioning that the subsidy info was available to everyone put the brakes on his rant. I am happy to say that, in recent years, he seems to have turned a corner and has become a more reasonable, thoughtful person instead of a libertarian edgelord.
