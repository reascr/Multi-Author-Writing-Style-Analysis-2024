One of those sentenced to death is Dr. Hamid Ghareh Hassanlou, a 53-year-old radiologist. His wife Farzaneh Ghareh Hassanlou has been sentenced to 25 years' solitary confinement. Both were arrested after they were caught up in a protest.
Hassanlou was tortured and did not have access to his own lawyer, anti-regime activists say. The attorney appointed by the government reportedly mounted no defense, instead advising his client to accept the charges of crimes against God.
Yeah, disgusting Geographically trapped to adhere to someone else’s mythology by pain of death. Utter nonsense I can’t even imagine processing such a charge…it’d drive you insane. His poor wife.
I didn't realize that God was so helpless that they needed Humans to handle the people who wage war on them. If some one did TRULY pissed off God wouldn't they(God) deal with it?(Unless they don't exist... but then there's no "crime").
Yeah, I understand he is. I’m just imagining rationalizing death over mythological disrespect to yourself. And I’m sad for his wife because what a fucked reality she’ll now endure.
This story breaks my heart. I sure hope the determination of these brave women and men help to facilitate an end to at least Theocracies, but organized religion in general.
