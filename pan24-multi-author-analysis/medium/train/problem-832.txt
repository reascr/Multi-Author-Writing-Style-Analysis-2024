Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels increases inflation, increases consumer prices and does nothing to mitigate issues surrounding climate change. Everything in modern civilization, literally everything is made from petrochemicals. By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels all you do is increase cost of living and reduce quality of life across the board for no benefit to the majority of the population of planet earth. A few percentile at top benefits, but no one else. It does not help the majority of Americans who will see their utility and fuel costs skyrocket. It does not help homeowners who will be forced out of their homes, victims of gentrification as cities get more expensive to live in.
