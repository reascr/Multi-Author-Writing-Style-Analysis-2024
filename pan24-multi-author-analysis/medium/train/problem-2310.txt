It is a condition for the continuation of the supply of weapons. Countries supplying Ukraine are saying they are not supplying weapons to damage Russia; they are only supplying for the defence of Ukraine territory. Once Ukraine attacks Russia then this statement does not hold and puts any country that is supplying Ukraine into direct conflict with Russia. The west does not want direct conflict with Russia. It is fairly evident that Russia could not stand up against the fire power of NATO. However, the consequences of a nuclear war will be very long lasting and possibly the end of humanity.
US DOD announced months ago in a press conference that they consider military targets in Russia and Belarus (as well as territiry claimed by Russia) from which attacks on Ukraine originate to be acceptable targets.
So Ukraine attacks a military base in Russia and Russia what launchs all of its nukes at nato? What would be the point of that. Thats like getting sucker punched by a sknniy drunk dude at the bar so you walk over to the biker gange and break one of there noses.
