Bullshit article. Tells you nothing. They donâ€™t name the person. Downvote and move on to actual journalism rather than this bathroom wall gossip. Come back when they name drop.
I would probably say don't downvote, but don't upvote either because if she wants to make a stand then she has to actually make a stand.
Probably, but in this case it's her fault for making the claim without details and no amount of journalism can fix that, but she did take the time and effort to say it, so it's not the normal situation of just bad journalist I suppose.
If you want to know why she hasn't named the person just watch the latest interview with Louis Theroux. She says I've got a family and a mortgage and I'm not going to risk being able to pay my mortgage to name the guy who has lots of money in power and could sue her. Unfortunately this is the way that it is in this industry until enough people come together.... why do you think people like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein got away with it for so long.
