Should read 'can't yet confirm'. Investigations need to happen before the Pentagon can go on the record as saying 'these Polish civilians were definitely killed by these russian missiles', given the absolutely massive consequences that could follow.
Even if they have confirmation (they probably already know), the US and NATO will keep denying it. Just like it happened with all similar incidents between the US and Russia/USSR since the end of WW2.
Real powers verify facts first, then act once all the facts are in. Also should said evidence indicate deliberate and intentional attack then it's impossible for Russia to get out of it no matter how much they lie. If something happens it needs to be Russia nailed to the wall for it.
The US would deny or at least not acknowledge active military conflicts with the Soviets if they felt it would do more harm than good.
In the most famous example, UN pilots (mostly American) fought many battles against Soviet pilots in the Korean War but didn't openly press the fact for fear of increasing tensions.
However it would be a lot harder to cover this thing in Poland up, and I don't think there would be much of a point to doing so.
Why deny Russia's mistake? NATO can absolutely use this to bolster anti-russian hardware and defenses along their borders, as well as justify new hardware deliveries.
I agree that this definitely cannot be an instant trigger for Article 5 and a full-on war between NATO and Russia, but we don't need to sweep this attack entirely under the rug for Putin's sake.
Please name and cite an event in which the US managed to hit civilians in a different country than the one they were aiming at with a failed missile strike.
