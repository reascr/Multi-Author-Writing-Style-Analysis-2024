How? Abortion pills aren’t over the counter. My insurance probably wouldn’t pay for more than one, if any. In that case, as a woman in a conservative state who’s still at the peak of fertility and sexually active, I’m gonna take the moral L and keep that pill for myself. I hope I don’t have to use it, but I don’t wanna be FUCKED like so many others either. As selfless as I’d like to be, I’m kind of in a pickle too and I cannot/will not be forced to have a baby when I don’t want it. My case aside, if it’s not OTC and it’s expensive, how can other women in blue states even obtain all of these to send out to help others? I don’t see how the average American woman could send out several of these pills at hundreds of dollars a pop. I’m genuinely asking, because I don’t see how it’s possible, although I could very well be missing something.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
