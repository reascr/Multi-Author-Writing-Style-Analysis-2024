The Court historically was supposed to be separated from public opinion as what matters in court is the word of law and interpretation. That's why the justices are appointments by elected officials and not elected. It originally was intended to weed out the lessers and bring forth justices who would be unbiased in interpretation of the law. These fascist bloodsuckers have now taken this ideal and corrupted it for the gain of their own interests. To use it for empowerment of their political beliefs and not the laws passed by the people's representatives, the actual will of the people. They're supposed to serve the Constitution, but now they serve what they want the Constitution to be and nobody who can do so meaningfully has checked them.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
