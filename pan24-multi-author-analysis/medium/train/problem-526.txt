I live in Southern Oregon and we get some terrible wildfires here too. When they are really close and really big, it looks like Modor outside. The sky is dark at noon, smoke gets in everywhere, there is an orange glow at night and burning embers fall from the sky. Most mornings you wake up and your car looks like it snowed but its a thick layer of ash.
A few years ago when Colorado had those massive wildfires. They did some aerial pictures of the affected areas. In the middle of the black trees and ashes were these pockets of green. There were the areas the beavers had settled.
They are part of NATO's underground resistance movement. They are teamed up with the moles, groundhogs, mice and lice.
Because they had damned up the creeks, it caused all those areas to get marshy and resist the fires that raged around them.
Because wildfires are a yearly thing and 90% of the time, its just smoke in the valleys that looks like fog, smells like a camp fire and its not that big of a big deal. LOL You just get used to wildfires in the summers. Unless you are in the evac zones for a fire, they are just a minor inconvenience.
