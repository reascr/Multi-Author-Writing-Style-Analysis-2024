Hobbs will also be a major upgrade from Doug Ducey. He really fucked up the state's handling of the pandemic. We'll never know how many people would still be alive without his mindless partisan posturing. He also made it so that you get purged from the vote-by-mail rolls if you don't vote every two years, and he also made sure that you can no longer add a missing signature to your mail-in ballot if it's recorded as missing on election day. He did a lot of damage and was a net liability for democracy and quality of life in Arizona. Good riddance. Arizona and America deserve better than people like him.
