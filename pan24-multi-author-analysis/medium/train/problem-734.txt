June, the State Land Department has leased state trust land to the Saudi-owned Fondomonte corporation for $25 per acre, so that the Saudi company could grow alfalfa and send it back to Saudi Arabia to feed that country’s cows.
More unbelievably, the state is allowing this company to pump groundwater for free. The $25/acre land lease is well below market rates, and the water being given away comes from the Butler Valley Basin and Vicksburg – areas that Arizona cities may very well need to rely on for their water needs in the near future.
It's not just giving them free groundwater to grow alfalfa in 110 degree deserts--the groundwater they're pumping is Phoenix's strategic water reserve. Once that's gone, the city goes with it.
Well, sort of. There are a lot of misconceptions about alfalfa. A lot of articles like to paint alfalfa as "water thirsty" and cite stats on water usage per acre per year. But what they fail to take into account is that in places with long growing seasons like AZ and CA, they're typically getting 8 to 10 cuts (harvests) per year. Alfalfa itself has a very deep taproot, over 20 feet in many cases, and is actually quite drought tolerant. It's just that with the right soil moisture it grows very quickly and you can maximize yield by irrigating.

My pleasure! I didn't really think anyone would be interested, tbh, so I didn't give a ton of info but here's a little more.
