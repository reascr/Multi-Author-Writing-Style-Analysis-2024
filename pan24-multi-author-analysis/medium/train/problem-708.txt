By the time that western nations decouple their economies from China, developing nations will have developed to a level to pretty much replace most of that market. But you’re right about the advanced technologies part. And it would also be more severe for China, yeah.
What a moronic take. “China doesn’t call the war a war, so China, the second biggest economy of the world by far, shouldn’t be a part of the global economy.”.
I'm honestly surprised China hadn't been sanctioned yet for there yearly massive abuse of human rights. They deserve a few slapped in there face as a "mess around and find out" warning.
And the rest of the world? Are they going to sanction China? Keep in mind that Russia’s actually the one invading here, has a GDP 1/10th of China’s, and it’s still part of the global economy. And you think a few sanctions over China not calling it a war is going to cut them out of the global economy?
China has been sanctioned a few times. Just not as severely as Russia, NK, Iran etc. because the rest of the world is extremely connected to China’s economy.
Yeah but difficult to do and China would just get new customers. But western nations that oppose China like the US should take quick steps to become more independent.
