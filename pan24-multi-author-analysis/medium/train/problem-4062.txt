I live in Calif and all our shit is basically already decided (at the senator level) but I’m gonna get out and vote my ass of. There are local props, city board members etc.
I guarantee you there are places where your vote matters proportionally WAY more than out here. Get your ass out and vote. It’s literally the easiest thing to do. Channel your anger and vote.
