was probably always that state, only now do we see it tested and for what it really is and has always been.
They have a proud history of rushing technology for the propaganda points. Not properly testing the technology. And it spectacularly failing. (But scapegoating the failures 'cos propaganda).
For instance, there was a brief time when only Russia had Passenger Jetplanes. Why? Because early Jet engines were dangerous, and the west grounded theirs till they were made safe. Meanwhile the Russians kept flying theirs. Which crashed at a truly alarming rate. (The Russian jets were truly terrible designs, that had been rushed for the propaganda).
If I remember correctly the first Soviet passenger jetliners were converted military planes, or they used a military design rather than actually design something new for civilians, no wonder why it was unsafe.
Hell their first jet fighter, the Mig-9 couldn't even fire its guns without causing its engine to fail from the cannons exhaust gasses getting sucked into the intake.
For the Russians it was a lack of size/movement in the control surfaces, and simply forgetting to account for the people with luggage that go on passenger vehicles.
