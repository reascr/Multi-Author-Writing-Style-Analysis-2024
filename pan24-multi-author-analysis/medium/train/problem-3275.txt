How to destabilize an already unstable region in 5 words. What a joke this would end up being, a nation sends a cell in to capture a national leader then executes them when all it would do it give the people of Iran an external enemy to unite them. For numerous reasons this has to come from the people of Iran you can't force a popular revolutionary victory from an external source. Beyond that getting Israel of all nations involved would be the most heinous eye for and eye idiocy, do that and every person in the middle east who already have a view of israel as a warmongering settler colonial state get to point to this as proof that Israel believe they have hegemony over the entire region which would radicalize even more people and push the possibility of peaceful resolution to any of this off the table for decades at the minimum.
A similar thing happened during the French Revolution when they violently overthrew the dictator king and a parliamentary democracy was born out of it. I hope the same can happen in Iran!
