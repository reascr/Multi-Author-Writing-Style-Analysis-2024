It's an escort carrier. They were cheaper and could be built quickly since were most often built upon a commercial ship hull. The US built a lot of them during WW2 as a stop-gap measure when fleet carriers were scarce. They are inferior to the true aircraft carrier. The escort carriers are generally slower and have lighter arms and armor. They also carry fewer planes.
Technically, the Chinese (ROC) had the first escort carrier before Wight Brothers made their first flight. It was a commerical vessel that was laid down before the first flight, refit by the Japanese to be a seaplane tender, then like most of the Republican Navy, end up getting destroyed by Imperial Japanese Navy.
But neither countries “aircraft carriers” are impressive. Russias will probably never leave that hole that they call a dry dock and Iran has zero experience with flight operations on water. It will take 10 years to build confidence and experience that can then be trained into newer pilots and crew.
Russia could have had a working one, if they figured out some arcane knowledge like "running a power cable from your dock to your ship so it doesn't have to keep it's engines running for more than 40 years." or "not having your floating dock sink and poke a hole in the flight deck".
They apply direct pressure and make it harder but nothing is perfect. They just set up shell companies in other countries to acquire items they need and ship them home.
It’s for a regional expression of power. In a fight it wouldn’t have a chance against the US. But now Iran can say they are the only ME or African country in the region with an ACC.
