Not that I disagree, but the number of events that are reported as extreme has increased disproportionately to the actual increase in extreme weather. Here in the Northeast it seems every year they come up with a new twist on how to make the first snowfall remarkable. It's either the earliest snow event or the biggest snowfall in December, or the coldest or whatever- pick your superlative.
Historically, things such as floods are measured in terms of time scales. A once a century flood line exists on most property maps insurance companies maintain. My suspicion is this is what the national weather center means here: a storm of a size that historically only occurs every x years. As these storms become more frequent, the averages will move. But I will defer to those more knowledge.
My biggest pet peeve is the various "wind chill" metics. Each weather station has its own copywrited way of telling you how cold it feels. "Its 20 degrees but the Magic Weather 'Really Feels Like" index says it feels like -20. Uh, no it doesn't. I've been outside when it was -20 Fahrenheit. No amount of wind or whatever is going to make 20 degrees sting your nose and burn your lungs line -20. It's not going to magically freeze your cars coolant that is good to 0 degrees and make the tires and belts as brittle as -20.
