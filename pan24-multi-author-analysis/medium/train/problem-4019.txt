The bill won’t pass but a big issue for any criminal law is that it has to clearly define what is illegal w/ 0 room for prosecutors to use subjective interpretations to punish someone. Basically, you need to know you’re committing a crime by doing what you’re doing. The propaganda part, at least in the recounting of the article, is not defined which is concerning. Anyone who has a Blue Lives Matter patch or flag or speaks at a rally could then be charged under the act if anyone they were with were “inspired” by them. Under First Amendment protections in place, that is 100% unconstitutional and could obviously be used against BLM activists, etc. w/ some amendments. These kinds of laws should always be avoided, lest we’re one step away from full authoritarianism.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

If there is one thing that pisses a nazi off more than people being different from them, is being labeled a nazi from the people who are different than them.
