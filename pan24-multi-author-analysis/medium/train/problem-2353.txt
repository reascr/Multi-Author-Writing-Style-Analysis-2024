Everyone talking about nukes here when nuclear weapons aren't even mentioned once in the article. The plan this person is talking about is more mobilization, and Russia's plans to close the borders to men in a week so they can't leave when that next mobilization occurs.
Martial law and more hardship for the Russian people is the warning given. Reznikov was telling Russians they have one week to prepare for what Putin is planning to do.
I don't know what I'm expecting, though. Redditors love to simply read the headline only and then assume the worst and freak out for updoots.
However, they have slowed down using it as a threat because it was losing its effect due to overuse. Some people are more prone to hysterics than others but even the most gullible were brushing it off.
So be ready when they do use the threat again because its coming... & when you freak out randomly yelling at everyone in a forum about how super serious it is --- thats what they want... to sow panic. Calm down, breathe, its going to be ok --- they dont want to die anymore than you do. Just remember --- MAD.
