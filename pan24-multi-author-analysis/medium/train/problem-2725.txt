I think the prevailing attitude is that as long as the war continues going on this way Ukraine will win. Russia gets weaker and more desperate as each day passes and as long as the west keeps up its support Ukraine will win. Russia could send their entire population to Ukraine, but they don't have the weapons or equipment to do so, which means they'd just be sending people to a firing line as long as the west keeps Ukraine armed.
Note how they are also thanking those who have been supporting them from the start by putting their flags along the Ukraine one. Proud to see Canada alongside the USA, UK and EU on this very important piece of history.
I can tell you, I went to Normandie 5 years ago and when they heard my french canadian accent some people stopped me in the street and at random places like supermarkets and the bank to tell me how grateful they still are towards Canada. And not just old folks... younger ones in their 30s too. ''My grandpa told me about you, canadians.'' It was very moving.
