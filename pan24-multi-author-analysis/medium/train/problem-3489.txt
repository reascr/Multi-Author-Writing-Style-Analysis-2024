Please, they make up awards to give themselves. No doubt that he has a Zap Branigan medal somewhere. Might as well glue on another star to make the other 4-stars autistically screech.
What you neglect is the bigger picture. Xi is the leader of a political party, albeit the only one in China, but he is not alone. -If they wanted Taiwan they would have done it 20 years ago. It's constant saber rattling and posturing. Yes, China does a lot of messed up stuff as a government, as ALL governments do. Such is the nature of all large bureaucracy's full of indivual human minds regardless of ideological frameworks and culture. But the Chinese party is no hellbent on becoming individually wealthy like Putin and his oligarch cronies. The CCP has much less tolerance of corruption and when they crack down on it they actually do, unlike Russia.
If China gets belligerent, all a nation who has a blue water navy has to do is park a flotilla outside the Persian Gulf and sieze/sink any tanker that is heading to China.
