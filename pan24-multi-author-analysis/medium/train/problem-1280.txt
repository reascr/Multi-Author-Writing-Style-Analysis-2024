I know it may come as a shock, but serving as a commissioned naval officer while holding a security clearance doesn't automatically put you inside the intelligence community. Bannon was an "errand boy" for the Chief of Naval Operations, not for an intelligence agency. CNO uses intel, not generates it.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.

(deep sigh...) Noooo, I believe being a naval surface warfare officer isn't the same thing as being a member of the intelligence community. Please quit saying dumb things.
