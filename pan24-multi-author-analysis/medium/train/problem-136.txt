Bitching about it in a monetary sense and wanting Russia to win are two very different things. The stance they seem to be taking is “other countries aren’t pouring this much money into this conflict, and we’re damn near the furthest away from it all, so why are we giving so much money to them when it could stay here?”. Now I don’t agree with that and I’m actually glad we’re helping Ukraine. But don’t twist that shit, the vast majority of people in the US want Ukraine to win or just want us to stop sending money bc it isn’t our fight. Both are reasonable and should be debated.
The things we are giving them are older. As much as people complain there is a savings to not having to maintain all that equipment that’s sent over. It’s a complex system but you see on the Russian side what lack of maintenance and upgrading has done to harm their army. To quote one of my favorite Reddit comments of this was “they’re about to find out why America doesn’t have free healthcare” I.e. a well maintained arsenal of weapons.
I agree with you in the facts of the situation the comment is more of a joke as to the stark differences in actually maintaining your military equipment.
