You’re not wrong, but before covid I would’ve thought that most people weren’t dumb enough to override their need to stay alive or that they would override the fear or jail for decades to be a cool guy in the cult and post about it on Facebook. I guess putin thought it would be a cake walk, or he’s just an idiot altogether. he could’ve thought it would be very little risk, even if that’s stupid, so that’s more understandable in some ways than the capitol. What was more shocking in that regard was a couple years back when people who are like already on deaths door at 45 Y/O and then went around flouting every covid measure, and then were shocked they or their spouse or etc were in the hospital dying. Or flouting it and then shocked their granny died. Sort of amusing how now the vast majority have shut the fuck up about it or were very loud and have now quietly stopped talking about dumb conspiracies. Almost all of ones that didn’t were introduced to our lord and savior the ventilator. I wish I could explain survivorship bias to the remaining idiots.
Obviously fuck putin but also fuck europe for not pulling the trigger back in 2008 over georgia, let alone 2014 over crimea because, to quote mr krabs, money.
