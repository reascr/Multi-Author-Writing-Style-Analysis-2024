I do not understand how any regular individual thinks voting for trump is a good idea. The man is clearly a criminal.
all you had to do was google it. There have been several peer reviewed studies from reputable sources such as Yale and the National Bureau of economic research that show republicans were significantly more likely to die from Covid.
