They don't usually notice. From what I gather, the first thing Lichtenstein hears about it is usually the official apology from Switzerland the next morning.
EDIT: There should be a ceremony; where the Swiss military commander has to bring over an apology cake. In the spirit of international harmony and forgiveness, the Swiss guy gets a slice; but to symbolize justice, the Lichtenstein guy's slice will be bigger.
That the Lichtensteinian government first hears of it when the Swiss ambassador walks over to them and says “sorry, we accidentally invaded you again last night. Hope there are no hard feelings. Here is our cake.” makes it even better.
The Canadians and Dutch would leave a bottle to when each would land on Hand island to remove the other's flag. It's been called the Whiskey War.

Probably as a guarantee that Germany wouldn't sell the arms on. Germany probably agreed happily at the time because giving weapons away is not a usual occurrence.
On 26 August 1976, just before midnight, 75 members of the Swiss Armyand a number of packhorses mistakenly took a wrong turn and ended up 500metres into Liechtenstein at Iradug, in Balzers. The Liechtensteinersreportedly offered drinks to the Swiss soldiers.
