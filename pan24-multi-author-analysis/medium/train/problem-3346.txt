Their country has to completely collapse and the west has to occupy them. Unfortunately NATO is too chickens shit to retaliate against Russian aggression. Although it helps that Russia is restricting their crimes to Ukraine, and not the entire continent of Europe like Germany did.
Well, at the end of the day Germany ended up better than alright. But that'll only happen if Russians accept a normal, Gorbatsjov type, leader, but I don't see that happening any time soon. It's too corrupt for that.
Unfortunately we don't know that. Putin is getting stories and reports heavily filtered by his lieutenants. He is no longer making most of strategic level decisions and almost none of tactical. He can be dead for all we know and it can be one of his body double that we see. Like that drive on the Crimea bridge - most probably it wasn't him. The driver was less puffy than Putin on TV a few hours later.
Germans have always been on point with the things they do. It hasn't always been pretty but even the killing of millions of people was documented to a T without fail.
