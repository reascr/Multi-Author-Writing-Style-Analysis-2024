Really, one of the more disappointing things about the Biden administration is just how many Trump era policies and regulation rollbacks were left in place. I feel like his first order of business should have been to have his staff go over every single change Trump made and start hitting ctrl+Z on any of them that were problematic, which were like... most of them. And now that we don't have the House for the second half of his term, fixing some of that is much harder than it would have been in 2021 and 2022.
Demo have to keep fixing what Republicans break over and over again. Republicans blame democrats when something breaks due to a regulation dems haven't restored.
