Back in 2014 after first sanctions "import replacement" became a thing among priorities of Russian industry. Everyone was aware of this, every relevant minister had recieved their tasks. And in these 8 years nobody reported any problems.
Let me guess: you used to work for a big company? This sounds like a common mistake for them: demand a lot, promote only those who "show proper results", end up with guys who faked their way to the top through manipulating reports.
But when sudden reality check rolled it, what do we have? Planes and cars, even nationally made, critically depend on exported parts. Production of arctic mining tech and LNG tankers is impossible without foreign technology. Semiconductor industry is still decades behind bare minimum, not even talking about actual competition with Asian or American manufacturers. Fuck it, even building trains requires parts that cannot be produced in Russia. This is humiliating!
“Look It’s not me who is the failure This other incompetent guy lied to me because he told me he ordered the stuff!”.
