Ok, so I own a thing. It's my thing. I bought it with my money. Paid tax on it and everything. I can burn it, pee on it, put it somewhere unsavoury or even eat it. What I do with my thing is my business. I really don't get why anyone would care what I did with my thing as long as it didn't damage anyone else's thing. Not to mention that the correct way to dispose of a Qur'an is to burn it, so even in this instance, what kind of halfwit would care? You do you and I'll do me. I was a Bible person once. I have never cared what anyone did with a Bible. It's a book. There's billions of them. Who gives a shit if someone burns their own copy of the bible? Now if they did it in a mosque, that action would be very disrespectful, but the actual loss of a single book is irrelevant. There's lots more.
As a swede, the guy Rasmus Paludan is a half-danish racist white supremacist. His whole thing is trying to upset muslims by burning their holy book in hopes they get violent, so he can point at them and go "Islam is a religion of violence!". He is doing it outside turkish embassy because with the current climate he KNOWS it will get more attention and possibly get Sweden in trouble, which is good for him because he hates Sweden.
