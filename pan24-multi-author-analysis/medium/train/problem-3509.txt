Minimum of 15 years, Germany only does sentences without the possibility of parole in very few circumstances. Even then you're technically getting released from prison just that you immediately get put in a secure psych facility.
Which is technically correct, but not the full picture. The version of "no parole" is the so called security detention, which is not a punishment, but a public safety measure for people that will most likely stay a danger even after the time is served. In case of murder, this is actually only when parole is granted, as until then, they don't have serverd their time.
And even in security detention, there is a chance to come out as long as it is determined that you are not a danger anymore. Considering the high hurdles to even get into security detention, that generally means you are factually unable to commit the types of crimes that you came in for.
This is a wrong interpretation of the ruling. The ruling is sentence for life, with no possibility of parole earlier than 15 years, but no guarantee for parole. The German constitutional court made clear that every incarcerated has the constitutional right for a chance to be set free within his lifetime as long as he meets the right conditions, and that is what the parole hearings are for (conditions like remorse, change in character and views, and so on).
The average parole is granted after 20-25 years, but there is no guarantee for it. I think the longest time for parole was 58 years.
