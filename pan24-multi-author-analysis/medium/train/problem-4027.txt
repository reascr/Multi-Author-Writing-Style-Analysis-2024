They already did that, the House of Lords only serves to knock back legislation for reassessment, they can't permanently block anything. If they could, fucking Brexit never would've happened...
Hmm, perhaps the House of Lords should have power restored to it… make it an actual check on the power of the Commons.
Maybe having all elements of society, the majority of the nation - commoners, and the holders of much of the wealth of the nation and a long view - the Lords, is a good idea?
It certainly is at odds with the view held by many that direct winner take all democracy is the only possible legitimate path forward. My take is that government should reflect the will, traditions, mores, and circumstances of its nation.
My gut tells me that Labour is simply trying to make a play for votes because the Lords really doesn’t have power anymore. Perhaps they want to make it something similar to the American Senate. Who knows. It all seems quite odd to me.
This is sort of what canada did. Not necessarily experts always, but "great" Canadians are offered positions in the Senate (functionally the same as the House of Lords in the UK) as we don't have nobility.
While there is value in having an unelected body that basically serves to moderate parliament, its current state is kind of busted. You can literally buy your way into it, or have peerage appointed by the ruling party, basically stacking it like the Americans did with their Supreme Court. Perhaps instead of Lords, they need experts in various fields. Economic, agricultural, medical, military, environmental, the things that the average MP probably isn't going to know all that much about.
