There is no lesser evil, you either vote for PiS or KE/whatever Tusks party is called and get your country wrecked.
I debate the abortion issue a lot. People have, on several occasions, brought up the United Nations' take on abortion. I realize the United Nations and EU are obviously completely different, but the situation is the same for the language they use. Doublespeak to appease less progressive Nations. People will point out that the United Nations doesn't view forced birth as torture. And doesn't guarantee access in all cases:
What a huge amount of doublespeak. That's every pregnancy. Every pregnancy is substantial pain and suffering. The fact that they don't view forced pregnancy, labor, birth, and recovery as torture highlights how in the dark ages our member nations still were and are.
"States parties must provide safe, legal and effective access to abortion where the life and health of the pregnant woman or girl is at risk, and where carrying a pregnancy to term would cause the pregnant woman or girl substantial pain or suffering, most notably where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or is not viable.".
Before we went fully legal this was the reason abortion was defacto legal in all Australian states. Tell a GP you believed carrying it to term would be detrimental to your physical or mental health, which.... No shit. And it was legal.
