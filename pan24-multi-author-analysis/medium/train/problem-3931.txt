I mean, we are turning Russian economy into a scrapyard. Sanctions are hurting a lot - real life USD exchange rates are through the roofs, a lot of people outright fled the country just so they can receive international money transfers (even basic things like PayPal are not a distant past in Russia), electronics sector is effectively dead and they have to rely on smuggling (on which we crack down) to get anything inside the country. Similarly they have limits to planes parts, engines and so on.
