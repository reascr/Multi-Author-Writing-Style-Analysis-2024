It’s not the New York Times. It’s a publication specifically for LGBTQ issues. Of course they describe this twisted person with an editorialized headline.
If this "deranged" protester were pro-trans, she would've been labeled a hero by the same publication.
Edit: You're becoming what you hate, and you're a net-negative to your cause. I'm not even against LGBTQ+ people and equal rights for all. I am against the movement as a whole if you can't process a simple case of hypocrisy and self-serving bias.
I think the burden of proof is on you. I'm sure people were super fine with nudity 50 years ago, right? They weren't called deranged back then, but times are a changing. Nudity now is absolutely deranged in 2022 regardless of one's political stance.
If you cared about people exposing themselves to children you wouldn’t be diverting the conversation away from the person that just recently exposed themself to children by citing an event that happened 50 years ago. What is your point in that comparison, 50 years ago gay people were marginalized by psychos just like the one you’re diverting attention from, now its trans people.
