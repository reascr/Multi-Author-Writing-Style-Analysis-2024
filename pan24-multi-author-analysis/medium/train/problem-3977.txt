The closest trauma center to our high school sent nurses, doctors, and parents of kids who were severely injured or killed in crashes. It actually did save my life. I was at a party with a friend - she was actually my crib neighbor in the nursery when we were born, and our moms were old friends from high school. Her cousin drove me, her, and another friend to the party. It was supposed to be at a social hall, but it ended up being in someone’s backyard with drugs and alcohol. I stayed sober, my friend drank and smoked some weed. I debated what to do because I didn’t want to get in trouble, but I also had that school seminar in my head (they’d presented only a week or two prior). I ended up calling my parents to pick us up. I lost track of my friends, someone else told me they got a ride back home with her cousin. My mom was mildly angry that I didn’t call her as soon as I realized the party was not where/what it was supposed to be, but mostly I was not in serious trouble and more importantly went to bed safe. My friend’s cousin didn’t even make it a mile from the party, he went off the road and slammed into a tree at over 100mph - all three of them were killed instantly.
Nepal has a few high altitude airports that can be considered dangerous because of hills surrounding. However, this flight was from Kathmandu to Pokhara, a relatively safer route.
