If you went to conferences and vendors invited you to dinners they are hosting, could you accept? Like is their exceptions for building those business relationships?
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Most codes of conduct have relatively broad carve outs for hospitality that is part of normal business dealings- so for example, you can accept a coffee when going to a firm's office, but they can't buy you dinner at a conference.
I ask because that's a part of my job, and I constantly go to conferences and dinner all paid for by vendors.
