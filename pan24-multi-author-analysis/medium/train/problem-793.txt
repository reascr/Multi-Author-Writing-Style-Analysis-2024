Why does noone ask Italy to apologise for the actions of Caesar and Rome, they sold entire tribes into slavery?
Naa not at all, I'm just saying it's done, we should definitely teach it in schools but we've learnt from our past.
People who didn't oppress anyone apologising to people who aren't oppressed isn't going to resolve anything.
Wherever you're from, look into your history and you'll find that to some extent, your country is made up of tribes that conquered each other.
Luckily we all live in a time where the majority of states have developed beyond this and are not looking to conquer others for development.
Of course the effects are still felt today, but that goes for literally all history, small or significant.
An apology, neither from the perpetrators or to the victims is probably the most hollow apology that can exist.
I believe there is a benefit to Japan apologising to the Korean comfort women who they enslaved for sexual exploitation because some are still alive and Japan is currently still omitting its negative past from it's history books.
The Dutch apologising for their involvement in the slave trade is literally pointless, everyone involved was dead.
Accountability is important, recognizing the fact that your culture has benefitted and still benefits to this day from slavery is a good thing, it allows people to be aware of the fact. Tell me how it hurts? Tell me why make such an effort to throw away any attempt at reconciliation? This is the last thing I'm saying to you, if you reply I'll just block you.
It's a symbolic act yes but that doesn't Mena it is nothing. A big issue for lots of former colonies is the refusal of former colonial powers to even admit that they did harm. Acknowledgement is generally the first step for any potential repatriation. Recognizing that doesn't mean it's being treated as a some silver bullet to every ripple of harm produced from colonization.
