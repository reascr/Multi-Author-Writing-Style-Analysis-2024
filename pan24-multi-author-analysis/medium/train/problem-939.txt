Nothing is done about climate change, because the cause of climate change is population growth...not the oil industry.
The oil and gas industry is for profit, it is a capitalist enterprise...Its duty is to generate revenue for its shareholders. It really is mindblowing how little people understand this.
The oil and gas companies have known like our politicians for at least the last half century that what they are doing is having a negative effect. They chose to ignore it. There is and will be plenty of opportunity to make profit from a transition to net zero. The issue is those greedy people are blind again after the massive profits they just made.
The government is needed to steer this. We subsidize these industries so much and yet what do they give back. Right now even less than they planned. There is no excuse. Renewables and local energy generation have been shown to be so critical recently.
Climate change is caused by the release of green house gases. Over population can only cause this to happen faster.
Oil and gas companies have no duty to act on the knowledge, politicians do. All of human civilization and technology is based on oil and petrochemicals. There is absolutely no way to end reliance on oil.
Renewables rely a heavy amount on petrochemicals. There is nothing Humans can do to reduce the impact of climate change, besides reducing the population.
