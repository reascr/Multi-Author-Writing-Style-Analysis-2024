Everyone knows that California will vote blue for president, so Democrats can take it for granted, and Republicans are best off writing it off. So neither party campaigns there, or writes policies to appeal to Californians. Wyoming is the same but in reverse.
That’s what I’ve been saying! Im in a similar red state, and if some more people moved here we’d flip blue easily. Housing is cheap af here, too. Entire homesteads with land and decent-condition houses for under $100k.
For president, WY averages 192k population for every electoral vote. With CA it's 713k. So it's about 3.71x the voting power for president. For Senate, lol, it's 68x.
Honestly, any red state. If you can stomach the terrible politics and have decent skills that can get you either a WFH/remote job or a job in an industry in that particular state, you can have your pick. Just learn to block out the people who are more obnoxious and adjust accordingly. I'm not taking any chances and got sterilized last year, so no need to worry about access to abortion. I also vote every single year in every single election, I wouldn't consider skipping voting.

All true. But at some point, we have to stop running and start standing up and fighting them. They want to chase decent people out of as many states as possible, permanently take over the Senate, and then screw up the entire country. There will be nowhere left to run.
