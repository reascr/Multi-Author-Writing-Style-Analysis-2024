So it's okay for lefty or progressive Democrats to make wild statements like this because everything the left say is the "truth" but when a ring wing Republican does it - it's immediately shut down as a "Conspiracy Theory!".

Last I checked the Democrat Presidental Candidate, (even the unlikeable Clinton in 2016), generally wins the popular vote, and the Dems also have a strong foothold on the Senate and only the slightest of slight minorities in the House. Plus you know Joe Biden, a life long Democrat, is president of the Country itself. So I think it's fair to say there is a lot more Democrats than Republicans in the U.S, especially since Covid which lets be honest, would have killed a great many of older Republicans who made up a major demographic of the party.
