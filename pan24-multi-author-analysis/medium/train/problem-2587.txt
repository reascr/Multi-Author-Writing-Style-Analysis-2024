Absolutely allergic to their names. They deserve whatever the pieces of shit names I call them. Remember plastic lady standing in front of a grave that costs more than most people’s cars saying to stay home during Covid when most people can’t afford to? Or how about Brandon saying he spoke with the people who invented insulin who have never been alive in his lifetime? Or him calling his wife the vice president. We replaced trump with trump light and the cryptkeeper is so scared of her position that she can’t even debate with a democrat running against her and has to make shit up. So pardon me if you don’t know a fucking thing that happens in this world.
