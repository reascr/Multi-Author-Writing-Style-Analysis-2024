You’d be surprised how little control the CCP actually has on North Korea. North Korean regime will gladly tell the CCP to fuck off if they are threatened with denuclearization and withdrawal of support. Why? North Korea simply just does not give a shit about its people like we assume they do. That’s why sanctions don’t work on North Korea. Millions of North Koreans could die due to starvation and they won’t even lift a finger.
To my knowledge they have nukes, but not nukes small enough to fit on a warhead (no means of delivery). Being able to manufacture warheads is what would make them a nuclear weapon state, but I could be wrong.
It's possible, but unlikely. Just this Kim tested a strategic, nuclear-capable ICBM that can hit targets in mainland USA. The current fear is that NK is already working on miniaturized warheads for tactical nukes to be placed on short-range missiles.
From the evidence available, it is likely that Kim has larger warheads capable of long-range missiles, and is making rapid progress towards tactical ones, as well.
