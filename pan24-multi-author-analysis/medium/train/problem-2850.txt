US Aid is "only" 3 Billion which is a lot but not when you realize its mostly giftcards for the US MIC and it all ends up back in America. For reference Israel's GDP is 480 Billion and Musk's Twitter Deal could replace US aid for 15 or so years.
It wouldn't be much for Ukraine either. They have received 21+ Billion assuming they get the same deal they would get money to spend on US Weapons which they are already getting. Not to mention that Israel provides feedback, testing and their own tech and research in exchange something Ukraine can't match outside of just using it.
