And if they were interested in supporting that, giving Sweden a bunch of demands that would inevitably worsen public opinion of Turkey was a pretty stupid way to go about it.
It's all just posturing for the elections. Sweden got played, Erdogan got exactly what he wanted. The Swedish government just turned the Turkish election in Erdogan’s favour. He was trailing behind, but this could give him the necessary boost.
The only way Sweden got played here is if Erdogan set things up for our NATO application and I think that’s very unlikely, don’t you?
The Dutch government has lots of loopholes for large companies to enable them to pay little to no tax for being registered there. IKEA is not a Dutch company by any stretch.
Did he milk the opportunity when it arose? Hell yeah, but he just got ”lucky”. We’ll see if it wins him the election or not.
And lots of companies are registered in the Cayman Islands, wouldn't say they were from there though. Tax havens exist all over the place, but to say IKEA is Dutch is just disingenuous.
