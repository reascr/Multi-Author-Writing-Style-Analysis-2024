It must be a pity for him too, as he probably spent more time and effort coming up with this one than his typical name-calling, where he just lazily tacks on some adjective with a negative connotation to the person's name, often reusing the same ones: Sleepy Joe, Sleepin' Bob (Casey), Little Michael, Little Marco, Liddle' Adam, Crooked Hillary, Lyin' Ted, Lyin' Brian (Williams)...
