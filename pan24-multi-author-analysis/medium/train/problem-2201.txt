Offending khameni is not offending Islam. So I don’t expect muslims to be offended. Just wanted to refer to their previous acts, when they offended all Muslims in the name of exercising their free speech.
You keep saying they publish this stuff in the name of free speech. You don’t have to like or appreciate the magazine but I think they think about it differently, I think they feel they have something to say and since they are free to say it, they do. This is protected by their Constitution, by UN treaties, by the EU. The leaders Iran have complained non stop about the USA, UK and Europe, often rightly so, for decades. No one puts out a fatwah on them for hating us or ridiculing us. I have zero patience with this argument against speech.
Yeah, exactly, they have something to say, which is expressing how much they hate Islam and Muslims.
The speech is protected under laws, no one is arguing against that. It does not make it any less of a hate speech, because what defines hate speech is how the other person perceives the speech and most Muslims perceive attacks on their prophet as attacks on them and their existence. You can't disagree with that, it's just how things are.
Some people might consider worshipping a cow stupid, and they are allowed to express that, but most people would agree it is hateful to go around saying that.
