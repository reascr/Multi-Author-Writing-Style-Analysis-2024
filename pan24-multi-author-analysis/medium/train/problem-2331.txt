Was gonna agree, then I looked up the last WWI veteran to die, he lived until 2011 Lots of these soldiers may well have living children out there, which is crazy to realize.
I know all about them One who had married one of the oldest veterans in the 50s, I believe, and never even collected the pension.
Also, the man I was referring to, Corporal Frank Buckles, was later in life, caught by the Japanese during WWII, while a civilian Working for a shipping company And spent time in an internment camp.
No certainly not ww1 ended 18 this would make anybody born at the end of ww1 105 years old only about 1 in 1000 people life to that age and only 1 in 1000000 live to 110 with the oldest person ever being around 120 but now since those soldiers died in the war their children must have been born during it making them even older. So in all likly hood there are maybe 2 children of those soldiers left a life but 0 is more is more likly.
Her father who served in WW1 and 2 was born in 1896 and passed away on 1972, my other great grandfather born in 97 passed away in 88 ( he also served in both wars ).
So while uncommon it is in fact quite possible to have children from that time period still alive today or at the very least within the last 10 years, and certainly grand children who are very much still alive and would have those family stories and histories still within living memory.
The total number of centenarians in the world is uncertain. The Population Division of the United Nations estimated that there were 23,000 in 1950, 110,000 in 1990, 150,000 in 1995, 209,000 in 2000, 324,000 in 2005, 455,000 in 2009 and 573,000 in 2021.
I also never said there’s a good chance of it, I said “may well have”, so yeah, maybe not likely, but still possible, and nieces, nephews, and grandkids all become more likely to exist.
