analyzing the weather over Turkey, they have a very low air pressure system seemingly the only place as such in all of middle east , bringing snow, and some rather cold temperatures in the minus 15 C Feels. It's slowly heading east. bless the rescue efforts in safety ship yourselves all south or outta there.
Yes, many faults are constantly near failure at all times, especially near an actively deforming margin. Faults share the stress among them in what is called "stress partitioning". If one fault fails and you have a lot of displacement to accommodate, all critically stressed faults will follow suit.
I view the California Seismograph Live on youtube every night for a couple of minutes, and spotted the 7.8 followed by a 6.7. but I saw no representation on the actual drum, perhaps that is for local seismic and not from overseas areas. but the world map is shown with the larger dots. as well as reportings of them (depth, mag, time) then I searched earthquake and 30 minutes in was all over the YT news. you can also rewind its time window up to 12 hrs .
