I don't know that I would fault Charles specifically. My view of it, similar to the same issue Harry and Meghan are dealing with, is that the monarchy as a system is harmful. Diana clearly had her own issues, and that would be difficult for any husband to deal with. It's not like he's a mental health expert. But the issues stem from them having to be in this forced marriage to begin with, because that's what the system called for, and neither being happy and Diana having mental/emotional issues that Charles was not equipped to handle nor provided any support to handle because it was literally his job to pretend everything was fine (and her job too).
I feel like it was inevitable given the crownâ€™s obsession with sweeping shit under the rug and never actually directly addressing any problem even remotely uncomfortable. The end result is multiple generations with loads of trauma and absolutely zero skills on how to work through those feelings or communicate in a healthy way, just dramatic explosions and toxic behavior the whole down.
