I'm in my early 40s. My father likes to tell stories about how he paid for my sibling's birth, his college degree, and graduate school while only working part-time. (My mother also worked part-time at a small, rural restaurant.) My father went on to obtain a second graduate degree while teaching part-time. He had no student debt and, therefore, does not believe in student loan forgiveness.
Old Republicans remember the days when they could pay for college while working. Those days are gone but they don't want to hear that. They would rather have you believe that all kids are now lazy and stupid and shouldn't go to college if they can't afford it. It's pretty disgusting.
