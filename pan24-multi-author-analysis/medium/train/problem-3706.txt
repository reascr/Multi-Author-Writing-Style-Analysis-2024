Exactly. Given Israel’s founding prerogative as a country, this situation is doubly dicey for them. Some 300K Jews live in Ukraine and some 85K Jews live in Russia, and Putin has the ability to make life hell for the Jewish community in Russia on a whim. Israel has to be careful not to create a situation where the Russian Jewish community is held hostage by the Kremlin, especially when there are many Jews from Russia that have previously fled to Israel, and have familial connections to Jews still in Russia that might be under threat. And that’s ignoring the whole geostrategic Syrian airspace/Iranian supply routes issue.
Russia is already pumping tons of money into Iran (and likely a lot of other hostile nations) so uh... What incentive does Israel have to listen to Russia?
Israel likes being able to target Iranian weapons shipments heading through Syria to hostile militias and terrorist groups. Russia allows them to act with impunity.
Iran has been trying to get the S-300 // S-400 // Russian jets, which would make things a lot more dangerous for Israel. It wasn't long ago that an Israeli F-16 was downed by an S-300.
