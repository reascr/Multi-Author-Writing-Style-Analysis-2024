The north it's a bit more dangerous nowadays, in general crime has gone up a bit around here, and example are fake delivery guys that may snatch your phone, it's not an everyday thing, but just don't be waving your phone around. The places you mentions are very tourist friendly and hostel are the way to go, if you have some money to spare you can use Airbnb, for tours to the telescopes is best to buy with time, for just stargazing you can find people to drive you around. For inter city travel, bus is kind of the best option if you only want to be up there north, any more south you may want to see plane tickets due to the distance. What else, some feel about money, taxi should be around 20-30 usd from any airport to downtown maybe less, usually a lunch is around 15-20 usd in a restaurant and for and Airbnb 40-60 per night in an individual flat, I don't have knowledge from Peru, but from close sources is cheaper than Chile.
