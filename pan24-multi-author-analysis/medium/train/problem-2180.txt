I think it's a lie. Normally I'd give anyone the benefit of the doubt, while reserving judgement either way, but I'm just going to go ahead and call this one a lie. Balloons are backwards tech and superfluous if you have good satellites (which China lacks, apparently.) Also, 10 is a nice, round number. Not 11? Not 8? The US has flown exactly 10 balloons over China? Backwards against the prevailing winds across the Pacific? Or all the way across 3 continents and the Atlantic first? It's been a couple of days for China to attach evidence to their accusation, and nothing so far. So, unless it's proven otherwise at a later date, this is a lie, and worryingly, more evidence that one of the most powerful countries in the world has the diplomatic skills of a young child.
Realistically it would be impossible, Tibet is close to being Sinicized, any successive government in China, whether democratic or autocratic, would not give tibet due to its strategic importance with India.
I wanna take this moment to remind people that the Chinese government kidnapped a child because they think it will let them control Tibet better. No one has ever heard from this child again.
China is so low tech, they can't even muster a photo to support their claim. But what can expect when they need 2000lbs of equipment to measure temperature, wind and humidity...
