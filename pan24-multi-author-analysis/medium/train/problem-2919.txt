Given Trump's attitude towards his children it is not only plausible, but extremely likely, that a significant number of people did more to raise them than he did. If Walker claims to be one such, sure, why not? I have heard no information to the contrary, which makes it one of his most credible campaign statements. It raises questions, of course, such as why he wasn't raising his own children instead and what he means by intelligence, but the basic claim on its own is believable. He absolutely could have been a less shitty father - to Trump's children - than Trump. What a world.
It might be true actually. I mean, it's very plausible he did help teach the Trump's stuff. Look at junior, dumb as a bunch of rocks. So, 50/50 chance he's telling the truth.
