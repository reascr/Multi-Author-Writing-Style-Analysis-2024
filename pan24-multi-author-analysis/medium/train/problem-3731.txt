Ukraine needs to push Russia back to the internationally recognized borders, blow up any Russian military targets within HIMARS range and set up proper defenses in the event they try to come back over the border. Then there might be a chance of peace talks.
It's the opposite: Crimea is very hard to defend. It's been taken by the Germans in WW2 very easily.
Crimea is easier to liberate than Donbas for that reason. Russia can supply Donbas easily. And they know it: they're already beefing up defenses in Crimea.
Once the land connecting Crimea to mainland is under Ukrainian control, it's game over in Crimea because Russia can't supply the army there, while Ukraine has a direct supply route.
This guy has some really on point videos about the war in Ukraine. His name is William Spaniel. This video is about Crimea specifically.
Yes this is true, from what I understand as well. If Ukraine can cut off the land bridge that Putin has so far held onto, the only way to resupply Crimea is over Kerch Straight Bridge, which has already been bombed once...or by ferry, which from a logistics standpoint, cannot replace a bridge or land crossing. Also, the main water supply to all of Crimea can be dammed as well (Ukraine already did this before when Putin annexed Crimea) effectively cutting off Crimea from all food, water, and weapons resupply. It would essentially become an island with no food, water, weapons, or any kind of resupply. Not an ideal position to be defending from.
