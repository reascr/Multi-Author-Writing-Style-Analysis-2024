I won't say people who can't separate the art from the artist are wrong, but I will say that I believe that there are a lot of genuinely beautiful things in the world that exist in spite of the horrible people who brought them into being, and there's something almost vindictively pleasing about taking that from them. As if they're the mar on their greatest works, and that their work will always be remembered with the stain of their existence on it, like if the Mona Lisa smelled faintly of shit for all eternity.
Harrison Ford accepted the Academy Award for the best director on his behalf and made a personal trip to Paris to hand deliver it. I've had an immense distaste for that slimeball ever since.
You can appreciate that something is well-done or has meaning while also reviling the person that made it. Harrison Ford doing the shit he did is a prime example of not separating the art from the artist, really, just in the complete opposite direction that sentiment should go for anyone with any sense of ethics.
I mean, he could have looked at the situation like "yeah a couple of good films were made but the rapist who made them should absolutely be behind bars" but instead he looked at the art and artist and decided "that rapist made good art so clearly he can't be wrong.".
