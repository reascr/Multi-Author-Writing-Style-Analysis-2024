Edit:Important to consider, also there's no way he leaves SA with $15MM. Travelling with more than $5k requires documentation and a lot of paper work. If he managed to privately get to his destination with that in cash it would be hard to conceal it or it's source for long. If he'd be working with accounts he can access globaly, all manner of things can fuck that up too. Truly his only absolutely safe option is to either hide deep in the jungles/mountains of another SA country, as far from government offices as he can manage-- which is totally doable and could include lots of modern comforts as it is today. Or he's gotta find a nation with no extradition treaty and loose laws for people with money which mostly leaves him in the Arab Penninsula or Africa... Otherwise travelling (and accessing his money if it's not in paper) is his biggest liability. If he gets to the right places he can pay for anything he needs, it's just getting there without raising alarm through legit channels or doing something physically dangerous-- and that's easier said than done.
He forgot to mention option number 4, which is "Buy what appears to be a one-way plane ticket to Orlando, while continuing to ask that his supporters pressure the armed forces to strike down the new government through a coup.".
