Agree that most people are not ready for a ccw - myself included(also a medical mj patient so I couldn't if I wanted to lol). I don't mind it existing, but I think the process should be more rigorous, it's a big responsibility and a huge danger if you attempt to defend yourself against another person with a gun pulled without really knowing how to. There was actually a study done in Philly by Upenn(can link if you'd like) that found that ccw holders were something like 4x more likely to get shot in cities and when they did it was often more severe than non ccw-holders.
Larry Krasner has violated the Law and Order tradition of never admitting an error by aggressively working to correct the failures of the Philadelphia cops, DAs and judges. This pisses off Police, who are part of the Republican system of Hate.

Also where da red states at, they're leading the race in terms of increased crime lol. I live in the sticks and like guns (and common sense regulation for them!) buuuut uh, maybe permitless open carry is kind of a bad idea?
