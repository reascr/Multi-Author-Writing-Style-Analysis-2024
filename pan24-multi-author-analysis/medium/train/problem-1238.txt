It's also done this way, so people can't try to coerce Ukraine to just giving in. Russia has decided it will throw as many bodies at the war as needed to win, because losing is not an option for a narsacist like Putin. If Ukraine's losses were reported in the same manner, the narrative would shift to them just giving up for the sake of the people. They just don't take in to account that Ukrainian people would rather fight to the last breath, than give in to Putin.
Either way, the official numbers won't be revealed until after this sick war is over. I see every day that Russian numbers are posted but any reference to Ukraine's losses is almost always removed or corrected. I am not saying they are lying but in every war/era there is a media narrative as well. At the end, its the people fighting and families who are losing, these numbers are just numbers to most people not realizing each number has their own story and life to tell about.
Ukraine said that the 100 000 number the EU commission got was not about how many were killed in action (KIA), but how many had to leave the action for any reason, like being wounded or sick, stating that 90% of such cases resulted in recovery and re-admission in the army in a couple of days.
