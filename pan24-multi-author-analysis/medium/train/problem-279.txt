At the UN Climate Change Conference, India has argued that the world must phase-down all fossil fuels, and not just coal, to achieve the Paris Agreement goals.
This proposal was made as part of the 'cover decision', a political agreement that the host country pilots encapsulating issues not necessarily part of the official agenda.
Last year in Glasgow, India had raised the issue of needing to phase-out all fossil fuel as against singling out one category of fossil fuel, namely coal. This was perceived as a defensive response to the growing calls "for ending the use of coal", and did not garner any support, observers said.
At Sharm El Sheikh, India is proactively pushing for a decision that would commit all countries to plan an exit from the use of fossil fuels -gas, oil as well as coal. Indian negotiators have reached out to other countries with the proposal. The hope is that "weaponisation" of energy by Russia in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine might lead to more takers for the Indian intervention.
The proposal acknowledges that a move away from fossil fuels will be gradual and in line with national circumstances, hence the phrase "phase down" as against a phase out, and does not have any target date. It urges all countries to accelerate transition to clean energy and to acknowledge that all fossil fuels contribute to global warming, while recognising that the shift will have to consider national circumstances.
India has argued that singling out one type of fossil fuel and labelling it as harmful while promoting and accepting the use of other fossil fuels is not based on facts. There is an equity aspect to it as well. Coal use is mostly concentrated in developing countries while use of gas is more prevalent in rich industrialised countries. Singling out coal puts a bigger burden on poor developing countries while giving countries with greater resources more leeway in planning out their transition to clean energy.
They want to see the rest of world in flames while they continue to use all forms of non renewable resources.
India is the 3rd largest renewable energy producer. Also check how many nuclear reactors are being built. Some nations just talk. India is walking the talk.
India should look in a mirror when speaking. Let them take the lead and show the world how its done.
From ur article. 56 GW of energy from coal to 500 GW of renewable energy. Clearly non renewables are being phased out n not the most popular anymore. And whatever is needed for keeping up with demand is only used.
For a poor country, what we are doing is plenty ahead than any other so called developed rich countries who survive on gas.
How is it possible to believe that non-renewables are being phased out when non-renewables are the largest source of electricity and they are building even more as we speak?!?
You are comparing apples and oranges. The 56 GW of installed capacity of coal power comes in addition to the over 200 GW installed capacity they already have, while the 500 GW is included the more than 150 GW they already have. It's also worth mentioning that this is installed capacity, measured in watts, not generated energy, measured in watt-hours. Renewable power plants generally have a much lower capacity factor, which is the ratio of the produced energy to the theoretical maximum energy the plant could produce over time if it was able to run at maximum all the time, than conventional power plants.
It's the second most populous country in the world, and is about to overtake China and become the most populous country in the world, so being the third largest producer of renewable energy isn't the bragging point you think it is. According to wikipedia India is the fifth largest producer of renewable electricity, after much less populous countries, such as Canada. What is important is the percentage of renewable energy, not the total, and only 21.7% of the electricity produced in India in 2021-2022 came from renewable sources, while 72.7% came from coal. 99% of the electricity produced in my country in 2021 came from renewable sources.
From 2010 to 2020 the share of fossil fuels in energy production came down from 84 percent to 77 percent.
This in a decade keeping in mind that our population, industries and net energy consumption has only increased.
U talk about ur country having 99 percent renewable. Bet it has a per capita ppp dollars of atleay 30k.
From wikipedia, in 2022 alone 40 percent of energy capacity installed is from renewable sources. That percentage will only keep increasing year on year 🤷🏻‍♀️.
Phasing out something is gradually reducing it’s percentage from the net. That’s exactly what’s happening. For the money it has, for the subsidies it has to give out to the poor, for the industries it has to maintain and expand, it is doing so much that no country can point fingers at us.
> India is world's 3rd largest consumer of electricity and world's 3rd largest renewable energy producer with 40% of energy capacity installed in the year 2022 (160 GW of 400 GW) coming from renewable sources.[1][2] Ernst & Young's (EY) 2021 Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI) ranked India 3rd behind USA and China.
