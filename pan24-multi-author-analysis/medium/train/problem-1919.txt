> Stephen Moore, also known as Steve Moore, has been employed by many conservative groups in various roles such as "Senior Fellow," "Visiting Scholar" and "Senior Economist." He founded the Club for Growth and has served on the Wall Street Journals editorial board. Moore is frequently referred to as an "economist" in the media, despite pushback from tenured professors of Economics due to his lack of a Ph.D. in the subject.[1] Moore was nominated to the Federal Reserve Board by President Trump in March 2019,[2] but withdrew his name "amid revelations about decades' worth of disparaging comments Moore has made about women.".
As long as that ilk (which is now actually even more Conservatives/openly right) members on the Supreme Court exists... I'm not really sure why anyone thinks any new laws would somehow matter.
However, laws can be made which challenge the scotus precedentâ€¦ if only we had a few more justices to match the number of circuit courts, as the Founders intended.
It was a LEGAL LAW that Citizen's United case overturned and the law was passed by a bi-partisan legislature and signed by a Republican President. The Conservative majority on the Supreme Court ruled it violated the Constitution.
The only thing that would stop the Supreme Court is a Constitutional Amendment enacting Campaign Finance Reform.
