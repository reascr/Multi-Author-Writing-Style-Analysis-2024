Republicans have been feverishly de-regulating rail and other industries since Reagan, resulting in almost daily disasters, but lets make sure we don't blame them for this calamity, because it might not be their fault.
looking at how common derailments are, it seems voters should support lawmakers who are very much pro-strict regulation going forward to prevent these things from happening. its been decades of no progress or rolling back any progress on industrial safety. progress needs to be made and supported.
May not have caused the derailment at first, but certainly made it worse. The specific regulation that was rolled back was for electronic brakes that would instantly apply brakes to all cars at once, instead of waiting for each individual car to activate, which they do one after another.
