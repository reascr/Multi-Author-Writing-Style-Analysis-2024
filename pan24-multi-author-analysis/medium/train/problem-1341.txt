I understand the whole "DAE literally everyone on the planet just became a total pussy in Spring of 2020 when they shoulda sacked up and dealt with it?", but medical supplies aren't infinite. Or did you forget that whole part of it? I'm real sorry some shithead had their Mom and Pop bowling ally closed down, but everyone was dealing with some shit at the time and "idk maybe most of us are gonna be ok..." sounded as stupid then as it does now.
He is probably referencing the fact that Japan has said they will downgrade covid-19 to flu status, which means masks aren't encouraged as much any more and businesses don't have to require them.
Also the whole "everyone wears a mask in Japan" was kind of blown out of proportion. Before Covid some people wore masks due to flu season or allergies, but it was probably like 1% or less of the population.
I think it was more, went to Tokyo in 2019 and it was rare to jump on a subway wagon and not see at least a couple people with masks, even if it wasn’t crowded. Though outside of Tokyo it’s probably less common.
