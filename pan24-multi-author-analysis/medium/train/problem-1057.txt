I thought about it and I have a hard time understanding the difference of someone being executed vs imprisoned for life w/o parole. People bring up cost, but executions aren't cheap either, especially when it can take decades to happen.
The past few years, I've had a shift in my feelings on capital punishment. It came from seeing other people who would get visibly upset if someone wasn't sentenced to death, or would cheer and celebrate if they were.
I'm not sad to see a murderer sentenced to death, but the idea of being excited about it makes me feel sick.
