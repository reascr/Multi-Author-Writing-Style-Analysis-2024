That will depend on the platform, their policies and how much they self-police. The biggest social media companies have either banned or heavily restricted targeting in political ads. If Twitter allows relatively unrestricted political ads or just fails to police their own platform, they could capture a sizable chunk of the $1.5B digital political ad spend this year assuming they have a presence in the right markets. I suspect Elon also believes any shenanigans will be covered up by Republican political cronies.
