According to the Guardian's reporting George Santos has a history of being an inveterate liar, scam artist and criminal, i.e., prime Republican material which means he has no business occupying that congressional seat nor any other political office - as George Santos just another Republican outright fraud.
I'm hoping for the same - but as you point out things could easily go either way especially considering the Republicans taking over the House majority in a couple of weeks and their SCOTUS Federalist majority poised to possibly rule in favor of the R's latest Independent State Legislature fringe wannabe theory in Summer 2023.
