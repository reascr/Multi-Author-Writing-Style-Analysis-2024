Equivalent? Zero. The US government doesn't really care if citizens abroad say about shit the US, or join anti-USA groups, etc. Doesn't really care if you say that here while inside the United States.
What are the odds that the United States and most other first world countries have some equivalent set up on foreign lands? Edit: Thank you to those who have legitimately answered my question.
I could totally believe the USA has secret stations for listening and monitoring everything but not for the sake of hatrasinh citizens. Just spying.
Not much, I'm in China and no one has reached out and threatened me regarding my shitposts on the US. Turns out free speech is a thing in America, crazy right?
Even if you really stretch the meaning if the word "equivalent", extending it to "most first world countries" immediately makes the idea fall apart. Most first world countries are far too concerned with budgetary pressures to spend tax dollars on things like this.
These secret police stations do exactly that for China- harass and ensure Chinese (ethnic Chinese, not just Chinese citizens) obey ccp directives on China.
