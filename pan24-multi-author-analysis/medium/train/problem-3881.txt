Putin doesn't seem to worry as much about his own survival anymore, more about his "legacy." Those not eager to die for said legacy should be mindful of how little Putin values any life but his own.
Putin himself mused, "What good is the world without Russia in it?" "We'll all go to heaven", yawp Putin's toadies on national TV. They have repeatedly tried to normalize the idea that National Suicide / unleashing Armageddon is preferable to defeat. I'm still on the fence as to whether this is for domestic or international consumption. It seems to me that the Putin regime has chosen the North Korean approach of negotiation by provocation, with bellicose actions to underline the rhetoric. The problem for Putin is that no one takes North Korea's outlandish, apocalyptic threats seriously anymore.
Russia was always painted as like the final boss of a video game. I'm in my thirties, so growing up in the immediate post-Cold War world, I always saw Russia framed as our utmost existential threat. And for valid reasons.
Agreed. I remember the cold war. The Soviets were seen as quietly cunning, massively well equipped, secretive, impenetrable and ever threatening.
The last year though, they seem like in all actuality they're just a geographically huge terrorist state at this point. The reasons for this war, the brutal tactics they're using, the failure of their military infrastructure, the outdated equipment, the untrained soldiers, it sounds like something you read about that happened in Angola in the eighties. Russia is doing all the same shit a lot of small, violent third world nations have historically done to each other, and they're conducting it in the same way and failing all the same as well.
Today's Russia seems like a flailing terrorist group, throwing everything they can at their failing efforts.
