I didn’t get a supplement because the premiums are kinda expensive so I got the Advantage plan which at least limits my MOOP. Mine is with a good local non profit insurance company. Being in NY, I can switch to a supplement at any open enrollment. Perhaps the companies are being paid too much per enrolled person- I don’t know. I do like having the option.
