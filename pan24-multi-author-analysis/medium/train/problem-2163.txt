To jail? A western jail maybe? After raping and killing thousands, sending over 100.000 of his own ppl to their deaths, displacing 10mn Ukrainians, leveling whole cities, costing thecworld trillions. I think we should introduce him to his own FSB torture methods. You know, the ones with razor wire. I'm sure you've heard about it. Let's have him experience this on global live tv. So his sympathizers learn what happens to modern day Hitlers like him.
I guess they'll have to change the dictionary definition from "a state of armed conflict between different countries or different groups within a country.".
Putin with a sense of morality is like a rock trying to swim, it wont happen. I will not change the dictionary because this facist nobody doesnt like the term war. A war he may loose. If he wins it he will heral himself as a war genuis. Putin is a pitiful excuse for a human being.
It's kind of ironic how Putin laughs at West having debates about pronouns and identity but gets mad whenever his actions aren't called the way he prefers...
