excuse me, excuse me, I have Total Merit, we have probably greater Merit than any of the Democrats, you go and you take a look, you have a Perfectly Innocent President, me, that's who we're talking about, and then all of a sudden here comes Sleepy Joe's Fake News, "Trump did bad things," and I did nothing bad, nothing in terms of problems for our Country, don't forget, I came in, we had no Coal, I said what happened, "it's Obama, Sir, he took away our Fuels," and I said that's a real shame, you have a Complete and Total Communist Obama who only wants us to be beaten by China, and President Xi, he likes me a lot by the way, so it's not a problem, you only have problems with the Democrats. remember, we would've never even had January 6th if it wasn't for me ok, no beautiful Marches, no Brave Patriots showing up, all there for Trump, they were doing a great thing, a great great thing that much I can tell you. ok, you can thank me now, thank me in the future, whenever you want, and they maybe say that I'm too nice, who knows.
