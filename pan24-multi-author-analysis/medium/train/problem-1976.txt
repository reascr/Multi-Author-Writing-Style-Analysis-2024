TLDR: Trump increased the debt by over $7 trillion, while at the same time cutting taxes for US corporations, which had the effect of reducing revenue for the country. Now FAUX News wants to blame Biden for inflation and (doom-mongering) recession.

There is not one iota of surprise at this outcome. The GOP pushed a massive tax cut while the economy was cruising, and now they are complaining about inflation like they had nothing to do with it.
The worst part, their preferred solution to the inflation issue seems to be even more tax breaks for the wealthy. Which will only make inflation worse (while just being an all around terrible policy).
