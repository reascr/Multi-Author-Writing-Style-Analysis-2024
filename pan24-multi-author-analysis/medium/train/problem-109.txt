Dems should turn this around and say: "While the citizens of Texas were freezing in the dark, why did Abbot care more about illegal immigrants by sending them to places with heat and electricity?".
I feel for the people of Texas too but it's ridiculous that FEMA is gonna end up footing the bill for all this help again. This is not a straight up natural disaster, they're allowing this to happen on purpose. Abbott is piece of human trash, while his people are freezing he's wasting money playing games shipping immigrants to the VP's house at the same time. Which he should be in jail for on it's own, frankly.
