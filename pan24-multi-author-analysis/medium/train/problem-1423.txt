Its always baffling for ne that people can support taxing the (very) rich less and belive all that trickling down bullshit.
The less fortunate use their money that keeps the economy running. Tax them very little usually they are most of the population numbers make Up for it. The middle uses a portion to grow wealth and often build the bones of a economy like shops, production service providers abd so on. Tax them in moderation they keep the country running together with the first group.
The rich have worked hard but they can Hardy fail at this Point and live a very good Life. Their wealth depends on the system as a whole running. Tax them more since a running system( goverment /country) keeps them rich.
The very rich... ( less than 1% but Most of the wealth) they can't fail at this point and are pretty decoupled from the system. The broke the scale so to speak. Tax them a lot since practically they wont notice and will still accumulate more money even If they fail often.
Once they are conservative, there’s no hope for them. If anything they’ll double down and argue they shrank because they didn’t cut taxes for rich people enough and that just a few more tax breaks will solve all the problems.
As late as April 2021 more UK poll responders thought it was a good idea to leave. After that point leaving being a bad idea started to grow and now has a 58/38% lead over it being a good idea.
