They need Israel to exist in order to fit in with their whole Revelations Apocolypse. And to be fair, the Bible does say the end of times will be signaled with Trump/Pence (trumpets).
It’s not that amazing when you realize that they’re a bunch of howling anti-Semitic doomsday cultist lunatics.
They want the world to end so all the Jews can go to hell except the 144k selected special ones, while the Christian Dominionist psychos imagine they’ll get to go to Heaven.
Yeah, the religious freaks get to indulge their eschatological anti-Semitic jackoff fantasy and the Nazis get a way to support the killing of brown people. They get the bonus these days of the brown people being killed by a government led by a fascist, which Netanyahu is.
For a certain subset of crazies, they need Israel to rebuild the Temple (which also means bulldozing some existing ancient temples like Dome of the Rock...) in order to summon Jesus (despite no one being able to know the time that He would return...) and punish all the evildoers. Who actually counts as an evildoer may surprise some of them, but they can hurt a whole lot of people in the meantime.
