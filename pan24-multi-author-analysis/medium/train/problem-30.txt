can anybody explain to me why classified documents find their way into people's homes to begin with (and apparently without them knowing)? i mean, i do not take any office-papers home by accident.

i'm not hating on biden or anything, but in both cases, trump and biden, i was wondering how that even happened and why.
I heard a podcast with someone who handled classified info for Obama and he said it happens often enough that they have the term “spillage” for it. The higher up someone is the less barriers they have to access them and that’s where the issue lies.
An intern or lower leveled government person has to be escorted into a room to view docs and be checked before they leave. A VP or President can walk in and out and take them wherever really. And since they keep most records on paper not computer it can be almost impossible to track docs especially if they go from department to department to POTUS.
