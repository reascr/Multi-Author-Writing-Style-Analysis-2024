It's like how you inherit debts of your parents if you accept the inheritance in many countries. You don't need to pay anything if you don't accept the inheritance, but if you do then debts must be paid.
Except this isn't a debt and is an example of a government seeking to steal private wealth, the very thing they are accusing said family of doing in the far distant past.
At least some of the people with African descent who currently live in Barbados are likely living a better life than their cousins in some of these countries.
Point being that while slavery is vile, we need to move past it, it happened, Africans were enslaved by Europeans, 2000 years prior to this the Romans enslaved entire tribes of hundreds of thousands of people.
