They negotiated 6 months initially, after he agreed to a guilty plea and waived the right to appeal sentencing.
Nothing ever happens to him because he goes right up to the line but has others cross it on his behalf, like Cohen, Weisselberg or Manafort. Imagine being 70 something Weisselberg and sitting in Rikers for 5mos because of Trump. WTF.

They got it down to 5 months, based on age, veteran status etc. His lawyers then tried to go lower than 5 months in their statement to the judge.
