The FBI was known as "Trumplandia" in 2016 and agents widely considered Clinton the Anti-Christ. McConnell refused to help tell the American public about Russian involvement in the election to help Trump. And don't leave out now-Speaker McCarthy who thought Trump was on Putin's payroll. Remember when Trump, Jr. left his security detail in DC and went to Bedminster - at the same time there were reports of Deripaska's plane at a nearby airport? The Russian prostitute released from a Thai jail just in time to be disappeared in Russia after apologizing to Deripaska and claiming she didn't really have evidence he was working with Trump? The news media - ALL OF IT - gaslighted America and helped put Trump in jail (oops, I meant to say "office" - Freudian slip) by ignoring red flag after red flag after red flag.... all to chase ratings, ad revenue and profit. $$$.
