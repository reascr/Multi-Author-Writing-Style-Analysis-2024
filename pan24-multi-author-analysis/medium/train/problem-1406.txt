When Trump came to power, Iran was going through a period of rapprochement with the West with decreased sanctions and increased inspectors. Trump ended this, on trumped up charges which the increased number of inspectors could find no evidence of.
well what if they are expanding their missiles to do something stupid like similar to 9/11 in magnitude such as just straight send a missile to florida.
Expect to see a lot more of this heading into 2024. The West's biggest threats putting over Trump. Putin, XI, and all their buddies would LOVE to see Trump re-elected for all the damage to trust it would cause in the West.
He also torpedoed the nuclear deal with Iran that could have seen the whole situation in the region defused in a big way (a net positive for Iran who would no longer be a pariah right?) So I imagine they're a little salty about that too, but yea the killing of their general was just...ridiculous. And we all just kinda brushed it off and forgot about it. Buried under the mountain of other bullshit he pulled.
