Even with the amount of absolute suffering the Ukrainians are experiencing, I have to say I am appreciating their subtle and unbreakable sense of humor.
I once read that there were Jews laughing and joking around in the concentration camps specifically because of their situation. A sense of humor and ability to laugh it off are often essential to staying sane in an environment that so thoroughly treats you as subhuman.
Loot makes them think of going home with their goodies instead of focusing on their mission. You want them cramming their mind and their vehicles with junk, displacing a sense of military objective and access to ammo.
I think that burning loot was a mistake. Loot is a distraction to Russians. I've seen lots of IFV's crammed full of washing machines and carpets. Stupid big things sometimes strapped to the roof obscuring vision ports and smoke dischargers.
Every washing machine displaces ammo and infantry. It interferes with combat operations. Every looted bottle of booze gets drunk and it deterioriates their minds and bodies.
If the loot is destroyed or taken back by the enemy that really demotivates/demoralizes them. It’s like they irretrievably lost their paychecks. They know they aren’t fighting nazis, nato, or defending Russia so they’re fighting because they were told to and fighting for loot. Now half the motivation is gone. I imagine seeing your equipment is poor, it’s cold and miserable, everything is dangerous, but thinking “At least I have my loot” would help cope. Now there’s less coping material.
