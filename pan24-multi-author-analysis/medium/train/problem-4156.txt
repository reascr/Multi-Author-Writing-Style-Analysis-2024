Why this is not off topic: THE fundamental part of politics is elections. A strong chain of evidence promoting trust in elections is vital to a strong democracy. When you have a politically motivated entity withholding evidence or misinforming about electoral fraud you have an undermining of the very fabric of society. We see that both in the damage FOX news caused as well as here in this case of a MAGA-cult-associated attorney general.
If I'm not mistaken that is a Brady rule violation. This is not unheard of when it comes to politically motivated suits close to the Trump campaign and presidency, especially if one considers the attempts to press charges against j20 protesters in 2017 using incomplete evidence from Project Veritas.
