Well, not sure about this particular situation, but my (Ukrainian) cousin (Russian) believes the TV personalities rather than us. She’s in the “it’s not so simple” camp though, which is basically “we know that our government lies to us, but your government lies to you too and more than our government does to us, so I will just let daddy Putin figure this out because unlike me he has access to the actual truth”. And it’s not a single case, I have more relatives in Russia, who visited Ukraine, some of them were even born in Ukraine and their position ranges from “it’s not that simple” to “finally we are showing these nazis their place”. We tried talking to them multiple times and always started in the respectful and polite manner, but the conversation always ends in an argument, because it’s very difficult to break through years of propaganda and indoctrination.
it was stated that their location was reported by civilians, as you know, if you start bringing hundreds of troops and supplies to 1 building people will notice.
