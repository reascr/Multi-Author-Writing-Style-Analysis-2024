CCW permit holders are vetted by the local sheriff department in my state and receive training from the local police after a psych interview etc. IMO, they are the only citizens/ regular people who should be allowed to carry a gun.

It's not as bad as it sounds. Between the ridiculously high tuition costs, textbooks, rent, and groceries, college students can't afford guns and ammunition.
I live in one of those states, and went to college here. It wasn’t a big deal, no one cared, nothing ever happened. I think one of my English professors mentioned it once when we had an off duty cop in the class (as an student) and we had a laugh about it.
this headline is misleading because the term “Concealed Carry” in this situation refers to someone concealed carrying with a special permit; it’s always illegal to conceal a firearm without a permit.
A better title which would give more information is “West Virginia bill would allow lawful concealed carry in Universities”.
But this isn’t about firearm ownership, but people with firearm carry permits being allowed to carry on campus. Tell me, did you have a concealed carry permit at 18?
Don’t you understand though? This time will be different Blood will run in the streets Cats and dogs living together Mass hysteria /s.
