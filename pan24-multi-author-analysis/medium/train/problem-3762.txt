I guess, but I suspect a lot of the libertarian candidate’s voters were probably people who voted for Kemp but couldn’t stomach voting for Walker but also didn’t want to vote Democrat. I suspect those voters will probably just stay home this time around since Kemp won and is no longer on the ballot.

It’s a very smart tactical move. It’s definitely an attack ad but doesn’t carry the negativity normal attack ads have, bc Warnock’s campaign isn’t even saying anything here, the only ppl speaking are Walker and voters. Exquisite chefs kiss.
Maybe some but most are just contrarian ‘both sides are the same’ asshats. I say this because it’s always around 1-2.5% Libertarian vote here.
The fact that Kemp out performed Walker by 6-7% suggests most Republican voters showed up and voted Rs down the ticket but literally just skipped ‘Walker’s’ name and left it blank.
That’s even more of a signal because had they just voted for him, he would have won. They really do not like him.
