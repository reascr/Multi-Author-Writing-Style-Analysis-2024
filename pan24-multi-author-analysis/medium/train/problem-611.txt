Yep. I had to open the article to even find out what country/city/region is abbreviated as PNG. But as a computer saavy person, the image format connection immediatelly became apparent.
"[There] we started meeting hunters who had seen and heard the pheasant-pigeon," said conservation biologist and expedition co-lead Jason Gregg.".
So you’re right, but this being the first confirmed sighting and first evidence is no less groundbreaking.
Confirmed sightings and recorded evidence are often referred to as “first time” sightings despite unconfirmed sightings coming first. Typically this work is only conducted because there’s some form of knowledge of a species’ existence from locals, hunters, etc.
It’s not just that it’s recorded evidence though, it’s also the fact that it can then be confirmed by experts that it is truly the species rather than an unknown variant of another species or a misidentification.
Even this recorded sighting by experts who themselves can confidently identify it isn’t considered enough until it’s confirmed by other experts as well (which it now has been).
Presumably the team making the identification would also aim to collect a skin specimen to compare with the existing holotype.
