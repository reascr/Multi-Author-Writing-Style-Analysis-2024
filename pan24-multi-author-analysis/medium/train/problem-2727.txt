The US and allies should be supplying Ukraine with longer range munitions to delete every Russian piece of kit in Crimea.
Limiting the Ukrainians to artillery duels of similar ranges to the Russians is just dragging this out and costing the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and innocent women and children.
Look, the US needs to get rid of obsolete or near obsolete inventory, not to mention that that inventory needs to be replaced by Lockheed Martin and friends as well as lining a couple Senators' pockets on buying shares from them. Do you REALLY think that having a short war is in ANYONE's interest save for the Ukrainians?
Ukraine is also free advertising for the might of the American military industrial complex. The more it can flex on the Russians, the better it looks.
Plus you know....at about 20 billion for a war that destroys one of the USAs biggest threats or at least sets it back 20 years with zero US casualties, well it's a bargain.
I mean it needs to happen don't get me wrong but it suits the US and NATO to have a perma weakened Russia.
