Today it was mostly quiet, but there were a couple of missile launches from Belgorod around 4pm, they weren’t aimed at Kharkiv, but at Kupiansk, or at least in its direction. We don’t know where it landed exactly, and there were no reports of explosions from anywhere, but Kupiansk has been getting hit regularly after it was liberated, it is being both shelled and hit with missiles.
It’s not getting talked about much, but the border regions in Russia actually get shelled by our forces a lot. There are constant reports in Belgorod’s and Kursk’s telegram channels about their villages and towns either getting destroyed by shelling or losing electricity, because we do target their substations in retaliation, at least the ones that we can reach.
The villages and towns that get targeted by our forces are most of the time evacuated and being used by the Russian military, so they can’t claim that we are targeting civilians. It’s funny how they were accusing us of using civilians as shields while we were protecting our cities from being overrun by the Russian horde, but then they turn around and do the exact thing they were accusing us of.
There is also one very important distinction in those two situations. When our forces were fighting off Russians from inside of our cities they had to be there, because if there were no soldiers in them, then Russians would simply enter and capture them. But Russians don’t need to be inside of their own towns and cities to defend them, nobody is going to enter Russia and try to capture their cities, so they are using their own civilian infrastructure to attack us from, when they don’t have to do it.
I have met Russians who are not dirty or scruffy so I am uncertain if it is a cultural thing that can be applied to all russians.
