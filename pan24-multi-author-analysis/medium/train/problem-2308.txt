Someone that gets it. Trump is a symptom, not the disease of what’s going on. People are overlooking just how fucking scary people like MTG and DeSantis are. Desantis has been doing his homework and, as much as I hate to say this, he’s much smarter than Trump (very low bar, I know). Dems also have a pattern of absolutely fucking things up, and so in its latest iteration, I envision no charges or so badly fumbling the case that nothing happens. Because reasons. Remember the time Bernie had massive support and they fucked him over for Hilary? That’s the shit I’m talking about.
