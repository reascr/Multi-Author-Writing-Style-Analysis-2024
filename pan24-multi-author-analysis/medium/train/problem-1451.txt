Please — logic dictates it was one of the Justices put on the bench by a Republican President, with money landing squarely on Clarence Thomas (or his wife by association and knowledge). The point of leaking the draft was to ensure that potential R-appointed Justices that Roberts was discussing with would have no choice but to vote to abolish RoeVWade; otherwise, it would looks like the Justices had cowed against peer pressure.
Or to test the waters to see what the blowback would be from the GOP/Conservatives. When there was none, they knew they had come to the right conclusion.

Yup. They just done want to “discover” who it was because it’s inconvenient. Im a little baffled why they pretended to look. Did some of them truly not know who it was?
So it was the court itself, telling people around them, who then told others (where there would be no trace or paper trail).
