Is Putin trying to emulate the Soviet Union's official (even if unrealized) policies of gender, class, and ethnic egalitarianism? No. Its excellent health and education programs? No. Its ability to strike fear into not only the West but its own citizens? Yes, but failingly.
Their mafia State is still living on the inertia of the USSR. Even if it is only a shadow of it and their pretended socialist ideology a joke. It's a slow decline of everything up until they reach the bottom, the level of other third world despotic petro States like Venezuela or Syria.
These soldiers must feel extremely lucky to be doing parades in Moscow instead of being in the trenches in Ukraine. I wonder if there are battalions that are held in Moscow just for events like this.
Same group is responsible for polishing and painting the military equipment they put in the May Day parade. It's worthless shit but it looks spiffy, even if it has to be towed.
I would be interested to see what happens if the Ukrainians reconquer this summer. What would the Chechens, the Chinese, the Turks, the Azerbaidjanese do with the Russian "Federation"...
