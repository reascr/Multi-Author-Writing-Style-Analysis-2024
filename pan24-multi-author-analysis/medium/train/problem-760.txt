My 7yo says kids his age already use them to watch TikTok on the bus to school. My kid recently asked why one of the kids in his school says “lick my balls, daddy” with a weird voice, and when I asked if the kid watches TikTok, I received a confirmation that the kid uses and talks about it a lot.
A six year old my kid met at a brief soccer camp last year was obsessed with showing mine some website that sells Marvel merchandise. I got the impression the kid was on the site often as he was very familiar with which hats he wanted to buy.
I’ve heard and experienced much more with kids much younger than 9. People aren’t caring for their kids.
The single best advice i gave my relatives was to go watch some of that spiderman shit that was promoted on youtube kids. 6/6 families started to heavily regulate what their kids can watch and limited the amount of time they can spend on their phone. Worked like a charm. And will do the same with my girl. My dad did the same to me with games years ago. Shit is not hard, someone just has to show them the worst things first.
The first minute seems pretty innocent. Reminds me of Pingu (the 80's playdo stop motion series about a penguin).
It's a tame way to explain that they depicted Joker raping Elsa and she proceeds to have an accelerated pregnancy like Eraserhead and gives birth to a doll and proceeds to punt it.
