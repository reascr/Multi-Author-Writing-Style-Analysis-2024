I’m on record being against settlements though I withhold that objection for East Jerusalem. We can discuss that specifically if you like but it’s somewhat irrelevant to this topic. Jews did not show up and start stealing Arab land. This is well documented, and it’s a cornerstone of the pro Palestinian argument even though it’s demonstrably false.
How much do you know about the early days of this conflict? How much do you know about the Ottoman land reforms of the mid to late eighteenth century? If your answer is “not much” then don’t talk about cognitive dissonance.
So you know nothing about the start of this conflict? Pity. I’ve already stated that that I’m against settlements excepting East Jerusalem, and at that only to a point. Beyond that I’ll stand next to you and criticize Israel and often have, but the claim that Jews showed up and stole land is false.
When was the last time settlement land expanded? Not when they got bigger, but when they expanded? I suspect that you don’t know the answer.
Oh. That's interesting. If it's not Israeli settlers stealing the Palestinian West Bank, then who is the one stealing their land? Who is the one passing such a law?
And do you have a clue as to how much West Bank land settlements sit on? It’s about three percent, and while I agree that it’s three percent too much it’s hardly an Anschluss.
