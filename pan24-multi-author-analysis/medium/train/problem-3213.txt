Obviously Sinclair wanted people to be appalled by the working conditions and turn to Socialism, but those other things were also important to address and regulate. The book resulted in President Roosevelt appointing a special commission to investigate the meatpacking industry, which confirmed everything Sinclair had written. Within a year of the book's publication two huge pieces of legislation were passed regulating food additives and inspections, and the FDA was founded.
Before I read The Jungle i kept hearing its what changed the meat industry. The I read it and was like “all you got out of this book was sick animals!?”.
>…. "There's no safe part of a loading dock," Maki says. With the provision in the Iowa bill that would lessen businesses' civil liability if child laborers got sick, injured or killed on the job, "it's as if they know that kids are going to get hurt.".
The food safety side of things was still important. Diseased workers handling food, losing fingers in food, rats and rat droppings in food, food contaminated with human urine and feces, food sold watered down / mixed with sawdust or other additives to increase its weight, food mislabelled as coming from a different source or animal, etc. etc.
That is a big deal! Sinclair was very disappointed. Of course this only really improved things for consumers and not for workers.
