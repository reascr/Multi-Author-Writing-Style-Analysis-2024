I have a feeling that if the house were solidly blue for a few terms, we'd get enough voting rights and election security laws passed state-by-state and federally that you'd see senate seats flip blue as well. Not to mention the disenfranchisement effect that comes with gerrymandering.
And yet, if the Electoral College were to be abolished and the Presidential Election was determined by whoever got the most amount of votes, Republicans would be the ones to never win again. Take away gerrymandering and it's likely Republicans would never hold a majority in Congress again.
The Republican party as it exists today is unsustainable. Let it fizzle out so that a new loyal opposition to the Democrats can emerge.

So what? Political parties come and go. They're private organizations and not enshrined in the constitution. We should not be disenfranchising people for the sole reason of protecting a "party".
