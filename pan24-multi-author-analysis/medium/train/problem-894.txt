School administrations cancels student screenings for many things all the time, countlessly. Barely any make it to the media. Again, especially when said media was burying it. There were political theatres across the city at the time though that were supporting its screening even if just to avoid censorship. Anyway, I don't need to prove myself to you.
I LOL, because hadn't heard of the documentary until India tried to ban it from their college students. Maybe they should've left it alone, because the scale of people it's reaching is now PLANETARY. Streisand effect has entered the chat...
I didn't endorse the content even for a second. Take a step back and you will see I simply made a comparison in school responses. You seem overly sensitive to attack anything you perceive as a conspiracy theorist. Of which I am not one. Kinda like a wedge issue for you it seems.
My school did actually. They pulled shenanigans to cancel student-organized screenings. Which just pushed us to screen it off campus. Debunking or not, my comparison was the effort to quiet it.
It was UofT, the screening was at (insert my college), and there is zero way to prove it or disprove it because it was almost 20 years ago. I am not going to dox myself any further for you.
