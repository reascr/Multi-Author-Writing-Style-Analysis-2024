"In order to help the Russians to properly target the US Patriot Missile batteries" President Biden agreed to paint a red cross and red crescent on each one. In exchange, he was given a bag of Cheetos.".
Yes. This is conflating two different uses of the word legitimate. There are legitimate military targets in accordance with international treaties and the there is the legitimacy of any international relations due to international acceptance.
Every Ukrainian soldier killed is murder, without hyperbole, and every Russian soldier is a legitimate kill (if they haven't surrendered).
In most conflicts like this one, one side is going to be illegitimate in every one of their targets.
It's basically just the same as defending your home and family against a violent house invasion - because that's exactly what it is.
Some self-styled "military" type people might disagree, and state that Ukrainian soldiers are legit targets, but that's only because they don't like the idea of soldier-killing-soldier ever being murder, because that can sometimes shine a spotlight on their own actions, or the actions of their own country.
I think Russia is probably capable of keeping the Patriots busy defending themselves from cruise missiles. Which means Russia wont have any missiles to shoot at hospitals and playgrounds.
