By continuing aid to Ukraine with heavy weapons and other supports it will keep Russia busy just to defend itself and not give time to plan or make it more difficult to plan new offensive once weather get warmer.
So far, Germany continue to fail in doing its share of helping Ukraine by denying use of Leopard tanks that Ukraine desperately seek.
Then why block other countries from giving tanks, nobody is asking Germany to give there tanks andUK has given MBTs and now they are saying the US has to give thereâ€™s first, the Abram tank is not suitable for Ukraine right now, there is thousands of leopard tanks in Europe already.
And on the other side we have various news outlets reporting from an unnamed unverifiable source that Germany says Abrams are required.
It needs to go through the export committee. That takes more than a few hours. Especially if not all members of the committee are present at the Ramstein meeting.
Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised the U.S. President Joe Biden to approve German-made Leopard tanks transfer if the Pentagon sends Abrams tanks to Ukraine, German media reported earlier.
