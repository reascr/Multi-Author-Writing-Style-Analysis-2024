Correct. They could still just say "FU" to France regarding the Caesar (don't need Denmark's approval if it was given to them, as only France is the export authority for the Caesar) and export it without France's approval, but that's going to make no western nation ever want to sell/give arms to them again, given they've demonstrated they won't adhere to contracts signed.
"... hoping to receive more modern Black Hawk helicopters from the US" probably refers to current negotiations regarding the procurement of I assume very moderately priced US Black Hawks, considering that the US Army is in the process of phasing them out anyway.
Not it's not... Their Mi-8s weren't used as a heavy lift, they were largely used as simple utility helos for troop lift, airborne, and medivac, so going to UH-60s doesn't present any loss in capabilities. Actually, in terms of airborne and medivac, the CH-47 would be more of a downgrade than the UH-60 would be, due to their size and unique flight characteristics.
