I knew a man who was one of the flight crash investigators in this attack. Unfortunately he passed away in 2018. I wish he’d been able to see this day.
Yes, that’s true. He was a retired Navy pilot that went to work for Boeing as a crash investigator. This news has me thinking about him today, so I will share his advice for life:
“Keep your nose up, come in parallel to the deck, watch your attitude, be ready to abort and come around again, drop your tail hook on time and you’ll be okay.” -Commander Fred Bereswill.
Idk about that. The other convicted guy from this crash was tried, locked up and released by Scottish justice system. And while the US does release some who are very sick on compassionate release, it’s not high profile people.
One of the women who got life without parole in the Charles Manson murders applied a few times for compassionate release while dying of cancer behind bars. She died in prison. She was denied by calif governor due to the high profile/well known nature of her crime and the outcry from the public that would have surely followed her release.
The US has many bigger prisons with large medical/hospital wings/cell blocks where sick lifers can be sent to live out the remainder of their lives under constant medical (and compassionate) care without giving them the opportunity of any freedom on the outside that compassionate release might afford them.
And yet, here in Canada, we let the people responsible for the Air India bombing off with a slap on the wrist despite killing a couple hundred Canadians.
