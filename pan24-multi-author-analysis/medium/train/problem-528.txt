How many people had to die for these scenarios where there’s a step mother and a step sister and a step brother? So the guy’s dad remarried after his mother died, so now he has a stepmom, then his dad passed away (because if they just gotten divorced, the “leading man” would have gone to live with his dad, and if his mom was alive he’d go live with her), and then his stepmom remarried a guy who’s never around, who also has a daughter? After all this loss in such a short space of time, I’d be too depressed to bone down, no matter who was stuck in the fuckin’ dryer like a moron.
