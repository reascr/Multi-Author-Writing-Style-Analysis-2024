I really don't understand how SCOTUS can overrule the decision to not proceed with another president's policy. I've never heard of something like this.
This seems like the ultimate overstepping of authority (even if there are other rulings that have been more damaging).
Especially considering the whole basis of the policy is the theory that Covid would be brought into the U.S, which should have ended when travel restrictions ended.
