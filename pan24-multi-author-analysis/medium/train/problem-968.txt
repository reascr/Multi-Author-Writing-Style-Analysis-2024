I think it was foolish for him to go back to Russia. What the fuck did he expect was going to happen? Hoping that a revolution will arise due to his martyrdom is not a good strategy. It's built entirely on hope. He would be more effective from abroad.
He's going to die in prison. Russia will not give him medical care. Russia is the type of regime that murders civilians like it was a sport. I expect the worst.
I wish he hadn't gone back either, but to be honest I think his martyrdom would be the only way he could hope to spark a revolution. He went back knowing this would happen. I think it was his last ditch effort to break Russia free from Putin's grasp. He wouldn't have a hope of sparking anything from abroad, given how tight Putin's control is over the media & Internet.
I'm surprised they aren't giving him the bare minimum to keep him alive out of cruelty and not 'mercy'. They're obviously making an example of him and want him to suffer the whole way, so just letting him die seems like they don't need him anymore.
