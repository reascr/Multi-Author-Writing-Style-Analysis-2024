To underline this point, NATO has spent between 1.5 and 3% of its combined military peacetime budget on this war in Ukraine that’s crumbled Russian power. It fields about 4 million men, thousands of jets, and like 2/3rds of the naval power in the world. Even if the US left NATO tomorrow, European NATO would likely win a war on Russia on its own as long as nukes were not deployed. Finland alone can field a military force equivalent to what Russia had deployed in Ukraine. The US military alone has the weapons stocks and resource allocations to fight all its opponents in low scale warfare at the same time, or wage two major wars simultaneously. NATO is an overwhelming force, it is why everyone who isn’t in the alliance want to join it or at least get its security guarantees. And that’s not even mentioning the nuclear umbrella which makes every member effectively immune to nuclear powers’ threats.
I don't think people realise how Powerful NATO is. Like guys, NATO could scorch the continent of Africa in a week if they decided to do so.
