And the fact that he was a former US soldier, in an rather adversary country to the US, wouldn’t of influenced the trial or the sentence? I’m not saying he’s innocent, I’m saying that I don’t trust Russian courts to do a trial against an American fairly, nor do I trust Russian jails to treat Americans fairly. Until just last year, he was stuck in what was essentially a penal colony and that’s not a situation I would want for any American (including those stuck in our domestic prison slavery).
Let him serve time in the US, after a trial and jury of his peers. Not in a Russian labour camp (Biden has since been able to move him to a regular prison tho).
It is not clear that Whelan is wrongfully detained. He has a history of convicted theft in the Marines, for which he was dishonorably discharged. He has a history of documented lying about his employment and education. He had $80,000 in cash which was clearly for some illegal "off the books" activity. Nothing a legit businessperson would have other than for bribes. He has boasted of "friends" in the Russian FSB. That "friend" is who arrested him in his hotel room with the $80k in cash.
It seems likely he was wrongfully charged _with espionage_. Shady shithead? Yes. Shady shithead the US government with trust with any real intelligence gathering? Unlikely.
