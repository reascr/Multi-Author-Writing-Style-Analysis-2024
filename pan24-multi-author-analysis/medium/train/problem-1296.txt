The problem for Russia in its retoric is that admiting it and giving an apology will make them look both incompetent and coward to their own people. They can't also admit it and say "we did it, so what?" because they fear an overwhelming response from NATO.
Russia has lost all self-respect and is just a government of desperate cunts trying hard to not be blamed for being utter failures.
So the only card they have left is to deny it and blame it to "provocations from the West" as they have been doing with everything so far. I don't have any doubt that, if the investigation shows that the origin of the explosions was in fact Russian missiles, they will start claiming false flag attack in no time.
Seriously, the Russian people don't really have a lot to look forward to in the coming decades with this kind of leadership, do they?
There's likely no coming back from this. They've kind of accepted this, in their own nihilistic way.
It's what makes me sad for Russia. I knew a lot of Russian immigrants in the last industry I worked in, and they were always great people. Friendly and fun-loving (and a lot of nihilism as you point out). I really wish perestroika had worked out better for them. Oh well. Their government still sucks ass-covered dildo, though.
What they are doing to Ukraine is absolutely atrocious. We need to bomb their critical infrastructure. Turn the lights out just as they are doing to Ukraine. Their army is also shit.
Nothing gets through to a bratty little kid like having all of their money and toys taken away and publicly given to other kids for bad behavior.
It would be a hilarious pie-in-the-face to Russia if Poland were just given a billion dollars from the frozen Russian assets the Eu has locked way, as a penalty to both compensate the victims families and rebuild whatever was lost. (And whatever else Poland wanted to spend the money on - missile defense systems, new tanks to replace ones they give to Ukraine,... whatever.).
