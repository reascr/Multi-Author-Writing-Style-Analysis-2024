They’re also deeply fearful people. My brother is one of these fascists and was very anti-mask/anti-vax. He would keep telling me that my boyfriend and I need to stop living in fear. My boyfriend literally works with infectious diseases and primarily works on treatments/cures for many of them. All of that experience was lost on my brother and he interpreted basic precautions we took in 2020/2021 for fear. It took too long for me to realize that he was the one afraid and the masks and vaccines were reminders that there was a global pandemic and that was too scary for him. They can’t accept that no one is truly in control because that chaos frightens them. So they turn to strongmen and authoritarians who claim they can fix it. They cannot understand that others do not live their lives in constant fear. Fascists are some of the weakest and most fearful people I’ve ever met.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
