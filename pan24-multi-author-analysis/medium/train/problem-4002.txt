- military history is more prominent part of curriculum. Reviving 50-year old gear and adapting repair and maintenance manuals to modern times and part availability is an interdisciplinary endeavor: a bit of archeology, a little practical engineering and a whole lot of religious levels of copium put together with duck-tape.
- military hardware is being replaced at rates not seen in decades: as modern-ish tanks, ifv, apcs and artillery is destroyed and breaks down it is increasingly replaced with mothballed designs from the 60's.
- rapid cadre rotation: current forces are being phased out as fertilizer and replaced with unmotivated recruits too stupid or too poor to avoid draft.
- trainers have been given a lot of leeway when developing new program: there is nobody to overrule them as the original trainers were sent to Ukrainian front in first waves of reinforcements.
- records show that new training program produces fully trained soldiers in quarter and sometimes even tenth of the time it used to get semi-trained draftees before. Reminder: questioning what the records show may cause suicide.
They don’t really have the capacity to get better. They produce a fair bit of energy and have some limited industry, but now they’re globally isolated and their greatest allies are more or less in the same boat and don’t really have a lot of sabers to spare if they hope to have enough of their own to rattle.
