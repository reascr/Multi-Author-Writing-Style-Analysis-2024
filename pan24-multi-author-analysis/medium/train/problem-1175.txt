Step 1) Create more and more technology capable of performing tasks normally accomplished by human beings.
Step 2) Replace the human beings that normally perform those tasks with the technology you created for that exact purpose.

No it means that the means of production are held communally and democratically and not by the state hence "communism". How stupid are you that even the basic definition from Google escapes you?
That's socialism, or at least a form of it. Stop bashing socialism would be a good first step if you want to find a better way to "utilize the benefits provided by automations and technology.".
