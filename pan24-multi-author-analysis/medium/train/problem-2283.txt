Trump was the president when he took the documents meaning he had the authority to declassify anything he wanted. Biden however was only vice president and did not have this power. If anything biden should be in more legal trouble.
A mistake over a decade long by someone who has been in politics over 50 years? Who knows how many foreign entities were able to access those documents from Biden’s garage. Iran, Ukraine, UK? These aren’t just simple classified documents, they could have endangered countless sources and even the country itself. This is a national security disaster!
