The Factory that produces ammo for the gepard is in Switzerland and they got laws that prohibit transfer of Arms to countries in war.
A weird point here is pointing out that NATO lacked adequate stockpiles of ammo for the Gepard. After all Romania is the only operator of the system in NATO.
To make up for it. Pretty wise since gepard has been useful at shooting down the 20k suicide bomb drones, a Ukrainian gepard operator said just 3 short bursts and the drone is down. Less expensive than using anti air missiles (s300 - 140k, modern defense systems 400-500k )and easier to operate 24/7 compared to manpads.
I think anyone who bought a weapon system from Switzerland is going to be considering changing and anyone who might have been considering swiss weapons is strongly reconsidering right now.
It's also worth noting that it's hard to change these kind of laws quickly (needs a public vote on it). Especially if like here in Switzerland, you have parties that are either fulky brownnosing Russia or at best indifferent to it because there is money to be made. The executive, i.e. the bundesrat, could override this law, but it is held 4/7 by those parties.
