He's the most corrupt president we ever had, is guilty but could manage the justice system since he has chosen more than half of the supreme court, has already increased his, his ministers of the government and his judges salary to over 45 grand a month while the minimum is at 1 grand, has given 10 billion to the media and self declared music artists, prohibited programming lessons on schools, cut a big chunk of money from education, people that make 1,5 minimum salary will have to pay income taxes that was to over 2,3 minimum before. Less than 20 days in to his presidency.
Conservatives think women should keep their legs closed unless they're married, and even then they should be pumping out babies instead of enjoying sex. On /r/politicalcompassmemes about the effects of the repeal of Roe v. Wade, right-wing posters were saying "Women are not having sex? Mission accomplished.".
America needs a law to enforce same thing on men. Since there are no biological consequences law is certainly needed. I'm sure sex ed would be popular and funded in no time.
