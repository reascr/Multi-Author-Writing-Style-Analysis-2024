There’s been plenty of calls on the justice department from democrats and a variety of democrats have called this Abbott/Desantis bullshit everything from human trafficking, kidnapping, inhumane cruel political theater, illegal stunts, and using human beings to start a fight with “sanctuary cities/states” and other stuff.
