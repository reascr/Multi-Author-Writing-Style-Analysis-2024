XFinity/Comcast earlier this year laid fiber in the neighborhood. Our driveway is like 530ft, and they want to charge us 8k to run a line to the house. That's not happening.

You give me $14 billion, and I won't lay fiber optic cable all over the country. How's that sound to ya?
What… 530 feet, your driveway is like a tenth of a mile? Is it like a huge estate or something? I live in a city where most driveways are like… barely the lenh of a car.
Maybe they're thinking that Satellite/5G/Whatever'sNext is getting to a point where landlines aren't going to be worth it in the long run, but... either way, Fuck Comcast.
Yeah, it's a big chunk of construction for them to pay up front for, but they'd be getting payment from whoever lives here for the foreseeable future.
For the most expensive tier they seem to offer here, at 80$ a month (and I'd be very surprised if there weren't extra hidden costs, and assuming they wouldn't raise prices, which would be silly given that it's Comcast), The subscription would pay for the construction 8.3yrs, after that they're just profiting on existing infrastructure.
