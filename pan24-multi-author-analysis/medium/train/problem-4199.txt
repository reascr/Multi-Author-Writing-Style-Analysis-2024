I guess when the astroturfers can't make any line stick with regards to policy or performance they'll go with "isn't he a lame old man, fellow kids?".

Dianne Feinstein's staff and national Democrats have been covering for her cognitive decline for years. Right wingers had nothing to do with that deception. Yes, conservatives want to destroy faith in our institutions. But when mainstream Dems aren't saying anything while someone who is clearly mentally unfit to serve is continuing the last year and a half of her term, they are doing a terrible job at preserving what little trust still remains in our institutions. It's unfair to expect anyone to trust them about a liberal politician's physical and/or mental fitness.
He’s doing well, but his 2nd term wouldn’t start for another 2 years. We shouldn’t have a geriatric President.
Feinstein's mental state hasn't been publicly acknowledged by a single person in a position of power. Without confirmation, that reporting only carries so much weight. People we elected to represent our interests are turning a blind eye while the most populous state in the country is being represented in the Senate by someone who is no longer capable of carrying out her responsibilities. And it's likely her condition is only going to get worse from here. She shouldn't have the opportunity to finish out her term. For her sake as well as her constituents', they should be pressuring Feinstein to retire immediately with the threat of public accountabliity if she refuses.
