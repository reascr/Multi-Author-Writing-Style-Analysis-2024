Right, so this is called “Gerrymandering” and is being used a number of states to increase the total number of Republican US Representatives. In fact, the voters of Ohio passed a constitutional amendment that made it illegal, but the state lawmakers ignored that and also ignored the state Supreme Court when they ordered that the district map be drawn following the rules of that constitutional amendment.
Yeah, I live in VA, and there was a period of time Democrats had the Governor's office, state house, and senate, still managed to get out maneuvered by Republicans for drawing district lines, worse is that the current system was put into a constitutional amendment so it won't be easy to change.
