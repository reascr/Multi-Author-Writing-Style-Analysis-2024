98% an accident, but the response will be critical. Otherwise a missile will hit downtown Lublin or a supply depot in Rzesz√≥w and Russia will be like ‚Äúoops sowwy ü•∫‚Äù all over again.
EDIT: I am aware this was likely a Ukrainian S300 which failed to intercept a Russian target. The loss of life remains as tragic as any other in this war, though it is Ukraine‚Äôs right to defend its territory.
I would hope that an expeditious deployment of high grade western anti-air systems, from Patriot to C-RAM comes of this. Ukraine should not need to even consider defending itself with 1970s soviet junk that might as well be a bow and arrow compared to what we have.
They are not even sorry now - in fact, they 100% claim they have nothing to do with it, which, already now, is proven to be a lie.
Edit: so since people are denser than I expected, I apparently need to elaborate my comment - being involved does NOT mean they NECESSARILY fired the rocket. Poland pretty quickly figured out the missile is Russian-made, which DOES automatically involve them.
Edit 2: Furthermore, if Russia hadnt invaded and rained missiles upon Ukraine, the Ukrainians wouldnt have had to defend themselves with their own missiles.
