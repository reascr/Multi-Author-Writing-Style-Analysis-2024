...are we blaming the wind for being Sino-centric now or what? I'm still absorbing that people in the 21st century, the age of internet via satellite, are scared of balloons. Am not sure how I'm going to process Tucker's ranting at the wind next.
Those thing on the balloon are technically a spy satalite, it's just not goes into the space sphere, hench it's cheaper and less likely to be spotted.
So you agree it's less capable than a satellite, of which China has hundreds orbiting overhead everyday, and yet it scares you because...it has solar panels.
Yea see, I just can't get into this "horror" movie, the scary monster is just too over the top silly. It's a balloon.
Or did you mean something else about the big scary balloon that daddy FoxNews told you to be scared about?
It's a balloon! It goes where the wind takes it. That's how the technology works. Oh my gosh this is disheartening how absolutely dumb the conservative party has become. I'm ashamed.
The only question I'm asking is why the red shirts are taking selfies with their guns threatening a balloon.
