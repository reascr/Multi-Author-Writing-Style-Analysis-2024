Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. This is a weekly thread posted every Monday, in order to facilitate more discussion on local issues on /r/politics. Since this is intended to be a thread about local politics, top-level comments that are exclusively about national issues will not be allowed. When commenting, please include the state you're living in, and don't forget to link sources. Also, please actually describe what happened. Things like "I live in X, you know what happened", "Nothing happened" or "[Politician] continues to be an idiot" isn't helpful to users and will be removed.
If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Enjoy discussion, and review before engaging with others.
Hi there, /r/politics. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that news about President Biden, Donald Trump or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed. Thank you, and have a good week.
Bold of you to assume they were teaching about any other Black Civil rights figures in the first place. I live in Illinois in a blue Chicago burbs county, and went to a top tier high school(...according to standardize testing results, anyways). We learned about MLK and Rosa Parks, nobody else, and even then it was a ton of revisionist history and ignoring the more controversial parts of their activism.
