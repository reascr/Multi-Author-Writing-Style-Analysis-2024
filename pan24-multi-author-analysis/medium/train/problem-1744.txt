I guess that means there's some laws/regulations that require you to put in your religion, and might experience disadvantages if you don't enter any.
Unless you walk around with an “A” for atheist badge, I find no one bothers me or most atheists I know directly for being an atheist. There is no atheist uniform or standard dress, so most people don’t know your lack of religious affiliation unless you tell them.
Religion in the US is dying on its own. Less than 50% of Americans attend church. There’s no need for atheists to go after religion. Apathy is killing it off much faster than we could.
If you grow up in a small community of religious people, expressing doubt about that religion will likely make your life suck pretty fast, possibly even at home too. Surely this is not the case for most people living in larger cities, but I would assume that a large number of people live in smaller communities and are thus more exposed to all kinds of social pressure.
Edit: Also, do not forget the whole abortion topic, which clearly indicates a social division based on religious morals and, depending on where you live, who you are and what you believe, might have a drastic influence in your person.
Yes, if you live in a tiny religious town, your lack of participation might be noticed. This is the exception and not the rule. None of my neighbors know I am an atheist or that my wife stopped participating.
Atheist is still the single most unpopular tag for a political candidate, even more than the S word.
The data says otherwise. GenZ is the least religious generation born in the US. More churches are closing than opening, and most denominations are getting hammered financially. Every year fewer and fewer people are identifying with any religion. A political surge like we are seeing in the Supreme Court does not reflect what’s going on with the people.
