Crazy because in the USA I feel people have gotten back into going to work, public and social gatherings while clearly sick. Like how it was pre pandemic.
One of the reason is that the RNA vaccines are much more effective than the Chinese ones, and China is too proud to buy foreign ones, because they want to be self-sufficient.
Not having RNA vaccines is not the reason why they are still follow Zero Covid. After you ease the restriction, there will be shit ton of people infected and the Medical infrastructure will be overload regardless. Vaccines mostly prevent Death, not infection. I live in Vietnam, after 80-90% of the population got vaccinated last year, the gov started to open up and the number of reported case skyrocketed. I personally know some people who got Covid 2-3 times despite having 2 pfizer shots.
The fixation is due to the need to save face. As much as China tries to come off as a strong unified country, a country as regimented and enclosed like China is much more volatile to public opinion than America.
If at any point the government appears weak in any regard, the people will not stand for it. This would create brain drains, more corruption, social unrest amongst the citizens.
They also need to appear to have complete control, and having states they have “control” of the situation while also suffering from several outbreaks goes against that image.
Yes, that's what I said, Vaccination prevents death not infection, but since people still feel sick, they will come to the hospital anyway. the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system in the short term is still there.
