Because as I see it, to stand behind you and the comment you are deciding to defend, you are either proposing to condone it, you are responsible for Trump's term as "If they do not stand with ... depose him and be done with it. If you have to full Qaddafi or Ceuacescu do it. Enough fucking pandering to fascists. Get rid of them by any means necessary.", or what's more likely, you are just an American hypocrite speaking from a position of privilege.
Sucks doesnt it, i voted to join the EEC but was never asked if i wanted to be an EU citizen and had to wait 40 years to let them know i never wanted to be, maybe you’ll get your chance in 2056.
This is a poor response and frankly nothing less than i would expect from someone who could still argue a case for the EU, we were never asked if we wanted to join, and had made it pretty clear before the EEC vote that we wouldn’t want to join an EU, but they forced it through anyway despite the overwhelming opposition to joining an EU system, and you’re surprised we voted out when finally given a democratic choice? Its what happens when the government decides to subvert the will of the people.
