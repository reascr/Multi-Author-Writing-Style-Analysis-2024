Before any of this stuff happened in Iran I watched a video of a man just riding a motorcycle through their country and I am pretty sure I love the people of Iran. Just not their government.
It really seems that way. I really doubt at this point it'll be realistically possible for the current regime to hold a dialogue that would be seen in good faith, and it doesn't seem like they want to if they could.
Well I know that but it just feels frustrating that we can’t talk about the political situation of another country for five seconds without someone comparing it to the US. It overshadows and distracts from the issue being discussed, and manages to center the conversation around the West even though the events being discussed are taking place in a Middle Eastern country. I know that America is completely f’ed and is slowly imploding and all that but our situation honestly doesn’t compare to the situation in Iran, so comparing it to the US feels like trivializing Iran’s struggle. Mentioning the US in this context just feels like a very tone deaf and Western-centric thing to do. Some Americans really need perspective.
