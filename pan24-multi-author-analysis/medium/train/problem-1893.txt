This has been a ruse by Ukrainian intelligence to drive a wedge between Lukashenko and his army and/or Belarus and Russia. It’s very clear Belarus wants nothing to do with this war. Even if Lukashenko wanted to join it, his military doesn’t and Lukashenko is a dead man without his military. Putin is desperate to bring Lukashenko into the war, giving him a bunch of fresh, trained soldiers instead of what amounts to useless meat to be sacrifice to slow down Ukraine. If Russia annexes or forms a confederation with Belarus as a lot of people are expecting to be the consequence of Putin’s visit to Minsk, sending Belarusian soldiers into the war would be his first order of business. The question is how successful the attempt will be, even if Putin and Lukashenko merge countries or something. The Belarusian military and people want nothing to do with the war. Could Russia pull it off or would it become a disaster with lots of Belarusians resisting it?
How are we going to provide Ukraine with 100,000s of units of artillery ammunition, when last time I checked we don't even produce that much?
