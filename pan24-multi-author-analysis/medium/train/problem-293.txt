The level to which hochul has gone to bat for this man is still baffling. There's zero benefit to this fight for her.

Expending all of this political capital for nothing.
Machine politics means that all the power rests with "the machine", and anyone who defies it gets frozen out. That's how Democratic politics has traditionally been done in New York. It doesn't really matter who this guy LaSalle is; it matters that he's in with the right people. When you're in with the right people, sometimes you have to wait your turn but you're not supposed to outright lose.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
