No. My mum voted to leave because she wanted ‘to take back control’ over our borders. I asked how that was going with all the immigrants crossing the channel in small boats and she blamed France for not stopping them. When I pointed out that we had ‘taken back control’ now and asked why we couldn’t use that control to prevent this happening, she stopped talking to me. Logic is lost on them.
Lol have you ever spoken to one of them? Seeing it will never be worth the effort required. This is our reality now, it’s worth just humouring them for the sake of a quiet life in the same way you tell a 4 year old their art is amazing.
Still don't get why they want to come here so badly considering the UK is falling apart and it's literally mad max over here. Everyone is wearing leather, driving down sandy streets and there is no civilization anymore.
Fair enough, then in the same way you pretend to agree with an excessively angry/grumpy person who is finding fault in literally everything they see, whilst quietly wishing they would just stfu.
