Let’s not pretend that the Kurdish people are a monolithic group. We unfortunately sold out the Syrian Kurdish dominated SDF to appease Turkey/Erdogan and partially to protect Trumps business relationships in Turkey. We won’t sell out Iraqi Kurds in Erbil to appease Iran; the US has been waiting for an excuse to retaliate against Iran. We’ve got no reason to appease the Iranian regime and we actively are supporting/amplifying protests there. I don’t think I’m wrong here.
LMFAO that's not regime change. Regime change is just forcing a change in regime via direct military action. It doesn't matter if the US picks it or not. It's still regime change and it's still a fucking horrible way to waste lives and money to accomplish less than nothing.
The US reacting to an Iranian attack on Kurdistan is not "regime change caused by US military action", it's just reacting to an attack by Iran. If that frees up the protests enough to topple the regime, so be it, but letting Iran attack freely isn't going to work.
The US will absolutely not allow Kurdistan to be attacked by Iran under any circumstances. In any case, this would be disastrous to Iran, who would immediately be faced with Kurdish resistance like they’ve never seen before.
