I wonder why they don't give more specifics about their plan. Criticizing organized religion is protected speech. We already have laws that address harassment and threats. What else do they have in mind? Are they going to start arresting people who criticize religion? That's a scary thought.
That's already very much illegal. They could just focus on enforcing the laws that are already on the books. Harassment, threats, domestic terrorism, etc. are already illegal. Creating a new agency seems wasteful and redundant.
