“We have demonstrated for the first time that a laser can be used to guide natural lightning," said physicist Aurelien Houard of Ecole Polytechnique's Laboratory of Applied Optics in France, project coordinator and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Photonics.
I wonder if this would work in the opposite direct, could a plane or satellite direct a beam through a storm to trigger lightning on a target and really go Bond villain.
__Researchers have used a high-powered laser beam pointing into the sky in northeastern Switzerland to divert lightning strikes. They claim it is a significant advance in lightning protection technology.__.
Scientists reported this week that they had succeeded in using a laser aimed at the sky from the top of Mount Santis in the Appenzell Alps in northeastern Switzerland to divert lightning strikes.
The scientists say their “Laser Lightning Rod” could safeguard critical infrastructure, including power stations, airports, wind farms and launchpads. Lightning causes billions of dollars in damage on buildings, communication systems, power lines and electrical equipment annually. It also kills thousands of people.
