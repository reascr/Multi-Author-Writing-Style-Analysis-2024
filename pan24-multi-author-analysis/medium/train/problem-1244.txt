Yeah, my current concern as an American is not a long dead fascist, like Pol Pot and Mao Zedong, that killed many of their own citizens. I'm not aware of a surge of Americans and the US government that are actively stating those dictators and fascists were good people and their atrocities are being celebrated--except from the orange guy and MAGA followers. Sooooo....
What's the dude's fascination with denouncing long dead and gone people? How far back do they want to do with it? Are we going to have to denounce the Roman Empire for killing Jesus? Why haven't they denounced the Confederation?

Weirdly, the word 'Trump' never appears in any of the right-wing articles on this exchange. How odd!
