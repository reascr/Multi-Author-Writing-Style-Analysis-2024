"Listen, I want to reconcile our nations interests, so as a peace offering here's a plot of land, and as a land owner you are now a Russian citizen, welcome to the conscripted forces, glory to the Motherland!".

has been making efforts to fund Russia-friendly voices and political actors on both extreme right and left of pretty much all western countries whose policies it cares about. From that $15m check Le Penn took from Putin in France, to the right and left extremes the German centrist coalition has to fend off, to the Russophile noises Berlusconi has been making (I know he’s a has been and irrelevant, but that’s one of their hooks in) to grander things like brexit and trump.
It's just worded in a weird way, it means "The Italian ambassador residing in Moscow" i think, Italy doesn't have an embassy anywhere else in Russia.
This lack of self awareness is kind of reassuring. And a reminder to everyone to look at yourself in the mirror every so often and ask ‘am I committing genocide today?’.
So he is the "ambassador to Moscow" in the sense that he is tasked with representing Italy within the city of Moscow.
