In a second, separate 221-207 vote -- aimed at addressing progressive Democrats' concerns over protecting workers -- the House added seven days of paid sick leave to the agreement, which currently calls for only one.
Wow the second vote basically only got the dems voting yes. Doesn't insipre much hope for the GOP congress next term with an even smaller majority since we can see that GOP won't break party lines if it benefits the dems.
The GOP was against it because it granted several concessions to the workers and a strike at Christmas would be a talking point for years.
And the railroad companies are also pissed because it's a compromise which gives some of the concessions requested. Despite requests not to alter the terms, Congress did alter the terms in favor of the workers.
