That precedent has already existed for decades - UN members have been annexing territory acquired via military operations quite frequently despite it being inadmissible by UN Charter. Still, a certain superpower does not care for international law but instead torpedoes international law and institutions, rips up treaties, pushes for this so called "rules-based international order" (everyone follow the superpower's rules). Violating international law or shielding allies violating international law has always presented this danger of setting terrible precedent - when the bad guys do it the legal framework is already in tatters. Then the only hope will be that the "good guys" can beat the "bad guys" into submission.
Peace resolution is fine if only Russia will accept. Unfortunately, Putin came this far to ruin Russia's future and lives of its people so odds are (and I hope I am wrong here) he will refuse and the war will continue at great cost to both countries.
If Putin had two brain cells to rub together he might still be able to negotiate stuff like a short term lease of Sevastopol (maybe 10 years) and/or have Crimea returned to Ukraine but as a special autonomous region that would allow Russia's to visit/live/work without a Ukrainian visa (but still Ukrainian laws and jurisdiction).
