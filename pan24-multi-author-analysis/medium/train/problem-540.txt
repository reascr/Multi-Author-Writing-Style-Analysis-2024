So, actually yeah. George Friedman from Stratfor, which was a major private intelligence service, was predicting around 2008 that Russia would escalate their military aggression from Georgia into Ukraine. Friedman even called the ball with a 2014 date of entry into Ukraine, with a window up to 2018.
I'm going to guess that they'll announce they're sending them in a few weeks, once the first round of pilots finish their training. This media is the start of PR for domestic consumption in preparation for the coming announcements.
I skimmed the article, but where is it mentioned pilots are being trained? Edit: I saw the summary, ok so 50 that could start training..
Also, I'd love to see it but I'm wondering how effective they will be. Even for more modern aircraft the airspace seems less than permissive.. In western doctrine you would have EW aircraft, supported by wild weasle sorties, CAP and so on to support strike missions. Yes they had some success flying HARMS of mig-29s but still. I hate to see get a bunch of pilots with limit flight hours immediately get shot down.
