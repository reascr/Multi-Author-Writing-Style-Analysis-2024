One of the reasons they struggled so much in the midterms is a big push for them was the economy and inflation which already cooled by the time of the election. So inflation is still an issue but much less pressing.
The GOP ran on fighting inflation (with no policies in which to do so), but is now proposing a national sales tax, raising the retirement age, and gutting Medicare and Social Security.
Right after the election and the red wave turned out to be a trickle I had an instructor comment "well, I guess we better get used to high gas prices". And then gas went down about 50 cents. Republican voters have no idea what affects the economy.
I have no doubt you’re right. They’ll try to take credit for it. My point is just that it wouldn’t even be true that “Inflation finally went down under the Republican House”. It started going down well before they took any power. And you’re also right that none of their actual plans or policies are designed to ease inflation.
