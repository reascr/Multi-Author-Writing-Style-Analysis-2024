Standing charge alone for gas and electric costs about £24 a month, up over 2x the previous price. After that you have gas costing 10p / kWh and electric 33p kWh. Those are over 3x and over 2x the price paid at the start of last year respectively. It all adds up and as I imagine a lot of people here have discovered it makes you aware of how much different things cost to run.
honestly, I hope it stays this way with the price levels. A former secretary-general from nato mentioned in an interview recently that the reason for gas prices to drop is because of less need ( less economic growth ) in China. If china needs more gas next year or in 2024 people in europe very likely have to deal with higher prices again. btw i’m no expert so i don’t know if it currently is the main influence on the prices.
If only that was reality in the UK. European average is £650 or less a year for energy bills but over £2500 for the UK and will somehow go up AGAIN in April. This government should've gone years ago.. I despair. It's turned into a hell hole for anyone not already ludicrously rich and it was never easy to begin with. Poor and / or sick? Fight for scraps at best.
No storage in the UK or very little compared to other countries. Sold off for short term gain. No storage means no buffer to smooth out the price spikes and shortages.
