Oh we got a real bad fent problem too, don't worry. I personally know 3 ppl who have died of od in the past few years. Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is the epicenter, the streets are just littered with needles and junkies.
Yes, it is a great time for Canadians to do this. And make a very big deal of it as well. It will serve as a bit of a distraction for the ruskees in addition to Ukraine. Find a few more stuations against them as well. It will stretch them till they break. They can't fight the whole world at the same time. Hitler tried that and it didn't work for him, either.
According to who LOL? We have one of the best trained forces in the world, but our hardware is outdated and in horrible condition. We can’t keep 4 submarines operational, our frigates have been outdated for decades, and our fighter jets are Australian hand me downs. Hardware upgrades are coming in the next couple decades, but it’s not exactly a top tier force right now.
I’m not sure but they can keep their special forces troops alive on dispersed ops in the winter for at least three weeks at a time, meanwhile Canada’s trucks break down any time someone says the words “road move”.
Plus, our retention and recruitment is shit. I’m fairly sure the CAF is currently operating with a manpower shortage of 10,000 people. We’re burning out the existing members, and not training new ones fast enough to fill empty spots. And that’s even before getting to the massive workplace culture issues in the CAF.
At least to me, none of these things are signs of a “top tier” military. We can and should be doing much better.
