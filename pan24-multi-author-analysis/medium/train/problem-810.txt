BRUSSELS, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Europe's biggest cities will donate power generators and transformers to help Ukrainians get through the harsh winter ahead, as part of a drive launched on Wednesday.
Since October, Russia has been targeting Ukraine's civil power and heating systems with long-range missiles and drones. Moscow says the aim is to reduce Kyiv's ability to fight and push it to negotiate.
The European Union's assembly launched the campaign with Eurocities, a network of more than 200 cities in 38 countries.
"The European Parliament and the EU have shown remarkable solidarity with Ukraine on the humanitarian, military and financial front. Now they need practical support to get through the winter.".
Part of the reason it's so cold is the lack of clouds. The clouds act as a blanket to hold in the heat. On clear nights, you know it will get especially cold.
Winter gives very little solar power; the sun is low in the sky, short daylight hours and lots of clouds.
We have a 4.4kw System, in Sept the peak output was 4kw, now in the best conditions doesn't even hit 3kw. Probs only getting a fifth of what it can to in the summer, and we're not even at the winter solstice yet.
It can be sunny, but the sun is weak and days are short. In slightly further north (Netherlands) and on some sunny days last week the electricity generated by my solar panels is already a _lot_ less than during summer days. In winter it's next to nothing.
