Hamas has not had an election since 2006. Maybe new leadership would help find solutions. I wonder if the Palestinians really think their leaders are doing a good job.
I can’t imagine that the average Palestinian is happy with Hamas being in charge, but they have a lot to lose by speaking up. People who try to organize against Hamas have a way of being branded with one crime or another, and dontcha know… the penalty is always death. Sometimes the families are leveraged, but it’s never pretty.
People talk up Gaza as an Israeli “open air prison” ignoring that Egypt controls a border and Hamas controls Gaza. Hamas gets a lot of money and power by doing it too, and influence, all of which they stand to lose if they’re replaced in a democratic process. It’s in their interest to keep the cycle of violence turning, if it ever stopped they’d be irrelevant.
Poll by international organisation put Hamas as the overwhelming leader in elections two years ago when Palestinian elections were scheduled.
This is not the first time that Hamas has launched rockets that fell within the strip. Moreover whenever there are victims from such failed launches they report them as if they were killed by the IDF.
