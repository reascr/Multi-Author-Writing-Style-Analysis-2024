Don't mind the parent comment too much. Portuguese press thrive on taking quotes out of context and making these clickbaity soundbites/titles.
And now regarding the quote in the title, he said it unprompted when everyone was talking about the match. He brought up the human rights issue in Qatar and after that the conversation became a little "akward" so he brought it back to football.
Regarding the child abuse he said that 400 was not that high a number, because he thought that meant that a lot more were not reported. So he felt that number paled in comparison to the true number.
Both quotes came out a bit weird but they were not said with the intention that the press tried to pass off.
I mean, that might be true though depending on the upper ceiling. Statistically there will always be child abuse occurring in those types of situations. 400/1000 would be a mind numbingly serious problem. 400/10,000,000 would be a success. Obviously you want that number as close to zero as possible, but you cannot remove crime from humanity.
The question here is that child abuse is not a statistic. It can't be. And we have our country's 1 figure stating that "it's not that many".
Sorry, one is already too many. And stating anything other than this is almost the same as saying "yeah, it's okay, go abuse little children as long as it's not over X cases, we're good.".
