At this point the vast majority of any liberal opposition to Putin is dead, in jail or in exile. Those remaining in Russia know that they are in a deep minority and for the most part are to scared to do anything. The few protests against mobilization and the war have been small in size and number and not the kind of large scale popular movements that actually has the potential to mount a serious threat to the regime. Putin has essentially spent the past 20 years convincing Russians not to care about politics and there is a deep sense of learned helplessness from the Russian people. Of the Russians that are political many of them are deep nationalists who favor Putin or want harsher action in Ukraine.
there is fighting up near kreminna as well as all the various scouting and little pushes that happen pretty much everywhere.
For the US and a modern military, it's 1:3 death to injury, and that's injured getting rotated out of combat.
And I think that ratio goes a long way in explaining why the Russian death toll seems abnormally high for a post WWII conflict. The US suffering 91,000 killed in a post WII conflict would be absurd (that number is just under total US deaths in Korea+Vietnam) but if Russian soldiers are getting injured and then dying from wounds at much higher rates then it could drive their death toll while their total casualties isnâ€™t quite as high relatively speaking.
