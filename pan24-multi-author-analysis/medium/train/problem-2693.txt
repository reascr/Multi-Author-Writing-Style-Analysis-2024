Can someone please help me find the right subreddit for my texts with my “friend” , he’s Indian and we had an argument that includes India, muslims, Russia and Ukraine war as well. (Very political) and as you probably already guessed he’s pro Russia and pro slaughter of the Indian Muslims. I would like to put out these texts on Reddit but I don’t know the right subreddit for that.
lol I guess these „friends“ are everywhere. Similar experience with ultra-nationalist who would think they are the king of the world because some privileged Indians got to be CEOs of some tech companies. They are blinded by their pride and think the world is black and white. Just time waste talking to these people.
He’s not one of the wealthy or privileged people though… but he is thinking very apathetically, like black and white thinking. The texts could explain better than I am capable of. …. He thinks that just because I’m trying to explain to him that you shouldn’t hate a nation for their religion or something but an individual instead and he thinks that I’m supporting the criminals due to that and that if I’m just anti Indian I could just say so lol, which I’m not. I’m not dumb or brainwashed to hate for example the Russian diaspora that lives in my country just because they’re Russian descent. I know that though there are a lot of criminal Romani people in my country I don’t think that they all are criminals and should be genocided or terrorised due to that. But I guess he and many Indians think that way. Which is awful and unfair and it only brings suffering to this world. Such thinking is biased and very one sided and dangerous.
Also no ones religion is superior, every religion has its good and dark sides, to pretend otherwise is foolish.
A lot of times bad people use religion to infringe peoples basic human rights and extorts people, and even brainwashes people. But religion is created to give hope and support for people in tough times. So it can be used for both good and bad, and we the people chose what to do with it.
Also people have been brainwashed to believe everything the government tells them even when it’s not true. There are some cultural racism there too, the whitewashing and no need to lie and pretend that that doesn’t exist, when there is plenty of data about it. And so is the red light district also a thing. Rape culture although masked still exits there. Am I trying to say that India is a bad place and that they’re bad people? No, that would be the same black and white thinking just like about Muslims.
Do y’all think that the good side is the one who strikes the first blow? Cause that’s what Russia did. They started the war, not Ukraine and not NATO.
Russia is a terrorist and fascist country and should be treated as such (the government mostly) and though ussr helped India it hurt and infringed autonomous countries that bordered it, did similar things that nazis did. And now these days they’re trying to do the same, to bring back the ussr and cause terror to other countries. Ukraine was and is an autonomous country and doesn’t belong to Russia and the countries that join NATO joins it out of their own free will. But whatever believe the brainwashing instead I don’t care, truth is truth so no matter how many times you’ll spew lies a lie won’t become the truth.
You’re absolutely right about that, it’s a time waister to even try to make them understand the truth. But here I am waisting my time on writing it here anyway lol 😅.
P.s. the Indian government isnt fully bad but isn’t innocent and pure, democratic, flawless government either.
He’s literally ok with Muslim women of India being raped because they’re Muslims. And the rest of his arguments only shows that he is in fact indoctrinated with such thinking. And is ok with Russian terrorism and terrorism of Muslims (just because they’re Muslims) is that the actually correct way of thinking? But of course you’re Indian as well so of course you’re backing him up. I’m very disappointed in him and thank you so much for your useless comment.
