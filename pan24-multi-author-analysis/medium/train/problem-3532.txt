He has the presumption of a Jimmy Carter without the benefit of the attendant humility, but with the added burden of naivete and hubris.
At some point in his past, perhaps it was his mother (or maybe his wife) told him that he was special, and he's been running on that ever since, apparently. No doubt he sees himself as France's "wartime" president now.
If he even hints at Ukraine ceding territory to Russia in order to achieve peace, then how about Macron throws in the French Riviera for Putin and his oligarch cronies?
China doing a dry run for Taiwan invasion to see how much BS the world community can take. . Macron has not learned his lesson after his negotiations with Putin . . Will Chinese use extra long table to show they are serious?. . Not important or real without comical table.
I don't understand your reasoning. Even Zelenskyy wants to talk to Xi. There's no disadvantage in trying to get China to do the right thing? I think the whole "Hope for the best, expect / prepare for the worst" makes sense as you can show your own populace that you're trying for a peaceful solution. This could weaken the arguments of those idiots that are still against sending weapons.
