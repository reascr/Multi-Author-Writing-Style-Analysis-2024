I agree, I think it's a sign that people want some level of bipartisanship or larger majorities than just simple ones. Ballot initiatives can have major impacts on a state, so ensuring they have broad support is a good thing.
I guess regular folks really do like stuff like the filibuster. The simple majority just permanently voted away their ability to do things with a simple majority. Maybe this should be a warning sign for those who want to shift more in the direction of simple majority votes - and to those who would try to primary Sinema in 2024 over her support of the filibuster.
Ohio is trying to do something similar in spite of having control of the entire state legislature. They want to make it so a supermajority is required to pass citizen initiatives. Last thing we passed with a citizen initiative was gerrymandering reform. So you might see why Republicans legislators might want to end direct democracy in the state.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The only thing this does is makes it harder to have a direct say in democracy and your future. Theres a reason these same state legislators pushing these agendas aren't putting the same 60% mandate on themselves.
Just to recap - a simple majority is good for the representatives we elected in our representative democracy. But when it comes to citizens directly representing themselves, you need a 60% super majority. It doesn't even make sense.
