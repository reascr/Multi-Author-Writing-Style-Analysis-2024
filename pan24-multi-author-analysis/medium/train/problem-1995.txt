BTW if you know a business that has obtained a PPP loan for too much/at all when they weren't supposed to be eligible, you can report them and the secret service will give you 10%-30% of the money returned from the loan amount as a whistle-blower fee. It's not often I suggest snitching, but these people stole money at a time when people were dying/losing jobs/having economic troubles due to a pandemic and pocketed it instead of actually paying employees. That's messed up. I myself, who didn't defraud the government, say these people deserve to lose the money they stole and if you can get paid for helping get that money back to people who really need it then hey. Live your best life.
Yep. The US Secret Service handles a lot of financial crime stuff like fraud, counterfeiting, etc. I had to call them once at my old job when we caught some jackasses hauling around a box of fake money.
