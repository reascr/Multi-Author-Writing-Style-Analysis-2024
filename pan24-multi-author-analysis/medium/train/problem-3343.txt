According to the article, Santos requested that the pet store owner make the proceeds from the "adoption fees" out to him personally. The shop owner refused and made the check out to the "charity" but when he got copies of the cleared checks, they had been altered and made out to Santos.
His checks were used to buy puppies. He then held a charity puppy auction. When the checks bounced, he said his checkbook was stolen and someone else wrote those checks. But has no explanation for where the puppies in the auction came from.

So…. If he stole puppies from them and had them rescued……….. wow. Sometimes even the worst people can do the right thing entirely by mistake…….
