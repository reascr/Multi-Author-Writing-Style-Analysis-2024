I did say "Within the church". I didn't imply the entire church is just one big paedophile ring, I said it's harbouring one. A group of powerful and influential people, actively facilitating a space where paedophiles can be active, and using their positions of power in the church to get away with their crimes.
Found out the parish priest at my primary school was arrested about a decade after I left, after it turned out he abused a bunch of kids in a child's hospital, and was then moved around the country by the church and it was all covered up, and they placed him as the parish priest of a church on a catholic primary schools grounds of all places... until some kids(turned adults) came out and hunted him down and brought it all back up again.
Once it all got too much publicity, the church dropped him like a stone. But that was only after 20 years of covering up the already know incidents.
Pretty sure the Catholic church with the amount of known abusers and number of victims in the last 50 years puts the church as the largest pedophile protection ring in modern history.
