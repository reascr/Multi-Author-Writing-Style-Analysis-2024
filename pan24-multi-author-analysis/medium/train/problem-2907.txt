Gee, I wonder why he would feel the need to use a private email and a pseudonym to do something that republicans insist is totally fine and above board?
Maybe because of Florida's very strong sunshine law, which makes it very easy for the public to force disclosure of state government records?

I think he did! But I doubt anything will happen to him, because the AG works for DeSantis too.....grrrr.
