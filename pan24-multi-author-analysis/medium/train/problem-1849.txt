I pay enough attention to know generally what's going on, but I do have a life. I've never read or heard mention from any common news outlet about Wagner. Blackwater I've heard, from war in the middle east, but I've still never heard that acronym used.
Kind of ironic considering the "Satanists" statement was almost certainly made to appeal to the large amount of Islamic ethnic minorities overrepresented in the army.
Regarding the west, they can range from glorified security guards & in most cases that’s the extent of it but some may be more specialised such as OGA contracts, it’ll all depend on the client & the requirements. It’s not a profession that suits everyone, the money is very good but during peacetime the requirements in general will be more strict.
I would wager if you're not in the military, you've never heard of it. I actually just googled it, and the only company I've even ever heard of is Raytheon, and just because i grew up in that area.
Well since only people involved in the military seem to know what it is, which accounts for less than 1% of the population, I would consider it 'highly uncommon'. The world doesn't revolve around you, people have different experiences.
