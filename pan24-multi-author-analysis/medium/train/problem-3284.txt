“Being homosexual is not a crime. It’s not a crime. Yes, it’s a sin. Well, yes, but let’s make the distinction first between sin and crime,” he said.".
He was speaking about in countries where it is illegal. He's not going to outright say homosexuals are OK. That would kill his career as pope. The cardinals would absolutely have him removed via scandals.
Well then he was wrong, because homosexuality is in fact a crime in countires where it is considered illegal.
I guess we can hope that some day, knowing that his career is reaching its end, he’ll come out and say that being gay is fine in no uncertain terms.
However yes it still is a crime in some places he only made this open statement to get publicity because it's been months since the Catholic Church made any sort of address worth a headline somewhere.
He didn't... he said it isn't a crime... speaking specifically in terms of the countries that it is illegal and even a death sentence. The church isn't going to change for a few more decades at least. Being gay myself I know damn well that until the younger generations take over the mentality will not change.
He would like to have the community accepted (which I think is more a political move than an actual truth) but he knows very well the church isn't ready for that kind of appeal to a biblical derived sin that's been there since the commandments were first written.
