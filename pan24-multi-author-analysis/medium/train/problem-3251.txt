Other than social issues reducing the size and scope of military is probably the only thing libertarians and democrats agree on, but most libertarian sub groups view a strong military as the only thing they like federal money being spent on because of national security. However most libertarians also want to vastly reduce or eliminate foreign aid, most of which is given out in part to prevent the need for military intervention or support in other places.
Both parties are hesitant to it because it weakens their chances of forcing their ideal through. Reps will point to Palin in Alaska, and Dems would point here (libertarians tend to be much closer to republicans, thus with RCV I would imagine most of the libertarian votes would have went Walker).
