Be sooo glad you dodged that bullet of moving to Florida. I moved to Tampa from NC in \2007 or 2008 - after my ex-wife and I got separated. It was like going back in time several decades - back into the Jim Crow Era Deep-South. Within the first year of being there, I went to jail five times - all for BS charges. Anywhere from trespassing to made-up charges of drug possession and battery on a law enforcement officer (there are tresspassing signs are everywhere as the justification to arrest poor/indigent/transient people and the more serious charges were fabricated by the arresting police officer and the sheriff's deputy at the booking desk). The Public Defender threatened me with 15 years in prison for all the "charges", and was trying to get me to take a plea-bargain for an 8-year sentence. I had only been in Florida at that time for about 9 months.
He worked at Guantanamo Bay in 2006 during George W. Bush's presidency. While it's unclear what exactly the work he was doing there was, it's clear he didn't object to a work atmosphere filled with the casual dehumanization of POC.
i'm sure florida will be well served by desantis spending the next two years running for president, flying around the country courtesy of florida's tax dollars.
