You don’t want to die - don’t go to war - easy. You do understand that in the beginning these were mostly volunteers and contractors who invaded Ukraine? Probably still are. Wagner and other private companies are 100% contractors + criminals serving 10-15 years who were offered pardon if they serve. Famously, one of the guys they “recruited” is a cannibal and a serial killer. As of right now, the average age of dead Russians is 30-35 years old, according to BBC. Kids my ass, they are all grown men murderers. Marvel is a fairly tale, what’s going on in Ukraine is unfortunately very real. Of course they don’t want to die. I hope they do.
It's a lot more than that. Ukraine estimates 120,000 killed on the Russia side. If you include wounded we're talking 3x that number. They already burned through 500,000 men on the Russian side. The cold and mud has also created a ton of none combat casualties. That's why the Russians are calling up another 1.5 million men. Unfortunately for them their equipment situation is bleak so they are gonna be sent into a meat grinder while the Ukrainian side is well equipped just lacking in ammunition. Ukraine has so many volunteers that they are turning people away.
