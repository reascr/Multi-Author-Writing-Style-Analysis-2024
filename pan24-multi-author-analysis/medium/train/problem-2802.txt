Having a 1 or 2 seat majority either way is not a working majority for either party. It would break the majority every time there's a vacancy, which would lead to constantly re-running leadership elections, followed by replacing all the committee chairs, followed by replacing the committees majority staffs (the majority typically gets about 2x the staff on committees). Not to mention office space, which is also allocated differently for the majority party. The House would essentially drop into chaos every time someone resigns or dies. And we already have 1 Dem talking about quitting to run for mayor.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Yeah… a ‘news’ channel that has argued in court that its primetime lineup is purely entertainment that no reasonable person would accept is news doesn’t have credibility.
