A church that’s acted as a 1 advocate for the spread of HIV in Africa by convincing its people that using condoms will send them to hell makes this request. It’s insane.
That's why they oppose education and safety. They don't give a shit about people being healthy and safe if they don't live according to their interpretation of the Holy Book.
In my experience it's something a little different, which honestly seems even more psychotic in the final analysis.
They actually earnestly believe that the 'sinners' will suffer literally infinitely more over the course of eternity, so they fully believe they are "rescuing" them from eternal torture by forcing them to suffer on earth. The rationale is, a little material suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of christ on the cross - it is our privilege to suffer for jesus on earth so we can spend eternity with him in heaven.
Raised catholic and still recovering...this kind of discussion is always cathartic because when you're raised in that kind of environment you can't help but think everyone in the world must have the same fucked up beliefs as the adults that surround you.
