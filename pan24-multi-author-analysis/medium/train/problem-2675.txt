Reminds me of djt lying about the employment rate before the 2015 election. He said it was 30 or 40%. That the Dept of Labor was laying to us about Obama’s numbers (5-6%). Then, the numbers came out during his first week in office. Sean Spicer announced the rate was 5.something %. When challenged by the press as to the discrepancy between djt’s numbers and the real numbers given how improbable it would be to go from 40% to 5% in a week, Sean smiled acknowledging the farce and affirmed the Labor’s numbers were accurate.

That's what the article seems to be suggesting if one is to take his recent statements at face value:
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
It's almost as though all of this outrage inducing rhetoric was done in bad faith for the purposes of controlling the narrative in the lead up to a midterm election.
