The Qanons are just slightly slower than the average expert who said Russia wasn't planning an invasion into Ukraine. My dear friend who's a big fan of the MSNBC and Behind The Bastard said we shouldn't have been pushing Russia when the war started. It's easy to forget these things after a year.
The USSR was a geopolitical superpower during the cold war, but collapsed. Russia's priority is not to make itself an attractive alliance partner, but relies on its abundance of land, minorities, nukes, fossil fuels and lack of ethics to run a military and civilian war and enforce their alliances. Fuck all who use violence. You can whataboutism about the blood on the hands of Western countries in the past, but each case deserves their own judge and we're now judging Russia for its violence in Ukraine.
I'm sick and tired of the "Russia was cornered by US/West/NATO" narrative because it follows the "US & Russia are geopolitical superpowers" narrative too much where European countries are just their poker chips. Geopolitics always matter, but Russia should realize that times have changed, the cold war era is over and that this narrative has become ineffective and irrelevant.
Nowadays, all countries should have autonomy over the alliances they prefer to strive for. If a country like Ukraine wishes to join an alliance with the EU or Russia, it should be the souvereign choice of their fairly elected leaders. Fuck all fraudulent practices during elections. No election may be perfect, but Russia runs one of the worst.
So he plans on absorbing Kazakhstan and Georgia too? What I don’t understand is why didn’t he do this at the beginning and not when he’s 70 and dying of cancer.
