I think the lawsuit was originally designed to keep control of the chamber until May and try to pass some awful ballot measures but without 102 votes they couldn’t do it. So, for the GOP, better to elevate an “independent” to the speaker role rather than a liberal democrat when the democrats potentially get over the 102 vote margin. And democrats obviously understand this as they all voted for Rizzo as well.

But without a GOP speaker I don’t know (I literally don’t know) if they couldn’t bring their insane ballot measures to the floor.
