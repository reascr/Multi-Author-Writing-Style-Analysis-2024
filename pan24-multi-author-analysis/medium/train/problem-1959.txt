The problem was that the path laid out was petering to an end. China's demographic problems, endemic corruption, capital controls, and environmental (mostly water) issues were causing China's growth to run out of steam and they would be stuck in the middle income trap. Chinese wages had already risen to the point that they weren't really "cheap" any more and productivity was substantially higher in many other countries, including middle income countries like Mexico. Much of the recent GDP growth of the last few years was due to a rapidly inflating property and construction bubble that is by far the biggest in world history egged on by huge influxes of government funds which was massively distortionary - and which was in no way sustainable. The CCP was no longer going to be able to provide consistent economic growth to meet their end of the bargain with their people; "We will provide steady and strong economic growth and you will not revolt and kill us".
