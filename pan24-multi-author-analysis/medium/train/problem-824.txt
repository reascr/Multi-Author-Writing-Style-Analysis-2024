Not to continuously knock the Missouri education system but you know none of that matters for a Senate race right? You cannot gerrymander a Senate race. You can try to suppress voter turnout but thats not even remotely the same as what youre implying. Missouri, as a whole, elected Hawley.

Well, she was one of the last ones. The state was blue, then purple, now red. Missouri has had plenty of Democratic senators and governors. The Republicans now do well there by using ballot initiatives to keep liberal policies or add liberal policies. Most recent being recreation marijuana use. That would never have passed the Missouri congress. The Republicans can go back to their conservative constituents and say “we had nothing to do with this.” Along with gerrymandering, and slashing education it’s going to be a red state for a long time. “You don’t want to vote Democrat and be like St. Louis do you??” I think someone can beat Josh Howley but it’s probably can only be a moderate democrat or he loses in the Republican primary to a moderate Republican. Like if Danforth has a kid or someone like that.
I'm from the lake of the Ozarks originally, and these little counties cannot be more red or seems. Now I moved out during covid when the tourists bought up all the homes and were remote working, so this may have changed. It seems here in the capital is purple leaning red.
