I identify all too well with your dabbling to “control” your drinking. I’m American, but I studied European and international commercial law in Holland, and had planned to stay there and work in The Hague or Amsterdam, but ended up moving back to the PNW just before Covid after meeting my (now) wife on vacation. I always struggled with alcoholism and addiction, but aside from the treatment my family forced on me as a teenager, never wanted to do anything about it. When my dad died in June 2020, I said enough is enough, and used benzos to “avoid withdrawals and help me sleep”, which, of course they did, but it ended up just being a replacement that took me down a pretty dark path. I got off them after a few months, but went right back to booze and everything else. Took me a couple more years to fully pull out of the addiction cycle, including almost dying from aspirating after taking god knows how much ketamine while already blacked out and alone at home, but I’m finally back on track, just celebrated 6 months sober, and just finished the first semester of my JD.
“According to testimony received by the Select Committee, the only advisor present who supported President Trump’s inclination to declare victory was Rudolph Giuliani, who appeared to be inebriated.”.
Seeing people like Giuliani running the flagship of the American economy makes me realize that being a mayor must not be that hard of a job.
How does someone make it through law school, pass the NY bar exam, and then behave like he does? Did something happen to his brain?
