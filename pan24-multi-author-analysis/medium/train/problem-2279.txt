It has symbolic value … it shows that people can still trust in the process and concede as they are supposed to … and doing it against one of the most vitriolic election deniers … it’s taking the high road AND subtly telling her to go F herself.
It’s well within the automatic recount margin. I see no point in conceding before that’s done. Sure the chances of it going his way are low but why not wait to be sure?
Because it doesn't matter. A concession doesn't change anything. He could have said days ago "I lost it's all yours Bobo," and it still wouldn't change anything. Is that how it works in Canada? If you win an election, but concede before the final tally is in, you lose?
