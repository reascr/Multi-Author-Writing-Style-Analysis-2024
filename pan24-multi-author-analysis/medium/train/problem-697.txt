I don’t think you understand how polling works. Approval/disapproval polling is wildly different than general election polling. In McConnell’s last election he did outperform the polls but they all had him pegged as winning with a very comfortable margin, he just turned very comfortable into a blowout. In Manchin’s last election the aggregate polling was within about 3-points of the final results and almost every aggregator projected Manchin would win except Real Clear Politics which rated it as a tossup race. Ron Johnson’s last race the aggregate of the final polls was about 51-48 Johnson over Barnes with an actual result of 50.4-49.4. Collins is the only one out of what you mentioned that was outside of the predicted outcome. And even then most aggregates had it rated as a tossup. Approval/Disapproval is more a measure of how potentially vulnerable someone is if the right opponent comes along. You can make a lot of assumptions based off of a/d numbers and you can make use of them to predict how hard or easy of a campaign someone is going to have but they’re useless without having the same information of an opponent to compare them to. And even then there’s still a lot of supposition that has to be done.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
