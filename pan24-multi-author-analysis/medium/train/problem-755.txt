They didn't even get into Kharkiv, a Russian speaking city on the border. Russia is more likely to implode than to successfully pick a fight with the west.
I can just imagine the internal strife that will come from this in the next months and years. The best thing is to fortify the border and stay the hell out of that place.
Russia has 6000 at the last count. Even if only 10% of these are working that is still 600 nukes ; enough to kill millions of people. Add in the 600 that NATO fire in retaliation and that is enough to cause a devastating effect on the planet.
I doubt we would nuke them back if they used a tactical nuke in Ukraine. Instead, weâ€™d just send in conventional forces/missile strikes to cripple any forces outside of their border.
Now I obviously can't know the actual state of their stockpile, but their budget for said maintenance is far less per warhead than anyone else's. And that's before considering that that budget is perhaps the single most perfect target for the sort of graft that has crippled their conventional forces.
