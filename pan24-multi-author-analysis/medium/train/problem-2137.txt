By Islam’s own rules these were not legal marriages. In Islam a marriage is not valid unless both sides consent. So these were not valid marriages. Yet this guy is saying even though it was legal. It wasn’t by Islam’s own rules. The Islamic republic of Iran not really Islamic.
This reminds me of when the Taliban pick and choose things from Islam as well. Like forcing women to cover up but then not letting them run businesses/work, going to school, stoning people for adultery (except the burden of proof in Islam for such a crime is having 4 men seeing the act occur which is virtually impossible), and so on.
People pick and choose from their religion/ideology and dictators and radical groups are no different.
If there was no Islam or religion, men in power would use "our customs" or "our tradition" as the next excuse.
Not only are these girls raped before they're executed because of a legal requirement, the reason why they can't die virgins in the first place is so they can't go to heaven. They're raped before they're killed for the explicit purpose of sending them to hell after they die.
And to be clear, the worst part is that none of these comments have specified what "young girls" means.
People who've been following the protests in Iran will have seen that girls as young as elementary school age have been actively involved in the protests.
Iran is one of the only countries in the world that executes minors. For boys the age where they are held legally responsible for their actions and can be punished by death is 15. For girls it's 9 years old.
