In a couple years, having a Florida high school on your college admission is going to put you at a serious disadvantage if you’re applying to anything that isn’t a state university or JC.
If Florida schools continue to be removed from reality, then students won't be accepted anywhere except Florida schools. Having no SAT scores and a black stain from the state education is going to put all of Florida's applications in the bottom of the barrel.
This is why the children of fascist leaders are often sent to other countries for their educations. Kim Jong Un received most of his education in Switzerland. Compared to the average NK public school student, he must seem like Einstein.
The parents that care about comprehensive education are generally not the people that voted for him. You can have a lot of pissed of parents in the 40% that voted against him.
