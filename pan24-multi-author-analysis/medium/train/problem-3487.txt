I love Katie Porter, but Schiff has a lot of experience in Washinon and has connections in both state and federal politics. Let him have the mantle for a few years before he decides if he wants to run for president, then Katie can have a turn with more years under her belt. But again, either is a great choice!
Democrats are trying to make sure Feinstein retires. She should retire. She's going to be 91 for next year's election. The silent generation needs to ride off into the sunset.
Has she actually announced that she isnâ€™t going to run? This seems like a less than glorious way for her to exit stage left. I mean at this point it kinda seems like the Dems have that big hook thing and are trying to drag her off stage.
