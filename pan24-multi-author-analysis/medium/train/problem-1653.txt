No one has mentioned it yet, but the reason is simple: they're legally only allowed to do two things right now. They can nominate a Speaker, which requires a majority of members to agree, or they can move to recess until a particular future time... which also requires a majority of members to agree.
I believe they could also change the rule for electing a speaker to say move to a plurality, but that would be very risky for the Republicans since Jeffries has the plurality right now and I would not be surprised if the 20 decide to call the McCarthy backers bluff since they could likely remove Jeffries later and restart the whole fight.
