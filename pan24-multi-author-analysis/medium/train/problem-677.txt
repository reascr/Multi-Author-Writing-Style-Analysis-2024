Their case is stupid and it is abhorrent that they are continuing to waste our time by pursuing it. But I don't think it is appalling that our court system "allowed" them to do this. Access to courts is a fundamental right, and it is a good thing that any red-blooded American has the right to appeal a district court order or even petition for a writ of cert with SCOTUS. The same institutional procedures that enable these idiots also protect the most vulnerable in our society when they are wronged by our government or big corporations. Given the choice, I'd rather plaintiffs have more rights, not fewer.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
