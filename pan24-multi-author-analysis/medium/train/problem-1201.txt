And all the vile russian (and chinese) influence begins to vanish at last. All the democratic backsliding, magically appearing strongman-narc-chauvinist dictators, all the neoliberal "agendas", all the anti-anti-climate agents, all of them will have a much harder time now. Thank goodness.
Do your mental health a favor and delete twitter. I deleted it about 5 or so years ago - itâ€™s insane how heavily the constant shit flinging on that app can weigh on your mind.
Edit: interesting about the covert war that russia is waging on Europe for a very long time. In my opinion, Putin's collaborators should be investigated for collusion/treason.
Using anyone as cannon fodder is abhorrent, but specifically conscripting men from impoverished, ethnic minority populations is even worse. Putin is essentially getting rid of Russians he deems undesirable.
I just heavily watch gaming and non news for basically any social media. Don't even have a Twitter. If some news on Reddit peaks my interest or elsewhere I'll actually go see if I can find some good sources on it.
