There's some think outside the box stuff that could definitely happen. Russia could agree to return everything in exchange for other stuff entirely like security assurances and economic benefits, they could agree to something like those regions all return to the Ukraine but Russians or residents of the dispute areas are free to enter, leave, reside and work there plus enjoy the benefits of being a Ukrainian, Russian, or duwl citizen. They can create a special region with special rights. When its sovereign countries negotiating at an international level there really are no rules they could come up with all kinds of weird stuff that would at last superficiqlly be ” win win”. There are a number of disputed regions and borders in the world ame lots of countries are making it work even though its messy. Messy agreements are better than war. War is the worst thing for everybody, even russia. People die in jig numbers, societies get weaker, the economies go into the tank. There's pressure on all parties to resolve this despite the sabre rattling.
If this peace process works and actually achieves peace, which is no small feat, China wins by appearing as a force of global peace, Ukraine wins by maintaining sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Russia wins a little by saving face.
I mean they entered a bad position and it would be much better for them to save face like this with a consolation price no one wants a nuclear war not even Putin.
This isn't even a major Russian L in world history is just Putin been greedy like Nicholas 2 ate dick this is nothing compared to that.
