Damn right it is. I don’t understand how when I was in school in the 90’s we had a Black History course. We learned of the barbarity of slavery, we learned about Jim Crowe and the Civil Rights Movement. There were no objections from anybody and it was a very important part of our curriculum.

Created by the same people who make the SAT to try and show you are ready for college. The class is taken in High School. Sometimes they can be accepted for college credits but it's not required to be.
