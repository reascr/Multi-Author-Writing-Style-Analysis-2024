I'm talking about radio dramas, movies, novels, video games, and TV shows. There were multiple generations who grew up with the idea being thrown around that Russia was a considerable military threat, even without the use of a nuke. I can't help but imagine that that notion died in Ukraine, along with a good chunk of Putin's cardboard army. It almost makes me wonder if any future video games will continue to use Russia as the opposing team in military shooters?
Not to mention completely shattering the world's perception of their military might. So many works of fiction made their military look to be cutting edge with highly trained soldiers, but actual combat footage has shown that they're anything but. They went into Ukraine with old and poorly maintained gear and ineffective troops that didn't even know why they were there.
I donâ€™t think those that were in the know ever thought Russia was cutting edge. Russia was number 2 simply because of nukes. Their military is almost entirely still.
