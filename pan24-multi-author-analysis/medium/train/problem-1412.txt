I doubt FIFA would lose money. Qatar probably paid up front, especially with their recent message of just focus on the football. Which I think was after the comment about homosexuality being an illness or whatever they said.
It’s something tho, and it’s better than nothing, good on them for taking a stand. For many countries, the World Cup is the biggest stage they will ever have a chance of participating in. To take a stand like that is damn admirable.
And a boycott is the right thing to do regardless of if it changes the situation. It's as much about who we are as ethical beings. I think at some point, when something is this dominant, you have to make a decision based less on "What can I and the people I know do to influence this event so that it's done right?" (because the odds are that you're not going to be able to stop or change one of the biggest sporting and broadcast events in the world), and instead ask, "Is the entertainment that I get from watching and taking part in this worth the suffering that it seems to impose on so many other people?" Which is an equally difficult question to answer. Because it's abstract and entirely an ethical one. And it's really fucking fun watching World Cup football, and those people negatively affected tend to be rather far away. But I think that everyone should at least ask it of themselves, maybe struggle with it, and live with the answer.
