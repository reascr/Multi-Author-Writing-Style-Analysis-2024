The Russian regimes, dictators and Generals haven't learnt a thing from the past 100 years about how to treat their soldiers. The threats, intimidation and poor training has not served them well, yet they repeat history.
I'm a US Army veteran, injured in the line of duty. I've spent years homeless, while fighting the VA the entire time. There are now a quarter million homeless veterans in the US.
YOU go home - I haven't had one for a good chunk of my life, thanks to the indifference and incompetence of the DOD.
I see, sorry I didn't consider your personal story, also thank you for sharing, and I wish you had better help available. I do think US veterans have it much much better, even if not enough and not as much as you deserve.
If you do want to understand a bit more context: Putin recently responded to russian moms on the death of their sons by simply asking them to have more children. That should be enough for you to gauge the level of support. There is also a lot of "whataboutism" unjustly comparing russia and the US in a way that tries to justify what russia is doing. So people, including myself might react hastily when something like that is posted.
Edit: And yes Russians do kill some soldiers when they are exchanged in PoW swap, as famously one was executed with a hammer and posted in the media as an example.
