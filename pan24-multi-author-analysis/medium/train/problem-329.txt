to my knowledge this wonderful guy had a stint in Guantanamo as legal advisor: essentially his role was to tell the staff what the "legal" torture methods would be.
I dated a retired Marine who constantly would say "what do you think lady will two degrees" It didn't take me long to remove myself from seeing him. Plus he parroted Fox news instead of thinking for himself.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
I get it, though. It all comes down to geography. If you were raised in a rural or semi-rural area, you will have had a rural "education" and therefore will not trust those whose worldviews differ.
It seems to never fail: those in the military (and, by extension, law enforcement) are consistently anti-intellectual, pro-Trump, pro-stupid.
As well, due to the sparseness of country living, those in rural areas do not see much interaction with those of differing viewpoints, whereas urbanites in their dense cities see regular exchange of information.
The same principles apply to both humans and molecules in solution: the higher the density and the greater the kinetic energy, the more interactions will occur, whether they be human or intermolecular. Taken far enough, I think all of politics and sociology can be explained by physics.
