The fucking virtue signaling is unreal. Banning Russian athletes for something their government did is unjust. Why wasn’t the US banned for the invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, multiple government backed Coups in Latin America, literal decades of imperialism. Why wasn’t China banned for their treatment of Uighurs which is a literal modern day holocaust, but instead was the host nation of the Olympics in 2008? The fucking Olympics were even held in literal goddam nazi germany. I can understand why Ukraine wants Russia banned, but this just gives more ammunition for Russian propagandists to convince their citizens that “the west” is out to get them and by the time a possible new regime with or without outside interference is established, it will be similar to the aftermath of ww2, causing a cycle of distrust and anti-westernization.Let the Russian athletes compete, they get caught doping, they get banned.
they should be allowed go, but must be forced to carry unloaded kalishnikovs while parading, let their people see how they are different from the rest of the world. 'carry your gun, and then you can run!'.
