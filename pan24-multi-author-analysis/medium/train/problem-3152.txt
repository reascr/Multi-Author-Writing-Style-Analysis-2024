I was thinking the same thing. Free knee surgery and 3 meals. Plus a chance to learn a foreign language for free. Electricity may be sketchy but canâ€™t afford it here anyway so same difference.
Your work needs to unionize. The Bank Robbers Union negotiated for their employees to receive free housing at an exclusive resort with 3 meals a day in between jobs.
Or what about paying women extra money for losses in career progress time off, same for men, as well as reducing work hours with hours devoted to child rearing, so ttat that having enough kids is sustainable in wealthy states?
Both Russia and Ukraine are in a population demographic crisis, especially for young people. That's why Russia is kidnapping and deporting tons of people from the cities it occupies. Any Ukrainians who are against immigration may have to rethink this.
Of course, other nations have the same problem -- Japan, South Korea, and (in probably less than a decade) the US.
whats your long term solution? Just keep importing people from countries that are less well off, exploiting others' children?
