Really unfortunate how there are only about 20 comments about this being fake, and 1,200 comments talking about this as if it was real. This is how misinformation spreads like wildfire. Tomorrow there are going to be so many water-cooler conversations about "how Switzerland is blocking Spanish arms for Ukraine".
I found it as first comment upon reading on these news here, so it's fine for me. (And one of the reasons I check on reddit every strange piece of news I hear.).
it looks pretty legit but there is one giveaway which instantly proves that this is not a real site.
Yeah well the article isn't about the Gepard and Marder now is it. In fact nobody knows what exactly it is about and also Spain hasn't even requested permission to send the goods to the Ukraine at this time. According to our government. They won't get the permission regardless (again, according to our government) and that sucks big time (Don't come for me I agree we should let them send the weapons) but they haven't put in a request either. Kinda stinks of virtue signaling and trying to suck up to the other NATO nations. At least put in the request first before you make a statement like that.
As a swiss person I think this whole thing is really fucking stupid. It's one thing to not send them weapons and ammo ourselves, fine with me. It's another to block other countries from doing it if they already bought the shit anyway. Just our government trying to antagonize everyone I guess.
I don't know if anyone has informed you yet, but the entire article and website is fake. It is not a legitimate news organization. Notice how there is no author listed for the article. Most of the other articles are ripped from other news sites.
