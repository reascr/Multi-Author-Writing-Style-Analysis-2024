The problem here is that there are a fair number of states that have already been gerrymandered to have a republican legislature with a democratic leaning populace. Those would never turn democratic again. The firmly red state will stay that way and the firmly blue states may enact something like this (but probably not). States with split representation in the US house could be changed to solidly red because of how they draw their own districts. (or just throw out democratic candidates). An actually purple state like Texas or Florida could change all their reps and basically lock in forever republican rule for the rest of the country.
An utterly dogshit fringe legal theory floated by the same minds behind the coup like John Eastman, and to the same ends: locking in permanent uncheckable minoritarian rule. That the court even chose to hear this is shameful. Oops, I guess we’ve suddenly been doing elections wrong for two hundred years because some people can’t sell their ideas to voters anymore.
