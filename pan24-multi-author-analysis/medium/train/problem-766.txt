You disrupt the biggest football leagues in the world to host in Winter because your Summer is too hot to play! That should have been a non-starter from the get-go and raised huge red flags, but they'd already bought it so can't exactly give the money back. Plus the sheer madness of building what will be empty stadia at huge cost in lives and greenhouse emissions hosted in a backward country that doesn't acknowledge homosexuals exist and women should be seen and not heard. Madness.
I was curious so I had to look it up. Tour de France is the most watched sporting event with 3.5 billion viewers, world cup is 3.3 billion with 516 million viewers for the final game in 2018. That's just bonkers.
Oh no the world will hate Qatar even more after the world cup. The world's rowdiest fans coming together and drinking and celebrating in the streets will lead to a bunch of issues. And there will be public affection (which is illegal there) and I bet money there will be at least one incident of police arresting a gay couple and some people might go missing.
