One path is that he gets to 210ish, the holdouts get a few more concessions and feel they've made their point, and give him the votes while threatening to keep him on a short leash. Another is that they go a few votes without him getting to 218 (and potentially losing votes), and his supporters see that he can't get there and start negotiating on a new candidate (Steve Scalise maybe). Or holdouts/Dems could give him the win in an alternative manner, by having a handful of members voting present to lower the majority threshold or voting on a rule to change the threshold to a plurality of members - although whoever is caving here would want significant concessions.
>To be elected speaker, a candidate must receive a majority of the votes cast. If no candidate wins a majority, the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. Multiple roll calls have been necessary only 14 times (out of 126 speakership elections) since 1789; and not since 1923 (68th Congress), when a closely divided House needed nine ballots to elect Frederick H. Gillett speaker.
Who in the Republican part is going to “get anything done”. Their entire playbook at this point is getting NOTHING done, and to be frank he seems like he would fit that role perfectly.

They keep voting until there is a Speaker. It hasn't happened in a long-time, so there isn't a ton of precedent. It could be resolved same day, take multiple days, or last weeks.
