As an activist, the protests of JustStopOil and The Last Generation are absolutly harmful for the cause. I know of some people doing these protests, I understand their desperation, but I don't understand the means they use, justified by a grim future. Extinction Rebellion for example had a good run, at the beginning, but then the good vibes it tried to spread turned into negativity. Fear and deep shocking Ã¼ber predictions for the future. It is true, that it's not looking good at all for the climate and nature. The mass extinction rate of plants and animals in the world is higher than in any mass extinction event in history we know of. This is shocking but with only looking at this negative part and cancelling out hope and therefore justifying dangerous protests or wrong placed attacks on paintings like this, to generate attention, does not give any progress to climate protection or regulations. Instead people will talk about paintings or criminal eco terrorists, because this is the only logical consequence when you start to do extremist stuff. Never helped anyone. You loose the whole backing from society.
Activists did not willingly block emergency services. The car drivers in the traffic jam did not form a gap for emergency vehicles as is ordered by law.
I think this refers specifically to incidents that have been also posted here earlier - activists blocked emergency services from helping critically injured cyclist in Germany.
