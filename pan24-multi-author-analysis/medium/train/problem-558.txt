Non-conservatives don't show up to vote because they don't have non-conservative options to vote for. The two most common reasons given for why people don't vote is that "No matter who wins, nothing will change for people like me" and "I didn't like any of the candidates". As long as our only choices are the conservative side of liberalism or the progressive side of liberalism, anyone that doesn't adhere to liberalism as a political ideology will be alienated.
