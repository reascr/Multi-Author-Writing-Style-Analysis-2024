Washinon—Today, the Select Committee made public additional transcripts of witness testimony that was gathered over the course of the Select Committee’s investigation into the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol.
You know, what the committee is doing is reminiscent of how journalists release information when it’s a sorry so big they don’t want to give anyone time to coverup or squash the story. Good, long research and fact checking, and when. They release the information, it’s being done in a consistent and frequent manner. I really like this way of reporting information - especially for something this critical.
