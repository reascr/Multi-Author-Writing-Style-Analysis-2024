That is because the battle lines keep moving back and forth east and west. They are literally fighting over the same terrain constantly.
At the rate this is going its probably going to come down to who runs out of bodies to throw at the other first.
I think the issue goes more into Ukraine goverment not wanting to lose territory when they have gained so much back already. Even tough Bakhmut is not that important in the grand scheme of the conflict it could hurt messaging that Russia military is weaken and the Ukrainians are close to winning the war.
Ukrainians should retreat as losing troops and equipment in Bakhmut will be more damaging than some dumb propaganda the Russians will push.
Bottom line is that they had to take it to move the invasion forward. 6 months and 40k dead Russians later, they're getting close to forcing a withdrawal.
The article headline is misleading, it doesn't have a lot of strategic value. It may be helpful for Russia to control it, but it wouldn't really end the war or change much on the frontlines. Ukraine is just defending to play for time at this point and keep Russia's attention focused there and their forces in the area tied up.
