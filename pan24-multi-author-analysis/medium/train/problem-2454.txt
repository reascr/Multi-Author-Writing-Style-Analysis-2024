Here in PA, Republicans forbid tabulating of mail-in ballots as they come in, as opposed to Ohio where it's permitted. They have to wait until election day. Then when it takes PA more time to count votes than Ohio (PA also has a couple of nillion more people), they scream it's a conspiracy or convince their supporters it is the deep state's fault.
They know what the real issues are with elections because they caused most of them. They just figured out that most of their base is susceptible to even the most unsophisticated propaganda.

That would assume good faith from all parties. Republicans are actively trying to disenfranchise voters but only have a problem with it when they inadvertently harm themselves.
On the surface, counting mail in ballots as they come in makes sense, but if that information were to leak prior to an election date, it could strongly influence the election's outcome. I don't mind waiting a few extra days of not knowing the result in order to avoid a situation like that.
I don't disagree, and that's not really the problem. The problem is that when there are delays, Republicans pretend that they have no idea how it possibly could take longer than Ohio to count, except for Democrats trucking in fake ballots after the fact to win illegitimately.
