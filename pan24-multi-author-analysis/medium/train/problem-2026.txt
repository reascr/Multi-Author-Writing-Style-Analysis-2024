The background to this is that countries in general will not permit extradition for a crime which is not a crime in their own country.
As the treaty between Sweden and Turkey follows this common model, and as "editing a newspaper I disagree with" is not a crime in Sweden, any request for extradition on that basis will always be denied.
Good for Sweden, Turkeys extortion is a bigger issue for Nato than it is for Sweden / Finland. We can wait as long as it takes, Russia is no threat for a long time.
I live in Finland so I am very aware of Russian influence. However script kiddies DDOS attacks are really not a threat in scale of things, invasion is. Finland has been preparing for attack for 80+ years and given that Russia is losing in Ukraine they are in no position to pose real threat to Finland. And Sweden is buffered by Finland.
Pretty sure Sweden would happily send their troops in to help the Finnish line though good god I would not want to be the Russian soldiers sent to march through a marked artillery range in the Finnish winter.
