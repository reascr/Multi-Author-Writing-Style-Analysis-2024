I mean either a strike would be the economic catastrophe that people say it is and politicians had a very good incentive to try and resolve this without a strike and the workers do have a ton of leverage regardless of what politicians do.
The democrats deliberately separated the sick leave into a separate bill because they knew it wouldn’t pass together. This would have left a strike on the table and empowered the rail workers. The only true bipartisanship in government is when it’s to fuck over the working class.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Because now that a deal has been forced upon both workers and the railroads, a strike would be a fireable offense. They would be breaching the contract they were forced to accept.
I don’t see why they takes a strike off the table. It makes it riskier, sure, but if they have the leverage everyone says they have I don’t really see why it’s a given that it can’t happen.
Canada tried to outlaw teacher protests, they did it anyway and they were forced to capitulate to the teachers' demands.
The more one agrees that a strike would be economically damaging, the more one has to agree that politicians have a responsibility to all their other constituents to avert it.
I'm not saying I agree with this outcome, just that it only makes sense to say that politicians are doing this "to remove your legal protections to strike" and are only acting for corporate interests if you also agree that the strike wouldn't cause much harm.
