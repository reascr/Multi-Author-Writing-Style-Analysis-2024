But the story was approved by at least one if not multiple editors. Why is only the reporter to blame? They should also get fired. If they did not follow their own rules for verification, and got away with it, they will do it again.
Pretty sure you need more than one corroborating facts to publish a story. That’s why newsrooms have fact checkers and editors. The editors weren’t doing their jobs to let something like this slip through.
If the editors aren't being fired I'm going to assume that the reporter outright lied about his source to them to get the story published. The article mentions the last time this happened AP fired two editors along with the reporter, and that for AP the only time corroborating evidence isn't required prior to publishing is when they're using a statement from a rock solid authoritative individual. If they're following their own guidelines I'm guessing the reporter either misrepresented their source as authoritative or misrepresentation facts coming from an authoritative source, and his editors took him at his word. The editors are supposed to manage quality control, sure, but I have to imagine they operate on the assumption that their own people are working in good faith.
Does anyone truly believe the missiles were Ukrainian? I mean sure, they could have been, but this whole scenario is clearly "NATO desperate not to go to war with Russia," so the truth is basically irrelevant. The missiles are from Ukraine because NATO needs them to have been fired by Ukraine, regardless of where they're really from.
