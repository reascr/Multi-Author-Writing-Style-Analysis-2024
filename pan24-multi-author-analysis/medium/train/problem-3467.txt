The fact that this year's cup won't fucking collapse saddens me. This is one of the most shameful things to ever happen in our lifetime. FIFA could choose any country to host the world cup, and they chose one that had no infrastructure to host it; which is so hot in the summer that the whole cup has been moved to winter (fucking over every major football league; which had to stop their calendar right now so players can go to the world cup); which uses literal slavery to build their infrastructure; in a dictatorship with as many freedoms as you'd have in 16th century Europe, a country so ridiculous that they had the balls to literally go and say "please respect us and don't be gay here". And, most important of all, a country that has no football culture and which is completely irrelevant in the football world. All of this happened ONLY so a bunch of old men at the very top of FIFA's organization get a few million on bribery.
Those are just the ones they were able to find death certificates for. The actual number is many times higher. The migrants and families take unsustainable loans to pay local agents, which results in their loved one being kidnapped. The sub-sub-sub contractor takes the phones and passports away immediately upon arrival to Quatar where they are exploited for as much profit as possible. A lot of them just die.
