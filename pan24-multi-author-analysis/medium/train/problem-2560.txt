If you're looking for something to buy online shop elsewhere, I've found the discounts to be much better at other stores this year.
why does Kyrie get blasted for linking to an Amazon video but no one seems to care much that amazon is the entity distributing and profiting from that content?
Because they don't promote the video as truth and have it on their entertainment platform as a corporation trying to make money. He used his platform to say it was the truth (without any actual facts checking )when in reality was highly anti-Semitic propaganda. Not saying Amazon is good but there is a reason a dipshit with a very large platform got in trouble for spreading anti semitic propaganda.
My guess is that the tweet was taken down for promoting anti-Semitic propaganda but will be talked about like it's the "left" at Twitter limiting free speech.
Yeah......the interview that I just told you about......that was all over the news when it came out.....that you apparently didn't go watch before coming back here...........
Do I have to spoon feed you google "Kyrie Irving anti-Semitic video interview"? If you know nothing of the subject then why comment on it in the first place? And it's not my responsibility to do basic google research for you especially about something you supposedly already knew.
Like the tweet, most likely, it was taken down for spreading the propaganda. You can try watching a video on YouTube of someone reacting to it to see everything he said. Probably your closest bet.
There's a reason you're only hearing about this from a site called rawstory . com. I think everybody can sleep soundly knowing their packages will arrive as expected.
