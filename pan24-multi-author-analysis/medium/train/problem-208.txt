That's a great point to bring up. We should make it clear and obvious that Iranians have options outside of the nation. Beyond asylum, I'm advocating for accepting them as legitimate citizens.
I suggest nations intervene by assisting in the evacuation and relocation of innocent Iranians to safer nations. There's plenty of room in rural America, with plenty of job opportunities to save America's infrastructure and dying towns.
I'm only suggesting America because I'm from there and have a better idea of its viability as a result.
Despite the massive increase in housing costs, there is still a plethora of relatively cheap options available in rural America.
Rural American here, there’s an old guy with a “I shoot terrorists on sight” sign outside his house. Big bigot with a big billboard. Met him once, 0/10, do not recommend.
How about a call to action? Instead of saying how bad things are, let's discuss how we can make them better.
Lol, calm down. They should be relocated and loaned property based on their current wealth and abilities.
