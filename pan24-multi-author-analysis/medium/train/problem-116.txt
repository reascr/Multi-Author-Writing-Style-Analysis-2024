My favorite is when i submit a resume from an outside website and then they want me to input it again. You better be a goal-tier company for me to have me do that otherwise i can already tell you’re going to be micro-managey as a company and lose all interest.
They don't care if you started on Jan 4th or 5th and quit on Sept 28th or 29th. If you tell them Jan-Sept you're good.
If they ask for a full date, it’s the 1st of the month to another 1st of a month. Otherwise its just a month/year. They don’t need to know that shit.
And sometimes I don't bother to fill it out at all (or just say ''refer to resume'' or ''refer to cover letter'', as applicable). I actually got at least one interview in spite of it.
