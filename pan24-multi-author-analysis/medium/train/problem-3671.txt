The day Saudi Arabian and in fact all middle eastern oil is not as important to the west is the day that America and others will break ties and they will not have the funding to pay corrupt republicans to side with them.
This is also very popular in the United States among well to do right wing Christian Republicans. They break the system, and then they invest in what they feel is best for their society by donating to their favorite charitable causes rather than just being helpful in the first place by allowing these marginalized groups a fair shake. Win/Win. They maintain their high status and look like good people. Which, many of them are, theyâ€™re just slightly unaware of the corrupt system that they maintain.
One thing Elon Musk did , i don't know if on purpose or not was build a factory in Austin texas and sell directly to customers. this has encouraged a lot of electric cars to be on the roads in the red states and helped remove the hate for electric to some extent, everyone knows the times of fossil fueled cars is coming to an end , in 50 years or so people will be amazed we filled big tanks in our cars with fuel that is so combustible, and by then solid state batteries will be common in electric cars, cutting costs dramatically and getting electric car prices under what fossil fueled cars are, also imagine having a car where you charge up at a power station and do not need to charge up again for 1500 miles, that is the future of solid state batteries and NASA is about to release the knowledge and ability to manufacture there solid state batteries next year or at the latest the year after, no longer is solid state 10 years away whenever talked about.
Electric cars are the future no matter what anyone says or what the big oil propaganda is spread, imagine believing that electric cars are more polluting than fossil fueled cars and i know there are many who have swallowed the propaganda and believe wholeheartedly it is so.
