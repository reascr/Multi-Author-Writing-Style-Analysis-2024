I'm just so glad someone is announcing they're running before the dem party announces who they will have fill in for Feinstein if she steps down. Alex Padilla was selected by the party to fill Kamala's seat and so he became familiar with the voters by the time the election came, so no serious dem challenged him. We basically didn't get a vote for our last senator. This absolutely must not happen again. We need a full on primary with plenty of candidates for our next senator seat. We cannot have corporate candidates forced onto us in one of the most liberal states where Bernie Sanders won the 2020 primary vote. I would vote for Porter but I hope others like Ro Knanna run as well.
