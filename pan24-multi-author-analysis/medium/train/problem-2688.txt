1. China ended its lockdown because the country was on the verge of revolt. To say that China did it because western countries told them to is nonsense and revisionist history.
I read a nitter thread which translated Dr. Zhong's thoughts on the issue. He did admit that Chinese vaccines aren't as powerful, but they were made in the traditional methods, so the side effects are more widely known. He also gave some numbers regarding the vaccination rates. There was fear of a big wave like in Hong Kong, but in Hong Kong, the elderly vaccination rate was around 20%, while in mainland, it's around 68%. He predicted a peak around February, and back to normal in June.
2. China had plenty of time to get its people vaccinated with mrna vaccines that actually work instead of their garbage sinovac. That they didn't is entirely their own fault.
regarding the vaccines, the vaccines do a decent job at preventing hospitalization and deaths for the most part. The main issue is that the elderly don't want to take a vaccine in the first place. I don't think allowing western mRNA vaccines would help that.
