All of this degernate, hateful behavior from conservatives stems from the old farmers (rubes) from centuries before wherein they relied on themselves for anything especially fixing farm equipment have made them "independent" and they've also had a very old hatred of white collar workers and intellectuals which is what the modern Democrats tends to love. This is not going to change anytime soon. Also decades of GOP talking points; GOP-controlled states systemically defunding their public education systems so their voters are increasingly more dumb; media propaganda (especially by Murdoch's Fox News and other subsidiary companies all over the world) have led the conservative to becoming stupid. One can say this has been behavior has been broken from the start of the US or even before as the British intentionally divided their colonies with caste systems, racism and division.
