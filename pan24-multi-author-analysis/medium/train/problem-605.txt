Russia has had it both ways, proclaiming the dissolution of the USSR when itâ€™s convenient and then taking its place at the UN without going through the admission process every other nation has to go through.
Yeah but good luck actually kicking Russia off the Security Council. Unless another country has a better claim at being the legal successor to the Soviet Union replacing Russia would be insanely difficult. Otherwise the UN would need to make a major change to it's structure which isn't going to happen anytime soon, unfortunately.
