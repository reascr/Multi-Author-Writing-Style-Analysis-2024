and their sources in occupied Donbas think they know what's up - a series of false flag attacks on churches.
According to one of the sources, at the places where temples were blown up, the Rashists plan to remove HIMARS fragments brought from other places of explosions in the plots for propaganda.'.
So many dead. It is just beyond belief that Putin can look at such losses and continue his war. These losses don't even factor in the sanctions and brain-drain. Russia has been set back decades.
From 24.02.2022 to 05.01.2023 (Day 316) estimated Russian losses so far (change since previous day):
>InformNapalm is one of the best OSINT/investigative groups in region and for years has contributed to important work including the MH17 investigation and hundreds of other russian crimes.
It's really weird how Russian society doesn't react. No doubt propaganda and sheer ignorance is a huge factor, but it's hard to have over 100K deaths go unnoticed. The TV clips of "festive celebrations" on Russian state TV are strange given the backdrop of the war.
Ukraine has suffered much hardship, but the rest of us will help Ukraine rebuild when the war is over. Some will donate money and materials while others will volunteer their time to work with Ukrainians. Ukraine will emerge triumphant and proud.
Fuck Russian trolls and their lies. Fuck trolls in general, but I'm focusing on the ones spewing war propaganda.
There was a live press briefing by the US DoD a little while ago. Confirmed Bradley's being sent, new package expected to be announced tomorrow.
Edit: Just wanted to add one of Ryder's comments, related to the so-called "cease-fire": "Russia is good at exporting violence; they are not good at exporting truth.".
