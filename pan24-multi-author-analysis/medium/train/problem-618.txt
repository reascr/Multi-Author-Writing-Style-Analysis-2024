The Japan Rail Pass was an amazing resource as a tourist. It covers local trains and shinkansen, and it paid for itself after a single trip from Fukuoka to Kyoto. I was able to see a lot of Tokyo very easily by train, and my train experience was way better than taking the buses (I'd recommend just getting a Suica transit card if you need to take the bus, I was never able to figure out the correct protocol to pay by cash without the driver getting mad at me).
Don’t have any personal recommendations for Tokyo, but if you get an opportunity to add a visit to Kyoto to your trip I’d highly recommend going to see the Fushimi Inari shinto shrine. There’s a beautiful shrine site at the bottom of the mountain and if you choose you can walk a long path to the summit that will take you through some gorgeous woods with a bunch of little cemeteries and lookouts along the way. It will take some energy and an afternoon but it’s a really peaceful and scenic walk. You can take the Shinkansen there from Tokyo in a couple hours and Nintendo HQ is nearby right off the train path too, so you can make a cool day trip out of those two.
