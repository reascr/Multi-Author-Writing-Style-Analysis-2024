I wish I could find an proper source of the full article, but it essentially painted the incident of Waco/ruby ridge as warning and the government as "Jack boot thugs" taking away guns.
gun culture in the 90s had a massive culture shift due to the ruby ridge/Waco. Lawayne Pierre, head of the NRA ended up having an internal memo leak in 95' which lead to a lot of old guard conservatives (like HW bush) to reject the NRA. Its also the time where they changed their philosophy to what gun culture has become now.
