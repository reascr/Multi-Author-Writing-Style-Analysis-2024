Yes. And as soon as Russia got bogged down they began furiously legislating (at least some in part of) the reforms the protests were calling for.
I just love how utterly based Kazakstan has been recently. From the liberalizing movement to calling Putin out to his face and now threatening to arm themselves against aggression?
Honestly I couldn't even remember if Kazakhstan had the same president or not since then. I was amazed though how quickly and solidly a former ally and nation of the soviet bloc turned its back on Russia.
This was (imo) setting the stage for the “special military operation” in Ukraine. It all seemed too strange. Then they left, wham, into Ukraine. As if it was to say “look, we did good, let’s do it again here”.
We have mandatory service for 2 years for all healthy male adults below age 27. Exceptions are made for those who pursue education (bachelors, masters, etc.) and those who have at least two kids. However, some may go to military bootcamp for 2 months (I think), but it is available for fixed fee ($1000, maybe more) and for man above age 24.
