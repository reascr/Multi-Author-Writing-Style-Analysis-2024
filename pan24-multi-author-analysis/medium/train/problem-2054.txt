Well,it has to do with South Africa stupidly thinking that the West would have its back last year by turning away the private jet carrying the wife of former Russian President(and current warmonger) Demetry Medvedev and refusing to refuel the giant Russian Antanov 124 cargo plane causing it to be stranded in South Africa. Resulting in South Africa having to deal with the fallout with the very unstable leadership in the Kremlin. The least that South Africa could offer to smooth things over with the lunatics in Russia was to hold naval exercises. China routinely holds naval exercises with South Africa since they're the country's largest trading partner. America and Europe have no problem doing business with these two brutal dictatorships(and others around the world).
Navel exercises are done by many different countries with their respective navy. Still, there might be ramification with future relationship between South Africa and Western nations though.
Shows the hypocrisy of Western countries when South Africa have been conducting naval excercises with NATO countries and is refusing to buy Russian oil(unlike India and other countries).
