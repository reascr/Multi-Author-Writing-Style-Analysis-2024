It's very likely the Brits and the Americans had something to do with that, since Kolomoisky was a big proponent of the Minsk accords and when Zelensky turned on Kolomoisky, he also did a 180 on that issue and became extremely pro Nato practically over night. Keep in mind one of the key issues for the Zelensky campaign was being a proponent of a Minsk style solution, which is why at the time he was portrayed as a Russian stooge by a lot of media outlets. It's also why Scholz and Macron dislike Zelensky so much, as they negotiated the Minsk accords and they essentially believe Zelensky was paid off to change his stance right when it seemed like a done deal.
I've been noticing it's like every week or so, another minister, cabinet member, judge, or government official is sacked. In nearly every case, non-government Ukrainian-based news sources can point to specific acts of corruption from these officials.
Martial law is a hell of an opportunity to cut corruption from the country. And aid from western countries also comes with oversight from those countries. They're going to want accountings, tallies, audits, and reports. They're going to be checking for theft and missing funds, which will help Zelensky cut corruption as well.
