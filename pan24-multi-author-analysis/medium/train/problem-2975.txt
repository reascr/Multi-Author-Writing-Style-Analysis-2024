What's so crazy about this is that Georgia is turning down free federal dollars and making administration of this program more expensive than it would otherwise be. So less coverage for desperate people and more expensive to run? Seems like a solid plan... Cruelty is the point.
My SO is diabetic, and was making a mere $10k/year a few years ago. She couldn't get any kind of health coverage because of this bullshit.
The fun part is, if you make so little that you qualify for medicaid on a federal level, you can't get a subsidised plan through Obamacare.
But, since Ga didn't take the federal medicaid expansion, if you're working, you basically can't get medicaid. So you're stuck with no health insurance.
