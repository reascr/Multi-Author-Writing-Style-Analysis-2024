Edit: You young Americans can't even see how the military-industrial complex is beating the drums of war. You WILL eventually get drafted and go to war, and they recently passed a law that includes women in that. Have fun posting on Reddit from the front lines, or are you expecting someone else to fight for your idealism?
I mean US soldiers are in Ukraine training soldiers and sending equipment. They provide targeting and satellite reconnaissance and there are probably special forces operating in the region.
Those ‘semantics’ are the difference between bombs falling on American cities, triggering Article 5, and not.
We already know the US is giving satellite intel while Western soldiers are training Ukraine’s on NATO hardware being shipped. That’s transparent. Have been for some time. If you can’t be bothered to suggest in specifics what you think NATO is doing otherwise then your comments will only read like conspiratorial rabble-rousing.
If America sent a tactically significant amount of troops, and not just trainers and advisors, the war would already be over.
Ukraine pushed Russia back using captured 1960s era Soviet equipment and military surplus from NATO allies.
A single American armored division with its usual support elements would clear the Russians from Ukrainian territory in a month.
Edit: trying to re-capture land held during the Soviet Union is not the same as coming to the New World to take it over. Any half-brained pundit left or right would concede that.
Edit: well, maybe you will, you just don't know it yet future draftee. Enjoy serving your military-industrial complex overlords.
