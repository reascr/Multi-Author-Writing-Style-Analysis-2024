I wonder who the young person was to be buried in what seems to be a place of importance or honor based on his neighbor there and also the peculiar burial practice reserved for nobility. Hm Fascinating stuff. Thanks.
Fun fact! In the medieval ages the line of thinking was that churches and cathedrals were the closest to god you could get on earth, so when being buried you wanted to be as close as possible to them. This led to the churches selling burial plots beneath the floors of the churches, which only the very wealthy could afford.
However when the body decomposes it creates foul odors, and since the churches now had filled their floors with decomposing bodies, churches became quite stinky.
I looked this one up based on your original comment and both references said that they were "Tour guide fables" with no basis in fact.
My pleasure I was a tour guide for many years so my brain is filled with random facts and stories that Iâ€™ll probably never have use for in my life again, so anytime I spot a chance to throw one out there on the web I do.
Anyway, "stinking" in this context just means offensively and the first use of the term stinking rich comes from the early to mid 20th century American sources.
I do apologize if this is overly critical... No offense meant - it's entertaining Which is what tour guides are supposed to be But not true...
I'm pretty sure "stinking" used this way is an entirely American expression, and therefore much, much newer than medieval times.
The rest about rich people buying plots beneath the floors of churches (or even in the walls!) is true, though.
