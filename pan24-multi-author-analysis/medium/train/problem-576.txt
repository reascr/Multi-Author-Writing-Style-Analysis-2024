>A dictatorship has to promulgate some sort of distant goals and moral ideals in order to justify its rule and the people’s immolation; the extent to which it succeeds in convincing its victims, is the extent of its own danger; sooner or later, its contradictions are thrown in its face by the best of its subjects: the ablest, the most intelligent, the most honest. Thus a dictatorship is forced to destroy and to keep on destroying the best of its “human resources.” And be it fifty years or five centuries later, ambitious thugs and lethargic drones are all a dictatorship will have left to exploit and rule; the rest will die young, physically or spiritually.
The motto of the current Iranian regime is probably something like "the nation must die so that the state can live". They’re literally killing the intellectuals, the creativity, the cream of the crop of a people. This is not surprising since it’s ME we’re talking about, but I still think Iranians deserve better.
Knowing it's just a desolate land of fucking idiots that are always drunk and cold and on the verge of hurting their partner. Devoid of anyone with common sense and oppressing what's left of it.
