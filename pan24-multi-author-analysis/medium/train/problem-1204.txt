This is why the US has been goading Russia with making Ukraine member of NATO. That strictly goes against Russia’s quest for control over the Eurasian region. I think the US has goaded Russia into war in Ukraine to in its desire to completely decimate it. Much like it did in Afghanistan with the USSR. We’ll have to see how the EU cap on oil prices will affect Russia now. As of now Russia has been funding this war by increasing the prices of oil. But it’s interesting to me how much pro-US propaganda is being touted here. America’s main goal in “supporting” Ukraine is simply to annihilate Russia’s goal of creating Eurasia, and maintain their global dominance. That’s all - and that’s why propaganda against Russia is currently on par with what it was like during the Cold War. Not that I expected much from American Reddit though.
So them stating this didn't came out of the blue, it's just something to remind the West/Allied Nations.
Tbf, historically speaking, Czechoslovakia were in the same situation during the advent of World War II when Allies(UK and France) dictated the peace terms about the issue of Sudetenland with Germany without Czechoslovakia's intervention or consultation on the peace terms.
