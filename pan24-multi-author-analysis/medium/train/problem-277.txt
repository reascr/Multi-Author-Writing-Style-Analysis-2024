Putin hopes to reassemble the pieces of the old Soviet Union into a bloc under his control. Ukraine is a huge piece of that puzzle. He miscalculated Ukraine's ability to resist, and also found his own forces far less potent than he believed. His plan was to roll Ukraine in weeks, instead of having a prolonged conflict. Pride goeth before the fall...this war is exposing a lot of Russia's vulnerabilities. It is to be seen to what extent those weaknesses can be exploited. One of the ultimate outcomes of this conflict will be that US/Russian relations will be radioactive for decades after a resolution in favor of either side. Russia is already paranoid toward the West, and this only validates that paranoia. Yes, Russia started this conflict, and they can end it if they can swallow their pride. Can that be done? We'll find out...
Yeah I have a photo of that too from a Mall Outlet. They do a good job photo shopping your head almost to anything. They got me doing the Stone Cold Stunner on The Rock. . How cool is that?
