With his incredibly fake salesman-like 'charm' he makes those who previously felt unwanted actually feel wanted. He addresses the things that they fear and hate and makes other people a target, whether it's generally attacking the libs or "othering" those he considers viable targets (LGBTQ and the sick & disabled for example). This makes his followers, who are often a mixture of the poor, the angry and the uneducated in society, feel better about themselves because they are then no longer on the bottom rung of the ladder - simply put, Trump gives his base somebody to kick down on. This also applies to his followers who simply don't like change, and they are often white males who fear the increasing diversity in society and the erosion of their 'normal' lives.
Exactly. He lost reelection and is no longer in any way part of our government. He is a nobody, a nothing-muffin, he can't "call for" or demand anything. Its ridiculous that every thought he has is put out by the media like it's important. Ignore this buffoon.
