They made those statements back in September (or prior) of that year. They did not make that statement after the vaccine was clearing regulations. Back when Trump was talking about how the vaccine would absolutely be available before a certain date (sometime before the election). That declaration can cast doubt because the vaccine research operates on its own timeline, not what a politician guarantees. It won't magically be available before Nov. 3, 2020 (like it possibly could, but you cannot guarantee it). There was legitimate concern at the time that Trump would purposely remove regulations in order to fast track the vaccine for the sake of a certain deadline (and you cannot entirely blame them as Trump had the whole what should've been benign Alabama hurricane Sharpiegate controversy). That concern was so real that the pharma companies themselves put out statements saying they would not rush out a vaccine and will conduct all proper tests regardless of government tests (unless you're going to start claiming the pharma companies were playing politics as well).
Hah. I flew in from Northern Italy a few days after the first widespread Western outbreak was discovered there and customs only asked me if Iâ€™d been to China. So yeah, the travel ban was both racist and useless.
