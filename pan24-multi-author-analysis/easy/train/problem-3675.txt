Civil unrest is not a silver bullet. It can and has led to good change. It more often leads to nothing, it can lead to bad change, it can lead to greater violence which similarly can lead to good change but usually leads to bad change.
Incorrect. Slavery ended in 1863. The USA banned the slave trade in 1808, making it the 3rd most progressive nation with that stance worldwide. It was the 16th nation on Earth to ban slavery altogether. The USA is way out in front on this issue. There are countries in Africa still actively participating in slavery as we speak. Please donâ€™t use your knowledge of slavery to illustrate future points.
It's the authoritarian mindset. "If I show them how powerful I am, they'll choose to kowtow to me". The problem is when people realize how you care for the overt shows of loyalty rather than getting the important jobs done. That's why every kingdom in history collapsed. You might have one benevolent dictator monarch, but the structure of power means it only takes 1 to rot the whole thing.
