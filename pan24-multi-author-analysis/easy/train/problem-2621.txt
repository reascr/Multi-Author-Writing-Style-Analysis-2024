Also, lol, you're nuts if you think a few hundred modern tanks (combined with modern artillery and missiles) aren't just going to completely decimate any land-based offensive by the Russian army. Russia has a serious problem. Either they win it now or they'll never take any territory again once the modern tanks are in play. They know this too.
Still has me somewhat worried that the Russians with their more concentrated strategy of pushing flesh at the dam until it breaks might have found a way to prevent the Ukrainians from overloading the Ukrainian ability to cover the front AND maintain offensive capabilities.
2. The more equipment Ukraine has, the more could technically be stolen by Russians. And you don't want that.
In terms of speed I think the best solution is more Soviet equipment or modernised variants of Soviet equipment from former Warsaw Pact members and potentially other nations that also use Soviet equipment if they can be persuaded.
1. You can't send equipment without training. There's no point in sending NATO equipment if they are used to Russian.
