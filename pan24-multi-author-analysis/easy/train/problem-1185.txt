So let me get this straight, you come here telling people to look at her voting record, I bring up an example in her record, and you reply “only ONE difference.” Are you expecting me to go through every single vote she made and lay that out to you, all for a comment and opinion you likely spent 15 seconds on? Luckily for you, I like to argue on the internet, and Kirsten Sinema has plenty of other examples to choose from. Like when she voted against including the $15 minimum wage in the Covid relief bill, when 87% of Democrats supported it. Or when she voted for the Republican “Crapo Bill” to roll back Wall Street Regulations. Or when she and Manchin were the only two democrats to oppose filibuster reform, a position so unpopular among Democrats she was censured by her own state party. She’s been useful insofar as she’s voted alongside Democrats on things like confirming judges, but for every big piece of legislation she’s made it abundantly clear she’d rather tank the Democratic agenda for her corporate donors, which I think speaks volumes more than her judge confirmation votes or her “stated policies.”.
It’s not copium. A recent poll just showed Lake and Gallego neck and neck with Sinema in the low teens. I could just as easily say you’re overreacting in the other direction.
