Hopefully, Fetterman is in a similar situation to my husband and will basically fully recover in time. I don’t know his medical details, but I would guess he had an ischemic stroke (caused by a blood clot) versus a hemorrhagic stroke (brain bleed) based on how quickly he was back at work. Ischemic strokes have a much better prognosis than hemorrhagic strokes, especially when treated quickly. Similar to my husband, he was likely given TPA drugs to bust up the clot, limiting the amount of time the clot prevented oxygen from traveling throughout the brain. The shorter the time the clot blocked blood flow, the less likely it is for the damage to be lasting. The brain can recover to an extent and build new connections, especially when the damage is limited through quick treatment. If the doctors can determine the cause of the stroke (ie atrial fibrillation, hole in the heart, etc), which they do in +90% of stroke cases, his long term health outlook will be even better. Give him some more time and I bet you’ll see a marked improvement.
Absolutely. The Democrats need to start intensively recruiting military/blue collar, white straight dudes with drawls and foul mouths ASAP. And I say this as a gay Arab dating a trans person.
