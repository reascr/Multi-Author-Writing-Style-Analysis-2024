For France, Brazil, England, Argentina, Germany, Spain, Italy, USA, and many other countries throughout Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa to collectively tell FIFA to go fuck themselves, cancel out their appearance at any of their tournaments, and start their own 'World Championship' under a new banner.
