I live in Southern Oregon and we get some terrible wildfires here too. When they are really close and really big, it looks like Modor outside. The sky is dark at noon, smoke gets in everywhere, there is an orange glow at night and burning embers fall from the sky. Most mornings you wake up and your car looks like it snowed but its a thick layer of ash.
Not really, while most Greek gods had tales about sexual encounters with questionable amounts of consent, which change drastically based on the version of the story (Poseidon and Medusa or Hades-Persephone as examples were almost always consensual in older versions but later retellings changed that), but Apollo is the one with the most stories of people he wanted to sleep with running away in fear and then becoming so desperate that they either commit suicide or beg other gods to turn into trees, in the oldest versions of the myth.
