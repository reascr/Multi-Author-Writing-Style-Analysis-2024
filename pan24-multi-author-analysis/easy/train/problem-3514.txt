I can see Late Stage Dark Brandon at one of these ground breaking ceremonies. Its late in his second term, he's fixing to ride off into the sunset and doesn't give a fuck, at all, about bi-partisanship, olive branches or any of that bullshit. He points at whatever GOP politician/lunatic is there and says" Look at this asshole right here, with his shit eating, media whoring grin. You know he voted against this project so he wouldn't be called a RINO by his brain dead, rambunctious, horse paste eating, snowflakes in MAGA clothing voters. But here he is, sucking up unearned credit, like the simpering, hypocritical dick head that he is. Lets give him a round of applause, because a Piece of Shit of that magnitude needs to be recognized." Then, he casually puts on his aviator sunglasses and digs the first shovel full of dirt, to thunderous applause and raucous laughter.

Absolutely. Sure, he has a lifelong speech impediment and I think it's fair to say some of his slurring/stammering may be age-related, but he's clearly sharp-witted and clear-headed.
Exactly! I love seeing someone lay a good trap and I enjoy watching folx walk into said traps but the sheer volume of traps laid and sprung was just epic. ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m still jazzed today from that.
That's hilarious! Wish I had thought of that. Kind of like Gomez Adams always pulling an already lite cigar out of his pocket, or a drawer, or wherever.
