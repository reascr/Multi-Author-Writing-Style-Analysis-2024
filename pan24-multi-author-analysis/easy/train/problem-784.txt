Dude I thought that the other day. This is exactly how movies show killer pandemics starting. It's on the news, but no one is paying attention. This shit is hitting every fucking animal now. This is really bad.
“Currently, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that influenza A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low.”.
I love the masks. I like being able to have scowls grimace on my face without being judged. And as muzzles they’re rubbish. It’s very easy to speak through one.
If bird flu ends up being a pandemic, conspiratorial propaganda is going to have a third of the country convinced that people are actually dying from the covid vaccine and bird flu is actually some sort of hoax for a "globalist" communist takeover or some other dumb brain dead shit, it's going to cause violent resistance against any effort by the government to get a handle on it, it's going to spread completely unmitigated, and America is going to be completely fucked. Our fate is basically sealed at this point.
