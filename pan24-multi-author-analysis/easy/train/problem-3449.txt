I heard that BS from my now ex-husband’s family 25 yrs ago, so it ain’t new, either. What they told me was that “productive” people who “contributed” to our society should have more kids than the presumably deadbeat people to outnumber them. It puzzled me exceedingly. My in-laws raised a Catholic family with 6 kids, but some of my ex’s siblings branched out to evangelical christianity. Ex and I had only 1 child and were the only couple to have < 3 kids. I left my ex when our son was only 2 yrs old. My son has something like 27 cousins. I can’t keep track; honestly, neither can he. All but one sibling lives far away from my ex’s home but he keeps up nearly daily with his 2 brothers playing video games, talking about how great Trump was, etc. No one is supposed to get a divorce in that family. They always gossiped behind my ex’s aunt’s back about her divorce. That couple’s child died and parents of dead kids have a higher than average divorce rate, and although they knew this they still gossiped about the divorce at any gathering. My poor son (now 22) knows they all trash talk about me, and to a lesser extent his dad, behind his back all the time.
