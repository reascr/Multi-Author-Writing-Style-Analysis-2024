No, why does everybody keep making this mistake. I almost feel like it's on purpose. Everything from structural racism(tied to the historical oppresion of physical minorities), meeting out punishment individually as opposed to collectively (family shaming for example), and an individualistic economic mindset plays a concerted part in abetting the pervasive violence that exist in our society. For example while Japan does have historically marginalized groups (Bukirami and Zanichi Koreans) and they do make up most of the organized criminal groups, each respective group doesnt make up more than 3 percent of the population. Even then, until a few years ago even thr Yakuza had to work with the local authorities to ensure they kept violence and drug trafficking to a minimum. Something like this would never work in the US.
Really? Who would've thought? If you're talking about gun violence and you include suicide, then it skews the results and messes with the data. If I'm talking about drug overdid, but with opioids specifically, would I add other drugs to the talk without highlighting the fact? No. Why? It would be dishonest.
