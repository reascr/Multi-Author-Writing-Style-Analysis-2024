Secondly, as far as framing the issues, our children’s ages and their formative years is a touchy subject for many parents. I am merely articulating that the courts and people of this country will need to grapple with societal and legal questions of deciding when a subject is age appropriate, but even further do parents indoctrinate their children to learn hate rather than allowing children to make their own decisions about what is important to them or what is not?
The question, and this is moral and legal, is how far does the state go to protect their interest in our children’s safety, based upon what WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE for their age, rather than allowing the market place of ideas theory and allowing children to decide what is appropriate for themselves within the constraints of age appropriate material.
No, they can’t. Fascists could do the rest of what you described and set up a fascist certification system but actual librarians would not be involved. These people would absolutely isolate themselves from the library world.
