In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Sure. you can call the cops. They'll take 15 minutes to get there to save you but you save yourself in seconds. And at the end of the day, they too will use a gun in these situations whether you like it or not .

Exactly. The root cause of domestic terrorism and political violence in the USA is extremist radicalization through the mainstream and the internet fringes.
And no. Handguns aren't inaccurate at 30 yards. Rifles aren't more accurate at 30 yards. Accuracy entirely depends on the user who's operating the firearm. Sure there is a recoil difference between a 1.7 lb Glock and a 6.5 lb AR-15, but if you're missing your targets at 30 yards with either of them you need to reevaluate your training regiment. You can slap an optic on your rifle but you can do the same with your handgun. A 9mm's lethal range is around 54\ yards (50 meters) but most engagements on average happen at 3 yards.
Absolutely agree. Gun bans are empty calories. Democrats need to be addressing root causes. We need to be doing the heavy lifting we were supposed to have been doing for the last 50 years. End the drug war, reform this horrifying prison system, free health care for all including mental health and meds, deal with the fact that there is a permanent underclass who won't live by society's rules because those rules are designed to make them fail.
