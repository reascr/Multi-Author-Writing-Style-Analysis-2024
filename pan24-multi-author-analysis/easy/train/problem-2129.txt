Andrew Cuomo, Sean Patrick Maloney, Eric Adams, and several other higher-ups in the Conservative wing of the New York Democratic Party were so tilted about the growing successes of Progressives getting elected to office in New York (usually at the expense of Conservative and Moderate Democrats losing their seats to them), and seeing more close calls even when Progressives lose, like with India Walton and Tiffany Caban (usually after some Democrats literally collaborate with Republicans against the Progressive, a fellow Democrat), that they yet again collaborated with Republicans to screw over Progressive Democrats. It blew up in Conservative and Moderate Democrats' faces when the Republicans took their seats too, and Progressives in New York managed to gain a new seat to offeset every Progressive seat lost (like Mondaire Jones). 2022 was the second election cycle in a row where Progressive did more or less as well as Moderate and Conservative Democrats did.

The court was probably just taking his word for it, so that's not worth much at all.
