I used to believe that the people in power make bad choices like this on a case to case basis. In this case, I would assume they’re slashing Medicare because of “fiscal responsibility” or whatever. The plain truth, however, is rather obvious now. All of these choices are all related… to drive and strenhen the growth of a population of sick, uneducated and poor, in other words, desperate people. The capitalist powers that be, be they the politicians or their silent oligarch masters, have never before had so much to gain from a labor surplus of this scale. When the people at the bottom are fighting each other like rats over scraps just to survive, the people in the 1% are struggling with existential issues like “Will my private rocket company beat the other guys private rocket company to the moon?”. Meanwhile, the friction of our infighting approaches an ignition point as the landed gentry hoses us down with the gasoline of identity politics, Christian nationalism and the feAr oF sOciAliSm. This is late stage capitalism and it’s going to eat us up all the same regardless of your political ideology.

It’s unfortunately worse than intelligence or gullibility. It’s blind trust on a single news source.
