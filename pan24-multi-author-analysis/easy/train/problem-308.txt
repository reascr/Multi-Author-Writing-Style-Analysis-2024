I don't think there's much more obnoxious than Indian middle classes blinded by imaginary Indian power, when the reality is that most of the population is dirt poor and uneducated, the middle classes don't give a shit about them, and India will never be anything other than a barely developed hovel until it actually starts lifting its poor out of abject poverty.
This is more detailed. Numbers are still sketchy, some sites are reporting 300+ and some \600 PLA soldiers tried to uproot an Indian outpost at 17,000 ft but failed. This was expected. I see 2 possible reasons - PLA's tried and tested salami slicing strategy OR the recent protests against Xi regime means that attention needs to be diverted towards something else. I think its the former(just speculation). This will continue to happen as India upgrades its border infrastructure with China - more roads, railway lines, airports, etc. For the next decade, India - China will have constant clashes guaranteed. China has an upper hand as of now due to better infra/supply lines and will try to coerce India from upgrading its own infra to match it.
