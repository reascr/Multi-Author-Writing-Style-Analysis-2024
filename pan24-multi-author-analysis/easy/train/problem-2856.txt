The thing is, schoolyard, boxing ring, etc. is waaaayy different than the struggle of nations. Second place is, to put it mildly, unpleasant. All we have to do is look at what the Russians are doing in Ukraine now. Or in Poland and Germany in 1939 & 1945 respectively. Or the Japanese for decades. Or, or, or… Hell, the Assyrians were such violent evil assholes they still have a reputation thousands of years later. And they haven’t mattered in thousand of years. Think about that.
Yup, also worked in Rwanda when the road network was going in/getting extended - China’s lending model is a hell of a proposition, especially when you consider the various “economic development” models offered up by the West in the post war era (and that’s without even touching the horrors of colonial “civilizing” efforts).
No! After China was caught bugging the African Union building with surveillance tech for their own interests. Tech buried deep in the walls. And the off brand heavily surveyed network tech China sells to African governments and citizens is obviously being used against their interests. It’s down right evil.
Oh, 100% - also, with how relatively new sub Saharan countries are just as defined, independent entities, and how recently most have had violent conflict either within or at their borders, that requires leadership that knows how to handle all the domestic complexities AND that has the strenh/force to stand up to predatory foreign interests.
Right? Everyone here freaking out. It's just stupid playground shit. The world powers have been playing in Africa for years but they don't want China to join. That's it.
I’m deeply skeptical/suspicious of China’s belt & road model, but let’s not ignore the grim reality of just how thoroughly most western have failed (or perhaps even worse: the damage done in those countries where western interests succeeded).
