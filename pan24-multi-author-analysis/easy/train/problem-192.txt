DeSantis was able to get rid of Disney’s self governing status which I think hurts Disney a lot. I don’t think Disney wants to cause any more damage to themselves right now.
But my point was Disney is still focused on this that I doubt they are going to do or say anymore for the time being. In the current economy and financial losses being reported, they are hurting so not a great time for them to take on anymore fights that could lead to surprises.

Actually, not. It will hurt the taxpayers of FL more (assuming DeSantis actually follows through, that remains to be seen, btw) when the District has to start funding police, fire protection, waters, sewers and more. They will also have to assume servicing the debt for all the bonds the District issued, which is significant of itself. Look for a bunch of homeowners in the area to get those Florida never-ending special assessment real estate taxes.
