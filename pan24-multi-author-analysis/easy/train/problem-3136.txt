Broom handle and strict gay laws is a good recipe to keep leverage on most folks. It’s actually very commonly used to keep loyalty in Russian army and military in general. They say “gay is bad, don’t you let us tell everyone you were forced to be the bottom”. They take pictures during and bam, loyalty till death. Shame is a social construct.
My theory is that Russian people were so exhausted after 90s (I remember that time, I was born in 1990 and 90s were scary, dark and sad even in Moscow) that when Putin came in power and the prices for oil skyrocketed and suddenly people not only had money for food but there was actually food in the stores and not just empty shelves, people just got distracted, you know. They lived their whole lives in dirt and poverty and suddenly they could afford nice things. They felt happy for a moment. And then it slowly started becoming clearer and clearer that Putin is a shitty president and it was actually just a coincidence that the economic growth happened during his regime. Like, people genuinely thought they started living better lives BECAUSE of him, they had no idea it was DESPITE his shitty actions. And then it just turned into an abusive relationship really. Like, your husband beats you up every day but you still remember the time when he gave you compliments and brought you flowers and you hope that maybe he will become nice and sweet again. I think Russian people were just so tired after the 90s that they couldn’t rise against the government once again just 15 years later. I think we can’t expect one generation to live through so much pain and troubles in their lifetime. That’s why the older generation (these who are 55-75) don’t want any revolution. Some of them are not happy with Putin at all but they are just so fucking tired they have no energy anymore.
