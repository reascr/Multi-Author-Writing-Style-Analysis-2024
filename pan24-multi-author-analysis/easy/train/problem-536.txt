This is incredibly disingenuous. There's a huge time gap between "trump becoming a phenomonon" and "trump getting elected" - in that time is when all the free press, covering shit that wasn't actually important, merely covered because it was absurd, is a large contributor to trumps popularity and thus his election. My source supported that.
History may well show that Trump expended whatever special magic he had to eek out a victory in a handful of competitive states eager for a dramatic change from the status quo against the most disliked and controversial Democratic candidate in modern history, who happened to be under federal investigation throughout much of the 2016 campaign. Ever since, heâ€™s mostly been an albatross for GOP candidates.
