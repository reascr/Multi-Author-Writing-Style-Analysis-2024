You’re not informing me of anything, though. Similar to how a non-profit which contracts with the US government for federal contracts needs to be compliant with federal guidelines and procedures, this position was a private contract with the US Air Force and thus the US government as well as the military. So you were bound by contract to fulfill some basic requirements to be and remain on base, for safety and liability sake if not just uniformity. But those were the orders, I didn’t really question it. Depending on the contract, the contracting parties, and any involved security clearances, you absolutely may have to undergo compulsory training. The government has a large array of positions, from military IT to contracted liaisons. This judge’s point is ridiculous and I don’t agree with how you paint what I’ve said or the nature of US Gov positions in general.
