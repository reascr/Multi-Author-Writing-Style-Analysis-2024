No idea. In this matter, though, they seem pretty good. In the US, being trans is not considered a disorder, which is in line with the medical consensus in most developed countries and the WHO (excpet for some notable cases like Spain amd Japan. Though Spain it's already looking at solving that).

Exactly. Do I want my kid to be trans? No. I would prefer that they were cis. But it’s not because I have any preference. It’s because I know that life will be easier for them that way.
Damn, if only we had some kind of, I don't know, a big, international medical organization that has made multiple studies, is considered one of the biggest suthorities in most medical matters and has written articles on the matter that could compare results of all the kinds of treatments applied to trans people ay different ages and see what's best.
