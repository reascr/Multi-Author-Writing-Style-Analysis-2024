I guess here I can only speak to personal experience. I have maybe half a dozen friends who went to top tier law schools and they seemed to all be doing pretty well right out of law school if they went corporate or litigation or patent. The non profit ones obvs are taking massive pay cuts.
Look into environmental consulting firms. Starting out you can do some really cool fieldwork. My speciality is birds but I’ve done all types of very cool fieldwork over the years: surveying for rare birds, catching and tracking bats, helicopter surveys for eagle nests, ocean grab sampling, desert tortoise surveys, rare plant surveys, lynx tracking…the list goes on and on.
Yes and no. Higher income, but because of how much school costs in the end it creates a poor debt to income ratio. So while one can afford the basics, there's limited opportunity to decrease those costs. For example, stuck paying high rent that increases every year, instead of being approved for a mortgage with a fixed payment amount for 30 years.
