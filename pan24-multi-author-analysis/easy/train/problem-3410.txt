The ukrainians have previous military experience, foreign military aid from the entire NATO and so other allies , they have proven to be brave and cohesive , they have proven to be innovative and took initiative in more then one occasion, they have good leadership and with great sacrifice they managed to hold the russians down and even took territory back . And they will never set foot into Russia proper . China would be a wasteland in like a couple hours after a Russia invasion. I would argue they could annihilate the chinese conventionally but they would 100 percent kill the majority of the chinese population with nukes .
