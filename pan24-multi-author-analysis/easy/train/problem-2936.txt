This is nothing more than projection. They are falsely accusing the school of being a left-wing indoctrination facility to deflect from the fact they want to turn it into a right-wing indoctrination facility.
Yes, it is. My son and I were in college at the same time. We went to different schools but both are in California where we live. His school is one of the leading engineering schools in the state. It also boasts top agricultural and construction management programs. That’s not a bio for what you’d typically think was a hotbed for progressives (other than the fact it was CA) but he’d talk often about being unwilling to ever bring up any sort of conservative views.
Wonderful. I’m glad we have educated people around. Is your comment based on comparing your college experience to your sons? I also have a BS, and having gone to a Florida university myself in the past decade, left-wing indoctrination is definitely not what I experienced. Yet I keep hearing it claimed as a real issue from those currently not attending any sort of classes.
