>On 11 April 2016, President Vladimir Putin declared Prokhorenko a Hero of the Russian Federation, the highest Russian honor. His funeral with full military honors was held in his home village of Gorodki on 6 May 2016.[2].
Very well, it's quite simple: completely arbitrary made up things should never be more important than things that are actually real or all unnecessary pain and suffering that they are the root cause of, whether that's capitalism and all that it entails, lines drawn on a map, or all of humanity's made up ethnicities that they somehow keep confusing as different races, etc etc.
Yeah, and that worked wonders. No, Russia has to lose this war. Run out of people to throw at Ukraine due to emigration or casualties. Then military defeat and then Putin is taken to rightful trial. If then proper elections and work towards a better future. Maybe then we can do something.
Fundamentally I have always maintained that the country was never deserving of such a patriot under Putin and that I will fundamentally respect him regardless of nationality.
It may. But I do have a colleague who used to be in the military and the was ineligible for leaving the country. He still left. Somehow. And if that communist xenophobe is against the war, thatâ€™s saying something to me.
