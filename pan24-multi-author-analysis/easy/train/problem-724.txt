Totally. But back in the 90’s I could go to a venue and buy a ticket at the gate for a GA show. And while I was at a show I could buy tickets for other upcoming shows for the actual printed value on the ticket. No upsets or other Charges. Nearly every show I went to in Philly was under $40 a ticket the majority were $25 and I saw a lot of good shows. I don’t go to shows anymore I can’t afford to pay $200+ for a GA ticket, forget about trying to get a seat.
What artifical scarcity situation. TS can only play a limited number of concerts without burning herself out.
Fundamentally wrong. Ticketmaster did the ticketing for the venues where they have contract. SeatGeek did the ticketing for the venues where they have the contract.
