Okay so at some point some asshole (well 18th centurish anthropologist/archaeologist/grave robber/genocidal imperialist pedophile, probably, lines tended to blur for Europeans of the time) found ancient Atlantis myths, and as the 18th-19th century was prone to doing, turned some ancient text saying 'there were these people who came from the ocean who we traded with who seemed to have their shit together, like great boats and top notch pottery and shit, but they're gone now and we don't know what the fuck happened' and 'humanity probably evolved from some common origin and there are ancient cultures and proto indo European cultures migrating up from Africa from whom most of the languages we know descended' into 'there is an ancient precursor race to all humans that were superior and perfect from whom all art and scientific knowledge flows, basically ancient aliens/genetic memory(which is, I cannot stress enough; not a thing; the human genome is about 1/10 the file size of, like, a rice or peanut genome) style, of whom we can be only pale imitations, and every living person is just a degenerate failson (remember; women weren't people) of these glorious golden gods, in unbelievably fucking racist ways that were going to use to justify all sorts of awful shit' of and obviously white Europeans were the closest and overall best. Because of course.
