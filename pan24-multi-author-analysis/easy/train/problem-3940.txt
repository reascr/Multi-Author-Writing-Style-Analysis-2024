I noticed it the last few summers. Until a few years ago, whenever i would leave the window open each night there would be dozens of insects coming in. Now it is maybe 1 every other day.
That’s honestly a pretty incredible relationship to have experienced. I think we humans think we’re special in that we can perceive the world around us and have awareness about that fact. I think most animals and a lot of higher tier insects can perceive and understand as much about the world as we can, we’re just the first to push to do more than what nature allotted or intended for us. I try not to kill spiders unless absolutely necessary. Always enjoyed letting them build their webs and kill the flying bugs around my house. I can honestly say I’ve seen a lot less this year as well: strange. Hope we invent the tech to help fix the damage we’re causing on our planet. But there is so much about this space rock we call home that we don’t understand.
Tarantulas regenerate legs . The females tend to stay in one burrow, they don't migrate and visit people.
It was really incredible. My family considered her a friend of the house. Its sad that the area around my parents property has been entirely developed so there won't be nearly as many experiences for my own kids when they visit.
