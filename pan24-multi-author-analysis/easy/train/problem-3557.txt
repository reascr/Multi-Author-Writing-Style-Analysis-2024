To be specific - we can't "level the planet" anymore. This was possible back in 1986 when we had apparently like 70000 warheads between USA and USSR alone. As in - land on Earth is around 150,000,000 km^2. Our strongest tested nukes (like Tsar bomb) could still cause third degree burns 100 kilometers away from center of the explosion so we can say an average one is still very problematic at 2025 km^2. Times 70000 = 141,750,000 km^2. Aka just enough to indeed "level the planet".
I mean, like I was all for the an eye for an eye don't work/ lets not truly engage approach at first, and I can see how the military industrial complex loves this going on for as long as it does, but I definitely wonder if the public vitriol was in any way similar to post-9/11 America in terms of being aggressive, and after seeing how little faith there is in Russia as a truly nuclear threat, I wonder if there's an alternate universe where they nipped this in the bud before it could continue to fester, and what it's like there right now.
