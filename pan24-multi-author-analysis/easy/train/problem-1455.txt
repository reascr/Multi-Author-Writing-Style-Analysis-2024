5 speed bumps were out in on one block, which I had lived on for 20+ years and there had not been a single accident. They were the speed table type which if you go over at about 35-40 mph they just kind of soften out - which a lot of people realized so speeds went up on the block for some people and the rest went 1mph. It is a big part of why I moved.
I don't personally own a car and I understand why people hate car based infrastructure on the other hand the vision zero stuff is completely unworkable and incredibly unpopular. They did this stuff in a couple neighborhoods in my city, put a stop sign at every possible intersection, banned potentially dangerous turns, made it impossible to go more than 10-15 mph on semi-residential streets and boy did that suck. It made it functionally impossible to drive in those neighborhoods and created a ton of traffic and everyone hated it besides the tiny but incredibly loud concerned parents coalition and the 20 year old non-driving intelligentsia. I think it was so unpopular that they ended it.
