It's funny. To the more cunning republicans (like Moscow Mitch), they always knew it was bullshit and without merit. It was just a stall tactic, a whataboutism to deflect criticism. In the house, when they were the minority, they could use it to stall progress then blame democrats for nothing getting done. But, like Trump, it kind of grew out of their control. Now they have house majority but have to appease the crazies by wasting time on this, potentially making themselves look inept. Though I partly doubt it. A huge chunk of their base is so out of touch with reality, they could blame Hilary and their base would lap it up with ferver. That said, if it could pull more moderates away and further schism the GOP, that would be lovely.
It's really inhuman, actually. I don't know how these people find any kind of compassion in this life.
