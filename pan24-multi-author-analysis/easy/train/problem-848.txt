Maybe the wrong sub, but I can’t not reply lol. I can get into my foil hat about paranormal/after life/mediums/clairvoyance, but on numerous occasions I have had the most random thought of or feeling from someone, I found out they died. Not a real close family member either. Ie, sadly Had an acquaintance die in a car wreck, I was out driving on my own that evening and he randomly popped in my head. I got home a few hours later to a text he died and when I asked the approximate time when… the estimate was around that same time I had that thought when I was on the road.
