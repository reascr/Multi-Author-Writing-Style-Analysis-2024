The Republican party has been marching toward this goal for decades over multiple avenues of approach: state legislation to sabotage election rules, court packing to make the judicial branch an extension of the party's will, and civil disobedience/criminal conspiracy when propaganda fails to win them sustainable power.
Who thought other wise. If you are upset by what Ye said just remember every conservative talking head who defended and platformed him believes the same thing. That is why they were defending him and platforming. At least Ye is honest about his beliefs instead of hiding behind a thin veneer of calling them globalist, bankers and elitist. All while claiming the same conspiracy nazi did. They are pushing degenerecy on us, whites are being replaced, they are tricking Americans into communism, they drink androchrome etc. If you believe all those things and think you are not a nazi well you are only lying to yourself.
