This press, WSYX (local abc channel for Columbus, OH) is owned by Sinclair Broadcasting Group. In case you aren't familiar, they are a national Corp that has scooped up dozens of local news channels across the nation to replace local journalism with a combination of right wing propaganda and the lowest effort "content" that they can pump out with as little journalism as they can get away with. Note how they refer to the "Norfolk and Southern trains" in the image caption as if there were multiple trains and as if Norfolk Southern was two entities. Everyone makes mistakes, but this lack of quality control is the best case for an article from an SBG station. They are never going to call these bribes because they love this shit. They are too busy running their nationally mandated "crisis in the classroom" pieces to try and defame the concept of public education so that there corporate overlords can privatize that and get their propaganda diets shoved into our collective faces at an even younger age. Be very skeptical of any local news article that seems a little off, especially if it is by a channel with the "on your side" tag line (Wikipedia will confirm ownership of a channel if you look up their four letter call sign like WSYX). Sorry for the rant, I have an irrational hatred of SBG after moving to a market with an SBG ABC affiliate that my family insists on watching. They are the absolute scum of the earth.
I know in reality there are orders of separation with how money flows but you can't help but imagine a scenario where (a portion of) the very money they save by avoiding regulations and maintenance goes right into the hands of the politicians who are tasked with making sure they don't have regulations. "We saved a ton of cash by not being forced to put new brakes on the trains. Here's your cut.".
