In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Seriously. I remember fielding posts in /r/trees in 2015-2016 when incels claimed Donald would legalize cannabis. What. A joke. Almost like it was an op, because instead he put private prison profiteer and sedition enabler Jefferson Beauregard Sessions in as AG. The anti cannabis crusader.
Mere decriminalization—not legalization—wouldn’t interfere with state law. It would just mean not going to jail if caught with marijuana within those city limits. Outside the city jurisdiction you may get fucked.

It's already practically legal/decriminalized. Hell, I know of at least one vape shop around me that said fuck it and started selling pre-rolls from CO.
