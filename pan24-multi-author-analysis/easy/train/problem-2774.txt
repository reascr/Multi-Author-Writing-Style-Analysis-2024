I was thinking of the impact on the market from a speculative/destabilizing sense. If the war in Ukraine can be a major contributing factor to US food and Oil prices doubling (even though we imported very little of either from Ukraine or Russia before the war started), imagine what a leaderless and deeply corrupt Russia could do to freak out investors.
What? Any nuke launched means the end of Russia regardless of what happens anywhere else. That's literally the dumbest thing they could do and they know it.
Then there's a very real chance that Russia has a popular uprising where people are demanding a better government more concerned with the welfare of the people, the west is going to be demanding Russia become a true democracy, and/or give up nuclear weapons, as a condition for lifting sanctions, and Ukraine is going to be demanding money that Russia doesn't have for reparations.
Edit.: I donâ€™t expect or want them to break their Hippocratic oath, but they all have a chance to just refuse working for a tyrannical despot.
