This is all apart of the GOP's ongoing campaign of domestic terrorism. Their actions are incredibly similar to the Know Nothing Party. Party leadership and notables engaging in rhetoric that encourages violence from their base. The base carries out the violence and plausible deniability is claimed because the leadership would always claim they had no knowledge, nor actually ordered the violence. They simply knew nothing.
This is what happens when you seal yourself off in an isolated propaganda environment, and refuse to pay the slightest bit of attention to an information source that doesn't have an interest in telling you something that you already want to hear, and preventing you from hearing things that you wouldn't want to hear.
Fun game you play. You're not good very good at it. Also major lol on the "2020 race riots." We all know Corporations aren't actually people but I'm sure you cry for their demise. Luckily leeches were able to siphon off nearly a trillion from PPP so it's all about equal, ya?
