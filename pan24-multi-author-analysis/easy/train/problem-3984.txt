They are trying to reform our Democratic Republic into a mob rule where people blame their fellow citizens for a bad government rather than the moneyed interests that continue to try to pervert the institution of government by intentionally misinforming the electorate as a shell game so that the political industrial complex can get away with whatever they want to while people rage at each other about identitarian differences among people.
Nope. This Republican investment in false equivalency doesn't deliver the plausible deniability they wanted. The media scoff and laugh - but treasonous Republicans will always just come back with more bad faith hearings. Always. They are not guided by a moral compass - they wage war on democracy. Fascists don't need likes or public approval - they rule by lies and violence. Defy them - unite, organize and mobilize - rise up and defend democracy.

Exactly. It's almost as if these articles are designed to placate the people on the left into complacency seeing this, so that they feel like the hearings "backfired" when, in reality, it didn't backfire for the GOP. They never expected for it to be factual or substantive. It was always going to be smoke and mirrors and carefully curated moments to play up on right-wing media for their base.
