Wow. This was a lot of text for your relatively short comment. What I'm saying is, I've been there, and I won't tell you the financial security wasn't a nice reprieve from the grind, but unless you're jumping up to 6 figures, shit right now is kind of just fucking bleak no matter where you're sitting. All I want is a job that pays the bills and makes me not want to fucking shoot myself.
Seriously. It’s like everyone on Reddit has a desk job that only requires 16 hours of work per week but are forced to sit at their desks for 40 anyway and they make more money than me. Where the fuck are these jobs?
I honestly think the history of labor rights movements in American has been intentionally sanitized to 1) hide the fact that capitalism is exploitative by nature and needs to be rigorously regulated to protect people, and 2) obscure the methods used and battles won to secure those rights so they can't inspire new generations to keep it up.
As a chef I work 7.5 hours of an 8 hour shift. In reality most days are 10.25 hours of an 11 hour shift. I feel like I’ve screwed myself by getting into this line of work. But I’m too far gone and make too much money to just switch careers. What the heck should I do?
