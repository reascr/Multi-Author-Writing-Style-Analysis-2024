Really? This is where you see a lack of judgement? Dinner with a bigot? He has dinner with bigots all the time. Don jr, Eric, Jarod kushner, just to name a few. He lost his judgement many times before the insurrection. His whole presidency was filled with errors in judgment. But at least here Christie is distancing himself from the train wreck. Christie is only saying it’s an error in judgment because it was done in the open. He couldn’t care less otherwise.
