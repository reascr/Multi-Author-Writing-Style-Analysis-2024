Thanks, but I'll take my nerdy, diligent, and boring public servants any day of the week over flashy memorable sound bite productions pushed in our faces ad nauseum. Republicans have eyepatch guy, wheelchair guy, Lauren and marjie, the closing time twins, and all the rest of the cast of characters who never even suggests that they are in it for the right reasons.

Exactly. Republicans treat politics like itâ€™s the WWE. Those people are public servants who are there to improve the wellbeing of the citizens they represent. It takes thoughtfulness, compassion, and intelligence.
I am not saying you did. I am saying if something like that were to cause you (or anyone, really) to then vote for a Republican that's a failing on that individual who would then turn around to vote for a republican, first and foremost.
If someone tells you that you might as well be a republican and if that causes you to vote for a far-Right political party, rather than doing introspection on your ideological perspective, that says more about you than the person who told you that you can "therefore fuck off".
