Fusion itself creates an insane amount of energy, the difficultly is in how efficiently its collected and how much is put into maintaining the process.
Yes. That’s the break over point. Once you can get even the tiniest amount more energy back out relative to what you put in to start the reaction then it becomes self sustaining. Once it becomes self sustaining the return on the fuel and life of the reaction (life of materials) then becomes an economics and process improvement problem. The physics absolutely make sense. You can get orders of magnitude more energy out than you put in even today.. for a very brief amount of time. The challenge is keeping enough of the energy contained to maintain the reaction indefinitely while siphoning off a little bit to drive another energy transmission objective, like make electricity.
Look at me everyone! I'm so like passionAAAAte about the environment and stuff... I'm such a good person.
Materials Science Applications Radiation-tolerant ceramic-matrix composites developed by FES researchers are central to fuels and core technologies being developed for current and next-generation.
It’s a chicken and an egg problem. A working fusion reactor can breed tritium from lithium. We don’t really “need” tritium in mass quantities until we have working fusion reactors that demand a lot of tritium. The break even point will create the demand for tritium which would then create nearly infinite energy resources to then expend at doing cool things like making tritium.
