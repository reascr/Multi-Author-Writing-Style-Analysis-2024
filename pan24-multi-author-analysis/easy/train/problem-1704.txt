The slow delivery of weapons is mainly due to logistics and supply considerations. A patriot battery is great if you have the training, ammo supplies, manpower, repair parts, etc. The Bradley is similar. It requires specific 25mm cannon ammunition that is only manufactured specifically for the Bradley cannon. On top of that, it has zero interchangeable parts with currently deployed Ukrainian vehicles. Western fighter planes take even longer, the pilots must be trained, supply lines built, ground crews trained, ground support equipment delivered, ammunition delivered, and so on and so on. These arms deals take time because robust logistical lines have to be developed to ensure that any delivered equipment can even be used. In the early stages of the war, transferring surplus soviet Era equipment was quick and easy to hand over because the logistics were already in place to provide compatible ammunition and repair parts because these systems were familiar to the UA, replacing lost or destroyed hardware that they already possessed.
Be honest. This war of Europe allied with the United States against Russia on the territory of Ukraine. Ukraine was harshly rejected for the sake of the interest of others.
