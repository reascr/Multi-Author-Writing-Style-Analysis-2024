In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. But if they are threatening election consequences it’s important to know who voted in their interests and who didn’t. The dems may be in power but punishing them with election defeat isn’t going to further their cause.
Interesting... Both parties voted for it. Wonder which one they will punish. Considering republicans voted overwhelingly against sick days and both parties voted to ensure there is no shutdown, which group do you punish? I know which group I would not vote for but I don't tend to vote against my own interests.
Republican logic? You mean the same party that universally rejected the deal you’re arguing in favor of?
