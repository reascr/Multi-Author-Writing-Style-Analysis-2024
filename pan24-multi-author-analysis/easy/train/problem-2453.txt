Lol. You go ahead and go to Russia with weed and see how the news articles go for you. Lol. This woman is more than a pawn she is a moron because she is screwed now. Nobody gonna save you from the gulag.
-Although Blinken did not directly confirm Bout was part of the deal, saying he “can’t and won’t get into any of the details of what we proposed to the Russians over the course of so many weeks now,” he said “in terms of the President, of course he was not only directly involved, he signs off on any proposal that we make, and certainly when it comes to Americans who are being arbitrarily detained abroad, including in this specific case.”.
lol. i got no sympathy for this woman. maybe she will learn her lesson. if any other person on this planet were to take cannabis to russia the narrative would be much different, but most likely non-exsistant. she now gets to learn that she isnt special and the same rules apply to her as everyone else on the planet. what a dumb fucking moron to take drugs to a foreign country there is not really anything else to say about it.
