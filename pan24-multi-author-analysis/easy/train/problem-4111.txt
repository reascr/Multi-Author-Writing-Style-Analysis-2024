edit: Since people think I'm lying. China has been miscounting population for almost 30 years because they don't do an actual census they instead take primary school enrollment data to estimate their own population. This is faulty since schools always say they have more enrolments than they actually do for more funds. I'll give you link after link from different sources and years. Just so you know, China hasn't done an actual census in over 20 years. The last one they attempted was in 1999/2000 and they stopped before it finished because the citizens were giving wrong information because they didn't trust the reasoning behind the census questions. India overtook China as the most populous between 2014 to 2016 honestly.
Exactly. We have been working on a project about this for almost three years and people still donâ€™t believe it. Bc no one wants to believe it. But ask yourself how many people you know who have had it over and over. My friends are teachers and they have had it four times in the last year.
