Endometriosis is no joke either; I watched it turn a strong af hardheaded women into a crying mess in fetal position and she just powered through it. It’s crazy to think someone should either work through that or use sick time (I mean it’s once a month, even taking one day off per month - that’s 12 days and the average number of sick days allotted in the US is just 8) or third option - jump through hella hoops to prove it after multiple doctors visits to get the paperwork and diagnosis like guys cmon lol.
I am a woman. My friends are women. I don't have much pain, but they do. And when they do, they take painkillers and get on with their life. If a woman has such debilitating pain that even painkillers can't touch it, it's probably endometriosis or some other treatable underlying condition. They should not simply stay home and suffer.
For starters, that ancient Egyptian stuff is fairly controversial as it makes a lot of modern assumptions based on spurious data, an academic paper that painstakingly goes through the evidence and assesses its validity. It does appear that men stayed home from work while their female relatives (wives and daughters) were menstruating, but that's unlikely to be because they were tending to them or taking care of things around the household.
I totally get that. Some women get it rough through no fault of their own and I have much sympathy for them. But also the government and companies are obligated not to discriminate against employees based on gender. Allowing women and only women access to additional paid leave would be gender discrimination. In my opinion a better option would be to just give all employees of every gender additional paid leave time and not require them to disclose the reason for using it.
