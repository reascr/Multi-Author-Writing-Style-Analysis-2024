[Average needle waste is around 0.03-0.05ml per dose. So, eg. - a dose of 0.2ml can consume around 0.25ml each time, an increase which seems tiny but adds up quickly. In this example, what "should" be five doses, per insurance math, is actually four irl.].
Healthcare is already insanely expensive. Insurers are now required to cover many things that were not covered 15-20 years ago when costs were about 1/2 what they are today. We're now at the point where even basic things like physicals and birth control require a costly claim be submitted. Now a $10 pack of birth control costs $100 because of all the extra bureaucracy. That address cost is reflected in our premiums. Forcing insurers to cover (arguably) cosmetic procedures will just make those procedures exponentially more expensive and will cost all of us more in premiums.
Yep. My youngest got hurt last year around Halloween and needed a staple in her head. My wife took her to the ER at a hospital that is in our network but the doctor on duty wasn't. Cost me almost 1500. We didn't find out until days before Christmas when the bill arrived.
