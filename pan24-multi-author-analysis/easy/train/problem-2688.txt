If he's indicted, he'll immediately start screaming about political persecution. He and his lawyers will do everything they can to delay, delay, delay any court proceedings. As any potential trial is dragged out, he'll still be openly running for the nomination, demanding loyalty from whatever supporters he has left and daring Republican challengers to come at him. He'll be extra motivated to keep running if he thinks there's a chance he could get the reins of power again so he can use the resources of the federal government to shield himself in any way possible. He can't pardon himself from state charges in GA or NY, but "I'm a presidential candidate" and "I'm the president" are the two strongest deflections he's ever had... of course he'll keep chasing those things.
