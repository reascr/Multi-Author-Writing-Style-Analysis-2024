So... do you have any other, actually relevant steps that can be taken to ensure Israeli citizens are safe from PIJ, ISIS, Hamas, any the tens of other extremist Islamic groups right next door?
Your suggestion has nothing to do with Israeli national security and keeping their own citizens safe. Unless you think the reason for violence and reliation is the settlement building which is beyond stupid. If you want to pull the settlement building fact out of your ass to say "If Israel didn't do X they wouldn't have to deal with such retaliation" you are very wrong. In fact, you are the one currently deflecting blame and somehow believing that this conflict is simply about land ownership and rights to land that has passed hands between empires and nations for millennia, and doesn't have anything to do with the fact that Hamas et al are extremist groups who will enact violence in any situation.
He’s not wrong. If you think the various medias of the world don’t specifically pick and choose what they want to write articles about then I would just ask that you realize they do. They’re made up of fallible people, like you and me.
