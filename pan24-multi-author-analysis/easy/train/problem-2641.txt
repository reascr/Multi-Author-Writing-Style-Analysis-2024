Of course, lack of compensation for the freed slaves is a whole 'nother thing that I can't defend. I think we can universally agree that half of it was fucked.

3. After the "apprenticeship period" these former slaves still owned nothing and many were forced to remain working for a pittance for these same plantations as there was nowhere else to go. The land still belonged to the colonial masters, and the businesses generally all belonged to the colonists. There still remained a population of people being exploited because they owned nothing, had been kept uneducated, were still subject to their former masters as they held all the power. Former slaves could try to find land attached to the Anglican churches - not that this was much better - but many had to rent land to put a house on from the same plantations they were still forced to work on. Slavery did not end with slavery.
Literally everywhere. Human trafficking for both labor and sex trade. Just because it’s not institutionalized anymore doesn’t mean the practice stopped.
