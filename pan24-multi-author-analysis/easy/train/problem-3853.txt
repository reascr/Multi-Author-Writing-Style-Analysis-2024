I disagree that it wasn't thought out. They have been testing the waters for a while now, getting increasingly racist when Obama was elected, and actively courting white nationalists and neo-nazis since Trump. They have been watching the reactions, especially amongst their base, delighting at how happy they were to have racist politicians "tell it like it is." It's not like one day, out of nowhere, the GOP as a monolith said "Let's throw in with the Nazis for no particular reason, what's the worst that could happen?" It's been a steadily growing undercurrent for over a decade, with mainstream GOP support for it likely being very carefully considered before being adopted.
Exactly. Elon also unbanned the publishers of Stormfront, a literal neo nazi site. Kanye wasn't banned for the Nazi stuff. If he was he wouldn't have been unbanned in the first place. He was banned for bad press.
