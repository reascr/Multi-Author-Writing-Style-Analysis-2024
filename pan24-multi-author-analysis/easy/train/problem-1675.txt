3.	Bolsonaro is (not yet confirmed) going through health issues, related to a leg infection. Still unclear, but some suspect Erysipelas. I don’t think it’s life threatening at all, but he’ll need to go through a recovery period. He’s not been doing much as of late.
Conservatives aren't a monolithic entity. You have everyone from Tea Party and Evangelical nuts to free market or small government supporters.
Really? You've never seen a matrix printer? Does it even matter? If a human can't read the ballot and come to the same count as a machine, obviously you have a bad machine (or a bad human for that matter).
Voter takes a ballot, fills it out, computer scans the ballot, computer gives the tabulation of the votes, a bunch of ballots are checked to make sure computer is not a liar and off you go. After scanning ballot is dropped into a ballot box. Have 10 scanners, check 2 machines.
Everyone surrounding him just saw Bolsonaro as a gigantic corrupt person sitting in an absurd amount of public money, ready to distribute it to the first sign of a supportive person, but now that he lost the election he no longer have an use so he was spat out like chewed bubblegum by almost all of his former allies, and that includes all the leeches from the military after they already have been graced with a ton of benefits, like being spared from the latest social security reform that pretty much screwed the entire population.
So don't use an LCD computer to select choices. Use pen and paper to fill out the ballot that gets scanned.
A computer that scans a ballot that was handed to you from a stack of ballots earlier in the voting process has no way to tie that ballot back to you. Hence nobody knows how you voted. Secrecy maintained.
2.	Everyone was really fucking quick to recognize Lula. Leaders from all over the world congratulated Lula right after he won, and the same happened with political leaders within our country (even some of Bolsonaro’s allies).
