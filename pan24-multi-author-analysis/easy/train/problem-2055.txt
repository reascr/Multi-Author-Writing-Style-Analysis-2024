I offered an explanation to someone replying to you, but please correct me if I’m the one who’s wrong. I’m pretty sure that you’re saying establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats both think that voters want more conservatism, when the opposite is true.
I think that the person you’re replying to meant that Democrats have been saying candidates weren’t “conservative” enough, literally exactly the same as the Republicans. It doesn’t seem like they were saying Democrats were doing the ‘equivalent’ of the same thing on their side of things within their end of the political spectrum, and picking a bunch of Bernies and AOCs in their primaries ... rather, they’re saying Democrats were completely MATCHING the push to the right, both parties in the same direction.
I understand why you’d take the other interpretation, but closely reading the last two sentences of the post seems to make it clear that they’re saying progressive candidates are more popular in spite of the establishment belief in both parties that they need to hug the middle or right.
Lol... No. It's really sad that the overton window has moved so far right that people think of Biden and Obama as progressive. They're essentially moderate republicans. A little better than Bill Clinton, but not much.
