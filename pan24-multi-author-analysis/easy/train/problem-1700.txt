It's my understanding that in the "Why did WWII happen?" post-mortem, there was a conclusion that the Treaty of Versailles was a big part of that reason: Humiliating Germany and making them pay reparations for WWI was what set the stage for lingering German resentment, the rise of Hitler and subsequent rearmament, and a second world war which ultimately claimed many more lives than the first.
Yea I'm sure. The US is spending less than 5% of its annual peacetime budget to supply a nation who is embarrassing one of their biggest rivals. Meanwhile, NATO has expanded considerably in Eastern Europe, their existing allies are spending more on their own defense, the EU is severing oil/gas dependency in Russia and the Dollar is doing historically well internationally while the CCP distances itself from the Kremlin.

I support ukraine, but this idea that we need a peace that dick slaps russia is stupid. Let's not piss off the Russian people.
