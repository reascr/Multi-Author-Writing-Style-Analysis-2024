Now, had France and the UK honored there treaties with Poland in the 1930's and instantly attacked German when Germany attack Poland, then Russia would not have gone against France (Russia and France were somewhat friendly, and Stalin wasn't going to join a war against a united front).

Germany was not armed and prepared to fight a two front war of attrition; they didn't have panzer 3, 4's just weak panzer 1 and 2's and han't had the time to manufacture that many and France had the largest ground forces and even with primitive combined arms practices vs Germany, would have eventually overwhelmed Germany while fighting on German land with their almost limit less manufacturing capacity of their their allies.
