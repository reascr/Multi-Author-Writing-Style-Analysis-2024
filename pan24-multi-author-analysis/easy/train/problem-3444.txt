Make no mistake the Chinese government is very bad they are committing modern day holocaust in their own country and are buying up essential infrastructure in Africa and the Caribbean and trying to buy essential infrastructure that would compromise national security such as trying to buy most silicon chip manufacturers and telecommunications technologies.
I got a secret parking ticket just last week. The bastards hid it in a fortune cookie. I thought it was my friend Xian making a joke, but if it's on Fox it.. well Christ, it must be true. And the ticket says if I don't pay it, it'll screw up my social score? Fuck me. This is all Biden's fault1!
In addition to China secret service everywhere to coerce their citizen living abroad, China has been promoting their propaganda in East Asia by establishing "cultural institutions". I'm Vietnamese, so I'm concerned of their agressive plans to extend it's influence by distorting history and our culture. For example they have been trying to claim falsely that many regions in Vietnam were part of the Chinese empire. They are sending their citizens in Vietnam to chinafy my country, so that in the long run they will be able to absorb those regions and extend their influence. Same strategy as the Russians trying to destroy Ukraine culture...
