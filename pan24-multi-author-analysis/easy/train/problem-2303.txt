"Alright everybody, as my first act as the Supreme Leader, we are gonna be making some changes around here. Now how many of yall have heard of Vecna?".
I'm from Iran, opposition call protests a "femine revolution", not because it's actually a femine revolution, but ratherly because we need to make west to cut their relationships with regime, so they use this "femine" word to show it as a feminist movement, basically west doesn't care about basic human rights in Iran but when they see some femeist movements somewhere around the world they become interested, as you can see most deaths are men and revolution are caused for gaining basic human rights including women's right which we actually had them before 1979 Islamic revolution(which USA, France and Britain directly supported it), plus it's not something to be finished with reforms, nowadays Iranians see this regime as foreigners and nothing satisfy us rather than overthrowing regime.
Yep thank u. One of those pro ruzzies who won't stand up downvoted my comment. Go figure. They won't go to the front lines nor fight Pootin, but downvote my comment in protest of the sheep that they are. I merely compared the vast differences of the 2 countries and they hate it. Welp what can I say. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
The Christian religion in the US is just as capable of such oppression because their religious organizations have been overshadowed by the teachings of the evangelical movement.
Yep. Admitting to your faults is the foundation for change. No change can nor will happen if you dont see/admit to faults. That's the problem with Russia. Zero accountability while all promoting crime. In Russia you get punished for being good. They are taught to support evil.
