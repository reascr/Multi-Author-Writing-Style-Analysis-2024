...I remember the thing that caught my attention, the whole FFFFF thing... which was reported to be a vulgar acronym. It's not like I was offended at the vulgarity of it or whatever, but when he was asked about it they only brought up the one example (in the yearbook I think, "FFFFFFourth of July" etc) where it was so clear he made up the bullshit story about how it wasn't an acronym, it was some friend who had a speech impediment or something and said "Fuck" funny, stressing the F for far too long so it became an inside joke to stress the F in words that start with F... which could be twisted to make some sort of sense in the context of that one particular time it was used and asked about. But it wasn't the only time he used it, and in another context (a letter I believe) his story made no sense as he did use it like an acronym. My memory is a little hazy but at the time I vividly remember being surprised no one there caught this detail and pressed him on it.
Exactly. And this was being talked about long before the primaries. The possibility of 3 SC nominations. And even the possibility of Roe v Wade being overturned if a Republican got elected. Everyone should have been RUNNING for the polls to vote dem in that election no matter who the candidate was or how butthurt you were. I hope we all learned a lesson here...
