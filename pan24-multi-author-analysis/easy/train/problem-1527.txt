Look at up. Look up what Reagan said about the passage of medicare. Look up what Rush railed about for 3 decades, undoing SS and everything FDR did "we're doing something about that". GWB is elected on the idea that Social Security must be privatized. The elected Republicans are against it, the influencers like Rush try to convince the Republicans voters to be against it.
