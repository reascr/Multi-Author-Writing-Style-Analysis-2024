The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.
The authoritarian and fascist impulses of the functionally illiterate American population gives power to fascists like DeSantis. He has signed laws designed to punish his political opponents, gerrymandered away any electoral threat to his party in Florida, embraced anti-science, installed a puppet Supreme Court, presided over a devastating and deadly Covid denialism policy, and Floridians are suffering under a tremendous housing and cost of living crisis. Yet, they cheer for him.
