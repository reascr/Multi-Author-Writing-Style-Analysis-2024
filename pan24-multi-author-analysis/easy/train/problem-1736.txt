For China, their nuclear strategy is that of a Credible Minimum Deterrent (as opposed to Mutually Assured Destruction), similar to what France and the UK are doing: basically, „we acknowledge that you can wipe us out if you want to and we can‘t do the same to you but we can still cause a LOT of damage, is it really worth it to you?“. While the nice thing about this is that you need to build and maintain much fewer weapons than someone who wants to have the capability to „win“ a nuclear war, the problem is that you‘re very susceptible to enemy anti-missile systems, if you don‘t have enough weapons to punch through it you may lose your deterrence capability entirely. Since the US has been fairly quietly building up its anti-ICBM capabilities over the last 20 years or so, China now needs to react.
Definitely. But as far as I’m aware, lifting an embargo is not something the people can vote on. We can, however, elect people who can and want to lift it, though. There’s actually some political will to do this, as well. Hopefully it’ll happen sooner rather than later, too. Just gotta keep voting for the right people, petitioning, and raising awareness.
