That's how we got Trump though. Republicans were losing badly when Obama first got elected, and everyone was talking about the party dying. So they went into a realignment. Unfortunately it was for the worst. But if they continue to lose they could realign again under someone good. I don't see it happening though, I think they probably double down on the authoritarianism until they get another Trump in office who accomplishes what Trump tried to do and we have some sort of Balkanization or other type of upheaval. It just seems like the divide in America is too great for things to work out and the right is willing to do anything to get and keep power.

Shhhhhhhh. Donâ€™t tell anyone, but we use gerrymandering too. You have to be in control of the state legislature to do it. Once we get more control in more and more states, republicans do what they do best which is play victim.
