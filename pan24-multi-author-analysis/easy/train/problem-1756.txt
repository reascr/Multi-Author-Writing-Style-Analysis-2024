Even as stockholders, we still would not be creditors by proxy. The debt is not owed to the American public, but to the DoE. The DoE acts under the authority of citizens, through Congress, who has given the DoE the ability to be a creditor for student loans. 1. Emergency powers are generally broad, and for good reason, which gives good cause to cancel debt under the HEROES Act. 2. Having been given the ability to be a creditor by Congress, they are solely in charge of that debt unless Congress steps in. Congress is not responsible for the credit, the DoE is.
It’s not an appropriation of money. They’re the creditor in this situation (they even revised the EO to take out forgiveness for people enrolled in the program where private loans were federally backed/regulated). It’s telling people “You don’t have to pay us back this amount of money, and no interest either.” That’s the plan.
