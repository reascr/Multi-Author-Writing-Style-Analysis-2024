Yeah, even a military victory would mean about 40 million pissed off people added to a nation of 140 million. It would be an administrative hell, not to mention partisan activity etc. Coupled with sanctions. What was he thinking...
Their first attempt to capture Kyiv at the beginning of the war failed, and that’s when Ukraine was far less prepared, less armed, and less dug-in, and Russia hadn’t lost nearly 100,000 troops, thousands of tanks and armored vehicles, hundreds of aircraft and helicopters, and hadn’t yet wasted so many of their missiles terrorizing civilians that they now have to resort to converting old surface-to-air missiles into makeshift surface-to-surface missiles. Since then, Ukraine has received billions of dollars worth of arms and aid from around the world, has had months to train tens of thousands of new troops, has refined their battlefield tactics, and seriously damaged Russia’s command and logistics structures by killing dozens of high-ranking officers and damaging or destroying vital supply lines from Russia.
