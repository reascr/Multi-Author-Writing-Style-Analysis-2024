At the same time we have a lot of soldiers that we try to fund and a lot of help needed for people in recently liberated areas. I know that there is a very limited electricity just yet, so they would need more help with powerbanks, small generators if possible. I guess I should look for some volunteers who travel there and look for a basic wishlist. I hope it does not sound like we do not need help, I’m just very grateful for all the support and being able to fund and cover my basic needs so I can’t even think of what would be great to have that can be shipped. But I would add that while I’m lucky to maintain my job a lot of people didn’t and also there are people who lost their houses (for example in Irpin or Bucha) and moved to Kyiv or older people who can’t go to the store without light because elevators don’t work then, so maybe even small humanitarian aid would be good.
No. Russian locations of strategic importance should continue to have "smoking related accidents" that are definitely not the result of Ukrainian action.
