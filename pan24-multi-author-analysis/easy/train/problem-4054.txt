That's one of the many issues that would come up during the potential negotiations, but almost nobody is happy with the status quo. Also, this article isn't even about Greene so much as it is about secession in general. The original title was simply "We need to talk about disunion", and I don't think they needed to change it.

Blame the magazine, unfortunately. The article originally was published under the title of "we need to talk about disunion", and then it was changed at some point within the last day.
Interesting article first published under the title "we need to talk about disunion". Not sure why the name changed, but it is an interesting read. It is essentially a liberal's case in favor of secession, rather than the condemnation that other outlets have heaped on the issue.
So yeah, it is actually markedly in favor of considering secession as an actual issue, rather than blowing it off as lunacy like the other news agencies all seemed to do.
