and now you have my Former, & Very Disgraced Lawyer, Michael Cohen, who was very very Low Level in the Trump Organization. we had a lot of Winners, but Michael wasn't one of them unfortunately. and they say I'm too nice, "Sir, why do you let him stay when he's Incompetent, Sir?" and I said he has a family, right, he has a family. and what did he do, First Opportunity, he took So Much Advantage of me and of your Beautiful First Lady, which is a problem, and we used to never have problems when I was in charge. don't forget, Low Gas Prices, Incredible Economy, Record High Stock Market, and then it all came Crashing Down, Sleepy Joe killed it, he killed our Beautiful Country. and I heard the other day the UN isn't letting us in anymore, not letting us in. we went from Total Respect under Trump to Less Than Nothing under Sleepy Joe. that's what you get when you vote Democrat, nothing but Bankruptcy and Pain. ok, enjoy yourselves.
