In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Absolutely. And wether itâ€™s intentional or not, Trump going off the deep end recently just makes DeSantis look EVEN MORE appealing to those swing votes. Ron will look moderate in comparison.

Semi-elective neo-fuedal corporate duopoly, more accurately. The whole voting system doesn't matter when we have a shadow counsel (electoral college) that can choose who they want over the people, considering that the members of the college are secret, I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in the electoral college is a multimillionaire or billionaire. The first step to actually having a democratic system would be by abolishing the electoral college, it's impossible to have more than two parties with it in place.
Floridian here. DeSantis could be this country's Hitler. Voted into office on a wave of popularism to expand American freedom (no COVID restrictions, abortion bans, and stripping voting rights) while fighting woke liberal pedos (LBTQ community) banning CRT so he can control what's on your school library.
