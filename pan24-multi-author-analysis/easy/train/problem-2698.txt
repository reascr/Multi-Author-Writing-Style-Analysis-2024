If you or I filed this lawsuit alleging that the election results in Maricopa were unreliable on the basis of "just cuz", that would be thrown out as groundless because we have no standing and are providing no basis for our claim. Lake was a candidate and her basis for her claim were some errors made in vote counting in Maricopa that did actually happen. And that's enough to proceed to the next level of proving your case, which was Lake trying to show that these errors were severe enough to throw the results in Maricopa into question. And that she couldn't do.
Arizona taxpayers foot the bill for a claim that, as expected was false, Texas taxpayers foot the bill for an unreliable power grid and Florida pays for theatrical politics in the form of immigrant plane rides (from another state mind you) and is now the proud owner of a screeching orange imbecile.
And that's all. Your problem is that you think "documented errors in vote counting" is too broad to be a basis for an election challenge and you want the judge to consider political statements to show that Lake's use of this basis isn't genuine because she was always going to challenge the election. But obviously, you can't use someone's free speech to penalize them by invalidating a justified basis for a claim. Her speech can be considered in potentially a libel suit filed by officials she maligned with her accusations.
