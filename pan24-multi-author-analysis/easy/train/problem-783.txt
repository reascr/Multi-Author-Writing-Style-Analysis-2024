I get the sensation that every alphabet agency has a press release at the ready, stating, "we had plans to charge Donald Trump with X, Y, and Z crimes and had all the evidence in the world to do it, and we were totally going to issue the charges this month, but he's dead now so oh well," and they'll use his death to sweep all of it under the rug rather than confront the game of proscutorial musical chairs/hot potato they've found themselves in.
I want to believe that still, but I canâ€™t. I was doing that same kind of thinking coming up to the 2016 election - looking at case studies and stuff from the past that could give some informed observations that could suggest that Trump probably win. Then, Trump won in 2016, and the shocks have continued unendingly since then.
Exactly. He's mentioned in a ton of rap songs, he was in Home Alone 2, he's the icon of a rich white guy. Sure, there are other guys who are as rich or richer but the average voter has never heard of Richard Uihlein but they damn sure have heard Nelly's Country Grammer ("Bill Gates, Donald Trump let me in now, I got money to give my friends now!").
