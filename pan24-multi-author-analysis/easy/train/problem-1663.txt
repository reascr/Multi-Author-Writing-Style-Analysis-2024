The 24' elections are already lost by focusing on gun control, Democrats needed rural Democrats to win and they lost them by pushing unpopular legislation.
Democrats need rural Democrats in order to win elections, the only reason Democrats won in 2020 was because of Republicans failures and the country being sick of Trump...No one voted because they were excited about the Democratic platform. The same was true for 2022, voters came out to the polls to protect their civil rights due to a fear that the Supreme Court would take even more rights from them. Voters did not reach the polls on the strenh of the Democratic leadership, but again due to Republican corruption, failure and influence in the Supreme Court.
Then you have Moore vs Harper where the Supreme Court is going to rule in favor of independent state legislature theory...Where state legislatures can ignore voters, the state courts and their own state constitutions and hand pick electors to throw the election outcome.
