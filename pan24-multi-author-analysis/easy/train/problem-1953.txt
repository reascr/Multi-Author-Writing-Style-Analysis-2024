I really hate to point something out but the reason why the NHL is trying to do this is because the NHL is trying to open up a new market. NHL is already considered to be a really white sport. How are you going to get some asian kid to sign up for the sport when all they see is white people? You don't think that if you open up the Asian demographic, that's a lot more people who are going to go into the game? You figure that out, it's a lot of extra profit year over year.
“Discrimination of any sort is not welcome in the state of Florida, and we do not abide by the woke notion that discrimination should be overlooked if applied in a politically popular manner or against a politically unpopular demographic,” the DeSantis spokesman said.
You look at hollywood, that's exactly what happened. Crazy Rich Asians came out. People realized that the demographic they joked were all doctors and engineers apparently had money. And now they're making more media oriented towards Asian Americans in general.
