Lastly, Roe V. Wade was poorly argued and was going to fall at some point due to it. Myself and Ruth Bader Ginsberg agreed.
Two amendments to the Constitution already covered it: the 10th Amendment is the catch-all for anything that isn’t already a law (in other words, why it’s legal for you to scratch your ass without any law giving you explicit permission), and the 9th Amendment says no new power of government (like the power to decide what a person does with her own body) can come at the expense of existing rights (like the obvious right to control one’s own body).
I.E. His only outrage is they didn't gaslight on the issue of new anti-abortion laws prior to the midterms.
He's only mad they didn't downplay it and avoid passing anti-abortion legislation BEFORE the midterm. He said so much back in June, publicly praising Roe's repeal while privately (but still reported on) saying they needed to downplay the issue for the midterms.
indirectly? hell no. he chose those SC judges specifically because of their stances on roe v. wade. they lied in their senate hearings, like we all expected them to.
