And we still have no clue why we have the meteoric rise in autoimmune issues and diabetes in our population. Surely, it not what we are eating. Itâ€™s only designed to destroy the digestive systems of the insects.
Bayer/Monsanto, BASF, Chemchina, etc. big agribusiness model is to patent seeds, sell them with the promise of higher yields, and then legally block farmers from harvesting their own seeds in subsequent years, locking them into predatory "seed rent" from year to year. This is a form of colonialism, where advanced science is used to push business models that put local farmers into debt, with many eventually losing their farms. This has already happened in the US, and agribusinesses are pushing hard to spread this model around the world. This is dangerous also because it decimates the genetic diversity of seeds: one blight can wipe out a monocrop, causing famine, as has happened many times before. Furthermore, the promise of higher yields are not proven, and chemical pesticides necessary when monocropping agribusiness seeds are used are proven to be bad for the overall environment, and bad for human health. Glyphosate (Roundup) must be used alongside Monsanto's soybean seeds, and it is proven to disrupt bees, and WHO scientists have clear evidence linking it to human cancer (the US EPA claims "not likely" but with Monsanto lobbying efforts clearly at play here).
