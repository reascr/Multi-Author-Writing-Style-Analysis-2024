Barroso, who attended COP27 United Nations climate talks in Egypt in November, proposed that Brazil gather "the best minds in the world" to discuss how to develop a "bioeconomy" for the Amazon to stop the degradation of the region.
Justice Luis Roberto Barroso proposed that environmental experts, investors and local authorities come together to brainstorm on how to foster sustainable development that would preserve the Amazon rainforest, the world's largest, and help the livelihood of the 25 million people who live there.
Does that really make sense? Seems like a pretty low chance they all share the same exact views like that.
Brazil's outgoing president Bolsonaro has criticized foreign environmentalists and non-governmental organizations for impinging on Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon.
It will never happen. Brazil has no interest in negotiating away any inch of the Amazon. Such a scenario can only happen by invading Brazil, which would result in guerrilla warfare in the forest as brazil's armed forces stage their last stand.
