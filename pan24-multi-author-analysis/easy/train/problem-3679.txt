Yeah CSTO abandoning Armenia to Azerbaijan did more damage to the alliance than Russia invading Ukraine. It’s basically dead at this point. The really tipping point will be when Kazakhstan leaves.
Precisely. If the defenders simply refuse to leave and insist on fighting it out then the attackers are forced to go room by room and clear an entire city meanwhile tall concrete buildings are perfect structures to ambush attackers. An attacker can choose to essentially level a city with artillery or airstrikes but that’s also not really a solution because then the attacker simply converts buildings into an endless maze of rubble and debris which is potentially even harder to capture than a series of free standing buildings. This is a process that takes months to play out which means the world has plenty of time to react as well.
Exactly. A weaker Russia by definition requires Iran to seek security elsewhere and in this case means moving closer to the west geopolitically. If Iran could ever convince Saudi Arabia to tone down the Shia/Sunni divide then they would be natural allies. As oil becomes less important I think that middle eastern/Islamic unity is inevitable.
