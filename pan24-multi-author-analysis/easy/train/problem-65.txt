Thing is, what there doing is completely misguided. They have zero impact. They are hurting global heritage as a ploy for attention like spoiled bratty children. Ever talked to some of these idiots? I have, and they are sjw white night wannabe morons. No thought beyond today just like all the ass holes on tictok and insta. Its a pick me i am special vibe that needs to go. Try going into politics instead… oh you cant because your an idiot. Real people ARE doing the right thing, just look into it. Give these asshole wannabe morons what they deserve. Jail.
I just don’t understand why they keep on doing these performances considering how everybody is already freaked out in Europe after the drought and extreme temperatures of this summer, and now this incredibly warm October. We are already bracing for future droughts and anticipating catastrophe scenarii in the immediate future (2-3 years), you just need to open any European newspaper or European Reddit sub to see that people are worried. Honestly, I think these little stunts are now more diverting media attention from the climate change/decarbonation plan/energy saving plan discussions that were already happening, than they are triggering any new discussion or action regarding climate change.
