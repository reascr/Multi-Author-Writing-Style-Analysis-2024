The region of Southern China/Northern India/large parts of northern Southeast Asia, technically known as the Southeast Asian Massif but famously named Zomia by Willem Van Schendel and James C. Scott, is considered one of the least governable regions on Earth. Mountainous terrain combined with a tropical/subtropical climate and high incidence of diseases such as malaria made it very difficult for states of any kind to effectively rule this region. For most of modern history, the Massif was dominated by a coterie of very ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of people, who often lived in smaller tribes and communities. Because of how hard this area was to govern, many bandits and rebels in China (and other states) would flee to this region and use it as a staging ground to either launch a war or simply raid nearby settlements. As such, many Chinese Empires saw controlling this region as vital to their own internal stability. Additionally, this region also had a large number of copper and salt mines, both very lucrative resources in Chinese Imperial history (copper was used as the most common form of currency, and salt was a vital resource in the preservation of meats).
You may have misuderstood me. Innocent people can still get provided with wrong information. Information doesn't care about who you love. If the information is factual, it should be verified with facts and real data first, not hearsay. So, being critical is a basic way to reduce and avoid misinformation. Science and current reality encourages people not to believe but to always verify information.
