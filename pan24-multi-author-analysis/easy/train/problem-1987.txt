I think it’s worse. It’s not even that he doesn’t care, but it’s what he actively wants. Imo he’s trying to provoke other states into not accepting Florida students so that he can get points for “standing up for students” and blame other states for not allowing other kids to have a future. Realistically, trapping kids in Florida by not giving them education opportunities elsewhere is punishing them for things they didn’t vote for, and had no say in. Desantis can and probably will play into that and tell everyone while he’s running for President that “those liberal states don’t want our kids to have good educations, look what happened in Florida, they won’t let our kids into their colleges anymore… they’re punishing them for having an anti-woke education.”.
