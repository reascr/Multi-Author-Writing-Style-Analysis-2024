Scream and cry enough about how conservative voices are being oppressed and you end up with some asshole savior coming in to free you from... what was really just consequences of your own misbehavior. Which is really the point I think. Conservatives want special treatment, they always have... and the reality is that they most often get it which I think might be why so many in America lean right, because ultimately they believe they are special and deserve special treatment. They (on the right especially) are the petulent entitled child who never got consequences therefore got to do anything they wanted and when consequences actually get applied to them they scream bloody murder because they don't know how to handle it as it is largely new to them.
I agree. Musk claims of free speech gives him the appearance of defending the US Constitution. It's a facade. If Twitter is going to succeed, it will require moderation. That will step on people's free speech. Otherwise, where is he putting the porn.
