We are ready to get pregnant now, but I’m so scared shitless, honestly. We have a “Colorado vacation” fund set aside and my obgyn is fully onboard with early genetic testing and continual monitoring for potential serious medical risks that may develop and require the immediate need for a quick trip to visit friends in Colorado Springs. I am painfully aware that this is NOT a solution for the current mess that every woman in Texas is facing right now, but it’s our dumb little plan and it’s just- goddamnit it’s so fucking scary to know that if I have a medical emergency, I can’t get immediate assistance to prevent my death or mercifully end the suffering of a potential fetus with life-threatening medical conditions. I’m sorry, now I’m just back to panic ranting again.

Mifepristone IS an abortificant. It removes the implanted trophoblast that attaches the fetus to the uterus and causes cervical contractions (blocking progesterone which keeps the fetus attached to the uterine wall).
