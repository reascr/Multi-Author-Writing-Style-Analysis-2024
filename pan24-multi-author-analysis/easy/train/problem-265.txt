Japan has continuously reevaluated what Article 9 really means. Originally renouncing their sovereign right to belligerency by not having a war capable force, it has since been reinterpreted and bent to create the Japanese Self Defense Force under the idea that repelling assailants is not belligerency and later the deployment of the SDF to aid allied countries abroad in non-combat operations, though they are allowed to engage in combat if fired upon during these operations. Somewhat recently they have also begun expanding their “navy” under the guise of coast guard and rescue vessels that while not war capable, could become so very quickly, most notably helicopter carriers that are most definitely not aircraft carriers and could not be converted to ones. Nope, not at all.
The permenant 5 of the security Council was basically implemented to cement both Western Liberal democratic influence, and the influence of "communist" (these days authoritarian) influence over the world but also to tie those countries into the UN. The USSR tried to withdraw from the UN and found it an awful misstep as the west then did a bunch of stuff with the "backing" of the international community.
