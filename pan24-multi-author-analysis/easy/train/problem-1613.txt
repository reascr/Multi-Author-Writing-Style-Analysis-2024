There's obviously good arguments against this reading, with Jackson's argument being among them. But that's the Crux of the theory.
They can strip the governor of some powers not enumerated in the state constitution (and even that only by passing a law signed by the governor—in the cases where it’s happened it’s been by an outgoing republican governor—or by overriding a veto), but if the constitution provides for a gubernatorial veto, then they can’t strip the governor of that power.
Always those two fucks. If the Court rejects this, I honestly see them as voting to unanimously reject it -- being on record for supporting this is clear and strong evidence for a lack of constitutional knowledge and judgment, and reason for impeachment.
Yup. It'd also be an absolute nightmare in terms of actually running elections. Because even if ISL is accepted as the correct theory, it only applies to federal elections. Which means that federal and state elections could, and very possibly would, be operated by different rules.
