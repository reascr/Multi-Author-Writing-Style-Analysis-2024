Oh there is plenty of security at the front door. But the metal detectors in front of the House chamber were added by prerogative of political leadership that expired when the new Congress was gaveled in on January 3 at noon. And look, . The efficiency is actually admirable.
Who gave the order to have them removed? No business can be conducted until a Speaker is sworn in. Removing them literally is business and couldnâ€™t be done unilaterally by security.
They are exactly the same. Pelosi's Speakership, the metal detectors and a lot of other features of the House are temporary parts of the House, authorized by the 117th Congress/authority of the Speaker, that would have to be reauthorized by the 118th. When the terms change, the House staff has to return the House to its default state. Lol.
On May 22, 1856, Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina entered the Senate Chamber and repeatedly struck Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts over the head with a cane.
It doesn't. Breach of peace is pretty specific, if they aren't actively causing a scene and preventing normal business they aren't breaching the peace. Simply possessing something won't count even if it causes a scene.
