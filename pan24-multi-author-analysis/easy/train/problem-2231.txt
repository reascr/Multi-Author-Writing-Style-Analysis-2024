This is the same principle by which retirement planning works. You plug in what today's dollars would look like as a safe withdrawal rate and then multiply that by 25. Maybe a little more if you want a higher chance of it not getting wiped out by long lasting economic downturns. Regardless, if planning properly and not squandered, 600M is a sum not only you but your descendants could easily live on for perpetuity accounting for growth as the principal amount sits invested.
Definitely. A million or two makes sense to invest a good amount to get long term wealth with the way inflation and housing prices rise over years. A billion dollars is just disappear some where and start your own island kingdom or something. A million seconds is 11 days, a billion is 34 years. It's truly so unimaginable that people think they'd need to invest to some how make it grow and not "run out" of a billion dollars.
