I went to school and was good mates with one of the slain officers, he was such a good bloke and kind soul, this is bloody heartbreaking and i feel so horrible for his siblings and family he was a triplet and was meant to come home to brisbane for christmas yesterday, i cant believe his life was cut short in such a horrible dispicable and meaningless act of violence by these conspiracy theorist nutjobs, no one deserves to lose their life while just trying to do their job.
