That happened here in Canada with our school support staff (everyone but the teachers), they went on strike and the government legislated them back to work using some law to force a deal and limits wage increases. The union told them to get bent and said they are striking anyways even if they faced fines. Other unions across the country stood up and supported them and the government ended up having to walk back the deal that they forced through. I mean what was the government going to do fine and arrest 50k workers ? The power is with the people we just need to start realizing it.
I actually really enjoyed the Belgian motorway system however. Was very efficient and effective. Thought it was better than the autobahn at least.
Instead, there is a cyclical "lack of nurses and teachers crisis" every 5 or so years and they throw some money at higher education to lower the requirements educate more fresh blue eye optimists who want to help people, and make it easier to get certified to work in healthcare with education from dubious institutions in low cost countries so it is easier to import workers with a higher treshold for calling foul on bad working conditions.
It was 100% peaceful. This was not a rainbow protest or Abortion protest the ends in extreme violence. Just mom’s and dad’s protesting for a better Canada. Then the clown in Ottawa unleashes the dogs of war on them. And I do mean a clown he wears face paint and everything.
Keep in mind that schools and especially hospitals are essential public services, shutting schools down is inconvenient but some teary-eyed politician always comes dragging with "think of the children I have lost access to storage for, and I really don't have time to watch them if I want to get some work done before sociaty collapses". So they put an end to the strikes pretty quickly..
