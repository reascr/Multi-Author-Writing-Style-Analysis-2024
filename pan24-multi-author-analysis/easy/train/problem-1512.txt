Back when the whole Hillary classified info email scandals were cropping up, I found it notable how nobody at all - not the left or the right or the media organizations thereof - thought it worth pointing out that the incident revealed a massive deficit in our government's ability to handle classified info. Not just the fact that Clinton and some of her people were to cavalier about sending classified-level info via regular email, and not just the fact that the entire state department from top to bottom seemed lax about it and always had, but that none of our intelligence / counterintelligence agencies had discovered these oversights OR that there seemed to be no ongoing process or inspectors general anyway to ensure compliance with classified material policies.
They changed the title. I think what happened is that they had another news story about the 1st documents, that came out just as the new ones were uncovered, and so they just updated the story with the same link. As you can see it was "updated.".

That’s not going to happen because it’s rare that individuals specifically intentionally remove classified info knowingly. The vast majority of the time it is simple negligence. And no it’s not a good idea to prosecute negligence like espionage.
