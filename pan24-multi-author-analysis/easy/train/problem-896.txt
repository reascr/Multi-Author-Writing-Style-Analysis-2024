I will honestly believe anything when it comes to gold. If you look at historical excavation sites in Bulgaria they'll say they found solid gold xyz artifacts. If you read about how much gold is used in iPhones (let alone computing components in general) there's another number. There are documented records describing the amount of gold mined in Mali and distributed on Mansa Musa's hajj. The Romans paid so many pounds of gold to foreign barbarians over the years that there is supposedly more in the steppe than the rest of the world combined. Every other year theres a new hoard of Arabian coins found in a Viking trove. Best Buy still sells monster cables. All the gold we ever extracted from the earth fits in a couple swimming pools, yet I have seen pictures of Fort Knox and Scrooge McDuck's swimming pool.
Croatian. The Ustasha did a little genocide on the Serbs in WW2 and again expelled around 250,000 out of Dalmatia in 95. Serbs did a lot of bad shit in the 90s, but so did the Bosnjaks, Albanians, etc. Atrocities were committed by all sides. There is no good guy in the balkans.
