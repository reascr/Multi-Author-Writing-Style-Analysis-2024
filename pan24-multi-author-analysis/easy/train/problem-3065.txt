Botched the Afghanistan withdrawal, 40 year high inflation, gas prices and grocery prices through the roof, a "come on in" policy with illegal immigrants at the border (almost 3 million illegal crossings so far just this year alone), refusing to solve the energy crisis, blaming oil companies that have their hands tied by his administration and telling Americans these are "Transition pains" as he forces unafordable and sub par electric vehicles down Americans throats, tanking stock market, billions being poured into Ukraine but still not providing the means to end the war quickly, I could go on. His tenure has been a policy shit show. I voted for him because I wanted a return to normalcy with a moderate that at least wouldn't do worse to the country than Trump.. Biden basically said "hold my beer". There's a reason midterm candidates didn't want him campaigning with them and why 75% of Americans say the country is heading in the wrong direction.
