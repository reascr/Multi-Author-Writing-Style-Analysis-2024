If the Dems lose its bc the centrists made it so. And equating the two as equally guilty is a bit shit. Again, you’re escaping that for the last forty fucking years centrist dems have been pushing rhetoric over and over again that legitimizes republican talking points, crime wave chief among them.
It’s almost like using tough on crime rhetoric for the last thirty/forty years has primed democratic voters to believe republican talking points so that when you have to choose between tough on crime candidates these voters will always choose the one who is tougher, which will always be a republican. Instead of spending years educating voters on what we know (more police does not mean lower crime, higher rates of use of force by police directly correlates to higher rates of crime, and crime isn’t reduced by strenhening the justice system but rather addressing the conditions that led people to commit crimes in the first place), you spent year after year legitimatizing the bullshit talking points that helps the GOP win.
As a centrist, this is wrong. Also democrats need to stop the narrative that a centrist or third party vote “is a vote for a republican.” By that logic it’s also a vote for a democrat or leftist. Nobody votes three times.
