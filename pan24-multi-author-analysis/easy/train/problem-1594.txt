Realistically the fragments of the government of the Soviet Union that consolidated into the Russian government as we know it today should have been purged while the region was in turmoil. There was an opportunity for the western world to intervene then that we failed to take. It sounds terrible and like a massive overreach of powers but realistically this all could have been predicted. When the Soviet Union collapsed the same groups of people maintained power just under different figureheads. Until the old guard leadership is gone nothing will change in Russia.
