More graphic details about Russian forces torturing Ukrainian children (the graphic part is in spoiler tags just so people have one last chance before deciding to read about one horrible and graphic incident described at the press conference):
No. Svatove. Russia counter attacked with 7 battalions. 2 of them were mobiks, 2 territorial defense from Luhansk. In chaos they forgot about those two mobiks battalions and lost coordination of the attack. Tank elements of Luhansk were reduced to 15 for both battalions, regular military units were left with 12-13 each. The third regular unit was used as fire support and artillery cover with it's 7 tanks (reports are saying that all of them were somehow damaged hence the guard duty). All three regular battalions were part of 119th regiment.
Really interesting. Sounds like NATO/USA is currently the last hurdle. This was announced awhile ago and then didn't happen as they want USA to take the jets and provide them to Ukraine rather than providing them directly.
