Staged may not be exactly the right word but everyone does kinda have a general script theyre following. Thr people show up to say their piece, the police show up let them say their piece and make sure nobody causes actual trouble, usually theres a healthy level of communication between both sides, maybe some people get detained and taken off but usually they arent gonna spend any time in a cell theyre just gonna be taken to a station told "heres your fine" and released, everyone goes home at the end of the day. Its not staged to the point of everything being exactly planned but everyone generally knows what the game is and as long as nobody decides to be a dumbass and try to actually start shit, nobodys particularly worried on either side.
You'd be surprised. I a man in my 40's and seeing work associates in their 50's and 60's getting so worked up over Greta is just fucking weird. I feel like the whole world has gone crazy since social media took off.
I actively discourage giving attention to someone who does nothing for the environment and I highly encourage to look for alternatives that are actually meaningful and supporting organizations that actually look for solutions for the environment.
