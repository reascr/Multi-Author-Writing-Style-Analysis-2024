I see your point, however, I'm talking professionalism. With all respect, it's not a matter of dispute, it's how one identifies credible news. I know this, I've spent decades devoted to this. If there is bias, a reputable journalist will (without bias) explain all points of view in (again) a non-biased way. It's difficult to do, journalists spend years honing this craft. If it's news - who what where when why and sometimes how, it is not bias. Also, you must bring into account author integrity. If it's a kooky provocateur throwing out bias, that's not credible news, it's opinion, it's editorial, it's not news. I'm talking nuts and bolts here, the kind of stuff that gets one nominated for the pulitzer prize, not junk . I'm talking the kind of sources that you can add to a bibliography when performing professional research. Bias is not inherently bad, not at all. It belongs on the editorial page. However, reputable sources always show both points of view without bias when it is imperative to the value of the story.
