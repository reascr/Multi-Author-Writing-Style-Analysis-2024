Funny story, I was locked up in Orange County Jail from August of 2010 until February of 2011 and actually saw the guy a couple times. I was a worker for the last few months I was there and one of the jobs you do is feeding the PCs (protective Custody) and the people who are too dangerous for general population. I was on single cell duties (PCs & dangerous inmates get 1 man cells) and I got to feed him his meals for about a week, or more accurately I stared at him in the eyes while I put his tray under the bars. I was explicitly warned by another inmate not to talk to him at all. If I hadn't been a huge Austin powers fan at a young age I likely wouldn't have even recognized him. It took damn near all of my 19 year old self restraint to not say "who throws a shoe, honestly?" But the fact that he was in for murder, and I know the cops sometimes let inmates fight made me hold my tongue.
Debatable. Just because missiles are more widely manufactured than nuclear warheads is as much a matter of global politics as anything else. The Iran nuclear deal limited their capacity for nuclear warheads, not missile development. And both missiles and nuclear weapons are the result of WW2 development.
