But a squad or sappers will guarantee results and guarantee not hitting own troops. So they are either shelling far enough that it's not the plant, or it's not them doing the shelling?
So they are either shelling close to the plant, shelling themselves or are not the ones shelling. But all of these news stories insist they are at the plant and shelling the plant. And that just doesn't make sense.
Since NATO didn’t want implement no-fly-zone over Ukraine, bc they didn’t want to escalate the situation, I think Russia escalated the situation to the next level, nuclear level Now is the time to implement no fly zone by NATO for the safety of NATO NATIONS, it is a legitimate reasons to protect Europe and send signal to any other stone head dictator who wants to shape the world with his delusional mind.
Yeah. Even though it's a simple, logical explanation, I guess it makes more sense that it's the Russians hitting themselves, severing their own power supply and threatening their own existence just to diss at Zelensky.
