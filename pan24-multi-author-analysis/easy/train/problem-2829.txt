>"Save the children from the Russians’ villainy; if you are able to, leave the region. Let’s home after the liberation!" the National Resistance Center highlighted.
Yes. Do you understand that Russia never hand any animosity towards Ukraine? At least the years I am alive. You can bring up shit from 80 years ago, but I would argue that Russians and Ukrainians living in USSR lives in same cities, listened to the same music, read the same books, went to vacations in the same cities, watched the same movies, laughed at the same political jokes, had children that went to same school. Never in my life I heard anything derogatory or hateful towards Ukraine or Ukrainians. I’ve been to Ukraine many times. And never felt unwelcome. I was young, but nonetheless.
The obliteration of entire cities, rape as a war weapon, tacit threats of beginning world war three and extortion of entire continents through energy policy all taken together as a combined machinery as open war that risks global starvation and calamity are significant factors in recognizing this as a planetary moment of disaster. This is on a completely different scale of hideous.
It is difficult because you have to properly estimate Russian capabilities which were grossly overestimated, and you have to estimate likelihood of actually escalating to nuclear weapons, incredibly unlikely. Both because they are still rational actors and they understand the consequences and there are other countries than America and Russia that have interests involved. If this was escalates more namely China who absolutely will not allow this to escalate to nuclear weapons if they can have a say in it. As well as India and many other nations. Understand that the next step of escalation greatly negatively affects them.
