This is the part that a lot of the "peace at any cost" folks fail to realize... if we enable Putin now, we aren't only giving Putin the greenlight to make more aggressive actions in the future...we've giving DOZENS of authoritarian lunatics the greenlight to use land-grabs and nuclear threats to gain an upper hand in negotiations or simply invade territory...
Exactly. We dont need to look to the 1930s. Putin has been in power for so long we can literally use his entire record as evidence of what doing nothing gets us.
Seriously. It's harder to find a conflict with a more clear divide between good and evil. Hell, even WW2, between Germany and the USSR was one evil dictator fighting a war against another evil dictator. In this conflict, we have literal evil empire on the march, trying to squash the freedom of an innocent people who bore no threat to them whatsoever. Ukraine did not start this conflict. Ukraine wasn't amassing troops on the border, plotting a dash towards Moscow.
Exactly. “Quit arming Ukraine and make them negotiate with Russia” isn’t a anti imperialist or pro peace stance. It’s a viewpoint that legitimizes war. An anti imperialist stance would be a view that seeks to discourage and punish nations for waging imperialist wars of aggression.
Exactly. It's classic imperialism. And the worse thing is, with every territory they invade, the stronger they get.
With every invasion they grow that much stronger. The longer you put off the fight, the harder the fight will eventually be.
