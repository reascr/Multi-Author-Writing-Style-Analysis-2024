Actually the universe is horrible and we’re just realistic. These morons just bargained themselves out of a job. Robo baristas are like 6 months away at this point. Maybe they’ll qualify for unemployment and wont starve but they sure as hell aren’t going to turn a Starbucks job into a living wage career. I’m all for workers rights but are you willing to pay $12 for a coffee? Cause that’s what gonna happen. Starbucks is a publicly traded company and the they can’t show decreased profits let alone losses. Want a living wage? Find a better career, that may seem cold but so is reality. I’m sure you think I’m horrid and maybe I proved your entire point but I know I’m right about this. corporations are inherently heartless and you shouldn’t be begging them to give you a better life. If you want a better life go build it, that’s what America is all about.
The average voter has statistically zero impact on what Congress does, because the US is on oligarchy/plutocracy/kleptocracy with pseudo-democratic features to legitimize its systems of mass human enslavement, abuse, and exploitation.
Agreed. Cooperation is a key tool in competition with others and life..all life is in competition. That’s been a key scientific model for well over a century. It’d be pretty big news of TToE was proven wrong.
