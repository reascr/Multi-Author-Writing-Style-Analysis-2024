Then again, I wouldn't underestimate any Republican from now on. I was sure that Trump had zero chance of actually being elected in 2016 and we all know how that turned out. Until the results are in after the 2024 election and say that the Democratic candidate won, I'm not going to count the Republican out. Even then, given the Republicans' penchant for challenging election results because "it's fraud if I don't like the outcome," I might not fully rest easy until inauguration day 2025.
Typical conservative playbook. There always has to be an out-group they can blame for things. It's not acceptable to blame Jewish, Black, Hispanic, or even gay people any more, so they've moved on to trans folks. Eventually they probably won't be able to blame them any more either so they'll move on to someone else, but the important thing is that there is always someone to hate and blame for their problems.
