Ken Burn’s The Vietnam War on Netflix is a good documentary about the subject. They covered both sides and has interview with both North and South Vietnamese served during the war. The docu provided overall fair assessment over the conflict in Nam as well as its impact in US’s politics and society. Not very long and easy to follow.
Also imagine being so brainwashed to be indifferent to the suffering of others that you're like "dude someone said [insert terrible crime against himanity America committed] already, find a new insult" as if I'm personally attacking American people (and you, by extension) instead of just pointing out that this shit happened and its fucked up that people like you act as if it didnt.
That sounds great. Pls keep me updated if you find anything cool. The story was the report made by OSS in the book I mentioned above. It was a genius way to unify all the political forces at that time.
National liberation movement? It was one side in a civil war, supported by the traditional colonizer.
