For anyone born into Gen X or later, this threat doesn't even elicit a yawn. We've lived in the shadow of mutually assured destruction our entire lives. Oh, you're going to destroy the world, Putsky? How fun for you. Let me know when you've got a firm schedule. I've got a series I'm trying to finish on Netflix.
In order to get that close to the shore to detonate it, you're going to have to avoid it being intercepted, Russia has made fantastic claims (again, what a shocker) about the speed of the thing, but I think we can take the idea of it traveling at 100kts as being complete rubbish, or if it does then it's going to be as quiet as a heavy metal band doing an epic drum solo, the Pentagon estimates that the maximum speed will be around 56 knots. They will be carried on board four specially made submarines of the Khabarovsk class, so all the NATO navies would need to do is follow these submarines at all times, and if they look like they're about to launch a Status-6 torpedo, sink them immediately. There are options, however, for the weapon to be dropped at sea in containers and then launched at a later date, although that would require a lot of things to work perfectly and recent events have shown us that Russian weaponry reliability is...sporadic at best.
So, basically, unless you live right on a beach, and Russia suddenly displays a level of ability that it has spent nearly the last year demonstrating a lack of, then you're not likely to be in any danger from this weapon.
