Every day we find more evidence that early man was a lot more coordinated and intelligent than we typically give them credit for. This is a great discovery.
It’s not impossible that a similar “proto-city” existed even earlier, since the spread of agriculture was a gradual and patchy process, so a population that developed agriculture and sedentary lifestyles early on could create a large settlement while most of the rest of the world was still building small clusters of huts or trying to figure out how to grow crops in the first place. Of course, such a “city” would likely have been made out of timber and reeds and other materials that leave fewer traces than the clay and mud structures of Catalhoyuk, and its size/scope would still be limited by the archeological record- anything past a certain threshold is going to leave telltale signs (especially in the prehistoric era) so something like a network of multiple settlements totaling tens of thousands of people definitely would have been noticed by now. On the other end you’ve also got the ice age which inherently limits how large/organized a pre-industrial community would be able to become, meaning that there’s actually some pretty heavy constraints on what kind of “lost societies” could have potentially existed. They can’t exist too early because of the ice age and lack of an agricultural revolution, they can’t exist too late or they just become normal contemporaries of well-known early civilizations, and they can’t be too big because they would leave too much evidence to have remained “lost” for so long.
I am a living creature in this universe. I test reality by using my senses and examining the results of those who have also tested claims of the supernatural, who by its own definition, exists outside what is natural, or "real".
