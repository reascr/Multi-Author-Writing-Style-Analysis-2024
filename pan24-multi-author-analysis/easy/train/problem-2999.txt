Indonesia is not Iran. There are plenty of gays in Indonesia. There is no law against homosexuality and there are plenty of Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu communities there.
Exactly. Because you know the men wouldn't have sex if it weren't for those naughty women flaunting their skin in front of them. Clearly the woman's fault!
Exactly. This is designed to hurt women, homosexuals, and political opponents. Basically a law that they know everyone will break but they can selectively enforce it to target the groups they want to.
And homosexuals. Seems like the compliant needs to be filed by the family or the spouse. Crazy this shit still happens in 2022â€¦.
Furthermore, you are stretching the definitions of governmental types disingenuously beyond credulity. Different government categories are named by who has ultimate decision-making power. Influence alone does not constitute a government.
Again, influence does not count as government. In any government, the people without direct power are indirectly or directly trying to influence the decides. This is true in any government and it's true in a democracy. The people with the ultimate power to decide are constantly being influenced by competing forces: corporations, religions, politicians, etc. As long as the people are the ones voting and the votes are free, fair, and uncorrupted, it's still a democracy.
