Like, the fuck? If the troops were going to join the "protestors" they would have. The local police were tied down elsewhere, the Park Police were pinned down by "protestors" at the various national monuments, and the Capitol Police were overwhelmed already. No one could have pretended to resist them if the soldiers were ready to overthrow Congress. They weren't. They were there to restore order and they did. If Pelosi was hanging from the gallows they built out front of the Capital they still would have been there to restore order. If Trump tried to order them to depose Congress, well, they would have restored order probably by accepting Congress Impeaching and Removing the Trump who killed his own VP (and was probably about to murder the lot of them) and overwhelming the handful of Secret Service officers in his detail.
