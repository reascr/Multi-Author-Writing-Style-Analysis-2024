I read — well started reading, at least — many threads in the past few days that, from the top comments with hundreds of upvotes, just immediately derailed into fevered anti-islamic hatred the likes of which I haven't seen since the peak of the alt-right brigades. And anyone who dared criticize the idea of piling on to any and all abuse against that "shithole" religion was pilloried as themselves being against free speech, instead of for common decency. We would generally see a few comments get through saying that maybe yes it was shitty to slag moslems like that but... hey, those backwards people chose to believe in a blood-cult sky fairy and obviously deserved every bit of abuse the mob, because fuck the political realities of Türkiye and Sweden, no it was really Islam's fault.
1. Should they stop it, show Swedish hypocrisy as they just let an infamous bigot do the aforementioned book burning in front of the Turkey embassy under the thin veneer of "protesting" (he's just being a racist) but are now suddenly stopping this guy from doing the same.
