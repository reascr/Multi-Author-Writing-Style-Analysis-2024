In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Absolutely. I'm just trying to understand your thinking as you could be right or see something I've missed.

This performative nonsense is infuriating. Banning words, like Florida once banned the term "climate change". Don't they have anything useful to do? No? Then why are we paying them? THIS is what the idea of laws has come to?
It's the we-have-to-find-reason-to-be-offended group striking again. Luckily this time, some common sense might prevail.
How's that for common sense? People of a certain decent are Latinos. Why do we need to constantly be making ever more idiotic terms for things that were perfectly fine before?
