Texas Election Code 43.007 says a District Court may order polls to stay open late if there is a problem at polling sites. The order is required to extend to the entire county. This law was passed by the Texas GOP in 2019 with reports that it was passed because election judges -- who are like school crossing guards in that they work a short amount of time, frequently in crappy conditions, for virtually no pay so they are little better than volunteers -- across an entire large county wouldn't be willing to comply with such an order and work extra hours so it would likely only be effective in small counties.
It is great how this article doesn't even answer this question. Either way, though, you should probably allow voting to continue for a single extra hour if people keep showing up. It's like if you are GameStop at a midnight release. Are you just going to tell the next group of customers that they are too late to buy a game on release day or are you going to stay open? Why wouldn't the government have that same view. "We're still here, come on in!".
