I also used to drive a truck, you are right. Trucks drive way to long and often to get fuled by electricity with the current available batteries. People seem to forget that they aren't busses that get put into depots every night. Battery tech isn't there yet and until it is, even thinking about replacing a whole fleet isn't an option, not even in 15 years from now on. It's a different story for caddies, sprinters and passenger cars, where a infrastructure can be build instead of gas stations. But a truck travels more in a year than most normal cars travel in their lifetime. Don't even want to imagine sitting in the middle of another country like sweden and calling my boss "hey boss, the battery seems to be undercharged and has taken some dmage. Don't have sun here, Solarcharger doesn't do more than 1% a day. Next replacement station is 500 km south of here. Can you send another truck and a forklift to replace it? Please hurry can't feel my feet any more".
First off all, depending on how your country generates electricity, they might not save the environment much in the long run, and that's especially true considering the ethics and problems with manufacturing lithium ion and lipo batteries.
lol...okay. So saying that a target date for a ban can be extended and technology improves over time is somehow the dunning-kruger effect? Has to be the stupidest comment I've read in some time. Feel free to elaborate, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say you won't.
