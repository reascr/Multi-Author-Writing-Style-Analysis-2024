In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly. There's plenty of reasons to hate Nestle but water volume isn't one of them. Yet every time I argue this people call me a corporate shill etc.
Absolutely. I did a paper in grad school about California's water problem and yes, the almonds! I love them of course, but it's completely out of control here in CA. The cattle thing is another thing hard to attack. I reduced my meat intake by about 2/3 many years ago. I still get to eat plenty of meat. But some folks lose their mind at the thought of just reducing their meat consumption by a little.

Republicans love capitalism until it negatively affects them... But they'll vote against the party willing to put in laws and restrictions against this kind of behavior.
