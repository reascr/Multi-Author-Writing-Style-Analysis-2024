- Xi thinks Canada represented by Trudeau is the little brother of the US and doesn't even deserve a seat at the table with China given the poor relations.
- Xi thinks that Trudeau probably took advantage of this unscripted meeting to make Trudeau seem more legitimate than he is (when Xi doesn't even want to give Trudeau time of day).
I don't think Xi is upset about the content of their initial conversation, but rather the circumstances and how Trudeau attempted to frame it into much more than it was. My two cents:
You know, China ain the only one that can use "geopolitics" as excuse, if shit hit the fan real hard and China is using their investments to fuck over Canada, Canada might very well decides to just nationalize these investments, especially if they are infrastructure like oil rigs.
Did we watch the same video? Trudeau came out of that exchange looking pretty bad. To be fair, he was ambushed by Xi. I bet he thought of all sorts of witty comebacks after the fact. The better reply would have been nothing. Such garbage doesn't deserve a response.
