Idk if thing have changed and I know it’s different for each state but when I use to be management at a grocery chain we could ask is your dog a service animal and then ask what service they provide and if it wasn’t for a disability like; visual impairment, hearing impairment, or something like for seizures we could ask them to leave because a therapy dog was different and not covered. We never really bothered people unless the dog didn’t behave, wasn’t on a leash, or god forbid they tried to like have it in the cart or in a purse or something because then it obviously wasn’t a properly trained service animal and I didn’t want to deal with some Karen bitching to me or the health issue of having a dog in a cart.
Yeah. My dad drives a bus and can't really press for info without getting into legal trouble. When someone tries to get on with a pet he can say "no pets allowed" and once they say "service animal" he just lets them on. It's less hassle, doesn't get the business or himself in legal trouble, but he can tell which ones are service dogs and which ones are people just lying to get their dog on the bus. The difference in training and behavior between the two is insurmountable.
Honestly. Having to deal with vomit, people taking their shoes off pressing the buttons on the bulkhead touch displays. picking their nose then passing you along the bag of peanuts, farting, random acts of phlegm....
