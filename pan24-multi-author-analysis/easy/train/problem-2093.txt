See, the thing is, you just need a proper Nepalese man to claim its totally OK and a part of his heritage, might have been stolen once before, but they got it back, he 10000000% is correct owner and is willing to give you a napkin stating so, and sell it trough him. Then the museums just eat it up.
anonymous in the sense that he doesn't want the general public to know his name and face (although people have a pretty good idea of who he actually is if you wanted to look it up, but most people don't actually care because they like the mystery, and finding out he's just a bloke ruins it somewhat). but he's not batman. the guy has made a movie and runs a business and has filed trademarks etc. people know who he is, it's just not common knowledge, just like how some people know you or i, but if you asked the general public they would just be confused by the question.
Absolutely not. You take that concrete block off, throw additional rebar and support on it, put it on an auction block and you could be looking at north of 10 million easily.
