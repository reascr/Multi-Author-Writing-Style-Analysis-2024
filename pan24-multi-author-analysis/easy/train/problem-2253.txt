I know I’ll get downvoted to hell for this, but we shouldn’t count out the possibility that this really isn’t Russia - it could very well be a Ukrainian anti-air system that went awry. Remember that video of a Russian anti-air missile being fired and then immediately turning back and hitting the ground? Ukraine is also largely using Soviet systems, after all.
Intentional or otherwise it’s completely unacceptable and absurd. You can’t just “accidentally” bomb a country and expect to be forgiven. The response against this should be very clear: the world will not tolerate immature and irresponsible military actions, especially which lead to the deaths of innocents. This should apply to Ukraine just as much as Russia.
Ukraine needs to be more responsible with their military. They’ve had far too many mistakes already and honestly this is becoming unacceptable. How can anyone expect us to support a country blowing up their peaceful neighbors? The fact they’re getting so many billions in funding and still haven’t made meaningful progress shows their “military” has no clue what they’re doing.
Possible ? Yes. And overworked operator that has to look at a 360p shitty as Black and White feed for 2 hours straight might just miss.
