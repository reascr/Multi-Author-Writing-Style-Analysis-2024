While the voters here are ultimately to blame for electing this guy, it's difficult to be an informed voter if the only information you have to go on is campaign websites, endorsements, stump speeches, and rallies. The end of local newspapers and news that covered local politics and held politicians accountable is a huge factor. This all would have come out prior to the election if that was still a thing, and he would have never been elected. I'm not saying we all need to go back to reading newspapers. Nothing has come in to fill the role that they once played, so we're going to see more and more of the Santos' of the country until something comes along that can scrutinize and hold these investigations up to public again. It's pretty tough though because any examination of anyone that identifies themselves as a republican or conservative, the right immediately and collectively writes it off as fake news and cancel culture. Both intellectually lazy btw.
They didn't miss it. Well before the election the Republican paper in his district called him a con man and worse. The Republicans knew and shrugged. National press was slow to pick it up. But locals knew. And didn't care.
