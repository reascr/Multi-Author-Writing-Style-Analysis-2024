In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Definitely an unexpectedly interesting race. I think she’s won but the democrat should stick this out to the very end. Mistakes happen. One double count of even a small batch of votes could change this thing completely. Very unlikely but worth a recount to be sure.
A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.
I don’t think the overseas ballots are going to change it much. Military tends to vote conservative. It may even move it out of automatic recount territory.
Regardless, Gerrymandering is an absolutely un-Democratic, horribly corrosive tool to systematically subvert elections and the will of the people. Two wrongs do NOT make a right.
