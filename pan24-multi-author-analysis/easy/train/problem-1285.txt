The problem is that the house and senate leadership actively fund, endorse, and promote incumbents, and bring tremendous financial resources to those incumbents. The problem is some of those incumbents lose to a primary challenger, who then goes on to win the general. And then what? Many of the legislators whose votes McCarthy needs are the people who just a few months ago, McCarthy fought tooth and nail to keep out of congress, and they’re pissed. They hold the keys and they know it, so he’s going to have to meet with each one of them individually and negotiate what they want in return for their vote. Some will demand pet project legislation, some will demand nicer offices or new furnishings, and some will want committee seats to which they would not normally be entitled. Then there’s a game-within-a-game… The best concessions will only go to the first ones to capitulate. Once he reaches 218, if you are 219 you are shot outta luck, so there’s a whole game of political chicken that has to play out.
