I do feel like Bernie has shifted the Dems slightly more left. Which is a good thing but that maybe came 8 years too late. The Dems had one window of opportunity during Obama's first term when he had the Congress and 60 Senate seats for 4 months. They should have passed Universal Healthcare and a whole host of progressive legislation that was popular at the time and still is. But sadly we got Obamacare a modest improvement on the healthcare system and not much else.
It’s not like Obama tried Universal Healthcare and settled for Obamacare. The Dems in 2009 were much more in the mold of the Clinton triangulation model and there wasn’t much of a progressive caucus. I think if that situation happened now Bernie would have torpedoed the thing if at worst there wasn’t a public option.
Exactly. It’s a sign to me that people who don’t know this OUT IN THE OPEN FOR EVERYONE TO SEE stuff are simply not paying attention and would rather “both sides” politics in a sad effort to make themselves appear more informed than they are. Or they are willing participants.
