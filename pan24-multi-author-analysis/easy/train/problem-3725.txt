I don’t. I’ve seen an insurrection and this wasn’t one. You can’t perform an insurrection unarmed against an armed force. And if you look you’ll see that nothing changed anyways. Look at Afghanistan for instance if you want to see how an insurrection is done. If you, as a democrat can ensure that you will protect my 2A rights to the fullest just like I served to protect peoples rights, and ensure that the lower middle class won’t pay more taxes then and only then would I ever think about being left leaning. I believe in everyone’s rights not just the ones I agree with. Which is why both parties are broken, they both want to take from you.

I am a Democrat, so I see a lot of the Republican talking points as contradictory to their stated ideals (the book banning controversy requires expanding the government to keep the ordinance in place, as do most of the culture wars solutions they propose, and historically Republicans tend to balloon the budget/deficit/debt and government, not shrink it) but a Republican may look at Democratic programs such as ACA and various regulatory agencies and say that they take away liberty by forcing people to get do things within a certain framework. Various non-discrimination policies may also force people to expose themselves or their children to concepts that they do not feel are morally acceptable, and that imposes on their religious/parental/ect. rights to control what they and their families are exposed to. Obviously I am biased towards democrats, but I think the point gets through well enough.
