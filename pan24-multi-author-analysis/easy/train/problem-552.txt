Liberals tend to see the world as a place where observable differences are superficial, rarely reflecting actual value (low Hierarchical world belief), cosmic purpose or intent (low Intentional world belief), deserved status (low Just world belief), or attention received (high Worth Exploring). Therefore, most hierarchies require reform (low Acceptable world belief). Fortunately, however, the world is getting better and change is taking us in the right direction (high Progressing world belief). Therefore, embracing change and rejecting inequality (the textbook definition of liberalism) is just common sense.”.
I, for one, love it. Monkeys Paw wish, but it comes with a free frogurt. He is a spineless, disgusting human being, and anyone remotely less narcissistic would not be able to look themselves in the mirror and also realize the “careful what you wish for” peril he is about to enter. Boehner was a career politician and it cracked him like an egg. Ryan got his tax bill passed for the Koch’s and promptly noped the fuck out. I hope he gets his wish.
