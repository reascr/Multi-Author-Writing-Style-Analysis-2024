See with that type of situation it’s more easy to shift the blame, though. A PM resigns here and there, a few names get dragged through the mud, but not often is someone’s legacy entirely destroyed. Literally all of the public pressure on Russia, both internationally and domestically, is on Putin.
No. No man rules alone. He doesn't collect taxes, police his people, enforce laws, run the military, handle elections, or run his intelligence agency or any of that. He controls the money and has key loyal supporters(the people who do those important jobs) who act in their own interest which at this time putin is their key to power. They also has constituents under them they need to keep happy to keep the position and power they have. As long as putin keeps them in power they're happy. If the king falls ill or somebody comes along offering a better slice of the pie the king gets replaced by someone more loyal to the key supporters needed to stay in power. Not for them to take the position of king but it's so they don't loose their position. Putin has been good at this balancing act of filling the pockets of people who matters but now that's being threatened.
