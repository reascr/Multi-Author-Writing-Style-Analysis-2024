Edit: Unfortunately thousands of buildings have collapsed, ten thousands are trapped under rubble and its around 1-2 celcius (34-35F) tonight. Professional help didnt reach yet to most of the effected areas and people are reporting survivors are crying for help under the wrecked buildings. Hypothermia is a huge risk to those trapped in debris. What a tragedy.
Meteorologist here. I do active warnings for tornadoes and severe storms. Recently had an event in my state where numerous people died, including a 9 year old. It sticks with you. The secondary trauma of being directly part of the emergency response process is very real. Take care of yourself friend, and thanks for getting info to people.
Devastating. I'm not Turkish but I've been following the country more closely for a few years. There is so much unnecessary suffering brought on by an inept and corrupt government and now this disaster. I'm not optimistic but I hope this will help bring the change the people of Turkey need and deserve.
