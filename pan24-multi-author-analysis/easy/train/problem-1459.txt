TV Rain's Latvian ban comes nine months after Russia announced that it was blocking the station's output, accusing it of spreading "deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel" in Ukraine.
Nice. For the people in the comment section: rain might be anti-putin, but it never was anti-russian, sympathising with "out boys" aka murderers and war criminals, so they deserve this ban.
Congratulations on “escaping “ Russia. I myself “escaped “ almost 30 years ago… and never looked back.
I used to laugh at their "third Rome" thing, but a bunch of violent imperialists grabbing anything they can, their main military superpower being irrational determination, the weirdly persistent inability to build a competent navy, government that likes to pretend its guided by law but is actually just a bunch of oligarchs audibly murdering each other behind a curtain while maintaining the ludicrous facade that everything is normal and above board, mind shatteringly army breaking levels of corruption...
I am aware. But things are different when you move a company. Especially such technology dependent company as TV studio.
Boo-hoo, were these grown-ass men conscripted at a gunpoint? No. Did they somehow resist the mobilization? Also no (except that one guy who shot a conscription officer, kudos to him). Have they done the morally correct choice to go to jail as the direst of options (although not always necessary) instead of INVADING ANOTHER COUNTRY AND KILLING ITS PEOPLE? Guess what — still no. Need I remind you that mobilization was announced in September, when the russian army was suffering obvious losses, so they've known the outcome?
