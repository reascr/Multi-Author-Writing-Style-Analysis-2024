Yep. Democrats should be screaming the "you're playing politics" card all the time. The sad thing is 9/10 of them are playing the same game as Republicans. They'll just say Republicans did a bad thing, vote for me. It's just a circus.
Iâ€™m not saying we are going to convert every MAGA Republican into a Democrat, but we sure as shit would see a decline in the blatant cronyism and hypocrisy that exists in the Republican Party today at a minimum, unless they want to keep losing votes.
Yeah good luck. They partisan deadlock every fucking issue for no other reason than they want issues to rile voters about so they can get reelected. It's just a circus of idiots in the modern world.
