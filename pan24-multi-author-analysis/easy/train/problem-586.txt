In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes, sure! You’ll be seeing that in a couple weeks. Everyone’s bigly excited. I’m hearing great things…in fact, that’s all I’m hearing. Just the best, that’s for sure.

Prosecutors have urged a federal judge to hold Donald Trump’s office in contempt of court for failing to fully comply with a May subpoena to return all classified documents in his possession, according to people familiar with the matter — a sign of how contentious the private talks have become over whether the former president still holds any secret papers.
Yeah. My theory all along is that neither the lawyers, nor Trump, nor anyone else, knows exactly what was removed and where it is now. They stalled and stalled with their stolen election crap, then when time ran out they randomly threw stuff in boxes and sent it wherever.
