Maybe not bodyguards, I miswrote, but work for him to control the people. This is from a Russian article in 2019:
That's completely different. Navalny did not have an entire state and an army behind him. He was all alone going into Russia and just got arrested. He had zero chance of succeeding. Zelensky, on the other hand, has an army and an entire nation with NATO support behind him. He actually has a decent chance of succeeding, unlike Navalny. Zelensky's move to stay was risky, but not unreasonable. Navalny's move to go into Russia was foolhardy.
I think it was foolish for him to go back to Russia. What the fuck did he expect was going to happen? Hoping that a revolution will arise due to his martyrdom is not a good strategy. It's built entirely on hope. He would be more effective from abroad.
He\s regular russian imperialist. Doesnt matter will he die or survive, russia\s foreighn course will not change. As he said about ukrainian crimea "crimea is not a sandwich to return it back". Any russian opositioner is same bastard as any russian.
