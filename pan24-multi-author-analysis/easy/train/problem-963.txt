Edit: hit that downvote button so you don’t have to think about all the Palestinians murdered by Israeli soldiers!
Guys, I figured out why we don’t have peace in the Middle East It’s all the Palestinians fault. Ok let’s go to lunch.
2. makes you look like you blame Israel as a cause to the terror attack, which is like blaming Paris in the Paris terror attacks, there's absolutely 0 justifications to terrorism, BUT in the PA, they actually pay your family after you do that, so once you have a financial motivator, you need to point the finger at the other way, Israel is trying to prevent those attacks, while the other side is paying people to do that under the guise of heroism.
How so? What I just said is actually more conservative than the three most well known groups that have formally accused Israel of apartheid.
And the Israeli public has mostly supported the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians, and the current apartheid conditions bring imposed on them. Those things are happening right now, not theoretically or in polls by right-wing foundations.
