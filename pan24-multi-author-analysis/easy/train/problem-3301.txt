If the Republicans put up another MAGA candidate, having a military veteran opponent absolutely makes a difference, since it’s an easier pill to swallow for non-MAGA Republican voters.
Good. Sinema claims "the Arizona people chose an independent." No, they did not. They elected a Democrat. And Sinema used the Democratic party to get there. If I was Gallego I'd hammer this.
Most states either have "sore loser" laws that prevent people from running independent or for another party after losing a primary, or simultaneously register candidates for primary and general elections to prevent this scenario.
What do you mean? I’m not sure why they would vote for Sinema over an actual Republican candidate. Sure, she’s obstructed a lot of things, but her voting record still mostly aligns with the Democrats.
