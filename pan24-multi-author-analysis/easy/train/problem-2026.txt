As a European I’m astonished with your astonishment. It varies by country but in general over here the employer has to give notice based on lenh of employment or pay severance for that period and the employee has a shorter period of notice (sometimes also based on lenh of employment but not as long or capped at a maximum). That’s private companies though. I’m a public servant, if I don’t show up for ten labour days without legal cover (like applied and approved leave) I’m out of a job immediately without severance or unemployment benefits. However if I show up and do my job they can only fire me after two six month negative evaluations which I could fight through unions or in court if I don’t agree with the reasons of termination. I don’t really care for the public system but the private system sounds fair to me.
Exactly. Here in Germany I am in contact with some Russians living here and all of them believe in the propaganda. This already began in 2015 during the refugee wave when some of them told me that Obama was arming the refugees to start a civil war take over Germany.
