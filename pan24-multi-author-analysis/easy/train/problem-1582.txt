My bad, I thought you were arguing the Trail of Tears was justified, but you're more debating the cause of it. My comment was more an oversimplification of the veneration the republican party is giving to Andrew Jackson, not really a comment on the trail. It's definitely a lot more complicated than the average us history class is able to dive into, as is our involvement in WWII. We're definitely not the perfect, spotless liberators that oversimplified history paints us as (just take the also oversimplified French saying "hide your men from the Germans and your women from the Americans," the fact that lgbtq people liberated from concentration camps were put right back in them when the camps were liberated, or the fact that American hero Henry Ford has an IRON CROSS).
No, it is not. The only Black history we're taught in history was that we were slaves, oh, and George Washinon Carver. To get an in-depth history of Black people, you'll have to pay for it in college, hence AP courses. Yes, you may get bits and pieces until 12th grade but it is only surface level and basic.
