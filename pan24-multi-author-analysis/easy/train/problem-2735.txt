Democrats must understand that we didn't win because of Biden; we won in spite of Biden and namely due to the major blunders by opposition handed to Democrats on a silver-platter. Huge difference. On the eve of the midterms, Biden was polling 39% with independents, 85% with Democrats (should never be below 90), and 5% with Republicans with an overall aggregate approval of 40-42%. DO NOT falsely believe that this midterm win was because of Biden, it wasn't. It was because Gen Z showed up and were energized about (1) Abortion, (2) Preserving Democracy from election deniers, and (3) Climate Change. Don't rely on such a court decision to be thrown into the lap of Democrats in 2024. You'll need a better candidate that is authentic, charismatic, visionary, and younger â€” that's what sells in competitive elections for Democrats historically.
Lol. You used Hillary as your one example?? She lost because she had 25+ years of personal attacks from Republicans and some lefty dems to get over, plus Jim Comey screwing her over last minute, that's why she lost. Do you not remember 6 years ago??
