The US has a spending problem. The US spends on too much that doesn’t benefit the population. Everyone cries that people need to pay their fair share, well guess what, the majority of income tax comes from wealthy people. But that’s not to say that they aren’t hiding more income that’s not reported or loop holed. Know how to fix a ton of issues in the US? Slash military spending, slash benefits spending, slash welfare spending, and create a universal healthcare program that includes mental health services.
Very true. Its not our economic system that is the problem so much as our political system that is implementing it, and unfortunately for us, ours wasnt build as well as it ought to be. Its easy to see how a government like ours can be weakened and bought out by corporations. Between gerrymandering, the electoral college and state representation inequality our elections are a sham, our two parties refuse to work together, nothing is preventing bribery/corruption, etc., theres so much vulnerability to corruption rn. We're just stuck in a loop of being lied too, robbed, enraged at the injustice, and robbed again.
