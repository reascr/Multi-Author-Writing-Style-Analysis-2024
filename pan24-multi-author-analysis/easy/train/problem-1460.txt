if we are strictly talking about casualties the problem is much worse for Ukraine whose population is 3 times smaller with even lower birth rate and similar military casualties and tens of thousands of civilian casualties so even if all the 7 million refugees return to the coumtry(a lot already did) they would still have a huge population problem that most people seem to ignore.
Beggars can't be choosers. The catastrophic demography in Russia doesn't really offer Putin much of a choice who he can select to declare breeding cattle, especially since most of the childless women can't; don't want to (biologically, mentally or financially) have kids. He might as well (and will most likely) make it a law for every woman of legal age in Russia who can have kids to produce a set amount of offspring for his war machine, in order to get special benefits like this worthless medal or otherwise be fined until they do as told. If they refuse, there are always the penal colonies where there's a 1:50 women/men ratio to blackmail women even further into making children "by free will" instead of being raped in prison.
