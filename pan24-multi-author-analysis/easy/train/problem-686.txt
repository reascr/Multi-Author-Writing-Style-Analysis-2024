The murderers who run the fossil fuel industry don't give a fuck. They will be enjoying all their luxuries in a gated community of mansions while the rest of the world falls into chaos as climate change gets worse. They don't care about human survival. We need to stop them. We need to do what Greta Thunberg and many other protesters did to block a coal mine expansion. We need to organize more protests that block fossil fuel business entrances or new constructions/expansions. We need to do it in such large numbers and in so many locations that the police will be overwhelmed. The fossil fuel industry is a threat to our lives and the lives of our descendants. Are we just going to let those murderers destroy us and our future? Fuck that.
Also, individuals cannot affect this directly. You don't get to choose what power company is available to you locally, and not everyone can afford hybrids or EVs. And if you response to drive less, that's BS too. Many countries, especially the US, simply don't give you an alternative. You drive, or you don't work.
