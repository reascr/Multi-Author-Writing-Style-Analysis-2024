Only ban certain guns and make it harder for people to get them not easier. Education on how that gun you are about to buy to protect your family is more likely to be used to kill a family member either thru suicide or accidental discharge than it will ever be used to protect anyone. Some people simply shouldnt have guns especually those who have no idea how to use them or a respect for what they can do.
Probably. If the government wants millions dead, and they are armed, it gets mor difficult now doesnâ€™t it? Liberty is not just about you, it is about everyone.
Seriously. It's about individual freedoms. I'm a classic liberal, not a neoliberal. I view these gun bans as security theatre at the expense of individual rights. At best it's reactionary and doesn't do anything to address societal ills that lead to shootings.
Absolutely. There's so many adverse trade offs with voting Republican just to keep assault weapons. Especially when a majority prefers thinks like healthcare and voting rights.
