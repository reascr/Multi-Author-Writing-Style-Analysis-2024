“Oh my god you guys, I asked them not to follow the rules in our favor, and they totally declined, can you believe it? They said they just gonna follow the rules. Well, I tried so now I can say MY election is stolen and yours is valid, ok? The enemy is strong but also weak.”.
It's also worth nothing that Bolsonaro's party (PL) elected the largest number of congressmen than any other party in this year's election (which already shows how full of bullshit they are for claiming that there was fraud), so even if their complaint had merit, by requesting a new election they would risk to end up electing fewer congressman and having less power than they currently have (even with Bolsonaro having lost the election), so this is nothing but a stupid theater to please a sector of the PL party and avoid a potential fractured among the members, since there's currently a lot of friction among those who respect the results of the election and a more radical group that wants to overturn the election.
They are not risking, they know this won't do anything. They are just doing to make people go the streets to make a 6 january happens here.
