I see you've copied word for word the railroads stance they post on company home pages. First off the unions are asking for 56 hours sick leave, not 15 days. Second, after 2 or 3 days off sick, I can't remember exactly, you may be required to obtain a doctor's note. Third, even though they deemed rail employees federal contractors during the pandemic, they refuse to agree to the sick days federal contractors are allowed. Fourth, the paid sick leave after 7 days is through the railroad retirement board which is separate from the railroads. And 7 days off unpaid before benefits start is not sick leave, it's short term disability. Fifth, and I can't speak to train side employees, but I gross around 65k a year and even when totaling compensation from healthcare (which now has monthly contributions uncapped with this tentative agreement) and pension benefits (which has more taken out of my checks than ssi) I'm still under 100k.
Wow. What a misleading headline. Stretched the words they used far as they could without lying outright. It’s a contract that the majority of workers voted for. That’s the entire reason it’s on the table. That’s why we’re talking about it.
