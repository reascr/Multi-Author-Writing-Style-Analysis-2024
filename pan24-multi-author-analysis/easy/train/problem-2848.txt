If you're holding your breath for that though, then you're just being utterly fool hardy falling for republican propaganda ("we're totally moderate guys, promise!").
The system isn't designed for political parties, even though they came into existence almost immediately. The modern practice is that, a few weeks after each congressional election, the newly elected (or re-elected) set of representatives of each political party conduct party-internal elections to pick that party's nominee for Speaker. Then, on the first day of the new Congress (January 3), every member of that party votes for that party's nominee for Speaker. if one party has a majority and all members vote for the nominee that won the party-internal election, they'll win, which is the usual outcome. But the minority party does routinely vote for their own candidate on the floor of the House, and that's been true throughout US history no matter which party is in control. The actual threshold for electing a Speaker is an absolute majority of those representatives present and voting when the election is held. Not plurality, absolute majority, excluding absences and explicit abstentions.
