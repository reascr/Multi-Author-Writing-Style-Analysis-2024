The people that created the Constitution enshrining these freedoms, literally owned other people like they owned a couch in their fucking living room. Maybe we should uh.. I don't know... acknowledge that, and stop pretending American history is as wholesome and straightforward as an episode of Steamboat Willy. I mean, we have a badge of "honor" few other countries have. That's the genocide badge. We shouldn't ever forget that the "greatest country on earth" is guilty of genocide. Twice.
Gender studies at the school I know of in Florida is actually a profitable one for the university - these departments are small and don't require a lot of funding, but a lot of students take the classes so the department actually makes more than it spends. Engineering at the same school is heavily subsidized by the university because it's expenses far outweigh what the school brings in through tuition, research, etc. i don't have stats on programs like nursing and business, but i bet they're public record and available.
