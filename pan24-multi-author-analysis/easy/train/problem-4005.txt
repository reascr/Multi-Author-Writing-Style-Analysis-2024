Because this is about them feeling threatened. Us putting US military hardware in Ukraine is their "Bay of Pigs". I mean pretty much the only seaport they can launch an aircraft carrier from is in Ukraine. And on top of that you want to put US missiles within striking range of Moscow??
Within Russia's borders, they should destroy ammunition dumps, aircraft/tank/vehicle factories, military bases (particularly those involved in cruise missile attacks), anything that would slow what Russia counts as logistics. They should also destroy air defences, to make it easier to carry out long-range strikes against other military targets in Russia, and force them to bring more of their air defence units back from Ukraine to Russia.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the Pantsir S-2 and S-400 systems meant to be Russia's most modern and effective anti-air defence systems? Presumably the Ukrainian drones that hit Engels had to pass through areas that were supposedly covered by those systems?
It's no coincidence that the Engels-2 Air Base that was hit by Ukraine is roughly as far from the Ukraine-Russia border as Moscow is. They know Ukraine can send drones that can penetrate through Russia's air defence network, so they're trying to provide additional defences to places they think Ukraine would be likely to strike - like at Putin's residence, at the Defence Ministry building, at the Kremlin, etc.
That was a two days ago? Maybe 3. The Ukranians flew a new route over Crimea with a fleet of drones, most were shot down. It was probably just a scouting run to see if there was a weakness. But Russia still has the capability to shoot down drones.
