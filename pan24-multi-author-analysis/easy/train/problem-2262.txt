Tim Ryan lost and I continued to get fundraising emails from him for a week. Our elected officials already work a shockingly low number of days in a year, but this continuous, nonstop election cycle (and the practice of any leftover campaign funds being forwarded up towards the party) has us trapped in this CONTINUOUS campaign cycle. The representatives in our Representative government aren’t incentivized to run the government, but to continuously be working towards re-election. In a perfect world, these would be the same thing, but when how much money your campaign can throw around has a HUGE impact on results (ESPECIALLY for down ballot races where raw name recognition is as important as any policy you may have), failing to begin fundraising for 2024 in 1924 is just ceding the advantage to your competition!
He may as well? Even if he loses he can grift meanwhile. I don’t see anything making him not want to asides from if he’s found guilty of certain things maybe he has to pay stuff back? But I doubt it lol.
For example the story that the 5th Circuit suddenly has concocted a plan to sunset trillions of dollars in so called entitlement spending, including Social Security, Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and others. Just like that. Immediately. Because they say so. No basis in constitution law. No one voting on it, no way to reverse it if the Supreme Court decided to take it up and agreed.
