Though, the NC natives I know say that, outside of the cities and the Research Triangle, it's as backwater and redneck as Florida. They say I'm getting the glossy, friendly view because, as tourists, I'm only dealing with people kissing ass for tourist dollars. But when you leave the tourist business and hit the people who actually live in the hills, you may as well be in the bible belt. That'd be a shame, because if I moved there, it would be to live in hills or mountains, not the hot plains & valleys. The lowlands are rumored to be as hot as Florida in the summer.
Exactly And I can’t imagine any big business is going to be looking to support him for a higher office, when he has demonstrated his ability to be so petty as to interfere with business practices if he decides he doesn’t like what they stand for… hopefully this stupid move of his will make the big donors think twice about supporting him for his run for president.
Thanks for the update. I suspected a lot of old people playing bumper-cars with Cadillacs but didn't realize how much your government has failed you. Instead of investing all that tourist $ into infrastructure they have pocketed it like all good crooks.
