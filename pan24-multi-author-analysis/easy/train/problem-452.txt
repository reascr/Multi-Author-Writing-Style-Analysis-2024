IMO goes to show that 24-7-365 Republican propaganda, plus alot of their underhandeded tactics, e.g. corrupt gerrymandering, voter suppression crimes against the people such as their latest attempt to cut off early voting - not only works - but unfortunately helps in keeping a segment of the voting public dumbed down and voting against their best interests.
I think it's a brilliant ad. Yes, it's gets Walker's embarrassing words out there. But it also addresses a social problem. In a lot of places in Georgia, people feel like if they are not a Republican they are outcast, some kind of weirdo that everyone else hates. This ad is speaking to them. It tells them they are not the weirdo here. We all see it. We're laughing too.
This is intellectually dishonest. Yes, he was talking about vampires and werewolves, but without the larger context of course it sounds insane. He was taking about watching a movie with his son. In the full clip he does eventually get around to making a point, and his point is legitimately stupid: werewolves are stronger than vampires and that’s why faith in Jesus is necessary. But this is different than being deranged or insane. He’s just fucking stupid.
