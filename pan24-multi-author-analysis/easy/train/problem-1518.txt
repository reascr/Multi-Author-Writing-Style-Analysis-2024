Incomprehensible? Our messaging sucks Especially with Biden It’s not incomprehensible they told us they were going to do this. Talk about how the republicans are a straight up cult. Got their marching orders to make everything dealing with race to be crt. Even though crt is not taught in schools. Talk about how they function as a communist cult spreading misinformation lies and chaos. Say fucking something that isn’t so nice to our future oppressors. Fuck with them.
Incomprehensible?? It's perfectly comprehensible. It's perfectly in line with what DeSantis and the rest of the GOP have been doing for the past 10 years. Unconscionable, yes, but incomprehensible? I'm afraid not.

incomprehensible? Quite the contrary. It’s a blatant move by the Fascist wannabe dictator to let the racists in Florida in the country that he’s their man. Likewise the homophobes and transphobes.
