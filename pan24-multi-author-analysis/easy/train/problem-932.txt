Elon then launches a new company to build giant tennis rackets. By the time the first prototype is complete six months later, Russia is losing badly and has barely any missiles left and maybe launches one a month or so. The tennis racket is deployed despite no longer being needed, and one day it gets a rare opportunity to do its one job and it works perfectly. Russian air defenses mis-interpret the returning volley as an incoming ICBM and launch all their ICBMs at Ukraine and NATO. NATO launches all their ICBMs back at Russia. Elon grabs Joe Rogan and together they make their escape to Mars on a now-functional Starship. Joe Rogan periodically holds interviews just for the sake of nostalgia, despite Joe's only two podcast viewers being Joe and Elon, the entire rest of the human race being deceased. When asked about the tennis racket, Elon shrugs and says, "I told them it would work.".
Yes, Russians in general are ethno-fascist imperialists. Their desire as a people is to subjugate others to their whims, in a messianic drive, believing Russian culture to be superior and thus civilizing. This is true to almost all Russians.
That's absolutely insane losses. Especially when you remember that this was supposed to last only 3 days. I don't know when the last time someone took that many losses. But I'm thinking Vietnam?
