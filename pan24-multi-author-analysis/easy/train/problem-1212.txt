Proportional response ; Ukraine launches a single long range missile to hit some random farm in Russia. Avoid collateral damage, maybe mail a tractor.
But just in case i was misunderstood i will explain what i meant about being wary, this is not about current situation as it was obviously russian attack (as it was confirmed), but in the future for any possible informations he/you may hear coming from Poland about future events as, as i explained, there are parties who currently understand well that such informations are easy to sell and they are used to blamin, not only Russia, but specific groups to gain attention and inlfuence among voters even before any real proofs are provided/investigations will be started.
lets not do anything. lets let russia fly a missile into germany or US, and not retaliate, because NUKES. right? lets let them do anything, take territory, and every time they threaten nukes for 100th time lets just piss ourselfes in fear and wet the bed every time while they laugh at westerners. as if youre the only one aware that nukes exist.
