Republicans care about one thing. Votes. Well, those votes lead to the real issues they care about, tax cuts for rich, grifting, etc.... but... in order to do all those things, they need ONE thing.. VOTES! Donald Trump got them votes in 2016. He still gets votes, but only during the primary. So the GOP isn't afraid of him, they are afraid of his votes and the base they helped create. Our country has become so divided that both parties have carved out majority safe seats. No politician wants a hard fought general election, they want to cruise to victory. Usually, name rec and incumbency was easy enough for the primary. Not anymore. 2022 proved that. Trump world will come for your seat in the primary. They might lose the general, but again most seats are carved up to be safe. These spineless fools have made their bed with Trump to appeal to his voters. They all probably can't stand the voters Trump created, but now they have to toe the line.
Already uncovered. The same LLC that Michael Cohen used to funnel the payoff to Stormy Daniels also took in $500,000 from a firm linked to Russian Oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. It took in $4.4 million just before Trump was elected.
