They’ll just go along party lines. Biden will face an impeachment every week for the rest of his presidency, usually ending with around 220 votes for, 221 against, with 4 abstaining. The House won’t be able to do literally anything else, and every vote will fail because no one wants to take the step after that (which is an acquittal in the Senate). So they’ll just take turns abstaining from the vote, and saying they’ve literally done everything they can for the American people. McCarthy will wring his hands and say “I’ve got to listen to my party”. McConnell will tell him he better never send that shit to the Senate. Everyone will play it for all the spectacle they can get.
Yeah, you're probably seriously misevaluating Jon Tester. He's a reasonably solid Democrat most of the time as long as you stay away from guns (it's Montana... you'll _never_ see an anti-gun candidate get elected here.).
