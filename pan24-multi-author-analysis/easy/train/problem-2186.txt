That's also not mentioning of course just how much their remaining armed forces have atrophied since the fall of the USSR. Had they come storming across the Fulda Gap they would have thrown everything at us including their air power. All of which was much more impressive during the 80's.
Conscription solves Russia's problem of keeping the war meat grinder well fed (their seemingly _only_ truly reliable weapon) and at the same time unties its hands to do nearly what it wants with those those conscripted citizens turned soldiers (when you're a soldier you have far fewer rights than other citizens, hello "military service", a perk of being a male citizen in Russia), and the family being poor can't buy their son(s) off or amass any legal (or literal, for that matter) defence, also when state tells them they know not how their son died or where (so they can save on war expenses). Russia thus culls its weak while leaving more fortunate/smarter/richer/closer to Kremlin to continue insulate and support the state where the top can keep the cash flow coming in. I mean what would a King do without his lords with fancy titles recruiting or enslaving peasants into a system where said lords levy everyone and collect taxes to send wealth upwards the pyramid, ending up at the Kings treasury? The King can't do these things alone.
In 1990 they had about 8000 aircraft, now they have about 4000 and a significant chunk of those will still be Soviet era planes lacking modern upgrades (same with their tanks which are lacking night sights etc), see the reports of pilots with commercial GPS systems taped to the dash etc.
