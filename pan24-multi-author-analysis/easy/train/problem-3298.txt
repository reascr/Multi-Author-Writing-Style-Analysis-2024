How? Republicans are anti-union and anti-worker and they have a huge paper trail behind them backing this position up. They're not going to campaign on railway workers not getting sick time two years prior when: a. they didn't vote for it; b. they're the people pushing for "right to work"; c. the last 40 years of conservativism has convinced their flock that union workers are overpaid, entitled, and lazy.
exactly. Both parties are absolutely not the same, but that doesn't excuse the fact that Democrats still aren't perfect. They should have kept the bills together, and if it failed, the rail strike is laid only at the feet of the GOP. Now, they have to share the blame. It was a move made in consideration for the majority of the working class, without recognizing that we down here would rather have dealt with the economic results of a rail strike in solidarity with the rail workers.In reality, most Democrats are rather moderate. Biden himself is textbook moderate. We elected who we had to to get the fascists out of office, but I personally hope he refuses to run again and endorses someone farther left who can be a voice of the people. I'm hoping Mark Kelly throws his hat into the ring tbh; a former astronaut and firearms safety instructor refusing to put up with fascist bullshit AND championing for the working class that built the very shuttles he rode into space? Count me in.
