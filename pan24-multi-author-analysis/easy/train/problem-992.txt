I don’t care and they deserve whatever happens to their country. We spent 20 years over there giving them every chance they had to rebuild their country and they did jack all. The taliban were hiding in caves like the prehistoric savages they are and the AFN was more preoccupied with smoking opium then finishing them off. Billions of dollars were invested into infrastructure and it didn’t improve the country one bit. What happens when we pull out after 20 years? They just roll over and die. Nobody put up any resistance or protest aside from a couple of commando units. When the taliban was taking over they all did was run to the airport to flee to the west. Maybe if they decided to do something they wouldn’t be in this situation. Of course I feel bad for these women and my heart breaks for them but it’s the fault of Afghans and Afghans alone. They decided they wanted this and I don’t know why they are so angry or surprised.

Historically Qatar's and Saudi Arabia's labor market were heavily reliant on migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Philippines. Because of Covid and raising food prices, many workers have returned to their homeland and won't come back due to better living standards and increasing salaries in their home country. Iran is in conflict with Saudi Arabia. So how who is going to fill the vacancy?
