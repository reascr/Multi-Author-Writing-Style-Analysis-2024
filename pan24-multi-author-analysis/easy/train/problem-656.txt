I mean it’s either a blatant lie or there’s an explanation we can’t understand (eg alien tech that vanished). Otherwise makes 0 sense why we may never be able to locate something we knowingly shot down, know the location of the shoot down, and almost immediately had numerous assets on site looking for it. The one on Lake Huron had helicopters and P8’s and ships combing the area within literally minutes. It doesn’t make sense.
The government that can’t keep a single thing secret basically ever, private companies with no reason to play along having satellites or observation material, hundreds of thousands of amateurs with telescopes powerful enough to see distant planets and basically every single person in the country famous for having “aliens visit” having a mobile hand held zoom enabled high quality camera and yet its all been constant visits and aliens for the last 60 years but there’s never any proof? Why is it always in the US or in this case Canada but actioned by the US rather than anywhere else.
