Seriously I don't really follow the whole royal family thing or the Harry and Megan stories, but every now and again I see stories or people talking about it and it just sounds like a shit show with so many contradictions, Harry and Megan will not win against the media because the media doesn't give a shit about their reputation, they simply care about the clicks when it comes to these stories and the more Harry and Megan say the more the media can cherry pick.
Oh bull shit. Harry and his dumb bride put themselves out there. Could of stayed in the castle. Also they have security, and can hire security with all the billions they have. From stealing from the poor for thousands of years.
They continue to do interviews what gives the media the exact thing they want to twist it to earn their money, honestly if they want it all to die down they need to stop with the interviews, books and documentaries, if they want their side of the story in the public then they can do that, but the media is going to do what the usual shit media do all the time and go to earn clicks by twisting and cherry picking.
