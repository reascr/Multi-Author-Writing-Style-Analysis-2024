As to the whole free speech thing: I'm from Germany and while we of course have the constitutional right to voice any opinion, we have more... reasonable boundaries on what constitutes an opinion. So I may call someone rude, but might open myself up to a lawsuit when I call that same person an asshole. this whole "in my opinion" stuff seems unnecessarily lax to me. Yes, in a Democracy, You need the freedom to voice your opinions, yet there is usually no need to protect each and any utterance that is not blatantly false. In reality, the laws and their applications are way more nuanced of Course. Parody or satire are way more protected against sad issues than your neighbour when they fling insults over your fence for leaving the sprinkler on.

Probably. The lawsuit is absurd. I read his lawsuit. What he says were CNN's defamatory comments don't even come close to defamation. He has to show CNN made a factual statement that could be proven true or false.
B) You have to prove that the false statement was made with what is called "actual malice". "Actual malice" neans that the defendant made the statement.
