The largest standing army that is strictly within Europe is Italy at \250 000. Finland has about 25 000 active personnel, but because they've had conscription this entire time, they have 280 000 fully trained personnel that they can call on in wartime. They have another 900 000 reservists. They're also highly motivated, with saying they were in favour of conscription and believe the Finnish people should defend themselves in an armed conflict. So... more or less you can count probably 80% of those reservists, who all have military training, as part of the Finnish military. So yeah, over one million people with military training ready to fight tooth and nail. It honestly makes most of the militaries in Europe look like a joke given the Finnish population. They've done that because they aren't part of NATO and couldn't just say "I'm going to tell my dad and he's going to beat you up.".
Thatâ€™s entirely inaccurate, especially given how much production capacity for construction relied on US companies.
