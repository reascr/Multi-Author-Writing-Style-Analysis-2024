I love how it’s greatly overlooked that the biggest “reason” given for banning flavors is due to youth consumption. It’s already illegal to sell to anyone under 21 but instead of actually going to the root (aka: dumb parents buying this for their kids) they punish millions of adults who switched to vape in order to ween themselves off of nicotine or even to simply not smell like cigarettes anymore. Never mind the fact that vaping is more eco-friendly (no gross butts, ash, lower fire risk) and is big tobacco’s only real competitor. Yes, let’s ban the already age restricted substance. Next, no more flavored alcohol, those are kid friendly and cause more deaths of minors annually.

Exactly. While I’ll probably never understand people who want to ban or limit the sale of the more socially accepted drugs between regulated businesses and legal, fully consenting adults, I at least respect the ones who are consistent.
