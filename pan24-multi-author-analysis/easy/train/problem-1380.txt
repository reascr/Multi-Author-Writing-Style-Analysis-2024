It's because of toilets now, and all the regulations, am I right folks? People are flushing 10, 15 times...Not me of course. But this guy over here, OK? In my day we had big, beautiful toilets "Big water" toilets, we called them. Maybe some still do if their memory is as good as mine, I don't know. I've got the best memory. Big brain. Very smart. A lot of people say the smartest. You had all the water you wanted, and the power Lemme tell you, folks--it was like a Birmingham firehose, washing all the bad stuff away. And they're taking so long in the bathroom now that people get thirsty. Melanie had a drinking fountain installed next to the toilet. I guess it's a European thing, because they are not free, folks--haven't been for a long, long time. The toilets are a big problem, and it's all over the world now. Believe me.
Their bench is not deep and they need someone who looks younger than your great grandparent who is not also screaming about loving or apologizing for Nazis, calling people of color subhumans from another country/planet/dimension, and closeted pedophiles whining about age of consent.
Holy shit this is brilliant in so many ways. Especially since a lot of them also feel like civil war or dystopia will be fun to live in. With that they could live all their Lord of the Flies dreams.
