(Also, according to international organizations such as Human Rights Watch Israel is committing crimes against humanity against the Palestinian groups, particularly apartheid; this isn't genocide, but that's also where Nazi Germany started prior to moving to full genocide. Arguments can be made as to whether Human Rights Watch is correct, but it being correct isn't my point - my point is just that exploring what is happening isn't itself antisemitic).

Israel factually isn't particularly comparable to Nazi Germany. If someone can't figure out a way to criticize Israel without the wrong Nazi comparisons, their criticisms may not be particularly worth listening to.
Uh, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance sure sounds like a reliable source to go to for a definition of antisemitism... Maybe it's not so good to be opposing it?
With that in mind, it seems like a reasonable working definition of antisemitism. Especially since, again, this seems like a nonbinding resolution sort of thing rather than actually criminalizing anything, so people saying "Israeli policy is way better then the Nazis" aren't going to be punished or anything.
