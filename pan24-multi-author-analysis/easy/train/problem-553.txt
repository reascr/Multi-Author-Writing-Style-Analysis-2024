imagine yourself being an ukrainian fighting at the frontlines - would you understand scholz step by step approach when you see your friends die left and right? how is russia supposed to escalate into a world war when it's unable to win a war against a nation a third its population. we both know nukes are a fear factor but not a real danger considering it would turn china hostile and seeing the vanity that surrounds putin and his band of kleptocrats they are vain, greedy and cowards that lack any death-wish besides enjoying life in their tasteless palaces. puting is clinging to power and life, he wants to leave a legacy. he is like every old man looking back wondering what was accomplished. putin didn't mount to anything.
The fact we’ve only just made a decision [on sending tanks] and already the next debate [fighter jets] is firing up in Germany – that just seems frivolous and undermines people’s trust in government decisions,” said Scholz in an interview with the German newspaper Tagesspiegel on Sunday.
