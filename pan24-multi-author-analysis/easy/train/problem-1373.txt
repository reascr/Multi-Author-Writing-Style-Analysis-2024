Power to the workers. Stand with the Rail workers. Screw these billionaire owners. Buffett must bend. Its time they pay. Beyond time, since these Assholes are getting tax breaks and subsidies at the expense of We the People. Give the workers a good job with benefits, sick leave, paid vacations, health insurance and regular cost of living raises plus performance bonuses and oh yeah shares in the company they work for. Lets not fire or write up individuals that have family to take care of when they are ill or in need. Lets treat the worker that does their best for the company they work for to the best a company can provide. The good workers, whom serve for 20+ years should be rewarded with pensions of 75% of their annual income and stocks. If a man or woman gives their best to you they deserve your best in return. Lets give the annual performance bonus the CEO gets divided equally among employees with 10 yrs of service. Do this every 5 yrs as a holiday gift to those in the trenches. Stand with the workers. Strenh in numbers. Unity is power.
Between student loans, expensive rents and/or housing, parents who havenâ€™t saved for retirement and are dealing with their own health issues in our for-profit healthcare system, and our own need to fund our future healthcare needs as we slowly work ourselves to death, we as a generation are determining the only way out of the cycle of debt as our very bodies are consumed by our systems of Capitalism is to refuse to subject future generations to this madness.
