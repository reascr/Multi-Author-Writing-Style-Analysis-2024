It was a wild story, we were way out on a kay that was only 100 meters wide and 300 long when a hurricane surprised everyone so we had to evacuate at 5 in the morning. The fiberglass open-top longboat we were in was packed with people from the island, plus the generator, and we were bounding over increasingly rough seas on the frantic trip to the mainland. A note on the island, It was Tobacco Caye, and when I was snorkeling off it I saw a ton of cinderblocks offshore scattered around the ocean floor. When I asked the cook about it she told me that since the highest point on the island was roughly three meters above sea level, any time a big storm came through there was a good chance they would be rebuilding a lot of stuff. Still though, paying something like $45 per person per day with all your meals included and staying in a cabin that was built on stilts over the water was amazing. At the time, we were really into backpacking so the minimalist nature of the cabin didn't bother us that much. I got to drink a slightly colder-than-air temperature beer, laying in a hammock over the ocean off a private cabin, watching rays dart around trying to grab the scraps the fishermen threw back into the water. For a couple of days, that place was one of the most relaxing times in my life.
