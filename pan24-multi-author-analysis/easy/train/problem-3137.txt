This is somewhat academic, however, since with the number of warheads each side possesses, they could each bring about a nuclear winter that would exterminate humanity -- and crucially, it doesn't even matter where the weapons are detonated. Missile defense is irrelevant if your enemy is suicidal, and mass launch of nuclear weapons is basically suicidal by definition.
Hmm. Actually they send all their weaponry to Ukraine. Everything they can spare and more. Because they fear nothing while they are a proud part of the modern world's most effective mutual defense and support alliance, and instead, share what they have with countries like Ukraine that aspire to the same freedom from fear that they now enjoy.
Exactly. If Russia truly broke up and the ethnic Republics were fully independent, then they could form an actual union starting with free trade then free movement etc, rather than everything created in Russia being siphoned to Moscow, leaving the countryside poor and the people fleeing the country.
