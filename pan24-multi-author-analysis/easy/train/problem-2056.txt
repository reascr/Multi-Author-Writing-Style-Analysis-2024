The real issue is that, historically. The United States has been a dick foreign policy wise. Yes even Obama that dude scary when it cones to clean up crews. Point being. The military complex is scared that the current military cannot operate at levels previously attained in old recruits. That, and they are scared they will not be able to shore up by sheer numbers. So, we now see the party that is heavily funded by the military industrial complex doing exactly what someone would imagine them doing. Ensuring population growth while suppressing the bottom line to create an influx of movement. Kineticly coordinated correctly this is an extremely effective national strategy. However.
