God warns that in the last days before earths destruction that many evil things will become the norm. Men with men and women with women. But he says do not fear or despair when these things become the norm. God will essentially “write the ship” after he has given everyone space (time) to either used their life for evil or good. He says this is the time that evil will dominate but do not fear it. So democrat winning and spreading more of their immoral views and policies is no different than a person growing old and dying. It gonna happen regardless. So do not fear it.
Definitely not relieved. She had political ambitions. I think she was even angling to be trump’s vp pick so in her mind she was dreaming two years as Governor, vp of the country for four years, then President.
Exactly. Most of Republicans including republican leadership would prefer De Santis over Trump any time of the day, the problem is A big chunk of Republican voters support Trump and they want him to finish his 2nd term and then have De Santis in 2028. If De Santis and Trump do run vs each other in 2024, I believe Trump will win the primaries.
