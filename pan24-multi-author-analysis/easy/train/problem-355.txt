They are not taking kids from the parents, they are just not letting them in if everyone in the whole family does not have an asylum appointment. No children are taken from parents.
Actions talk louder than agitpropaganda words, and the actions says that biden is to the right wing of george bush, by keeping implementing the hardest ice plan he inherited from donald trump while the whole white supremacist mafia agency needs dissolution and a criminal inquiry.
This author isn't the first one to point out that . All the "you're denied because you're applicant number 30,001" or "you're denied because you didn't come on an airplane" stuff is just straight up violations of international law. The only real difference is Trump's was "You're not allowed to even ask for asylum here because I hate you," and Biden's is "You're not allowed to even ask for asylum here because they hate you.".
The bottom line is that the trump mafia is still actively protected by joe biden (under the excuse of not wanting to have "political charges", so he prefers them above the law), but the ICE/CBP neonazi thugs are still attempting to kidnap & ransom innocent brown farm hands off the street side alongside stephen himmler's nazis plans.
Edit: i am correct. Even on the app directions on the cbp.gov site it says you can use kiosks or paper forms.
Republicans lying? Well, that's unheard of, I'm sure that'll come back on them when people find out /s.
