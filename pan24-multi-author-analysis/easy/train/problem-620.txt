Under the new contract they will get one day of sick leave and they are reducing penalties for taking their vacation time on short notice, that will reduce the number of people going to work sick. So, safer than we were before the contract, but otherwise yes you have a good point, people absolutely shouldn't be forced to work while they are sick, and hopefully in the future congress can pass a bill guaranteeing sick leave. However, in the short-term I believe the country as a whole would be worse off if their were a rail strike. 40% of our shipping goes by rail, what happens to our economy if that stops? How much do the already high price of goods increase? How many kids go hungry?
These workers who are deemed essential workers who asked for only 15 sick days, sick days that most of us take for complete fucking granted, sick days that they were only going to get seven of, sick days that would have treated them as valued humans vs a fucking cost line item on some bean counters spreadsheet, these jackasses couldn't muster the courage to put it into main bill.
Sure. That’s a different issue. Republicans could have gotten the sick leave passed. They came out in numbers against it. Both sides fucked up, but the republicans are the reason the sick days didn’t pass. Period.
