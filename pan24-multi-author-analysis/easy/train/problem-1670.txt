In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Seriously. There's no proper way to call 911, especially if reporting on a traumatic scene. Some people might be borderline hysterical and unable to put together coherent sentences, never mind accurately describe the scene in front of them. Some people might go into shock and sound abnormally calm or detached. You would also need to know an individuals regular speech patterns, education, cultural background, and tons of other information if you were to even begin to judge whether or not they sound "normal" on a 911 call. But this guy literally claims that anyone who says "please," "hi," or "huh?" at any time is showing indicators of guilt.

Technically, unfortunately, he’s not providing evidence. Instead, he’s providing training that lets the prosecution pretend someone else is an expert witness. That “expert witness” then provides the evidence/testimony. The “expert witness” is then the one subject to cross examination. The “expert witness” points to their training as a sign of expertise. They didn’t fabricate the methodology, so can provide convincing testimony without lying their asses off under oath, the way the inventor of this hokum would have to if he testified.
I'm the same way. Very calm in an emergency (a drowning, a cardiac arrest right in front of me), but wake up at 4am panicking about what I have to do 4 hours later at work.
