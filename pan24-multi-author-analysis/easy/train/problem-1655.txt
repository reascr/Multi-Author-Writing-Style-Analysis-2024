Here is a more recent article on Kilimnic by a journalist who actually directly interviewed Kilimnic... one of the biggest surprises from this is that not a single investigator from any US government agency even attempted to contact Kilimnic for questioning, not even once. And to my knowledge, that hasn't been contested by any US governmental entity. There is always the possibility that Kilimnic would refuse, but to not even attempt to speak to him truly boggles the mind. The same applies to Mueller's curious decision to not speak with Assange/Wikileaks. Assange openly offered to show proof to the FBI that it received the DNC info from a non-state actor. Why would the investigators not entertain that idea? Even if they doubted it would be fruitful, it doesn't make sense to completely ignore it when helpful evidence could be recieved, observed, or discerned even from a person trying to be deceitful. I think it suggests more of a willful avoidance of information that runs counter to the preferred narrative.

An Impeachment and insufficient reporting. Sad for current Big Media consumers looking for truth, great for Rhetoric preferred banter.
