Very true. I feel it happen to me, sometimes. Failure to do anything about violent crime in my city, with catch and release literally putting machete wielding people uttering threats back in the street, has lead to my usually left-wing city swinging right. I voted as far left as possible again because I know left policies have the best chance of resolving the problems that lead to that violence, but others are sick of seeing the government do nothing to actually help these people. Instead, they’re just asking us to put up with living in bedlam and being threatened twice a day or else we’re bad people. Nevermind that mental health and addiction services have had their budgets slashed, the shelters are dangerous, and the Justice system’s version of mercy is to just fail to hold to account anyone brought to them, no matter how concerning their behaviour. No help is given for their mental health or addiction, either, of course, other than excuses to just release them.
Seriously. Its like saying “Republicans have been working against conservatives for years”, except that statement is true and progressives and Democrats are allies.
Republicans, like what you’re doing here, constantly attempt to change the meaning of words and phrases to suit their political ends. Its Roger Ailes whole schtick.
