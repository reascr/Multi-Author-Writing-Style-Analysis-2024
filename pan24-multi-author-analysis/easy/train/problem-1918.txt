The Torries strike again. But the UK and US are the two biggest tax havens in world, so its no wonder these two governments would be against this type of reporting.
You are right about Ireland being independent and yes there are other countries that are tax havens, but the US and UK are still the number one and two when it comes to being tax havens. The Tax Justice Network, where the article gets it data from, ranks the US and UK as number one and fourteen on its 2022 Financial Secrecy Index: They have a metric, Global Scale Weight (GSW), which is "presented as a percentage of all financial services globally provided by all jurisdictions to non-residents". The GSW for the US and UK are about 26% and 14%, the highest of any of the countries, meaning they are the number one and two countries for hiding money offshore to avoid taxes or other financial obligations.
What? Last I checked the estimate was around 23 trillion dollars or so are lost to tax-havens, tax-evasion etc. of which the largest- and richest actors stand for over 80% of it.
