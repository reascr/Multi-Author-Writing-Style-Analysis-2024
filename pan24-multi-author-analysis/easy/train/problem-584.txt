Assuming Boebert wins her race after the recount (probably a safe assumption); Democrats can unite behind a single candidate; and full participation in the Speaker election; they'd only need to peel off 6+ GOP Representatives. It'll be 222-212, so if the GOP loses 6, they're down to 216, and if the Dems add those same 6, they're up to 218. Obviously, the more Republicans Democrats can peel off, the better, since it's more durable that way, but there's no reason to require room for progressives to protest vote. They should be able to understand, and should be able to sell to their constituents, the idea that this is the best outcome they can get right now.
Not necessarily. “The majority” is supposed to be just that. There’s nothing in the Constitution about political parties. So if you could get a handful of Republicans to support a conservative Democrat, that would also work.

Exactly. He provides blowjobs to the right people... hopefully only metaphorically speaking because the implications of that going literal are just nasty.
