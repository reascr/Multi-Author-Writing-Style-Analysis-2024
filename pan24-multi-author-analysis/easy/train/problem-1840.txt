China isn't involved in a shooting war right now. Sorry, worried more about India economically supporting the country involved in a shooting war in Europe a bit more than playing nice with an unreliable country that is run by a wannabe dictator like Modi.
3. India wants to have an indigenous defence industry. It doesn’t want to be forever reliant on Russia or the US for its own military, same way China has been moving away from Russia.
How else would you suggest India move from relying on Russia for military equipment to relying on the US / self reliance?
Again, you’re acting as if the US working with India on military is the same as the US working with Russia.
You also imply that if India gets some US tech, it’ll just go and hand it over to Russia. Which is pretty stupid. Why would the US do this if that was the case? And I’m sure they know more about what’s happening than your or my stupid ass.
Negative. Russia has already lost in Ukraine. NATO is expanding, they're sanctioned and have been made a pariah state in the west, their military is being degraded. They haven't lost militarily in Ukraine yet but I think its obvious that Ukrainian identity and government isn't going anywhere even if Russia manages to hold some land in the east. Russias war is a huge net loss for them and they've been made and are now seen as a second rate power.
