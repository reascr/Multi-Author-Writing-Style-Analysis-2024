They were loans for restructuring. Not really a big tangible return on the loan itself, but car companies did use that money to revamp their processes, and American cars are really a lot better than they were before the bailout.
I read it. They were correct. And you're misrepresenting it. I don't disagree that the government that we elect is representing the wrong people in this case. But I'm not too dense to understand why they represent them. Things would not be any better if the government had less control. And if you think it would. You haven't been paying attention. The whole reason we're here in the first place is because of corporate control. Do you even have a cursory understanding of why we have holidays? 40 hour work weeks as a general rule? Weekends? Granted we've given up a lot of ground and let corporations turn those concepts into Swiss cheese. But previously the unions and the government had fought for and enshrined them into legislation. We relinquished control of the government to monied interest and now they serve the monied interest. If the Senate and Biden had cited for the workers. I don't think you would be so up in arms. So it's not that they need less control. It's just that we need to tell them what to do with it.
