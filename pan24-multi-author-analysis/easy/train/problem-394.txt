It usually depends on your health coverage. If you don't have a coverage, they will apply an epidural on medical advice but not on demand. But I think this only happens on general clinics, motherhood centers offer epidural on medical authorization but not on advice. You're actually supposed to give birth in motherhood centers (they're public and free), general clinics are mostly for cases of emergency or capacity.
