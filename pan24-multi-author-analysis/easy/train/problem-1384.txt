I moved from Independent, to mostly votes Democrat, to Socialist. I've moved further to the left the older I have gotten for exactly the same reason. I still remember being furious when "the moment of silence" was imposed on me during High School. They couldn't get prayer in school so the adults who never cared about anything at our school except for sports decided we should all have to be quiet during home-room every day to "pray". We already had "meet around the flagpole" groups who prayed before school and I didn't know anyone who didn't have some ritual they did before tests or exams. I remember arguing that as long as there were tests there would be prayer in school. NONE of the adults were listening. They just wanted their flavor of Christianity back into the schools. Then I watched as they failed to comprehend that the culture they were trying to "hold onto" had already gone away long ago.

opposite really. teenagers are not generally politically aware and parrot their parents, the rebellious teen is rarely political.
