Doesn't matter what the cost of pilgrimage is, monetary or any other. There is an amount of wealth, over which all religious activities related to money (or net worth as generalization) become mandatory. Hajj is one of those obligations. Like Salah, or fasting during Ramadan, there are little exceptions for exemption. If you have the required money, it is mandatory to perform Hajj at least once in a lifetime, and as quick as possible if you're wealthy by the definitions of Islam and can physically endure the hardships of the pilgrimage (which TBH 99% of people can, also adding that taking loans to finance Hajj is not suggested). Even saving money for child's marriage, or send them to college, is not an acceptable excuse. Hajj comes first. (Source: I am Muslim and currently preparing to apply for Hajj).
Exactly. All of our ridiculous methods of "humanely" killing someone actually make it much worse. Just for whatever reason people think that the electric chair/gas chamber/lethal injection are more humane, probably because we expect them to be less gristly than beheading, bullet to the head, or the good ol' cattle bolt, but they are more drawn out and prone to major malfunction. If you're going to kill a man put on your big boy pants and just fucking kill him.
