The second bargaining chip is committee and subcommittee positions or gavels. For example, I read somewhere that the HFC is demanding at least 1/3 of the seats on the rules committee. Traditionally, there is some informal line of seniority for these committee and gavels. Rumor is Gaetz may have been angling to jump seniority for the armed services committee gavel. Rogers is in line to be the chair, so it’s possible he caught wind of Gaetz trying to jump him in line.

Potentially. They all caved in the end, but they’ve had a major impact on the new rules package and could see increased representation on key committees. That’s a lot. They have a lot of leverage over McCarthy while McCarthy has only a very razor edge. Less flexibility for individual members to have cop out votes if it’s politically beneficial, and almost no room for significant opposition within the party.
