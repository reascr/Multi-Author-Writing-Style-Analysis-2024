This tends to call into question the usefulness of harsher immigration policies given that farmers and the like in the states still end up hiring just as many immigrants regardless. Laxer policies have historically shown to result in people going back home to their families after the work was done. It’s unclear why people don’t recognize that letting people go back home freely would fix that whole “they’re impacting us economically!” Cry out. You’d have them at the same rate you have them now that harsher immigration policies aren’t stemming, they’d invest a greater portion of that money into our economy while they’re here because they don’t need to hoard it out of concern that the revenue stream they’re sending to their families back home would go away and then they’d go back home without overstaying because they’d rather be with their family and friends anyway. Unless the issue is the availability of things like picking fruit jobs it seems weirdly obvious that people would prefer the policies that increased the likelihood of illegally crossed immigrants going back home of their own accord.
My side?? They both suck. No way I’m going to vote for anyone in the 💩 show of USA politics. How closed minded are you? Not everything is black and white… your side sucks and the right side sucks.. same damn bird, different wings.
