Exactly. McCarthy and Company just proposed a flat 30% sales tax and rescinding income taxes for the rich and corporations. They arenâ€™t handing out bread to placate the masses, they want to make it cost 30% more.
Obviously. She's characterizing congressional support for one particular side in a war as "allegiance to a foreign country". If congressman/woman pushes for pro-Ukrainian policies, does this mean they are "pushing for allegiance to a foreign country"? Of course not.
They could, but McCarthy is also from the wing-nut side of the Republican caucus, so unless he suddenly decided to become a moderate, the best outcome is his speakership fails quickly, and some moderate Republicans work with the Democrats to put one of the moderate Republicans in the Speaker position, and then work together on whatever their bipartisan coalition can actually agree on.
If the Democrats thought McCarthy could be a decent Speaker, they would have negotiated with him (and he with them) rather than forcing him to give a ton of concessions to the most MAGA wing of the Republican party to get the position.
