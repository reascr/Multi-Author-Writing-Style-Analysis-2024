Assuming that a B-2's bomb bay can be refitted with an integral 50,000lb fuel tank or hey, let's be generous and say a 60,000lb refueling tank, the more conventional tankers would have more range and more capacity, forcing them to more closely follow aircraft in need of servicing.
Just gleaning off of a quick cursory internet search, the official capacity of the B-2 Spirit's bomb bay is 40,000lb with an estimated maximum capacity of 50,000lb. A KC-135 seems to be able to have 150,000lb of transferable fuel alone and can carry limited amounts of cargo. Both of those numbers I'm taking from wikipedia, but a forum has some more numbers. Wikipedia also states that the KC-10 has 356,000lb fuel capacity on top of also having additional cargo capacity.
China obviously. America's existing stealth bomber fleets are designed to operate solely out of US airbases for security reasons. This is how we bombed Saddam in the Gulf War. Tankers extend the bombers' range and allow them to completely circumnavigate the globe without landing. This is immensely useful if there is a real threat of nuclear war. It's also useful for other sorts of missions, like P-8s patrolling for Chinese subs around Guam or C-5s delivering tanks to the front line in Korea.
