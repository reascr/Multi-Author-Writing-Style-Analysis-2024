the supreme court of india should be considered the only legitimate arm of the indian government. most of the meaningful cases take a long time to go through, and perhaps some times there are many appeals, but eventually the liberal principles that defined the enlightenment era of europe always prevails. unfortunately, despite the fact it leans very democratically and secularly, the supreme court can often give guidance that is too narrow in scope to enact meaningful change, and they use this approach to pussyfoot around powerful executive / legislative agendas.
No. It is a prostitute of whoever is in power. Chief Justices need powerâ€™s blessing to become chief justice of the supreme court. It is not same as SCOTUS or Republican Supreme Court.
Fortunately though, communicating easier doesn't make it easier for narcissists to cooperate because they don't understand that concept anyway.
Can you read? The guy said the judiciary branch is part of the government, just like the legislative and executive branches in most countries.
