and I said we'll see what happens because you never know what the Radical Left is going to do to hurt us, they've hurt us a lot, they forced Clinton and Obama on us and you almost got stuck with Crooked Hillary if I didn't run, don't forget that, it could've been way way worse than Perfect, which is what you got with my Presidency, Total Perfection, I had the Military locked in 100%, they said they'd never seen anything like it, "Sir, the Army called and they just wanted to thank you for saving Christmas," I said it's no problem, it's what I do, I win, I don't think I've lost probably anything in my entire life, I've always been a Winner, but then you look at people like Pocahontas and Sleepy Joe, and I know the Fake News doesn't like it when i say that but that's ok, but they barely won anything and now they're trying to do a Hostile Takeover of my Presidency. what they're doing is Highly Illegal, it's a real shame, we used to be a Super Power, now we're like Less Than Even Mexico.
