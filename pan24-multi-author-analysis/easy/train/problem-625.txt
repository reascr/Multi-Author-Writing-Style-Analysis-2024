If the civil war. In one instance they set up checkpoints and checked IDs (which specifies religion), if you werenâ€™t Christian you got executed on the spot (men, women and children). Hundreds were murdered in a couple of days.
Nope, you can't just ignore the fact the ottoman ruled for a long time say 600 years of harsh ruling, enough to make middle eastern people believe they could form a different united government in the entire middle east, could be democratic or a dictatorship who knows but that dream was killed when the brits and france decided rather than that form a bunch of different countries and hope for the best for the middle east without knowing actions have consequences.
This is just silly. The Brits while around tried between ww1 to ww2 but were unwelcome and revolted against. So on the 1 hand accusing them of colonisation then blame them because they left? (While installing new governments and supporting them) It's a lose/lose situation. Sure it resulted in chaos but i don't see any other possible scenario where it wouldn't have considering the elements involved at the time.
