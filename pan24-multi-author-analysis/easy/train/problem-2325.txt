Fun fact, Russia unanimously voted to give up the lease of Sevastopol (because they now control all of Crimea). When Ukraine retakes Crimea, Russia loses Sevastopol as well, and they gave it up themselves.
Nuclear weapons were researched and developed in multiple countries simultaneously. The USSR was developing their atomic program and it was a few years behind the Americans, but they were going to develop the technology regardless of any espionage.
Lol. Its not about gas and oil at all. They got whole fucking Siberia full of that. Its about access to black and mediterranean sea. Which if Russia loses Crimea will be lost forever. And occupied by USA which will Russia never let happen. (E: Unless they totally lose).
Unfortunately you‘re probably right. Only someone from within the current power structure can remove him and assume power without a civil war/total collapse. But I have a feeling that we won’t necessarily like whoever comes next, none of the people currently in power strike me as particularly sensible.
