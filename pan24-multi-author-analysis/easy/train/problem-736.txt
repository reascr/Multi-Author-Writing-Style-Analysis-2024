If the R’s only hold a 1 vote majority in the House, then I imagine that House D’s would be willing to pay a pretty high price to flip just one single R. Start with the most moderate R in the House, and then work through the list until you find a taker. They could decide who would become speaker (maybe themselves), and get all the pork barrel spending for their district they could handle.

Oh, absolutely. I agree. And if the repubs in Congress, or anywhere else for that matter, think trump is just going to fade away, they’re just as delusional as his base.
Serious question. Suppose he gives in to the "Freedom Caucus" and permits the "motion to vacate the chair." Would Democrats be able to leverage that to interfere with the inevitable impeachment attempts? Just trip the speaker onto his dumb face at every opportunity? They know--if they end up in the minority--that they're not going to win the Speaker seat, but they're still members of congress and they can still call the vote.
