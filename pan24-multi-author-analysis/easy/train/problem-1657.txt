Pence is saying this 2 years later, after the midterms. He waited until the official party line changed to cast Trump aside and is dutifully putting a face to that madness. He kept quiet for months about the event, while investigations were ongoing, while the GOP tore into Cheney for heading the committee, while they abandoned key party officials who dared say Trump had tried to lead an insurrection, because it was convenient. The party tried to play down Jan 6th because it served their political aims, and after the debacle that the midterms became they are trying to pivot hard away from him and lay the blame solely on Trump. Make no mistake, these interviews are the most cowardly, calculated, cynical attacks on Trump simply because they think he is no longer useful to them.
Exactly! At least should have thrown his weight behind Liz Cheney, endorsed her or something to get her re-elected. Instead stayed behind the political curtains until the rest worked to clear some fog of uncertainty, then making his appearance. Sorry, Liz over Pence at all times.
