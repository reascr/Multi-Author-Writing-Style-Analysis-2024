The government caused this explosion in prices through their intellectual property rules/patent protection for biologics. There is a government-sponsored oligopoly in the insulin market - there is absolutely no competition, and there never will be. Most pharmaceuticals come off patent about 9-12 years after they are commercially available. Insulin never does. Humalog from Eli Lilly was commercially available in 1996. Over 25 years ago. The price has gone up from about $70 to $300. That is simply not possible unless something is allowing that to happen, and that thing is the US regulatory and IP environment. These are monopolistic practices and long-term monopoly can only exist with government support. A lot of this was actually well intentioned to stimulate the biotech industry. There are millions of people employed in the high-tech biotech sector and this was done to stimulate the massive investment needed. There are a lot of really really good biotech drugs that would not exist without it. Catch 22.
The problem exists because of current regulations/standards, high barriers to entry, abuse of a patent system, built in monopolies, imperfect markets and direct to consumer advertising.
We did. But building those facilities and hiring staff takes time. Then expanding capacity to make the a difference across the country will take years.
