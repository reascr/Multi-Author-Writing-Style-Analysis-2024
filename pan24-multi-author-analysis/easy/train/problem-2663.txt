Drill instructors then make you all do jumping jacks next to each other because they know that it will knock CS gas off your uniforms and re-gas everyone in the formation. Continue to do jumping jacks while being gassed. Drill instructors try not to laugh.
When Ford ratified the Geneva Convention in 1974, the United States established implementation policy that prohibits use of CS gas in warfare except in very narrow circumstances (to control prisoners of war; to prevent civilian casualties in riots, and in rescue missions).
I get it. I thought the same thing. When you go through basic training your exposed to it and taught to deal with it (as best as one can). Then you learn why it’s banned, where you can and can’t use it. Basic the law of war as applied to an American(and there’s a lot of law).
Seriously. I worked for a company bottling military grade pepper spray, at the end of shift someone would put on protective gear and a gas mask and sweep the room while the fans were on full blast.
