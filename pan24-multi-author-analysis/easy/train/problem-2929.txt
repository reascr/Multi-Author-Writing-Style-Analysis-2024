Actually no. The US also has drones that spoof the radar signatures of different aircraft and even multiple aircraft in formation. So while there's a golf ball on your screen there's also a flight of F15s escorting a heavy bomber wing that grabs your attention. So you turn on active radar defense weapons to get the lock and suddenly you get an F35 launching anti radar missiles at your AA systems from out of no where (I'm not aware if the F22 normally having ground attack options). If you can manage to launch any interceptor craft then the F22 will appear out of no where to take them out.
Supermaneuvrability isn't what makes these aircraft. It's the electronics. Better sensors, stealth characteristics, electronic warfare, and fusing all the data into a coherent picture to reduce pilot attention demands.
