I'm not sure who should be doing what in Ukraine or how much can be justified but it's nice to see the Saudis come to the table on the right side of this. Most people act like they have forgotten the Iraq War, but a popular question back then was "Why aren't we attacking Saudi Arabia?" Here's your answer. They are on our side. And the list of middle east nations that are on our side is pretty short. They're not kicking out billion dollar weekly allowances like we are, but this is a different kind of assistance. They are sending fuel. That's something that's hard to do from here. The Saudi's are the last chance for gas for us in that part of the world. We're probably ultimately still the one's paying for this, but this is more than payment. How much money you have in the bank isn't very important when your when you're stuck in the middle of nowhere when your car is out of gas. Gas is more useful than gold on the battle field.
While official Saudi government money did not fund Al Qaeda, much of the funding for that organization did come from the Saudi Kingdom and an overwhelming majority of the hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi subjects/citizens. To say that Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with it was wrong too. Osama bin Laden himself was from Saudi Arabia and his personal fortune came from Saudi oil too.
interesting. i seem to remember being concerned that because we are trying to uncouple from saudi, that we were effectively pushing them to russia.
