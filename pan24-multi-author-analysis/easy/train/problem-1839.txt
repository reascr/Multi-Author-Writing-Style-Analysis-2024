They’re removing the literature to removing anything that is not Jim Crow/American Apartheid style reading. Anything black or anything that is considered minority or to be bluntly they want the focus on white(as a social construct not just skin colors as white isn’t a monolith) male centered content and heroism. There has always been highly intelligent people who lead movements to oppress people, which normally starts with oppressing literature. See Hitler, etc. They seek loyalty, they remove knowledge from people, they control media, they control the money, then politicians, and they display to the people nobility. For example, after Brown v Board of education, so that white kids weren’t taught by Black Principals, school districts all over replaced those leading black schools with white staff and principals. In most cases they were severely undereducated but those individuals followed orders. Example, In Fort Valley GA, the principal of their high school was black and had a PHD. They were replaced by…..the local Milkman. In Florida they’re stopping away many of the qualifications teachers are required because all they want are puppets.
