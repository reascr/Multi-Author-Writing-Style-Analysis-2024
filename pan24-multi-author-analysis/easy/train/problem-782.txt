That's the point, no one is hyped. No one cares really. We usually talk and discuss the upcoming world cup. Make bets about winners and teams that go out early. It's complete silence now. Like there is no event at all. Feels like everyone will just skip it.
Conditions on World Cup and major infrastructure sites vastly improved due to the justified focus on World Cup projects and also major international construction companies bringing modern western ways with them and implementing good practices.
Most of them don't! It's more about projecting a good image so that their brand remains marketable. So that they can earn more through that whenever their football career is done. I feel most of it is a PR stunt, extremely sad.
An example of weighted systems not working is rugby union, which resists pressure to do anything that doesn't favour the same 10 teams (who have voting rights equivalent to the rest of the world, and tend to vote as a bloc), right the way down to world cup qualification processes being rewritten whenever one of the "important" teams doesn't auto-qualify for the next one.
I am not feeling it. Every WC or Euro we make plans with friends, get together to watch games, bbqs outside. Now that it's in winter I am not even sure if we will get together for the final. I probably won't watch a game and I've watched most WC games for decades. Feels like it will be a complete skip.
Those numbers were taken from a guardian story years ago predicting deaths in World Cup stadiums, those figures were taken from total deaths extrapolated over the years from award in 2010 to 2022, per migrant population for all migrants, man, woman or child and workers of all professions. So 12 years of deaths for all migrants blamed on World Cup stadiums.
