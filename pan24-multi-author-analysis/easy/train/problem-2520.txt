Then you have Bernie Sanders, who sometimes has others align with him (AOC & co), but really, Bernie stands alone on most issues. If people were better educated in economics, I believe Bernie would have a much larger following. Even Charles Koch relented that, and I’m paraphrasing, “if we’re not going to fix cronyism, and attempt to practice democracy, and equality as the founding fathers intended, why wouldn’t everyone just vote for Bernie?” Obligatory, fuck the Koch’s. Bernie’s vision for how a government should function in a capitalist global economy, under the current geo-political situations, is pretty astute. I don’t agree with everything, but his end-goal truly is equality, and freedom. The closest representation to what I believe the founding fathers intended. He see’s the reality of who the American people are really up against (Wall-Street), and he tries to fight that fight.
Really? Remember when he tried to have the CNN journalists removed from his "Presidential Addresses" because he didn't like their questions? They had to sue the fool to get back in.
