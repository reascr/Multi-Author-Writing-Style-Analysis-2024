Desantis is way more blatant about creating scapegoats. All this “groomer” rhetoric happened after Trump was out of office and he was never smart enough to come up with it. Trump enacted the plan to separate families at the border, but he didn’t come up with it and never talked about it publicly. Desantis and Abbott conspired to send asylum seekers to vacation islands in the north with no services, and even to Nancy Pelosi’s house. As a cruel stunt. He pushed the “groomer” rhetoric. He scapegoats people who are the least visible in society because they have no power to fight back and because it’s safe for his supporters to hate them. The new Right have the potential to be the most evil force we’ve seen in the country since race riots and Jim Crow.

Fascinating. We had a similar incident happen in Canada (roncarelli v duplessis) that is nowadays pretty fundamental law to limiting government administrative overreach. Shame the same power doesn’t exist in the US.
