Exactly. It's ridiculous that people see a comment like this, jump on it with upvotes, push it to the top...and not even realize that no one had made such an accusation out of nowhere.
Antisemitism. When you pretend that this word refers to all speakers of a Semitic language when historically this has absolutely never been the case. You're basically 'all lives matter'ing anti Jewish hatred. That word is very specific. It was popularised in the late nineteenth century to replace the previous term, judenhass (Jew hate.) The reason, because this was a new rational world and so if you wanted to sell Jew hate it had to come across as rational and 'scientific.' This is right around the time that eugenics is becoming popular and racists are attempting to 'scientifically' prove their bullshit. There's a massive shift in the tone of anti Jewish prejudice around that time that changes the focus from justifying itself on religious grounds, to focusing on the negative qualities of the 'Jewish race.'.
