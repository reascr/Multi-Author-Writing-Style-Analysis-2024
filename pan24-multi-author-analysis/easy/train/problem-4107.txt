I mean the guy is what? 70-something, overweight, diapers, dementia, syphilitic, and he was hospitalized with COVID-- they're clearly just hoping to run out the clock and not have to deal with it.
Interesting. I would never have believed that was the same person. Not that I was bowled over but the pence of today is completely lifeless. He looks dull, he seems dull, he projects emptiness. Not even so much evil as too vacant to know right from wrong.

At this point, it just occurred to me, the National Archives may actually be looking for specific documents; so, prior to Trump, they probably had a more lackadaisical review process, but since Trump left, they realized scores of scary important documents were missing (nuclear secrets have been confirmed to have been stolen by Trump, that much we know so far); they must still be missing shit, and are probably working through a timeline for who had access to what, and if Biden and Pence come out clean, I but they search more Trump properties again. Bonus prediction, I will guarantee Trump has more documents and has been selling access to them.
