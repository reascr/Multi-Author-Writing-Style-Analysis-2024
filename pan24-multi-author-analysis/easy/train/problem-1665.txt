In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Uhhhh. Yes we did. 4 times. We also defaulted on war bonds sold to service members and their families during ww2 after the war was over. The only ones hurt by that default were veterans and their families.
Seriously. I think the Super Bowl fixed that whole situation. Look at how the media blasted the shit show in the airports. And basically the shut down was shutting down the biggest event of the year for money.
Exactly. It's a problem that congress creates for itself. Congress passes a budget which is a list of things the president has to spend money on. The president can only spend money we have in the treasury and when there isn't enough (which has been the case for over 20 years) he has to take on debt. It's like telling an employee to order lunch for the office and then refusing to let them use the company credit card.
