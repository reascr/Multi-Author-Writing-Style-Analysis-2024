Relative low levels of inequality (Scandinavia), great baseline affluence (US, and even then...), and the presence of friendly and co-operative democracies around you when you don't meet the preceding criteria (eg France / Germany supporting Spain / Portugal in the 70s/80s) and lack of neighbours who want you to go down a different path (eg Russia as regards Hungary) seem to be a good starting point as a criteria.
