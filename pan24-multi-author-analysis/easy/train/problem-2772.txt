Now instead of Napoleon Dynamite trying to jump the English Channel with a sick jump, he's now only trying to jump the Grand Canyon.
Ukraine wins most protracted engagements, has won all their major operations, regained all territory it last since March(or nearly march), has gained the "initiative", developed an unprecedented position of standing in the international community, a military that increases in strenh/capability every week and perhaps most importantly Ukraine has nearly entirely unified and coalesced into a unified national identity.
Fat Boy is obsolete, too. It would still help Ukraine win this war. We won't give that to them, either.
\+ all Russians garrisons being thrown and wasted in Ukraine even from hot spots like Kuril Island garrison amid tensions with Japan, Caucassus garrison amid Russian ally Armenia being defeated by Azeri forces, Finland border garrisons and Arctic Brigade amid Finland and Sweden NATO accession, whole Kaliningrad 11th Army Corps leaving Kaliningrad defenceless against Poland - basically leaving 100% Russian borders defenceless.
It's still stupidly impossible for anyone to challenge them. But it's not as stupidly impossible as it was.
Still enough to hold whole Russian military cleaning last Soviet warehouses including WHOLE Russian ground forces with VDV, Spetsnaz, 1st Guards Tank Army, 29th Combined Arms Army, 35th Combined Arms Army, 36th Combined Arms Army, 6th Air and Air Defence Forces Army, 8th Guards Combined Arms Army, 20th Guards Combined Arms Army, 22rd Army Corps, 58th Combined Arms Army.
