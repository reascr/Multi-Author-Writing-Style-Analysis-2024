>"This is the 21st Century and to have skilled workers being denied sick leave, even unpaid sick leave, is unconscionable," DeFazio told Bloomberg Government. "Freight rail companies are watching their record profits, 'Oh my God, if we give people paid sick leave our stock might drop by a dollar.' Give me a break.".
A wildcat strike means that the workers and union lose the protections they would be afforded under the Railway Labor Act, and the rail companies would be free to discipline the workers as if they just didn't show up to work, as opposed to participating in a protected strike action.
What scabs? It's my understanding that non union rail companies in the US are pretty much non existent. This isn't like when Starbucks people go on strike. This is a large, highly skilled laborforce. You can't just hire people off of the streets and throw them in a locomotive.

Totally different industries. Back when Reagan did that, they had armed forces air controllers step in and fill the gap for the fired workers. There is no similarly trained group of armed service members that know how to run trains.
