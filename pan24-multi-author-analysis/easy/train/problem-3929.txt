The Republican governor of North Carolina tried to band transgender people from using the restrooms they should be using. He got voted out because of that. For some reason people seem to think transgender is some new thing. These gender market changes have been around since the 1970’s. Also as far as we know transgender people have been playing sports since the 1970’s. Probably even before then. Not everyone transitions and tells everyone. Transgender surgeries started in the 1920’s. Now because some maga moron has no platform they want to try attacking transgender people because most people don’t know anything about them or their history. They take advantage of ignorant people. We had some guys at my work that are Hindu Indian, they went to a strip bar and got ran because a bunch of maga morons were afraid of them because they “are Muslims” Get ‘em! They were not Muslim and who cares if they are.
You are deliberately misinterpreting my post. To most people, genocide is murder. Hence the word, destroy in the definition you provided.
Exactly. And every one of these state-level measures would become federal if/when the GQP regains the White House and Congress.
