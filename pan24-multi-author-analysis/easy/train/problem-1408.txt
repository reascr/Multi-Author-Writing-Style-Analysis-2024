Not every non-religious person is logical and no where have I said that. Now I can't think of a non-logical think that I think (I would say it's pretty weird if I could because if I knew it was not logical I wouldn't think it, and if it's indeed illogical I'll change my view). People can have different opinions sure, but people can not have different facts. And the fact is we don't know that there is a god. Someone saying there is, is not logical. If that non-logical thing then creates a whole lot of bad in society, that non-logical thing isn't just non-logical. It's bad. All that good stuff, why do we need religion for it? As soon as a relgion attaches rules to it, it's just plain insanity. You want to believe in ''something'' because the not knowing is to hard for you? Fine. Don't make up rules and try to force them on others because of your uncomfortability with not knowing.
