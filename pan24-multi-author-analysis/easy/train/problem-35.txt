It's always about money. I think that is your typical legalized political corruption. This business with Trump and congress feels different. It directly benefits Trump, his buddies, Russia's Ukraine invasion, and indirectly the rest of the world's totalitarian regimes.
Maybe. Or more realistically, this is what happens when dumb people think they are smart. Saw a chance to flex the power they think they have- and in the short time it is working. Problem is they haven’t thought about what comes next. The curious.piece is who is going to be the hand of justice? Does the turtle care enough to put the train back in the tracks ? Or maybe he lets them fracture, essentially putting democrats in the drivers seat and then uses that as a opportunity to wash the stink of stupid out of the party.

Exactly - fucking idiots. I cannot imagine them getting anything done worth anything while they control the house except investigations into everything and everybody - Biden’s, Fauci, Spending, Ukraine, Afghanistan Pull-out, etc etc.
