Yep. I can’t believe it’s almost 2023 and this sub is still posting “experts say…” articles about Trump’s criminal actions. That shit hasn’t mattered since 2017, at least. Expert opinions are completely irrelevant when it comes to this guy.
That involves a poorly run program by a law enforcement agency to allow guns to knowingly be sold to members of Mexican drug cartels or their surrogates in the United States and then the guns were allowed to go across the border into Mexico with the intention of catching the guns and purchasers in Mexico so then law enforcement officials could hopefully catch some of the higher up members of the Drug Cartels?
I am so sick of hearing this. How about NO ONE say anything about Trumpo being charged, indicted, arrested, tried, or finally brought to justice UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY BRING THE FUCKER TO JUSTICE. I've been hearing "we've got him NOW" for the past six fucking years. It's gotten pretty old.
