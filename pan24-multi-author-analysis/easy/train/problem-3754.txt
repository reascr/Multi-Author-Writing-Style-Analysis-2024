A great recent example is Google trying to keep its water usage along the Columbia River confidential. They have more money than some small countries and they had an iron grip on the state and local governments until The Dalles, a small farming community, refused to stop pushing for accountability and forced their local leadership to push back. Now that this drought stricken community knows that the server farms are using 1 billion gallons annually, Google is in serious trouble and definitely going to see major water conservation legislation leveled at them. And that’s not an empty threat. People will draw guns over water rights out here. It’s no joke.
Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why it is important to be optimistic and we are chipping away at the problem, but really all the evidence shows the worse is yet to come, things are going to get a lot worse before they get any better, and to be clear what we are doing right now is not enough to make things empirically better in the future. We have to be capturing carbon now at a colossal rate, not just reducing emissions, in order to stop the catastrophe coming.
Not necessarily. There are plenty of land use models that don’t involve destruction of habitats or that preserve vital habitats and pathways for animals. We’re also at a moment in time where restructuring out communities, especially urban communities, is viable and very necessary anyway, so this is a good time to implement them.
