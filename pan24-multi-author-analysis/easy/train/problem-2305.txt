The thing is, if we can get any kind of long-term constant thrust going, then the issue is mostly one of economic feasibility. Even a little ion engine can do the trick if you get enough of them and enough nuclear fuel to keep it consistently going. We already pretty much CAN do it, but the question is, can we afford to do it? As in, can we literally get enough materials and labor together to get the job done and do it while in orbit. How many astronauts do we have who can do space engineering? It takes thousands of folks to assemble things on the ground, but we would likely have to assemble this in space. That means a big honkin' station.
If you needed to accelerate or decelerate (deceleration is extremely difficult to do at near lightspeed), you would basically need to spend at least several months "building up" to the maximum speed, and in the last 2 or so light years you'd need to immediately decelerate (because it would require an extremely long "interstellar runway" of sorts to gradually slow down).
