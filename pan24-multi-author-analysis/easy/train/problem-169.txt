Cool. So strangle Russian economy more and propper this time, and send more weapons to Ukraine to deal with new Russian recruits.
It's basically impossible to measure. Hard dollars, probably billions in lost equipment and expended ordinance. In terms of economic damage? Depends on how long the war drags on and the conditions under which it ends, but could be upwards of several trillion in lost economic opportunities, brain drain(both via emigration and mobilizing educated people one to send them to the grinder), and actual damage from Ukrainian military/internal sabotage(Kerch bridge, the oil pipelines exploding, the smoking accidents in factories).
They did. Hence they are closely watching what's going on. Basically it looks like February last year, but less troops are at the direct route to Kiyv than in the western part. There additional 20k Ru troops training in the northern part of Belarus - if they start to move south - it will mean their training is over. The current estimate is 2 days to prepare the concentration on the exit positions. And that's how much time Ukraine will have to react.
