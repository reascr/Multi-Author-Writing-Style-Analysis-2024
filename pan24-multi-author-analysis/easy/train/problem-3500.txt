My best guess would be on Kadyrov forming a semi-autonomous region to rule on his lonesome, nominally still part of the RF but in actuality more of a client state. Should Putin die the RF would likely become very unstable, meaning that being under the direct control of the central government would be a dangerous position to be in, and it would probably be the best move to try become independent to play all sides in order to come out ahead without directly establishing a faction and placing a target on oneâ€™s back, or trying to make a move for independence and having everyone gun for him.
Not quite the same. The people who were recruited into the first crusades did so with the promise that they would be guaranteed a place in heaven and all of their sins forgiven. They were also being told that they were fighting for God.
Corruption. Finding out the hard way that everything is based on thievery & getting one over on the next unsuspecting fool. Inspiring life ehh? North America has its issues but, being an American in a small rural area I've been thinking a lot how grateful I am for that.
