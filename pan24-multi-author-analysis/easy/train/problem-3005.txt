There’s other info on the page, you can see if you follow link. It mentions other POWs, that they’ve been fed, taken care of in a humanitarian manner. And there’s repeated info about Geneva. The Russians know that “Geneva conventions” means basically that are fed, get medical treatment, not tortured—they know because they’re told that Russia abides and Ukraine does not. The biggest hurdle is to get them to trust the unknown (Ukraine) when only have been presented picture that it’s evil. But when they’re pushed far enough (mistreated by commanders, freezing, etc), many are willing to take the gamble that maybe what they heard was untrue and surrender is a better option.
Excellent article. Probably the best I've read on this war. I particularly liked the insight it gives into the Ukrainian air force and how it survived the early phase of the war.
- Important! All those who voluntarily surrender will be issued as ‘captured in battle.’ This is to protect military personnel from possible criminal prosecution upon return to their country.
No. Russian opposition is more sophisticated. If Pootin was winning they would have boasted about helping poor Ukrainian people that are struggling “in this difficult situation”. We are lucky they are not in power. They are the same, but more subtle.
