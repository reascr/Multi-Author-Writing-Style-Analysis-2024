It is a catastropheâ€¦.for Russia. It is hard to see how they will exit this war in a better position than when they entered it. They have wiped out 30 years of progress in relationships with the rest of Europe. They have spent/lost countless billions and it will take decades to make it back (if ever). Worst of all is that they have exposed themselves. Nobody is going to respect the Russian military after this debacle. Once the bully gets punched in the face, others will no longer put up with it. It has been a tragic miscalculation by Putin. They may win some minor gains somehow if they can maneuver for a negotiated peace by drawing it out for a very long time. But more likely, they will be in a state of perpetual occupation of Ukrainian states, but it is hard for me to see how the west will capitulate and allow a negotiated peace. Regardless, any gains will pale in comparison to the damage done. Russia has screwed themselves here in a very big way.
Yeah seriously! How pathetic and stupid does someone have to be to start a war and then throw a temper tantrum and complain that their enemy is fighting back??
