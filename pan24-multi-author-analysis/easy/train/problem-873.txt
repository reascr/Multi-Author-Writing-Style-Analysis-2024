And I wouldn't be shocked if they supply them with drugs before combat, the way they do with child soldiers in Africa. These guys are all disposable mercenaries and Russia wants them fighting like berserkers because the only thing they've got going for them at this point is sowing terror. Plus they've had issues with their own troops cutting and running away from combat, so drugging up the mercenary forces made of convicts and mental patients will go a long way towards making sure they fight and do it in a way that could demoralize the enemy.
autopsy??? you live in a fantasy land. They aren't even picking up the bodies anymore, and the dead get torn apart where they fall by packs of dogs when the shooting dies down. War is hell. This war is hell. Its a horror in reality, not some clean tidy police procedural TV drama.
Definitely. And the 39 date is around when meth was synthesized using the birch reductionthat made it a viable means of production, before that they all just used regular amphetamines.
