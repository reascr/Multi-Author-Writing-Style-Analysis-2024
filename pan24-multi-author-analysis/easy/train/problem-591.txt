If you're talking about ww2, horses in the early war were still able to win battles like in . The charge of a calvary brigade against a tank division is actually a nazi propaganda myth influenced by the , where a polish cavalry division charged and dispersed a german infantry battalion before armored cars forced the polish to retreat, however it still caused enough delay to allow the polish to retreat.
Wrong. It is still in service with the Bundeswehr. Granted, the rifles are now in use by ceremonial troops only (which only recently noticed that some of their arsenal still carried the swastika on it, yikes) but these guns still hold their promise. If you can see it, you can hit it. Which is all that's needed for a great marksmen rifle.
The K98 Rifle is a great example of this. It was made in 1898. At the time it was considered so good that it gave the german empire significant diplomatic influence because they could decide who had access to this rifle and who didn't. The selling point of it was "If you can see it, you can hit it" which wss not something you could say about many other rifles of the time.
