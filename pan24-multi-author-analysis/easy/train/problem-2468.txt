There’s some narrative that America was much better during the time of the robber barons and unregulated free markets. Trickle down or horse and sparrow theory was what they sold to the common man. Then FDR came along and they couldn’t get away with accusing anyone who wanted even a minimal safety net a communist. Meanwhile, the history of labor in 20th and 21st century America has been a battle for labor to get meaningful improvements in benefits and job security and safety from begrudging management, while management and CEOs try to increase their profit margin through loopholes in their concessions.
Correct. They're just smart enough to grift their way into government, but just stupid/dull/base enough to fail at the job. How many middle managers have you known like this?

Conservatives cling to hierarchies. With the God-ordained elite (white rich males) at the top, everyone else below. It's their job to perpetrate (and justify) the scam by punishing the out-groups and enriching the aristocracy (themselves).
