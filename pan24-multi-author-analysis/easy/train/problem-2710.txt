Really? In a thread about a woman being pardoned for killing her husband because she was abused for 20 years you are calling her abusive for being human and reacting to abuse. His abuse started in 2012 and his claims (despite previously saying he was never abused) don’t start till 2015. And no, it did not “all come out” in the circus show of a trial, in which the judge refused to allow all medical evidence of the abuse and yet allowed his lawyers to claim there was none. There is a reason he settled after she submitted an appeal. He would have lost. I recommend reading the transcripts from the UK trial, the judgement includes reams of text messages and evidence not allowed in the trial in the US for reasons that were shredded by the appeal.
