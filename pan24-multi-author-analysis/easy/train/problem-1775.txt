100% agree with your last paragraph and there is no doubt fb and ad revenue driven media has made it much worse, but the insane stuff I was thinking about is like "poor people probably deserve to be poor" or "non-white people are inherently inferior" or "my particular brand of Jesus is the only one that will keep you out of hell".
Good chance? That's ridiculous. He couldn't steal the election when he had the power of the presidency, a web of government co-conspirators in several states, a violent mob of loyalists, and the element of surprise. He and his inner circle tried every scheme they could imagine and they still failed. Now the DOJ has their phones and computers and shitloads of testimony about everything they discussed and attempted, and the public has a lot of it too. Even if some of these fuckers aren't already indicted by 2024, do you really think these fuckers are going to work with him on this again, with all eyes on them and the FBI breathing down their necks? You think these fuckers have any better ideas than what they already tried? If they did, do you think he could trust any of them not to be informing on him as part of their plea deals? You think Trump has even 10% the leverage he had when he was president?
