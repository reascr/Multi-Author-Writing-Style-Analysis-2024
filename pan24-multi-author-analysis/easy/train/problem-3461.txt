Have you ever heard the thing about technology venture capitalists who invest in 10 different companies and 1 makes a small ongoing profit, 7 flame out altogether, and 2 make the investor enough money and then some, to make up for any losses?
... OK... But the issue with American tech companies is the rate rises because they are uniquely, highly leveraged in a way that relies on cheap money to borrow. A lot of them had entire business strategies that revolved around high burn rates to grow user bases (Twitter, Facebook, Amazon marketplace and even some depts of Google and Microsoft) that are very reliant on the flow of cheap money. As soon as those rates went up, layoffs started because these companies have tons of business areas with very long term profitably windows that just won't survive without cheap money. This is further evidenced by how these tech companies survived perfectly find during covid, and most thrived. They aren't beholden to the issues the rest of the world is dealing with.
