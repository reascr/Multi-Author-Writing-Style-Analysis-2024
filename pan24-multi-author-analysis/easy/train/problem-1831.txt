2. The bombing of Japanese civilians - few of whom may be described as fully innocent, as this was a war of nations and not of armies - was a horrific trolley problem resolved in the less deadly manner. Had the war gone on longer - which it would have if the bombings (I refer here to both the fire raids and the atomic bombings) had not been carried out - many more Japanese civilians would have died at their own hand. Everyone should read the chilling accounts of the survivors of the fire raids and the nukes, and also the accounts of the survivors of the massacre of Okinawa and other islands. Stories of people boiling alive in canals (Tokyo) are horrifying, but so are stories of two young children beating their mother to death because they were convinced she would be pressed into sex slavery if the Americans captured them.
Exactly. They donâ€™t trust the government to provide basic services, but they do trust the government to deliver justice and decide whether someone deserves to die or not. Very weird thinking to me.
Accepting responsibility =/= absolving responsibility. He accepted responsibility, but that doesn't absolve him of it. And execution by the state is not the only form of recourse.
