Combine that with a strategy that actually calls out the Republic an party on the last 50 years following Jude Wanninski's two Santa Claus Theory in order to explain how the system has been gamed not only against their parents but also them in the pursuit of enriching massive corporations over creating sustainable infrastructure.
