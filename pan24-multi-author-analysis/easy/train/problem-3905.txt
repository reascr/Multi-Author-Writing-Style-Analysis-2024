Not the worst part by far. The political corruption you speak of is intimately connected to media and academia, all of whom are bought and sold by the corporate sector responsible for the political corruption, so they both end up churning out propaganda and disinformation supporting the corruption. The Kochs called this tactic a "beachhead”, and they would setup shop pushing this nonsense on university campuses, who would in turn provide talking heads and pundits that would appear in the media as credentialed experts connected to so-called "think tanks" to push propaganda promoting the original corruption. The effect was similar to what we call regulatory capture, except instead of capturing governments, they would capture newspapers, television outlets, publishing houses, universities, law schools and foundations. The focus on the universities was especially insidious because with scholarships and fellowships they insured that their special brand of corruption would be passed on to the next generation. The closer you look at what they’ve done, the more evil it appears. Read Merchants of Doubt, Dark Money, Shadow Network, and Democracy in Chains. It’s a well-oiled machine.

It worked.
