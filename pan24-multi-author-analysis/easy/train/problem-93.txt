The Bradley Fighting Vehicle uses diesel engines. The Bradley also destroyed more Iraqi tanks during the Gulf War than the Abrams did, mostly using the TOW missile. The TOW is integrated standard on the turret of the Bradley. The Bradley also has duel feed ammunition, so it can switch between high explosive ammunition and armor piercing ammunition. The Bradley isn't a tank, but it is very effective at infantry support, at destroying Russian armor, at driving over trenches. The standard training for a Bradley is just 8 weeks.
Ukraine isn’t doing any of the maintenance for the western equipment they are receiving so I’m not sure valid that argument really is, especially considering that everyone was shitting on Germany for citing that very same argument when it came to Leo2s and why they rather helped supply Ukraine with t72s instead of western tanks.
Ok? So send them now and start the training ASAP. Even if they don't learn 100% of what they could learn, it's still better for them to have the tanks than not have the tanks.
