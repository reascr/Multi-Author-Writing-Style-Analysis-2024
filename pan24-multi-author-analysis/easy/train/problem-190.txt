BUT, The war is very asymmetric, so defenses have very little value, especially tanks in defense. A couple of $300 consumer drones with basic AT hand grenades are taking out tanks costing $2-3M every day, along with 3-4 of the crew. And those same drones basically killed the concept of trenches that whole world found so useful in World Wars. So tanks are truly useful only in offense. That's also why many countries don't rush to offer tanks. But if war ever comes to them, those cheap drones would be the exact same, so it makes no sense. No country needs those tanks more than Ukraine does. And perhaps, after Ukraine-Russo war, nobody really needs any tanks. We're observing a totally new form of warfare where even rifles issued to infantry have basically zero use, save for taking PoWs, and most of the troops never see the enemy they destroyed or got destroyed by. It's 2023. A new era.
Serious question. How do the tanks being sent to Ukraine help them? It seems like all Russia is doing is lobbing missiles (indiscriminately) towards civilian targets. Wouldn't Ukraine benefit more from a comprehensive missile defense system rather than tanks?
