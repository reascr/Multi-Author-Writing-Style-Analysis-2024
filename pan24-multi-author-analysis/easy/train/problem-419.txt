English did it to the scotts, US did it to the natives Americans and Hawaiians. Its pretty vicious of a nation to tell people that their language and rituals are banned from use.
Misleading title. A Kurdish musician was denied permit for holding a concert under security reasons. This is an ongoing crackdown on what the ruling party in Turkey considers immoral. If you look up in this issue you’ll find out that this government regularly cracks down on concerts and festivals. This isn’t a solely ethnicity issue. It’s a social issue.
Since inception: after eliminating armenians and assyrians, the CUP and ataturk’s ideology was to assimilate kurds by denying their identity and officially calling them « mountain turks » as an official state policy.
I do see your point though. The title of the article is in itself misleading, it should’ve put it in context.
The headline is very inaccurate. They didn’t ban Kurdish music, they banned dozens of music festivals so also Turkish music.
It’s misleading because it takes it out of context and implies Turkey banned Kurdish music when in fact, Turkish government banned dozens of festivals where all sorts of performances were going to take place. Kurdish is not specifically targeted. If you read the comments, you’ll see that people have understood it exactly as intended which was Turkey is attacking Kurds again. That’s what makes it misleading.
This is an intentionally misleading post. OP is still not correcting the title despite being informed.
