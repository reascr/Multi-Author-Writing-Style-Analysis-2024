In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I dunno. Trump waffles bullshit where nothing he says makes sense and usually ends up miles away from the point he was trying to make e.g. nuclear speech. deSantis tries to sound like a normal person even though he's also talking bullshit but his sentences make sense in the context of the aforesaid bullshit.
Demographics aren’t destiny fellow. The only real answer is to VOTE. What you can do is to emphasize the accomplishments that Democrats managed in the last two and a half years: back in the Paris Climate Accord, passing bills for green energy, domestic microchips, helping sufferers of burn pits, leading the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, supporting a slow and steady recovery of the economy. And, of course, handling Covid to the point where I almost forgot to include it as a positive.
