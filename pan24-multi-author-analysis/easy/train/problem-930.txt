A lot of people seem to mix up the two (which also implies they think the constitution is a perfect reflection of their morals). People (even sheriffs) have a really shitty understanding of constitutional law so they should not be deciding to ignore laws based on their perception of constitutionality.
Bye, bye Snaza! Screw these holier than thou douchbags. This mentality is of the same stupid conspiracy thinking of sovereign citizens. Also why they see themselves as judge, jury and executioner. Most sheriffâ€™s offices are fascist as hell.
So your solution is to have even less accountability by putting the interpretation of constitutionality into one person's hands, who has no education in constitutional law, who doesn't hold that hearing in public court, and doesn't have adversarial representation presenting legal arguments on constitutionality of the matter?
They are not. However, because of Washinon's primary system (top two vote getters go on) there are two Republicans on the ballot for Sheriff. Songer hopefully loses because all Democrats vote against him as well as plenty of Republicans. That system might actually keep MAGA people out.
