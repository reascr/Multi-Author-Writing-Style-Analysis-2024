In Austria we had Sebastian kurtz who tried to build a dictator ship but he was caught red handed when he tried to intimidate the courts and trying to buy the biggest Austrian news paper. He is currently on trial.
Does that also apply to the American people who just want to live in peace, in control of their own bodies, religion; better their county, state, country, planet environmentally without intimidation; seek education through history, mathematics and science for the enlightenment and betterment of all. Is that what you’re advocating for in your statement honorable John Roberts? And does old Thomas share your view? Never in my 67yrs have I witnessed the hell unleashed in my country as by you sitting 6. JFK assassination, fucking Horrific MLK assassination, fucking Horrific Vietnam and Iraq wars, fucking Horrific! But you have helped top all that wicked fuckery, you have succeeded in turning Americans against Americans. Over AR’s, over a woman’s choice, over corporation contributions, over race, over open-carry, over voting rights, over environmental impact/respect.
