Balloons loiter, are somewhat difficult to detect due to their altitude and slow speed (radar), and can catch a site off guard. If you can catch a site off guard you can photo things you normally couldn’t. Government tracks all spy satellites so won’t expose new tech on ground if it’s doing a pass by. A balloon could catch then unaware and could lead to photos of secret planes, open silos, weapons tests, and so on. A lot of photos too since it’s over the area for a long time compared to a satellite.

Totally. And it's only because Trump controlled the federal government with an iron fist, having purged each and every subversive element, that we are only hearing about it now, from the one or two guys he didn't catch, who only right now decided to mention it, because they didn't really want to tarnish the Trump name except to put the current Joe Biden crisis in context. Facts.
