There are things that definitely were missed, but only some (those tied to public tweets of Santos's, Pulse victim claims) are easily verifiable and on the research team's shoulders for not getting. Employment and education history likely wouldn't be as willingly disclosed by Baruch/Goldman to someone who wasn't a journalist writing a story on the person, and stuff like his Brazilian check fraud required someone from the NYT physically flying out there to file public records requests - not something you'd go looking for on a campaign just on a hunch.
This has been driving me nuts too. Had the Suozzi or Zimmerman campaigns done even minimal research, they'd have started finding this stuff the week after the Republican primary was over. How fucking incompetent does a Congressional campaign have to be to just completely refuse to do even cursory opposition research?!?
