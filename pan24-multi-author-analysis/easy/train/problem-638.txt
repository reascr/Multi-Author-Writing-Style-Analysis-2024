This is how Russia has fought almost every one of their wars historically, and I wish analysts that came out and predicted this conflict unfolding exactly how it is had gotten more exposure. Russians never have a positive ratio with their service members, they always rely on easy to replace/mass produced equipment and have no problem throwing wave after wave until they slowly steamroll and exhaust their opponents.
Yes, unfortunately. I was speaking existentially, not factually, however. Suppose I just wonâ€™t ever ever understand that level of nationalistic fervor to invade and conquer over the cost of people, especially in this day and age.
Absolutely. We don't see and hear the same things Russians do, on the whole, because most Russians probably don't speak or read English, and outside of major cities, probably consume fairly limited media that comes from outside of Russia's borders (which is exactly how Putin needs it in order for his propaganda to work).
Fully agreed. All of these people saying "well if the Russians begin practicing effective combined arms doctrine" is a bit like what if your layabout pot smoking brother decided to hit the books and go to Harvard. We've not seen one instance of them following the proven military doctrine of the post WW1 era, so why would they start now? Forget why would they, they literally don't have the physical infrastructure or organizational structure to coordinate offensives like this. Russia couldn't establish air superiority on day 1 and now Ukraine has loaded up with numerous air defense systems including the one America trusts to defend the damn White House (NASMS).
