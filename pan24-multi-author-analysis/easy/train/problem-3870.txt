In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. In many places “the community”, state, whatever has demonstrably failed. Meanwhile I have kids that need an education RIGHT NOW, not whenever the government gets around to fixing the problem.
Absolutely. Just like when we look at maps for election results. Just because most of the map looks red, doesn't mean they had more votes. It is about the people, not the land.
“At a meeting Tuesday, the board voted 5-1, along party lines, to ask the Legislature to require every charter management organization to post audit reports of its use of public funds, including information related to salaries, benefits, and contracts.”.
That's not the trap. You just accused me of keeping people in a system that doesn't work. You are hoping that there's some sort of magical fix to it in a private school. That's the bullshit of all this. There is no magic fix or escape. Local communities need to say that there's a problem. And then neighbors need to recognize that that's a problem. It's not the government, the government is all of us, the people. The trap is people thinking that it's not their problem to fix it. That it's not their children that need help.
