The danger is blown out of proportion by people who don’t understand the context of the Fukushima disaster, nor Japan’s extremely effective anti-earthquake equipment installed in every building. The earthquake did not cause the disaster. The tsunami that overcame the seawall and flooded the backup generators in the basement did. If TEPCO had heeded warnings from years prior and built the seawall higher, no disaster. If the backup generators were placed above the first floor, no disaster. Every part of the accident was preventable and had nothing to do with the earthquake itself.
This is such incredibly irresponsible "journalism". Get the facts about nuclear power. It's the primary power source we should have been and should be seeking to use. Wind/Solar isn't going to be enough to desalinate the amount of fresh water we actually need to be producing instead of draining all the natural rivers and lakes. But no... "nuclear bad" ignorance like this piece of shit have kept us polluting with coal and oil for half a century.
