But not Donald. That's why the base loves him. He's not pretending, like DeSantis is. He's legitimately not clever enough to differentiate fact from fiction, and they can tell. As people who have been following the Fox Gospel all their lives, they at least can tell when people are pandering to them and when they're true believers, and Trump is a true believer.

The poor educational system in America has graduated people incapable of critical thought and zero intellectual curiosity or intellectual consistency. The idiots are able to be convinced that a $6 gallon of gas, despite worldwide shortages, must necessarily be the intention of evil Democrats, and the irony of those same idiots driving "coal rollers" that get 7 mpg escapes them. Murdoch, et. al. saw profit to be made by using America's own idiocy against itself in a kind of Stupidity Judo. And now America has fallen down and it can't get up, on account of the morbid obesity. Really, it's a glandular issue. Don't laugh. Just get my mobility scooter, goddamnit!
