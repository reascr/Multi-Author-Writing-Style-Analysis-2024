Once upon a time, the thought was I would have loved to go, visit the places my Grandfather visited and told me about. Now I do not see that ever happening. My grandfather was working at 14 years of age on a Siberian farm. (He was German and it seems his family had a wee bit of wanderlust as his other brothers were all over the place as well.) 12 bros and one sister. Only 4 of the brothers survived the war.As with many of us I wish I had asked him more of his time and life in Europe when he was growing up. However, he had deep nightmares all his adult life from things he saw in WW2 and was reluctant to talk of the past. The 4 brothers and 1 sister all immigrated to Canada in the early 50's.One of his stories was during the winter in Siberia, the snow was so deep and it was so cold that they didn't want to go outside. There was a tunnel dug from the farmhouse to the barn where they would tend to the horses and cows. During these times they all taught each other how to make shoes and such. It was pretty interesting.
