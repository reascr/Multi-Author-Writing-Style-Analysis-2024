Carbon monoxide (CO) is also a non-toxic asphyxiant when a high concentration of the gas is breathed, and is the reason many people accidently die when they run engines indoors for a lenh of time.
The air we breathe is already 78% Nitrogen, which is classified as an because it has no toxic effect on the body by itself, but if the pure gas is inhaled it will displace all the oxygen in the lungs and cause suffocation. This is different than carbon dioxide (CO2) which is also an asphyxiant when the pure gas is inhaled (causing suffocation), but also toxic because breathing it in lower concentrations , causing unease and illness.
Yep. Pentobarbital will just make you go to sleep and never wake up. And it costs a tiny fraction of the weird drug combo they use now that is made almost nowhere so there's often an inability to get it. And it apparently causes a lot of pain and discomfort. The point of the death penalty is not supposed to be punishment, it's supposed to be like putting a rabid dog down - it's someone the government has decided cannot be rehabilitated and is a threat to society. Making it painful is not helping anyone, it's just cruelty.
