I really don't think you know what communism is man. Also Putin hates Lenin. Also Putin's main source of inspiration for his takes, Ivan Ilyin, is a fascist philosopher that supports social darwinism which is pretty much the exact opposite of communism. Under Putin, socioeconomic disparities have continuously increased while socialism advocates for equal distribution of wealth to the people. Putin likes the USSR only because it was a superpower, not because of its system. He's more nostalgic about the old Russian Empire. To summarize, you should probably re-edit your first comment and replace "communist" with "fascist". Have a good one.
Seems a bit excessive, we don't hold the populations of democratic countries for the war crimes of their governments, and they have a much easier avenue to express and revolt against such action compared to Russia which has a history of blackbagging and conscripting protesters to die.
That is true. My point is mostly that it wouldn't even destabilize the country they would target. The democratic mechanism would simply play its role.
