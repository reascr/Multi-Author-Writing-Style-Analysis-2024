If they’re still allowed places like supermarkets, this actually would make sense because it’s somewhat harder to keep constant surveillance on what they do/say than in an open outdoor area. It’s a lot easier to go into the middle of a field somewhere to talk to the other wives while avoiding security cameras and guards than it is in a mall or restaurant (I’m guessing women are still allowed at grocery stores and banks and stuff because it would just be way too much inconvenience for the men if their wives couldn’t buy food and stuff to prepare for them, especially if it’s anything like India- I’m American and not very knowledgeable about that area of the world, but I’ve read that in India most people don’t even own fridges and buy fresh food every day usually. Men are not gonna want to have to go to the store every day to buy food).
Barbarians. Men who are so afraid for their power that they are ready to ban education for a good half of the population. Religion should be optional in our times, not formative for the country.
