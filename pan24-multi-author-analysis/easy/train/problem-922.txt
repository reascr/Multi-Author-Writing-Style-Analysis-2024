Some of them didn't think there would ever be a total ban. Most people's views on abortion are in the middle no matter if they vote red or blue. They are okay with first trimester abortion and lots of caveats after that, medical issues, birth defects, rape, incest, etc. The real difference between the parties is that Dems trust women and doctors to make ethical decisions on abortion so they don't see much need for a legislative role in setting limits in place. Republicans on the other hand have let the extremists run away with their platform amid their general lemming race to the right. So they have wound up backing near total bans on abortion which don't even have a majority of support within the party. Rhett enough voters across the spectrum turn out to register their disagreement is the question. I hope so but I'm steeling myself for disappointment. Between apathy and the obsession with "owning the libs" on the right no matter the personal cost, it looks dicey.
