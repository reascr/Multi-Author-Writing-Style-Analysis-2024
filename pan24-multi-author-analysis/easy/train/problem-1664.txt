If they made the wrong people mad or if this was planned by someone else bigger you may not hear about these 3 again. Big money doesn't like loose ends.
So I wander to r/Conservative and I will say 90% of their content is absolutely hypocritical garbage but you do see a few level headed right wingers questioning their batshit insane compadres for source etc, I think at one point 80% of their threads were about Bidens sensitive docs which his team is complying 100% with the FBI and rectifying the issue every step of the way. And it was 100% silence with Trump after one big flared users only thread.
Yeah, at least in the US, this is mostly a result of a few major factors: 1) gerrymandering creating very safe districts for extremists 2) spiraling economic inequality making extremists more appealing 3) political parties realizing they gain nothing by compromising with the other side because their safe districts mean they only have to appeal to the base.
Because right wingers force it down to this level. Right wingers/fascists are the worst scum on Earth. They are the source of many of our biggest problems.
