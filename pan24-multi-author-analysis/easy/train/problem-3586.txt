You completely missed the point. It does not matter to them if you show them one mangled fetus that ends up killing the mother because they truly believe they are saving millions of lives with their anti abortion stance.
It’s not that they don’t care, it’s that they truly believe millions of babies are being saved. If I believed that I would surely think the same way. These people aren’t all evil, they are just stupid.
I sincerely appreciate your empathy. We need more of this. I a have a family member who was a vehement COVID denier and anti vaxxer. He almost died and is now tethered to an oxygen bottle. Wife and kids got vaxxed on the QT. Hamstrung the rest of his life. It amazes me how "small government" folks are willing to enforce how the rest of us live, but sure do want flood, hurricane and tornado relief and want to send our people to brown countries as a weapons testing ground without limits of in addition to somehow being against letting Medicare negotiate prices. Gonna need joint pain medication from the gymnastics. We can do better.
