Our poorest homeless have better lives than some of the richest people in certain parts of india. That is simply unacceptable for a nation that wishes to claim it is the peak of human rights and above being investigated. <3.
It amazes me how many burger-flipping minimum wage working Americans think that India is cheap af because they can only afford traveling to the slums and hoods after losing their life savings booking a plane ticket to India and can't even see the actual lifestyle India has to offer because they're poor as shit and can't afford it, then go back to their country and spread the word to their fellow basement-dwellers about how dirty and poor India is lmao I'm pretty sure I live a way better life than you do.
Buddy. I'm implying that people like you saying India doesn't have severe uman rights issues and that America is "worse" are delusional. I don't have anything else to say about it you're literally just spouting drivel if you try to support the way life exists for the poor in p much any southeast Asian nation.
