My older kids are 24 and 26. When they were little they NEVER went trick or treating (Alaska) at Halloween bc it was also so nasty cold for a kid. 0 or 10 maybe 20. Just too cold. We went to the church “ harvest festival “ and that was indoors and lots of fun. Then one winter they were maybe 8 and 10 and I realized it was “ warm” enough, around 25 or so iirc. That’s the first time they went. And now Alaska is 47 and raining. And it’s November Unreal how it’s changed in just 20 years. And the rate of change is still accelerating. It’s an exponential scale. Doubling and doubling again. We ain’t seen nothing yet.
On a snowboard you're standing perpendicular to the direction you travel, so a lift design that skiers can sort of rest their arse against, is against the hip/thigh on a snowboarder, the take up is also abrupt, the design provides no stability beyond a dragging force and it's super easy for the board to get stuck in a rut and pitch you off.
Wow. I knew a lot of people died due to the arrival of European diseases, but had no clue it was that many. Didn't even figure that so many people lived there at all at that point in time.
