“Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Heres Tom with the Weather.”.
The maths certainly works out that way, with infinite time infinite arrangements of matter theoretically may be possible - especially with quantum mechanics which, let’s face it, we know very little about, i believe classical physics wouldn’t necessarily agree with that due to entropy, but, there’s ideas like the big bounce and then we really know nothing about time, and whether it could run backwards - it’s all very exciting. I’m not the authority on what I’ve just said, i study a physics degree at the moment so if there is anything to correct, please do!
Nucleobases are formed spontaneously from simple inorganic material under a variety of circumstances. You’d expect to find them relatively frequently, even in the absence of life.
