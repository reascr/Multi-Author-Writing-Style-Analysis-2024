Recordkeeping in the federal government is a tricky business, especially in higher levels of government like the White House. Any document, and I mean any document that contains even a hint of classified information is marked classified. If a 2-page briefing packet for the VP contains some offhand details drawn from a chain of intelligence summaries from classified primary sources, that packet and all related documents down the line will be marked at the same level of classification as the primary source, even though there would likely be little to no damage to national security if the packet was leaked. High ranking officials receive briefing packets like those all the time, probably faster than their secretaries can destroy them. The media is probably overhyping the story, like they usually do.
Absolutely! Biden wasn't actively trying to risk national security by hiding classified documents, yet classified documents were still discovered, even after his own lawyers did their own search. I can't imagine how many new documents would be discovered if they were able to search all of Trump's properties.
