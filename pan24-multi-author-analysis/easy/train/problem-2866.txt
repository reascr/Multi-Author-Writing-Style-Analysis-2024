I laughed when Putin called the Patriot missile system quite old. I wonder if anyone told him that the U.S. military and defense contractors don’t just build a weapons system and not continuously upgrade/modernize it. Take a look at the B-52 bomber for example. It first flew in the 1950’s. That model of plane has been flying over 70 years. The planes flying today are completely different and far more capable than the ones in 1950. The B-52 is a wonderful example of American ingenuity and was way over engineered when it was first built. It’s called rolling thunder for a reason! The US hasn’t even deployed the most modernized systems to Ukraine yet. Keep shit talking Putin, we have quite a bit more tools in the arsenal to try out.
Actually not that complicated. It’s called a “general withdrawal order”, it is, in effect, where u withdraw your combat troops from an area. And hostilities end. I know right no one has ever thought of this before?
It's unfortunately probably in the world's best interest to completely "sufficiently demilitarizate" Russia. Russia falling apart may be the only way humanity survives to the next century.
