I know Azerbaijan doesn't have thousands of nukes like Russia does, so the stakes aren't quite as high if the west ever decides to start caring about the Armenian genocide and decide to wean itself off of Azeri energy. However, what kind of message does this send to other developing nations around the world? It says that we will always put money ahead of our principles. Someone without principles cannot be trusted to act in any interest but their own. The less likely they are to trust us, the more likely they are to join the global order that China is trying to create. We aren't going to be able to just swing our bags of money around and bend the world to our will forever, and when that changes, I would like democracy to look like a better alternative to authoritarianism.
Isnt Russia partially occupying Georgia? Whats stopping them from pushing deeper if they're already in? Also Hungary isnt exactly a great ally and will likely use this connection against the EU in any future disagreements.
