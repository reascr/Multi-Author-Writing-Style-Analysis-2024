The acceleration of diversity and progressiveness is fueling the conservative and authoritarian reaction.
Hi, I’m a young person. I’ll never own a house or have kids. I’ll probably live with my parents longer than we’d both like. My repetitive, 9-5 job will continue to pay me the same amount while the price of everything continues to skyrocket. But I’m in college, pursuing my education and hopefully obtaining a degree that won’t help me much if I’m being honest. It’ll just leave me with a life-altering amount of predatory student debt. I’m pretty much being fucked on all sides, and the funny thing is that I’m rather fortunate. I know people in my generation that have it worse.
