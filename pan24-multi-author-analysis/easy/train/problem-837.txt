yes Disney no longer has to fund its infrastructure and urban development projects, but Disney also is no longer in control of its urban development and infrastructure projects. Until now Disneyâ€™s infrastructure and urban development projects were controlled by a board whose members Disney appoints. But now Desantis will appoint all of the board members that decide all infrastructure and urban development projects, eg, a plan to build a new theme park or hotel now requires the blessing of the Governor (via the board he appoints). Also until now Disney was exempt from numerous state regulations including building codes and land use rules. That is over now, which will cost Disney money.
