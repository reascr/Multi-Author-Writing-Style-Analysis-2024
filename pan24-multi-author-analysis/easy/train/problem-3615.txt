Perhaps the most important point that emerges from a review of all the opinions is this: only once has the United States addressed the question of whether a president can be an unindicted co-conspirator. The conclusion was an unequivocal yes. Richard Nixon was so named in the Watergate indictment, and that inclusion was sustained by Judge John Sirica and defended by the United States inÂ United States v. Nixon. (The Supreme Court did not resolve the question.) No department opinion or filing has ever contradicted that position. The fact that it is permissible to name a sitting president as unindicted co-conspirator, moreover, tends significantly to undermine the only argument against indicting a sitting president.
Yes. Comey sent his to Congress on 10/28. It probably cost her the election, cost the SCOTUS 3 justices, and an untold number of American lives through the administration's deliberate mishandling of the pandemic.
Great. We'll have a really good record of all the crimes he got away with. I guess I was mistaken. I thought you got arrested when you commit a crime.
