People prefer highschool drama level shit more than the typical boring political stuff that actually matters most of the time. Having their internal struggles play out like a said school drama, while attempting to consolidate control on a razor thin margin, in a chamber whose ineffectiveness they would ideally want to pin on Ds, is about the worst scenario possible for the GOP given the circumstances. The GOP is far better off with people just ignoring the existence of the House, like they do most of the time, so they can obstruct and pin any legislative failures on the WH. McCarthy's circus act may now end up being what comes to mind in more voters heads when shit goes sideways the next time something important goes down in the House, but maybe I'm just being too optimistic and the media impact outside Reddit is minimal.
5. Some grouping of Republicans cuts a deal with Democrats to agree not to do certain things (like allow an impeachment of Biden right off the bat and agree not to summarily kick certain Democrats off of committees for right wing fever dream reasons) and in return Democrats vote for/allow a more moderate Republican, perhaps even McCarthy, to be elected.
