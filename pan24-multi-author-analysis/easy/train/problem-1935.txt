I 100% agree that there ought to be a reasonable investigation into this but I do have to wonder if any of this matters at all given that Biden is currently the president and therefore has not only the right to have classified information but also the ability to declassify that information.
Do you mean he shouldnt have kept them? Because he was allowed to have them in the first place. He just needed to dispose of them properly. Unless im off base.
Not trying to make excuses for the oversight (or lack thereof) of classified documents, but it seems to me as though this requires an investigation into how classified documents are handled during and after individuals have been given such status and after said status has lapsed.
No, it's not the same as Trump. Trump ignored a subpoena for documents they knew he had. He had over 300 of them. That's horrible in its own way.
