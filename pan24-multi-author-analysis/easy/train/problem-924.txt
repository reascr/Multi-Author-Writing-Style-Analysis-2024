There were elections lately in Israel and the majority of the seats in the parliament went to rightwing and ultra Orthodox parties. Because of that Bibi Netanyahu became prime minister. Bibi is on trial for breach of trust and accepting bribery so he did what every good criminal politician does and selected Yariv Levin, a guy who is known for his hatred towards the supreme court and his desire to politicias as much as possible the selection of judges, to be the minister of Justice. And to top it off, Bibi selected Aria Deri to be the minister of health and interior which would have been okay if Deri wasn't a convicted criminal who by law can't be a minister by Israeli law. Levin presented his "Reform" and it includes effectively stripping the supreme court from its power and almost removing completely the professional part of picking judges and he did it the day before the trial which decided if Deri could be a minister started.
Full on. This gives me hope for Israel. The conservatives and right wingers there and in the US will get them all killed I fear. The madness must ease. The pressure must be allowed to escape.
