Oh its on, the drone plant will he one of many, Israel will enjoy having all of thier operations green lit buy the u.s., theres also about 3 or 4 secret locations refining uranium that will go boom. And then theres the domestic issues in Iran (you know the rioting public). All 3 countries are fucked. Soon youll be able to purchase russian house servants.
Retaliate? So they will sponsor even more terrorism and wars, just like they sponsor war in Yemen, ISIS, PLA, Hamas? No way...
Read what I said carefully, I never claimed there would be a Shia version of ISIS, I said there would be a power vacuum for organizations similar to them, there are also Sunni's in Iran and Saudi Arabia being a big sponsor would sponsor there also.
Again you and people that spew the same rhetoric as you didn't learn anything because I was referring to the power vacuum left by the US after it's invasion of Iraq which led to the formation of ISIS which is not a SHIA organization meaning that It's not an organization funded by the biggest Shia nation out there Iran.
