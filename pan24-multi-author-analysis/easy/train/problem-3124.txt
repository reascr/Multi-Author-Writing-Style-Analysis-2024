In GA, foodstamps are basically worthless now, as we dont have federal backing for the program due to the conservative party. They blamed biden because in the renewal paperwork it said that covid money given to the state had to go to covid policies, which kemp had a fucking meltdown over. He wants to use the covid money on what HE wants to use it on, not what its purpose was for. He then spent it all after he refused the paper work on random shit, the money itself didnt have to be used until the end of 2024 and he spent 4.8 billion on... things before his eventual re-election as he was expecting to lose to abrams and didnt want her using the money to make herself look good. Those few 'republican' voters who will listen dont blame the party still, they blame kemp and biden for not setting the paperwork up better beforehand when the money was sent out. Tell them it was during trump that the money was sent out and the new paperwork about how to spend the money was biden, they praise trump for giving the state something during covid and again blame kemp or biden seeing as if biden hadnt sent out that 'renewal paperwork' then the foodstamps would still exist. Try explaining how the renewal works and well... you get the idea. They dont wanna accept anything other than what fabricated knowledge they possess.
