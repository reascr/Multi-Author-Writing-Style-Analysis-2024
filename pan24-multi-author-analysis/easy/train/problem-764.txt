A key point is that the Gulf War was initiated by Iraqi forces invading Kuwait and, to an extent the Iraq-Iran war, which was also initiated by Iraq. Out of all the wars the USA has been in the Gulf War was legitimately a good one in the sense the US was defending a sovereign nation (now you can argue true motivations if you want). Cold hard reality is that any war, good or bad, is going to cause civilian deaths, and for all purposes, this was a "good" intentioned war on the coalition side. Now Iraq was very much a dictatorship, and civilians had no say in initiating the conflicts, but that doesn't mean Iraq can invade its neighbors without repercussions. Those deaths are on Husseins hands not the allies.
And for another, hitting North Korea with air strikes would have been completely out of the question because A) they were and are protected by China since the 1950s, so striking them in the 90s would risk reigniting the Korean War including war against China which was never going to happen, and B) North Korea has had an avalanche of artillery aimed at Seoul since before even Carter was in office and kicking off a war with North Korea via air strikes would be sentencing Seoul to complete destruction.
