They waited so long and the news and politicians themselves (such as DeSantis) will never mention it again. The voters will assume DeSantis and other GOP politicians followed through. Standard GOP political tactics. If DeSantis does run in 2024, I want to see the Republicans who run against him (and any Democrats who may run against him if he wins the nomination) to bring this up. Mention how he talks a big game but fails to follow-through. Mention how he bent over to appease Disney in the end, despite trying to puff his chest out initially. Hammer it home.
The Reedy Creek Improvement District (Disney’s self-government) is basically the only example in the US of a private corporation actually building publicly accessible infrastructure at no cost to local taxpayers. Disney literally pays for it all themselves. But then if their self-government gets taken from them, they won’t have the ability to do this anymore and the state is gonna have to take over all of it, with the cost going to local taxpayers.
