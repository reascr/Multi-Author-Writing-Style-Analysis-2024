Itâ€™s actually insane to me that you can go to the conservative subreddit and find people wanting Russia to win the war. Fucking amazing. These people would have literally rooted for Nazi germany to win. And they call themselves patriots.
Religion sets people up to not question authority (patriarchal punishment, threat of eternal Hell if not compliant to set law and order within theocratical parameters) and what they're told from early childhood (creating difficulty in determining fact from fiction and literally robs an individual of critical thinking skills before entering adulthood, which is the entire point) and corporate marketing toys with human psychology and neurologic chemistry sets (dopamine, serotonin level manipulation, chemical addiction, environmental, product and consumable stimulus and goal-to-reward schemes), especially with children, to set up life-long brand recognition and trust with that branding. Nestle for example, excels with creating the problem of choice (analysis paralysis) with innumerous companies producing multiple corporate product lines with all profit fed toward one major and global umbrella company. Samsung and Mitsubishi also come to mind.
