Threat for Russia fro the territory of Ukraine? Meaning what? If we can’t control your people or govt, you’re a threat? Natos already at your borders russia, with Finland and yet russia ignores this. Meaning it is and always was a land grab.
The problems i have personally seen when i've been there explaining why they haven't moved on him yet, (for the record this is my personal experience and observations therefore i don't want to give the impression this is an objective fact and could very well be misinterpreted, i am no expert and i am no professional analyst or anything of that nature, so take what i say with a grain of salt as i very well could be wrong without realizing it) is that much like here in the west like the us and Canada, the younger generation sees all the plot holes and places where the cut doesn't meet the corners properly, but largely feel powerless to change things at this point because just like here with the older generations being much more conservative and loyal to the republican party and controlling the majority of resources and businesses, the older generation there is largely loyal to the putin regime and in fact makes up the bulk of his support in country. So not even taking into consideration the overwhelming force putin can bring down on dissidents, not only do the younger generations lack the experience to effectively mount a resistance of any kind, they also do not have the desire to actively challenge their parents and grandparents or like we talked about earlier, see them hurt because of their actions. Not only that, but with how restricted information sharing is in russia, it would be very hard for any under ground movement to get a foot hold without quickly being discovered and rooted out expeditiously, and no one would be sure how many would show up to fight, if the supplies they need would be there on time, ect ect, keeping everybody second guessing everything and making it very difficult to mount an effective rebellion. At the end of the day i don't believe it's a will power or motivation problem, the will and motivation is absolutely there, it's a logistics problem, they don't even know where to begin or how to go about carrying out such a monstrous endeavor.
