“The unborn” are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.” - Pastor Dave Barnhart.
"Frankly, I'm glad our lawmakers are distracting me like a cat with a red dot by going after defenseless people which have nothing to do with me instead of drawing my attention to the fact that I'm under paid, under educated, could lose my health care should I even have it, have a decreasing amount of social safety nets, can't buy a house because things are insanely expensive and corporate greed spiking inflation to the point that my grocery bills have about doubled over the last couple of years. But I get off on seeing others who aren't like me suffer, so it's a fair trade.".
