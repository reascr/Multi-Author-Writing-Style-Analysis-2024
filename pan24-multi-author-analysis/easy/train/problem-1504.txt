Trump: "This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. There has been another president and perhaps another politician who has been persecuted, harassed and in every other way unfairly treated, like President Donald J. Trump. What Leticia James has tried to do the last number of years is a disgrace to the legal system and a front to the NY State tax payers, and a violation of the solemn rights of the US Constitution. She developed a political platform and made a career out of maliciously attacking me and my business before she even understood or was elected or reviewed one of the millions of pages of documents we willing produced. We willingly produced these documents. She announced that she quote 'was obsessed with taking me on', taking me on folks..... This whole thing is very unfair." He then goes into talking about Michael Cohen being a "total loser.".
Trump tried to rig the election by installing fake electors and his little maga wacko-insurrectionist-cult members attempted to subvert the peaceful and democratic transfer of power, with an overwhelming concensus that Trump incited it.
