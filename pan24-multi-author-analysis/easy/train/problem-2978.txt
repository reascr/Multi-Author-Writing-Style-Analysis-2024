Yeah so he didn't write on his December forms that he got taken out to see Hamilton during a trip to New York while he was Mayor of Tallahassee, by undercover FBI agents posing as his friends. Then those same undercover agents donated money to his campaign for governor, someone only named Individual B talked to them and supposedly assured the undercover agents that donating money would get them whatever they wanted in return for donations. However, the indictment clearly states that Gillam kept saying separate your thinking about your building projects from your campaign donations. He never actually did anything for them? Then the FBI came around and asked him if he took campaign donations from the undercover guys and if he did favors for them, he says no I didn't and they are charging him with lying to them.
Seriously. I feel like Chicago is actually probably one of the least corrupt governments in the US because the perpetrators always get caught.
Thanks PiffityPoffity. I remembered the news stories, but not being from Florida I never did find out the conclusion, so I decided to read the actual indictment. Here's a link;.
