I’m not saying culture isn’t important, I’m just saying we’ve evolved past the use of traditions that don’t serve a purpose. It’s not like I’m saying that names don’t have origins, just that those origins don’t prevent usage outside of one’s gender. I don’t buy the argument that a gendered name allows for the listener to know a persons gender because there are plenty traditionally gender neutral names and it’s never an issue. That’s why we have pronouns.
I've seen footage of wolves hunting and killing bears, probably a group of lions could do it as well if given the chance (a male lion or 2 can even take down elephants if they are not helped by other elephants, weak or young ones but also adults if they are particularly hungry) and a tiger or 2. Have you seen how huge some subspecies of tigers can get? They can easily get bigger than some of the smaller bear species. Siberian tigers can grow over 3.5 meters, they are easily strong enough to take on most bear species, except probably polar bears.
