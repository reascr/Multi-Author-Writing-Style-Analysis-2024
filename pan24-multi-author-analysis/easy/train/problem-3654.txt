They could maybe cut some places off from it for a time. But destroy it? of course not. 90% of it is probably hosted on servers that aren't even in Ukraine.

Ukraine: Remove all military forces from Ukraine, including all illegally occupied territory during the 2014 invasion, return all kidnapped civilians including both adults and children and have them reunited with their families, pay monetary compensation to all families negativity affected by this unprovoked military invasion, start a continuous payment system to repair Ukraine's infrastructure and economy to prewar levels, pay to relocate all Russian citizens and businesses so they feel as little impact as possible when a buffer zone of 20 miles starting at the pre 2014 border of Russia and Ukraine and heading inward towards Russia is installed to defend against future Russian aggression since their promises of non aggression are laughable, this buffer zone will be heavily fortified, mined and patrolled by Ukrainian and/or NATO forces (including air space) as they see appropriate, Russia will be supervised as they turn over or destroy their nuclear arsenal since they have proven repeatedly they are a unstable terrorist state who continues to threaten the safety of the world's population by attempting to hold it hostage by the threat of nuclear weapons, Russia will be required to comply with random nuclear facility inspections by a NATO oversight committee to ensure they aren't again attempting to build more nuclear weapons, and Putin along with all other perceived "war criminals" as defined by Ukraine and approved by NATO, will turn themselves in to be tried for said crimes with an actual fair and impartial trial.
Works both ways. Most of the oil and construction materials in Europe still arrive from Russia. It just has to go though a little different route.
