A friend of mine left a small house party hosted by other friends of ours even though they encouraged her to stay the night. Her husband called around the next morning saying she didn’t come home assuming she’d spent the night. Nope. I knew her drinking was getting crazier than usual (a 59 yo mother of 3, all kids are adults though) so I looked up the local counties jail listings. Sure enough I found her mugshot. Apparently she hit a neighbors car with her massive Mercedes, and in that time she was trying to get out cops had arrived, then she hit one of the cop cars with her vehicle. Tens of thousands of $ later she never saw a jail cell (except for when she was booked that night) and even got off probation early. And was allowed to remove the blow thing they made her install in one of her other vehicles she was made to make her daily driver. She sobered up, and is doing really well now, but they bought her way into every safety net they could. Good lawyers, paying the fines and expenses off early, even being able to do her community service time at the community theatre she already volunteered for anyway. I’m glad she is doing better and she def went through a lot of stress, but if I hit a cop car while totally wasted there’s no way I would’ve been able to get that treatment without coughing over a down payment on a small house.
