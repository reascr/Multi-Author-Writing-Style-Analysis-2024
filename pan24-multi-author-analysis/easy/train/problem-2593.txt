Oh beileve me I know what NATO is, it is formed against USSR, to stop spread communism, I also know about NATO's unofficial branch known as "super NATO" aka Gladio where they massacred the leftist protestors in my hometown where my mother and uncle were present and fortunately got out there alive but many of their friends died. Also NATO supported the coup in my country Turkey where hundreds of thousands of people tortured and killed. If I mention what they did in south america this would be 4-5 page long comment so I wont bother. So yea I think It is you that needs to be educated my friend.
