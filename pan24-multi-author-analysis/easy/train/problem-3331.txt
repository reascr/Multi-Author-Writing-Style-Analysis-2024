I suspect part of it is that we're still cleaning out our closet of old ammo. It's use it or loose it, and it costs money to dispose of. Like the Javelins with 1990s fate codes.
The largest reason why Ukraine hasn’t been given Western jets and tanks (yet) is that you can train an existing Ukrainian pilot or tank crew relatively quick to operate the western equipment, but both the Abraham’s and western jets have extensive supply chain requirements that Ukraine simply doesn’t have setup. They are already experiencing issues repairing and maintaining the various artillery they have been given that require significantly less logistical support.
LOL. Ukraine is there own country. You know what, that's fine. The US doesn't need puppet states. It needs real allies.
Interesting. As I understand HIMARS if the US wanted to give Ukraine longer range capabilities it would only require delivery of long range missiles, not new launchers. I have to think that there is debate on getting a dozen of the longer range ones to take out the Crimea bridge in whole, once they are done repairing it. Probably not so with re to Russian air bases.
