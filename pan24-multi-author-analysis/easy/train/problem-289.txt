I'm 58. It's always been like that. It starts in middle school, where it's cool to be bored but some people never grow out of that mentality. It's just easier not to care, that and I think fundamentally vast swathes of the population are just selfish really. They really only care about themselves and their immediate circle. Bad things happen to other people so why should I care? (Liberal voters do generally have empathy and want better things for others, but the US is structurally biased against where most liberals end up living, i.e. urban areas.).
If the fascist DeSantis actually does replace the AP w/this christian-centric garbage then really, any federal funding for education in Fla ought to be re-directed to states in need of education funding AND that are not trying to disadvantage their kids educationally which evidently Fla's favorite fascist nutcase is actively trying to do.
Same. Wife and I met there but weren’t from there. I spent over a decade living down there. I saw Trumpisium before 2016, esp in central FL, but then after 2016 I realized I needed to fo of there. No way I was going to approach raising kids in that state. I knew what coming and got out when you did. Best decision I’ve made in a while.
