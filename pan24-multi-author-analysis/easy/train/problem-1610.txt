In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yeah. Fascists/authoritarian types usually end up betraying their so-called allies. That's what I am saying. Oh, and they don't like brown people. They will turn on the Latinos who vote for Republicans because of their race and religion (they also don't like non-Anglo cultures as well).
Isn't the majority of Latinos in the US Catholic and once the divide between Church and State (which is fading fast) won't they find themselves in the "wrong" category for Christianity? It will be the Evengalics that would most likely plan on taking over and they won't tolerate other forms of religion, especially Catholics (which they see as being non-Christians).
