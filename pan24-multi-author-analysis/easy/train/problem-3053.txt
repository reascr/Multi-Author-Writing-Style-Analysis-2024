That model works for a niche, but I don't see it scaling, it'd become too finicky and not very user friendly. It's more inline with the tech minded folk who would find that easier to navigate. The model is not advertising friendly, because each host sets their own rules .. so you would have ad-friendly communities and nazi-friendly communities. They could change if the host changes. Advertisers don't like that amount of instability where they put their branding.
Exactly. Twitter is mostly a passive news feed / notification system with a very low barrier to produce content. It's far from essential or even engaging for most people.
I will say this if Twitter indeed survives you best believe these companies are watching and with the oncoming economic downturn diving even worse we might see many companies start going towards not just normal layoffs but instead complete trimming of fat/becoming skeleton crews since Twitter has that issue (cut basically half the staff) and surviving relatively easily.
