DeSantis plays every fascist trick in the book. Anti intellectualism, anti communism, "anti communism", culture wars, sowing doubt in democratic systems, overbearing machismo and toxic masculinity, racism, queerphobia, what-aboutism out the ass, and covering any possible topic to distract people with bullshit, the paradoxical dual beliefs of his enemies being weak, unpatriotic, unamerican, and less than human, while also telling people that they're threatening to take everything they hold dear with the power "they" have, it gives his supporters the sense of constantly being under siege on all sides, by potentially anyone and everyone. Ron DeSantis represents the greatest threat to American democracy in a long time. And Florida just reelected him.

For real… you just keep your head down, never question him, agree with all his policies and don’t make yourself noticed so he doesn’t feel the need to retaliate at you and get your company penalized like Disney or your job fired like that AG or have your house swatted like that Covid analyst or get arrested for having books he doesn’t like… Media just needs to shut up and let him be so we can all let him be how he wants to be (… or else he’ll pass laws so he specifically has expanded powers to sue the News for libel like he threatened to do this week).
