In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Gerrymandering. Redistricting. Closing voting locations. Cutting off the USPS at the knees to slow mail voting. VoterID. These are the first volleys in an assault on democracy.
Absolutely. This is one of many movements to suppress the rising black power in politics. The All Lives Matter / Blue Lived Matter shit is another.

Concentrate forces geographically. It’s better to hold all of the power in half the country than it is to hold no power across the nation. Concentration of forces itself is a force multiplier. In the case of the GQP, it also results in more groupthink because the differing views were running out of town.
