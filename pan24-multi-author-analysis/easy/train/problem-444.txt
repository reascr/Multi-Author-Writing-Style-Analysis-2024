People keep talking about the Mormons in Idaho, and while there are many they really in most ways are not radical and want to be left alone to raise their families. There are some that split off into being Libertarian, and they are kind of out there and tend to leave the church. The people that are dangerous are the Evangelicals and the Christian Fundamentalists. They want to kill education, allow religious freedom to ignore and ban medicine and ban books. It can be very tiring to live here if you don't follow along. I can't tell you how many times a month I get told to leave if I don't like it or how much hate I have for God if I want kids to have a good education or access to Shakespeare and other classic books in public libraries. The people moving here really want to change much of the state into a right wing Mecca, without even recognizing what Mecca is.
Literally. Idaho is like the shitty parts of Washinon and oregon with none of the good parts. I don't understand why it's so much more conservative and backwards than frankly any of the states around it. Montana and Wyoming and Utah are so much more chill than Idaho.
