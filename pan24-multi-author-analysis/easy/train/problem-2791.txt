The left falls to a different kind of propaganda - apathetic or angry reactionary like Chapo Traphouse or Jacobin magazine. They work themselves into a frenzy wanting a fervent and arguably forced form of socialism or communism depending on who you talk to and they looooove to tell you that things in the Soviet Union or currently in North Korea is our fault or isn’t as bad as we make it out to be. I have two friends who openly say this shit all the time. As far as I’m concerned, they’re simply selfish about the fact that stuff hasn’t changed as fast as we all talked like it should after the 08 election. Being selfish about it is good, being forceful and angry about it gets them nowhere. If they don;t get what they want, they act all pissy and don’t want to go vote because “what’s the point” and “why don’t we let this country fall so people realize they were wrong?” That view is not helpful and tells me they don’t think about outcomes, only their immediate problems. This country falling wouldn’t lead to a socialist paradise and it would arguably be even more violent and bloody.

Totally. Imagine your only hobby is racism and bigotry 😆 And being a total loser and looking in the mirror, thinking, well at least I’m not _____, i am so superior.
