I have nothing to do with any sides in this conflict, but Ukraine should actively be trying to protect it's minorities, including their language and culture. This includes their Hungarian minority. Being at war is no excuse.
“The Committee strongly condemns this senseless and barbaric action aimed at intimidating the Hungarian people of Transcarpathia, destroying the universal cultural heritage and poisoning Hungarian-Ukrainian relations,” the document issued by the Committee said.
Oh, fuck off! None of this shit is done without a vote by locals, look at how there's literally still a statue of russian empress in Odesa (only just now they covered it and promise to move her, someday). This is like a fucking farce - they take EU money, block sanctions against russia, keep buying russian gas, block aid to Ukraine and now they even push russian-like propaganda about oppressed minorities. How long will that clown country can be considered "European"?
In the resolution, the body therefore reiterated its concern about the systematic harassment of legitimate organizations of the Hungarian community in Transcarpathia and the official actions aimed at intimidating their democratically elected leaders.
Even Wikipedia shows drastic difference in understanding of that term. For USA, it breaks into color of your skin and "general direction" of your origin . For Ukraine it clearly shows exact ethnic group.
The resolution also stressed that the Foreign Affairs Committee is committed to strenhening cooperation, dialogue and mutual trust between Hungary and Ukraine, in which the Hungarian community in Transcarpathia has a particularly important role to play.
