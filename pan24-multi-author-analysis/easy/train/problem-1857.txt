Although I don't agree in principle with banning athletes for the actions of their governments (unless the athlete shows public support for the actions of their government), I'd be fine with it if the rule was applied consistently. However, the problem is that it isn't applied consistently. The US committed some of the most heinous war crimes of the 21st century in Iraq (like Ukraine, it was a completely unprovoked and illegal invasion), yet there was never a call for the ban of US athletes at the 2004 Olympics (or any of the other Olympics that were held during the lenh of the occupation).
There is nothing to dress up. Itâ€™s a historical fact that the US did not invade Vietnam. They came to the aid of the South Vietnamese government.
The 2 year alternating schedule is too frequent to make the games impactful (I've barely watched the last few), and it encourages the ridiculous constant building of unnecessary infrastructure and the bloated, corrupt bidding process that often leads to host cities spending billions they don't have on massive budget overruns with minimal support from the IOC.
Nah matey, I don't give a fuck. We went into Iraq in 2003 under false pretenses and caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people. I can say that and still say Russia is wrong because I'm not mentally deficient or emotionally fragile.
