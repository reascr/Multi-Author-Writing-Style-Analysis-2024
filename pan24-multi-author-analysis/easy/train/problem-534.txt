Before Biden did anything about it, it was all just talk to pander to millennials and there's no way he'd actually do it. (I'll admit that I was also in that camp.) And then he actually does something Shouldn't everyone be happy he followed through and did what we wanted? Obviously not, because decades ago he voted for a crap bill so that means he's a horrible person and nothing will ever change that. And after that judge blocked it, oh lord. Clearly that means Biden just did it to get votes, because he's an evil mastermind that knew it would get blocked after midterms so he wouldn't actually have to do anything I've also seen many wild takes explaining how he could just "do it anyways" (about student loan debt, but also abortion and basically everything else they want him to do.) because their understanding of what a president can do is apparently on the level of a 5 year old talking about how if they were president they would stop every war and make food free.
