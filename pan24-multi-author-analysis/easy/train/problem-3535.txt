Agreed 100% and that's why I always say "enslavement" instead of "slavery". The latter is framed as this passive thing that just was while the former reveals that it was an active choice to have enslaved entire cultures of people based on nothing but skin color. America may not be a superpower today if it weren't for slave labor, and to not address that and admit that is a huge slap in the face for every person of color today who doesn't even know their heritage because their ancestors were ripped away from it. It was a cultural genocide that whites specifically, but also America in general, benefited from. We need to teach that so we can both face the reality of America's complicity and the rippling effects it's had and will have through time, and ensure that this type of thing never happens again.
Seriously. Partner and I tried to be responsible adults and send out holiday cards one year, and my brother flipped out because they didn't say "Merry Christmas." It did not occur to him that a lot of our friends might celebrate something else. Nope, we were just being brainwashed by the woke agenda.
