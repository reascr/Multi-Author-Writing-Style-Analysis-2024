"Not only did Reagan deal with terrorists as president, as revealed in the Iran-Contra scandal, the preponderance of evidence now supports the charge that his campaign negotiated with Iranian hostage-takers while he was running for president in 1980, to delay the release of hostages before the election, which could have helped Carter win reelection — what was known as “The October Surprise.” Given that Reagan wasn't president then, but was negotiating to thwart a president's attempt to get hostages released, this is not simply questionable behavior, it is arguably an act of treason.".
there isn't much journalistic integrity here, considering they're reporting this event entirely on the account of one person who; 1) is mentally ill 2) is a grandmaster-level troll 3) has a publicity motivation to promote his campaign and 4) is trying to siphon votes from the evangelical-right while the "dump trump" gettin's good.
But this? Two wholly-unqualified emotionally- and psychologically-damaged narcissists, vying to run for the Preaidency, and having a shot because they are able to make racists feel better about themselves? A major political power in this country foregoing its entire platform in favor of "Do whatever that guy says?".
