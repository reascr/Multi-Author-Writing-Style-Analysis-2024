2. Nancy Pelosi resigns her House seat. By the Constitution, Governors do not appoint replacements on the House of Representatives when they leave office before the end of their term. The Clerk of the House will provide constituent services until the Governor schedules a special election pursuant to California law (which I don't know the specifics of when it comes to timing).

Bahahaha found the corporate establishment bootlicker! If you think Pelosi is “progressive” in any way or has pushed “progressive” legislation, boy have I got a bridge to sell you.
I just named a bunch of progressive legislation, followed by her support for candidates and stances that are the opposite of what she says.
