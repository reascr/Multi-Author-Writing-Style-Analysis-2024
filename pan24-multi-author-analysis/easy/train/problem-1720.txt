I honestly hope that the American right wing voters can see this catastrophe and adjust their voting toward useful, reasonable, and compassionate policy rather than "my team brrrrrr!".
Not really, they have no actually legislative direction or drive to change anything fundamentally so at best they will investigate Hunter Biden’s dick picks and investigate Nancy Pelosi’s insider trading (which will only expose how congress is insider trading everywhere). Since the Republicans only have a slim majority in the House they don’t have the votes to actually send anything to/through the Senate without bipartisan support (now more than ever since the Republican House is fractured) and even after that Biden would have to sign into law whatever they attempt to pass which makes the chances of anything impactful happening to an absolute rarity.
That’s the thing. This is them trying to take over the government and they are so stupid they are shooting them selves in the foot. If Kevin gives up they will just be who ever is popular.
