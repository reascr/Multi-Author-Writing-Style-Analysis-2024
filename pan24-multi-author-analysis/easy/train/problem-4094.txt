There is absolutely no way Trump doesn't run in 2024. Independent if he has to. Pray Desantis wins the nomination so they eat each other alive. Biden pulls a William Henry Harrison. Kamala for 12 years.
Fox went full send on "woke culture" and inner city violence when all Republicans really cared about were dinner table issues like the rest of us, like the fact that Rs voted against vet protection bills and healthcare coverage for 9/11 first responders just to spite Biden, and it turned on them in state after state after state.
I had that since 1st grade. Sunday Morning I would wake up all depressed and let down because I had to go to school the next day. I’m 42 now and that has never changed. When I wake up and have to go to work on my Monday I feel an existential dread. It’s worst probably in January when the holidays are over, the chilly feeling of the bathroom after I get out of my warm cocoon of a bed makes me hate life. One might think I’m depressed, but no I’m happy as a kitten when I’m leaving work on my Friday.
