EDIT: The above comment was based on Peltola (D) having 42% of votes and Bye (independent) having 7% with about 50% of votes counted. (Source was AP or Politico, I think.) With 72% of votes counted as of 11am EST on Nov 14, it appears Peltola has 47%, Palin (R) has 27%, Begich (R) has 24%, and Bye has 2%. (Source: , and . I think politico uses AP's polling and fivethirtyeight uses ABC News'.) If this remains the breakdown, Peltola would need between 1% and 4% of voters who selected Begich as their first choice to have selected Peltola ahead of Palin further down their ticket (Peltola as second choice, or Begich as second choice and Peltola as third choice). So it will come down to how many Begich voters are voting against Palin vs for the Republican party.
Absolutely. I grew up in California, and it just didn’t feel like my vote mattered. I knew the results before Election Day, and I wasn’t tuned into national politics at that point. Now I live in a completely red area, and I vote out of spite.
