Very true but since white supremacy isn't something the public favors yet they're going to go after the LGBTQ+ community and more specifically trans people and once that's done they'll move on to their next targets. The same playbook was used in Germany and of course history is repeating itself because whitewashing the bad parts was more important than actually teaching us everything like what should be done.
I'm a gay dude living in GA. Moved here 18 years ago. In 30 days I'll begin the process of leaving the State. This is due to MTG and Kemp along with a lot of other xenophobia. Portland, OR here I come.
If he was as good of a speaker as conservatives think he is, or had a modicum of intelligence to not call everything he doesn't like a hoax, he would likely still be president, and people like MTG and Boebert would be consolidating power as we speak, and the US would likely see one of them running in for the white house in 2024.
Yep. The problem is that as of yet the US's status as a "free" country still stands in many countries, while a third of the population is willing to murder minorities to get what they think they want. This is a multi-faceted problem and a lot of it stems from late stage capitalism not that conservatives are smart enough to realize that. It's easy to pin the blame on people completely unrelated to your problems rather than solving them.
