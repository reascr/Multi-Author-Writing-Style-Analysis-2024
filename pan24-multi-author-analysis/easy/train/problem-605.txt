It takes a special kind of person to serve the public as a government official for that long. My dad was in the Coast Guard as a veteran for 30 years, then went back in as a civilian and is still there today. He doesn't just see it as a job, it's a calling. He put his everything into his work, whether it was being at sea for 200+ days, busting drug boats off the Florida coast, or writing training curriculum to keep new recruits safe. Fauci reminds me a lot of my dad in that way - he climbed the ladder through merit and grit and put his life on the line for his job. He could've rested on his laurels after the AIDS crisis, but he stayed long enough to fight swine flu, Sars, and a once-in-a-century pandemic. He is the epitome of what a public servant is meant to be, and an example we can all admire and strive for as we pursue our own goals.
Damn communist infiltration, communist indoctrination, communist subversion, and international communist conspiracy sapping all our precious bodily fluids.
I’m happy for him. He worked far longer than he needed to, because he wanted to. He’s got everything he could ever dream of and he sacrificed over a decade of his golden years to continue his research and expertise. A role model is an understatement and history will remember him as such.
