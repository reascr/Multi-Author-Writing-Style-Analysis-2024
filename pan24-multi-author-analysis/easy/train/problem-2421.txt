It should ABSOLUTELY be looked into and whatever happens happens. There is a WORLD of difference between these two cases. Please, tell me you can at least see that much.
Wait hold up, so you think someone intentionally stealing classified documents should merit the same punishment as someone accidentally having classified documents? Are you fucking serious?
Again, there is a world of difference between finding 10 documents, locked in a closet at a think tank, immediately reporting it to the proper authorities, and then returning the documents as soon as possible VS purposefully stealing hundreds of documents, storing them haphazardly in offices and storage rooms, then lying about it when asked, then hiding the documents, then returning some of the documents, then lying in court about having searched and found no documents, then the FBI finds the documents, and even empty SCI document folders, and then having EVEN MORE documents found in a storage unit. Right? You can see the legal difference in those two situations .... right?
