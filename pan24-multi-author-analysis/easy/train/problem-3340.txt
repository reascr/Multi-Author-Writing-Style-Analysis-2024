Reddit would either need to stop allowing user submitted content (which would kill Reddit) or stop moderating completely. All the spammers, scammers, off topic posters, porn posters, hate speech posters, etc would have free reign. Go to the "Aww" subreddit to see G rated photos of puppies and kitties? Well the "kittie" you just saw wasn't a pet cat and definitely wasn't G rated. Go to the "LEGO" subreddit to talk about brick building? Sorry, you need to wade through posts about herbal Viagra, links to phishing scams, and people posting about random stuff they did today that don't involve LEGO. (Also, more of those "kittie" photos because they would be everywhere.).
, I made my submission under my real name (and I volunteer as a Mod under my real name), because I believe that someone who is participating in a public policy decision has a responsibility to respect the highest standards of public transparency and public accountability, by exposing himself to public scrutiny.
2. Reddit find a way to protect themselves, leaving moderators open to legal action, this wouldn't effect non-American moderators.
So? You think Reddit should be able to defame or damage people because itâ€™s only a small percentage? This is peak American exceptionalism aka corruption.
