People say they’re “half Jewish”, so, one of your parents is Jewish and one parent is like, Catholic or something? Or is Jewish technically an ethnicity, like saying I’m half Korean because my mom is Korean and grew up in Seoul before coming to America? Or would it be more accurate to say half Asian? Is Judaism a religion and an ethnicity, like are the two mutually exclusive? What if then, one of my parents were hypothetically ethnically Jewish but for one reason or another grew up ethnically Jewish but practicing Christianity or Islam? Would it still be technically correct to say I’m half Jewish?
Because that is history, just for comparison, Germany lost around 5 million soldiers, and Japan, with less population than both US and UK, lost 2,4 million soldiers, the war was about those people, US and UK just won the propaganda game, the data we have can't lie in favor of those two, it's impossible to study history as it is and not seeing that, unfortunately, UK and US was playing games instead of actually fighting the war like the soviets did.
