So she isolated an island until other countries developed a vaccine for them to use. It's not like that was hard, now if she had to try to isolate a big country with a large mobile population with multiple land borders, multiple water borders, and many international and other airports, a large international economy, and not a little island in the Pacific, she would have been lost.
I'm super torn on this. As a human, she's earned it and it's more maturity and clarity than I've seen from almost all our Aus pollies. Glad she's done it. As a pollie, the world needs people with this perspective more than ever. Sad she's done it.
I'm ignorant of New Zealand politics but was Fauci not on her level and/or was she subjected to similar totally unwarranted politically motivated attacks?
There was zero Covid for over 350 days at the longest. That paid dividends to most of the population while the rest of the world yo-yo'd between outbreaks and restrictions and unnecessary deaths. There was a short period where Delta was in the community but the vaccination rate was higher that restrictions were not increased. Omicron came in just after that and that was the game changer and restrictions were dropped altogether.
