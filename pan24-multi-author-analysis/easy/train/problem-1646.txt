"In military terminology, a missile is a guided airborne ranged weapon capable of self-propelled flight usually by a jet engine or rocket motor.[1] Missiles are thus also called guided missiles or guided rockets (when a previously unguided rocket is made guided). Missiles have five system components: targeting, guidance system, flight system, engine and warhead.".
Consider also the following historical precedent: Unrestricted Submarine Warfare was considered a war crime. During the Nuremberg trials, German U-Boats captains who had deliberately targeted civilian ships successfully avoided prosecution by arguing that the Americans had done the exact same thing. The defense was deemed acceptable, and they were acquitted. Breaking international law, endangers the legal case by which we hope to charge Russia. The Nurmenburg Trials would appear to set the precedent that you cannot prosecute the losing side for crimes that the winners willingly committed; and thought it's not impossible it's much harder to set a new precedent than it is to carry an old one.
