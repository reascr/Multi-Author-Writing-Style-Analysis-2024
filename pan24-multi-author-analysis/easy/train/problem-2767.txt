This really isn’t a great bill. The language of the bill only speaks to the federal government being required to recognize same-sex marriages IF it’s recognized by that state. If anything this bill just gives the court more cover to overturn Obergefell, and we’ll see states outlawing it without any repercussion from this bill. I’m very nervous to see if this bill plays out well.
Yes but the Ginni Court would refer you to this one letter to the editor from the 1700s that clearly shows everyone everywhere felt differently back then and so they feel that this law should be struck down what cause reasons… also no take backs and you can’t use their decision as precedent to do anything good.
But that's not how it works. A law can't just give the thumbs up to ignoring an amendment. If a state tries to, even if it were to cite this law, it would still be in violation of the 14th Amendment.
There's also a nuance here: How far can the federal government go in forcing states to do something? If they go too far, there's plenty of legal avenue to challenge it as federal overreach. Making it an argument of simply telling states to apply their laws equally, instead of trying to supersede them, is a much safer bet.
