In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I agree. I'm simply stating I understand why teachers themselves are complying with these awful laws. Plus, teachers have stood up and plead their cases against these laws, and DeSantis has simply ignored them or called them pedophiles, groomers and being "woke." It is up to the people to support the teachers and push back against DeSantis and the Florida government, but that's also becoming increasingly difficult with the illegal redrawing of district lines, voter suppression, etc.
Yes. I wish they'd fight back, especially on book banning. We need them to also call out this Christian nationalist crusades they are on right now. The fact no one is even trying to call these fundies from Footloose out is astounding.
