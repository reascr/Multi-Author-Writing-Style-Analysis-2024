"When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains, and the women come out to cut up what remains, jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your gawd like a soldier.".
The radiation would decimate future crops from the area, creating an even greater food scarcity on that side of the world--we already saw African, Indian, and Middle East support was wavering because of the realities of the grain shipment delays, despite Russia trying to turn the narrative on Ukraine witholding it rather than, you know, the war.
I wouldn’t go that far. I suspect it’s a mix of not enough time, not enough transport capacity and, if particularly cynical, the calculation that caring for a wounded man who won’t be returning to combat any time soon is a non-trivial resource drain…but one that’s easily turned into the enemy’s problem.
Barf on Russian media! Since when have they cared? If they had cared, Russia would never have launched such an ill-prepared war. I suspected Putin was thinking that Ukrainians would just lift white flags and didn't think through the what-ifs.
