Secondly, once they found the first file, why did they keep looking? Since the files being there is a serious issue, surely they notified Biden when they found the first file. Did he tell them to keep looking? Did they have security clearance to view the files? If not, then Biden was willfully giving people access to files they didn't have clearance to see.
If Biden's motive was simply to return the files, why didn't he have the FBI, National Archives, DOJ or any other government agency take over the search once they found the first file? The fact that he had his lawers continue with the search suggests that maybe he had something to hide. Can you think of any other criminal investigation where law enforcement agencies allowed a suspect's lawyers to gather possible evidence? Did Biden say anything to the DOJ or FBI during this process that might have influenced how they handled it?
Nothing nefarious. Nothing that undermines his credibility (except for with those people that had already decided he was guilty before considering any of the facts)...
