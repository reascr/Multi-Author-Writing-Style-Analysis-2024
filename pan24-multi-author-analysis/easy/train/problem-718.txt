If no sanctions were put against Russia,most western companies who left would still be operating in Russia now. Those companies who closed their businesses left because they supply chain was disrupted by sanctions. Companies don't care about how many children are shelled. They care about profits.
Not necessarily. Someone might have fucked up and assumed the war would be over by now, sanctions would be lifted and Russia would be a profitable market. They stayed because they thought they would always have a chance to leave on the same conditions that were a year ago. Now they might want to leave and the profit of doing business there no longer makes sense, but they can’t sell it anymore for remotely acceptable cost. So they stay begrudgingly since they still keep hoping they will at least break even eventually.
It’s not necessarily a 100 percent comprehensive list, but the Yale “Chief Executive Leadership Institute” has a list of about 1,000 companies that are doing business in Russia, have curtailed operations in Russia, suspended operations, or withdrawn operations. The list is still being updated regularly.
