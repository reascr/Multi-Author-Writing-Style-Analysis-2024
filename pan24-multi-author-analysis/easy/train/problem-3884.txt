I mean, that's false. The Swiss we're part of the Holy Roman Empire for much of the middle ages. The Pope did not engage them as guards until 1506, and by 1515 their reputation on the battlefield began to wane as they were not effective against firearms. In 1523, Protestantism took hold in Switzerland, so not all Swiss are Catholics. Swiss neutrality came about in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars.
