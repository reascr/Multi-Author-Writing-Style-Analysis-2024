My kids all did AP courses, between the three now out they achieved around 60 credit hours that were accepted at their college of choice. We would have had to pay far more for dual credit which involves actually paying for college taught courses as opposed to simply paying fees for testing. Then there is the location of classes, if dual courses at community college involved attending at the community college or it's satellite locations it would not have been possible for our family to transport our children to and from our "local" community college which is an hour plus away on a good morning, 35 minutes away on a good afternoon and an hour and half away in evening rush hour, I do not understand the timing with this. So I while I see it as a viable option, it is also far more expensive than simple high school taught AP classes and it involves far more coordination and possible conflict with regularly required and scheduled high school classes and can also require parent transport, which in our case would not have been possible.
Eh. If we’re truly being honest, the College Board’s monopoly does a good job on its own of fucking over plenty of kids in the AP program.
