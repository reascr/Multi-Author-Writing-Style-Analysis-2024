So an accumulation of useable wealth (NOT the value accrued in the home you live in) that’s out of reach for 99.9% of the population is “too much” and “not worth it” if you get there. Got it.
Changing from democratic to independent doesn't really impact who the majority party is. Sanders and King are both independents but count for the democratic party when it comes to determining majority party. Sinema will be no different.
We want AOC, who voted to screw railroad workers, abstained on the hideous Iron Dome vote because Nancy Pelosi to told her to, when she could have help defeat it, ghosted Amazon workers when they were preparing to strike, forgot about caged latino orphans as soon as Biden took over, and voted to heavily fund the cops, right after she personally felt threatened by 500 MAGA AutoZone shift managers in antlers, waddling around the Capitol impotently.
What's that based off? Republicans aren't voting her. It's an easy campaign ad. She's voted 90% with Democrats as a Senator. It will be the right leaning Dems and those that always lean incumbent.
