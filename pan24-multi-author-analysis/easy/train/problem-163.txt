IDK. The thing I keep hearing is that Trump was talking (taxing?) out of both sides of his ass. On the one hand, he is claiming massive losses on his taxes. Or at least they look like massive losses to my poor ass. Then on the other side of the cheek, he's telling lenders that his properties are profitable and a good investment. So perhaps, and I'm just spitballing here, the actual release isn't to us, the American public, but rather Trumps backers and this is the way to alert them that the Count of mostly Crisco isn't the golden goose he claims to be. Now, it may be obvious to us all that Trump isn't the greatest business man, but thats just hearsay. Having his actual returns in hand, which is a piece of information that is normally not available in a regular business transaction, may just turn the tide on his ability to raise funds. Which likely explains the NFT scam. He likely owes someone big bucks and the release of his taxes is going to have quite a few powerful folks calling their markers. So IMHO this is a chess move to bring the power of lenders to bear and those folks are likely the only ones Trump is actually scared of.
