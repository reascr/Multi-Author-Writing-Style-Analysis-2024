An issue that I have is that this self-absorbed and COMPLETE waste of space (not to mention time and money) most likely knows nothing about the actual Salem witch trials in the 1600s. The Salem 'Interrogation' of the accused seemed like it was due to a personal hatred and complete disregard of the 'witches' (they were almost all women). Mood swings? Witch Introverted? Witch Outspoken? Witch Speaking about or showing concern towards anything of even slight importance? Witch And all of this without one shred of any objective EMPIRICAL evidence of 'witchcraft'. It's not like the accused had any kind of recourse or any say in this. It surely didn't prevent the fact that they would soon be burned alive. BURNED ALIVE.
The confirmation that Trump was a "sleeper agent" is not Trump saying "Russia", it's Manafort (Trump's campaign boss) giving polling data to Russian intelligence, and Stone (Trump's dirty tricks boss) coordinating with Russian intelligence to time the release of emails hacked by Russian intelligence.
