Someone needs to explain it to Trump this way: At the end of the day, he was an nothing more than a high level employee for the government, not the owner. When you are fired from your job, all documents pertaining to the job and it's trade secrets belong to your boss. He has/had zero authority. He can keep saying he does all he likes, that will never make it true.
>	(2) The term "Presidential records" means documentary materials, or any reasonably segregable portion thereof, created or received by the President, the Presidentâ€™s immediate staff, or a unit or individual of the Executive Office of the President whose function is to advise or assist the President, in the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President.
Can we just charge this fucker already? Midterms are over and everyone, including the GOP apparently, is pretty over Stupid Watergate. Throw the book at this idiot.
