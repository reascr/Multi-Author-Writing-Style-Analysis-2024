Well, I hope teachers receive extended leave and workers compensation when they are attacked and brutalized by these “children” as you attempt to deescalate a child’s aggression. Be careful that your attempt to deescalate equites to giving into the child’s demands and rewards the child for poor behavior.
You’re assumption is that the child that needs restraining is rational. Restraining is only the last resort and a good teacher would have already averted most situations. However, in cases where it is warranted, it is warranted for the safety of everyone involved. These de-escalating strategies do not usually work so well when the child is already in a crisis situation that would warrant restraining. Johny is stabbing someone, here you go johnny. IPad time for you. Seriously, wtf. It rewards bad behavior.
this... unfortunately. I've had to really rail into a teacher for this exact reason. the sad part is that myself (school psychologist) , the cse chair, and others offered various alternatives/buy stuff for her classroom to handle the students needs but all rejected because it's too much work. I get the kids can be difficult but strapping them down should not be an immediate/the go-to reaction.
