Yeah, they have a terrible track record of producing new aircraft and tanks. Except for the alligator, which is nice except why a fixed gun? I wouldn't say the US has a bad track record of producing a new MBT because they don't promise one. Refits aren't new, but are generally more than sufficient. Like you said - it's not necessarily the guns that are lacking. Although the lack of say things like an arena-m on their tanks reflects poorly on their capabilities to actually make modern shit.
Not saying everything is useless and not a threat - they just have a terrible track record on new tanks, planes, and tank systems. They sure do launch new rockets though. Wonder if it's because there's less room for graft.
No army in the world can operate under such conditions, for another example of what negative morale does look at the Afghanistan army, Trump negotiated US pullout and the Afghanistan elite were preparing to use their troops as sacrificial pawns to buy time to extract and move as wealth abroad as possible, the troops said fuck that and left their positions en mass because they like being alive and they weren't going to fight to the dead to save a bunch of corrupt assholes.
