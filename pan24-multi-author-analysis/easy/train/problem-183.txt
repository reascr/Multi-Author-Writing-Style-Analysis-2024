This person, contrary to the top level comment in this thread, is clearly not a murderer after googling him for 2 seconds. Super weird to see.
He was convicted for Terrorist activities and attempted murder, he got released in a prisoner exchange with Hamas , and then returned to terrorist activities and he's a leading memeber in the pfpo , he's being deported as part of a new law allowing the deportation of convicted terrorists.
Also, as he said, this is the second time. He was convicted two decades ago, served prison, but was released in a prisoner exchange with Hamas. You know, the jihadists.
>He has been repeatedly placed under a regime of administrative detention – which Amnesty International considers 'a major human rights violation'\[7\] – a procedure depriving people of their personal liberty\[8\] by arresting and keeping them in custody, without laying charges or putting them on trial. The procedure can be repeated indefinitely.\[9\]\[8\] It has been claimed that he has been held in detention for a crime of opinion.\[10\].
