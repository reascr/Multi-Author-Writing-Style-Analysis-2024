Maybe he’s getting senile and forgot. The house of Saud has never been our ally. They’ve cozied up to Republicans because they are more susceptible to bribery. They absolutely knifed Biden by agreeing to set a fixed price then renegotiate with Russia, probably at the behest of their GOP friends trying to use higher gas prices as a hot button issue to leverage the mid terms. Biden needs to fuck them back in a more meaningful way than just importing fuel from Venezuela and letting the Russians sell oil at a rate guaranteed to be 10% lower than the OPEC price. They need to lose out air missile defense protection and undo any pending weapons sale or open contract for service.
All we have to do is stop selling them US made weapons systems or even stop allowing our defense contractors to service what they currently have and pull our missile defense systems and they will fold like a cheap shirt.
