Ehh cut her some slack she spent a lot of time studying post industrial revolution working conditions via a time machine, so that probably influenced her opinion quite heavily.
No it isn't. Tell any Ukranian that the war started in 2022 and they'll call you ignorant as fuck. Idk what fantasy world you live in, but Russia is a far worse country than Qatar in the grand scheme of things. That's just a fact.
There is no freedom of expression, while Russia has at least the 'pretence' of legal protests and opposition, and there is at least some pretence at there being freedom of speech, while in Qatar there is not even a pretence, nor a legal opposition (there is legal opposition in Russia, albeit one controlled by the regime, they can still oppose the government on many issues, and even anti-government protests are on occasion approved). In Qatar you can legally and do get life sentences for criticism of the government. In Russia, while freedom of expression is supposedly protected by the constitution, its not entirely present either, but arrests for someone's speech is very rare, authorities often use other excuses for arresting someone for expressing their opinion (or assassination).
Yeah. Why was it perfectly fine to watch the 2018 world cup hosted in Russia, but we're supposed to feel bad about this one being hosted in Qatar?
My point is why are ppl only making a fuss about the Qatari WC when it's always been shit? It's literally just FIFA as usual, so idk why ppl are making a big deal out of it this time and try to shame others for enjoying the WC matches.
The corruption surrounding it isn't even worth highlighting as it's literally standard procedure with fifa and you talk about others being dumb ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.
