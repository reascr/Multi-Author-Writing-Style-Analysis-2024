That's a Reddit myth. Winnie the Pooh is not banned in China at all. You can buy figurines and dolls and paper plates and shit with him on it, like other mascots.
1) Incursion into… Russian territory? Wow, that would be a blatant obvious cause for war. But that didn't happen. Incursion into… an abstract fact about some other country, not applying military force? Wow, that's nowhere near what you'd call an incursion.
Exactly. There never was a treaty, period. Just because some dude who holds no power over NATO said something, that doesn't mean that countries who are willing to join NATO shouldn't be joining. NATO did not expand east, but eastern europeans countries ran west for protection against Russia.
Except it's totally appropriate. How come America's invasions are consistent with attempts to "forge better ties", and Russia's aren't? Like, the US didn't invade Russia, and Russia didn't invade the US. It's the NATO chief that's whatabouting here, by bringing up something actually unrelated.
