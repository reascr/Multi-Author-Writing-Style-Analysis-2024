The senate will pass a clean bill, the president will come out in favor of signing a clean bill, and the Republicans will still be talking about how they want to cut Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid in return for raising the debt limit. That's not going to play well. They'll try to make it appeal to the typical boomer self-interest by saying "We won't impact current recipients or anyone within 5 years of retirement age, but everyone else is gettings cuts". But if the Democrats have half a clue on this (and I believe that they do) they'll say "We aren't cutting Medicare, Social Security, or Medicaid. We already passed a clean bill in the Senate. All the house needs to do is pass that bill, but instead they want to crash the American economy so that they can destroy Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid." I think that the Dems learned a lesson from the RvW ruling being overturned, the American population has come to understand that things that we were fundamentally entitled to or always expected to be there actually could be taken away by Republicans, and they'll be on high alert this time around.
Exactly. It's not like the corps can't pay more to get everything they've ever wanted, they just don't need to.
