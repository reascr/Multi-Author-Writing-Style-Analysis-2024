I support anyone who is not hurting anyone else, to include LGBTQ, but none of the Canadian politico's responses did anything substantive to help that community in Russia, but they did help their own PR efforts, as well as the Russian's effort to make themselves look strong to the internal and external audiences they care about influencing.
That is rich, may god. Russia has this proverb: "There is two tragedy in russian family - Dad left us and dad stayed with us.".
Russia should demand Canada denounce Nazism and Fascism, treat indigenous peoples fairly, treat migrant workers fairly, stop Canadian Mining companies from commiting crimes against humanity and environment world wide.
I have to agree with the outliers on this one. Hundreds of thousands dead, wounded, raped, starving, but send a bad Tweet and Canada gets mad. I am Canadian and pretty pissed that this overshadows everything else. FFS, we ran out of weapons and real aid to send them, we have a very small contingent there training them since our military is over 10,000 short. But, now this tweet has Canada demanding an apology. Really? Stop the virtue signaling and do something real. Hell, call out Middle Eastern countries for their homophobia. You will never see her do that and they tweet that shit constantly.
