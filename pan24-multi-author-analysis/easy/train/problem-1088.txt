"The DNC" didn't do that. Biden was already leading by that point, he had massive leads in upcoming states, and the other moderate candidates (Buttigieg and Klobuchar) had no support in upcoming states and no money left to keep running, so they dropped out. That isn't a conspiracy, that is how primaries work. As for why they didn't endorse Bernie over Biden (which let's be honest, is the real reason you are upset with it): well, maybe Bernie's staff shouldn't have endlessly bashed all the other candidates the entire time with purity tests, alienating the supporters of those candidates. He couldn't make any coalitions with anyone, because they pushed everyone away.

Zelensky was really unpopular before the invasion. His popularity soared after that, because he was now the figure benefiting from a Rally Around the Flag phenomena, but he wasn't exactly doing well as President beforehand.
