when i read cyber punk books as a kid 20 years ago i thought that they were over the top and comically delusional in their predictions of the future!
Really.... It's about the "monthly fee" part. No car needs that. BMW took severe flack for a monthly fee for butt warmers. Sell the car... not a monthly fee schedule.
Oh yea I never drove an automatic I only ever drive manuals but even so engine breaking is even more important in electric cars as they can generate a lot of electricity from engine breaking extending you millage massively but even more important is that you never fill up a electric car to the brim because if you do so engine breaking will no longer work if the battery is fully charged to avoid overcharging the battery.
Sure... I could make the case either way - the fact that I think someone doing UX research on the experience of having a phone run out of battery before the end of the day could reasonably find that a majority of users would prefer a little slower but not running out and make a product case that the best way to ensure people are happy with their phones longer would be a software update that does that.
