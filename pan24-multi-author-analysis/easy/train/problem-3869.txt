The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of those problems that doesn't have a solution. I don't believe the two-state solution is viable: the Israeli government would never cede land in the West Bank after all the settlements they've built there, and a non-insignificant minority, if not a majority, of Palestinians would never accept a solution that doesn't result in the end of Israel. If a two-state solution was going to be implemented, it should have been done in the 1980s or 1990s. The only way it's going to end, if it ever ends, is with a complete and definitive victory of one side or another. Maybe the last Palestinians who live in the West Bank will be slowly expelled and Israel's Eastern border turned into a fortress; maybe there will be another war; but I don't see this conflict resolved diplomatically within this century or the next. The hatred and suspicion run too deep at this point. When the younger generations, those who were born long after the initial wars in 1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973, take up the mantle, as they have, it's time to acknowledge that simply waiting for the current generation to die and a new generation to repair the damage is not going to work. The attacker here was only 13 years old. There are Palestinian babies, who know nothing of the world, who will sadly grow up to be murderers because of indoctrination by their parents and society.
Also, if Israel had been conducting a genocide of the Palestinian people, there would be no more Palestinian people today. Anyone can Google a of the Palestinian population over time. That doesn't look like a genocide to me.
Israel forcing people to live under whatever conditions in Gaza is a very strong position to hold, considering Gaza also shares a border with Egypt and that their situation is of their own making after Israel completely withdrew from Gaza and they decided to turn to terrorism rather than make peace and build and develop their society and communities.
