Religious Zionist MK Simcha Rothman took issue with Zelensky’s reference to Ukrainians who saved Jews and tweeted: “I don’t understand Ukrainian, but if the translation I heard is accurate, Zelensky asked us to treat the Ukrainians like they treated us 80 years ago. I’m sorry, but I think we will have to reject that request. We are, after all, a moral nation.”.
Iran is Israel's number 1 security issue (via various proxies) and is currently profiting massively (both financially and technologically) by positioning itself as the closest ally of Russia.
The past? Just last week they voted for Israel to be disarmed from nukes and to condem Israel for fighting back against the lion's den and the pij ( both are terrorist organizations supported by Russia ) they want our support they have to support us first ( something they never did).
How? South Africa did the same thing and they were treated far worse than Israel. And some the strongest voices against Israels occupation in the west come from Jewish scholars like Chomsky and Finkelstein.
