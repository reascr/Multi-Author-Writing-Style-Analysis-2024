And it’s actually pretty normal to see this kind of thing go on for a long time depending on tectonics. I mean we are talking about landmasses that move 1ft per year, and if they slip, there’s no guarantee that they won’t continue to slip more for the foreseeable future. push two jagged pieces of plastic together and one kind of slips under the other. Eventually one piece will break and a huge slip happens. Whether or not a huge slip will happen again is entirely predicated on where the previous break stopped slipping g. Could be tomorrow, could be centuries.
Unfortunately the latter. And yea, to answer your question about this pre dating Erdoğan. You bet it does. BUT, İstanbul did suffer an earthquake (though not as severe as this) back in 1999. There’s been a lot of taxes collected since then specifically to prepare. Where did that money go? In Erdoğan’s own cabinets words “just because it was collected for the earthquake doesn’t mean it was going to be spent for it” (2 years ago I think).
Absolutely devastating. The first was heartbreaking; an almost unbelievable event. And then this. I hope our country continues to assist in every way possible.
