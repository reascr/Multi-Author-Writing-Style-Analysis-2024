Secondly I know the teams would never withdraw like I said they should, they're in the business of playing soccer/football and there would be all sorts of negative lasting repercussions for the national teams and the individuals involved, and probably a tiny minority of players would even want to consider boycotting...I just don't see any other truly meaningful way for FIFA to be held responsible for their ethical corruption.
They should be creative. If they have only banned the OneLove armbandâ€¦. Then they should just adjust their kit to OneLove tops and rainbow socks.
Presumably because Qatar has migrant workers it mistreats (they aren't African, but who's counting), they notoriously have very few rights for women, apparently they do have rights for disabled people (so this shouldn't actually be listed), and being homosexual is outright illegal in Qatar.
Hi. Conservative redditor here. Can we all agree that canceling FIFA is the right thing to do? This organization is 100x more corrupt than anything we have here in the US, and that's saying a lot because the NFL is by all accounts pretty shitty.
