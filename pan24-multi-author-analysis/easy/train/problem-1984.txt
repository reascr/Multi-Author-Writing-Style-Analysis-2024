In 10-15 years we're going to hear news reports of Russians lamenting the loss of a generation as there will be no young men left to generate the next generation.
It's actually sickening. I used to look at the Russian casualty numbers with a bit of joy hoping it would spur a retreat or peace treaty and end the war. But now that they are mostly conscripts, its just sad. Wagner can still get fucked though, rack up the score on those dickheads.
Rus' language (also called "ruthenian language" or sometimes "old east slavic") is a precursor to the ukrainian and belarusian languages, and actually I believe that a modified version of it, along with a society of modern ruthenians still exist in the western part of Ukraine, in Hungary, Slovakia and maybe other countries. That trail of thought is corroborated by historians of many countries - except our one and only Russia Muscovy, which to this day calls it "proto-russian language" or "old russian language".
The term "Kievan Rus' " was specifically crafted by historians of the Russian empire in the beginning and middle of the 19th century. That period of time was right after Catherine II's rule, and she was adamant on rewriting the history of the lands captured by russians - to solidify russian claim on them, and stregnthen their own history. (Naturally, the usage of the term "kievan rus", meaning Rus' of Kiev, implied there existed "muscovian rus", meaning Rus' of Muscovy, which of course gives russians additional reasons to believe that history of Rus = history of modern Russia). Prior to that it, along with all other claims of modern Russia on Slavic history, didn't exist.
