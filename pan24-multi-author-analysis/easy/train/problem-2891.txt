My irrational self: But what if NATO decided to say "yeah that wasn't Russia" to avoid war, and to make the excuse that the US should send better air defense systems to Ukraine. It's the perfect opportunity to show that you did your diligence and you're not irrational like Russia. That you investigate things and you'll call a spade a spade. The alternative would be some awkward use of force that Poland would have to carry out to show it can't be bullied and then it puts them on the brink of open war. Instead NATO gains global credibility and doesn't have to get pushed into open war.
Absolutely. "They" have no obligation to tell "us", but "they" probably knew the answer the instant it all happened. Just took a few hours for info to go up the chain and nations to coordinate and decide on a response.
I'm disappointed especially with associated press. Their wording was intentionally confusing and implying who's the guilty one. They even added "official sources", but never clarified this either. All while Pentagon itself couldn't confirm a missile yet.
