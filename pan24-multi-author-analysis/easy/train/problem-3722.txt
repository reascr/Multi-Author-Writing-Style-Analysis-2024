I don't doubt Iran has good soldiers, what I do doubt is that they're as well trained and equipped as the Israeli military. That said you're right that there's little point in Israel invading Iran, at the same time Iran's regime is intent on making their anti-Israel stance and existential one, so Israel's just gonna do what it always does: try to destabilize Iran as much as it can.
But when it comes to the moral high ground in an Iranian-Israeli conflict specifically, in my mind Iran has even less - not least because Israel didn't really do anything to Iran to instigate Iran's hated of it other than just being a Jewish state trying to exist in the middle east.
What you gonna do? Train terrorist groups to harm Israel? Threaten it with extermination? What are you going to do what you haven’t done yet? Because we all know that the Ayatollah regime is to chickenshit to do anything more than what they haven’t done already.
Incorrect. Iran would get curb stomped no question and their poorly trained, under-equipped soldiers would get rocked.
