Fully agree with you. But I really want to see NATO tanks parading through the Kremlin. A childish fantasy one might say but I still want to dream dammit.
they dont really have the men or capacity for an amphibious assault anymore, and by this point their slightly lacking in standing or collateral to bring to the negotiating table, specially when every other agreement russia has promptly ignored and nigh literally spat upon, lest we forget bombing negotiated civilian evacuation corridors.
