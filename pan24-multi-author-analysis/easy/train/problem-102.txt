Matt is a toddler. Recall the time when he mustered some of the other psychos to storm the SCIF where the intel committee was holding depositions related to the infamous trump/zalinski call? “I need you to do us a favor though”? Yeah, Matt thought it would be funny to disrupt that deposition and order in pizzas - postponing the committee by threatening the Capitol police guarding the SCIF, entering the room, holding a pizza party, and requiring a subsequent 8 hour long sweep for electronic devices because they broke every security protocol with that stunt. He’s a congressman that wants to be an internet influencer. It’s all performance with that clown.
