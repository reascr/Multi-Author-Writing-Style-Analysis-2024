I think most of the time it's one of those things where you don't realize how far deep you're in until it already happened. I don't know anything about this particular case but that's generally how these things go. What I imagine happened is that a former military pilot has been offered a lucrative civilian job from a non-chinese person/business that required them to move to another country. Then a couple of years into your job you get offers to train some young people to fly. Maybe you notice they're Chinese, maybe you were told they are Korean. Anyway once you notice something is seriously wrong and you were told to "explain" military matters, It's already too late. I mean, what are you going to do, go to US and tell them you were accidentally part of the Chinese training program for the past couple of years? But you didn't notice something was wrong until last week, pinky swear? And come to think of it you were payed a lot for the last couple of years, and I mean a lot of money. No way that's legal too.
"The foreign earned income exclusion mitigates double taxation on income from work, but the Internal Revenue Code treats ordinary foreign savings plans held by residents of foreign countries as if they were offshore tax avoidance instruments and requires extensive asset reporting, resulting in significant costs for Americans at all income levels to comply with filing requirements even when they owe no tax".
