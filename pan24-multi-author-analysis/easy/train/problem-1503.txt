This is why Iâ€™m sure the military-industrial complex lobbyists will be having some words with the Qpublicans saying theyâ€™ll withdraw support for Ukraine. Theyâ€™re paying off the materiel acquisitions from the West with live battle testing of the fancy new hardware.

Well. Regardless. Although it has been going really bad for Russia, their firepower is quite something. So it is somewhat difficult to counter everything. Moreover you donâ€™t win by just defending. So other stuff to actually attack was also needed. Then there is the issue of keeping the whole standoff from overheating. At the end of the day the USA cannot and will not throw in all it has because nobody wants this to end in a full out war with Russia. So there is always going to be talk why the US did not more to help because in theory it always can. The key idea though is that Russia should loose. For that to happen the USA does not need to do all it can with all the risks involved. It just has to do enough. There are many many variables involved in what the USA is willing to do. But, it looks like the USA will just get what it wants while fighting with one hand behind their back. They actually always do that regardless of winning or loosing. This time though, they are pretty committed to get what they want. I guess that idea has settled in quite well among the Russians. I hope they loose a lot of sleep over it.
Not necessarily. Most of the weapons are older and already tested, and itâ€™s dangerous to allow new weapons to be used there because the enemies of the US are keen to get their eyes and engineers on new US tech.
