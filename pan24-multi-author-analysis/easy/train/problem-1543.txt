So when liberals say that outcomes are the result of choices we make as a society or the systems we’ve built, republicans get indignant. They deserve their wealth, power, and health because that is who they are, and any suggestion otherwise is an insult. Also if you dare suggest that they change something about their life, how they go about their day, to improve others’ outcomes, they lose their minds. You’re messing with the sacred hierarchies to help people who they think inherently don’t deserve better outcomes.
Really? I've been wanting a gas stove for a while. I have a gas water heater on the other side of the wall. Maybe I should get a quote. I assumed it would be too expensive.
Republicans believe in hierarchy. There are the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the healthy and the sick. And where you land in those hierarchies is just who you are. No one did anything to put you there, no system caused you to land there. You are poor or weak or sick because of who you are, period.
