State they are “willing” to negotiate— people remember they have done so they are not idiots. It’s the difference of supporting them with no feasible end in sight or supporting them knowing at some point (like most every war) they will still be willing to go to the table. It is simple perspective. No one is asking them to negotiate and not hold their own at the table or give in to Russian insane demands — just keep on saying they are willing to end this at the table at some point. If they can’t do that supporting them in effect means there will be no end (even if they push Russia out it will remain an active perpetual war).
Absolutely insane. Can they not imagine what it'd feel like for them if their people were being killed, raped, and tortured? How difficult it would be to try and find peace with someone who is the cause for having tens of thousands of people die for nothing?
Absolutely fair. I'm Canadian, so maybe it's partially an outsiders perspective on this topic, but on my end the same is definitely true for my people - very gullible (I'm sometimes guilty of this too.).
