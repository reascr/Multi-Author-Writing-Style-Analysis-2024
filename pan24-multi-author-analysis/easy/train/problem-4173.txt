Obviously social media platforms have come and gone in the past, and I absolutely believe the world can move on from Twitter, but it's hard for me to imagine exactly what that will be like. Companies and celebs have invested more than a decade in building massive followings. Individuals have spent that time cultivating networks that are integral to their careers, hobbies, political movements building. Even governments use Twitter as a crucial source of disseminating information, but that wouldn't be worth much if there wasn't an established base of users built up over many years... I could be very wrong but if the world is going to move to another platform, it's hard for me to imagine how it's not going to be slow and painful.
Guilt by indirect association? If I go to my local grocery store, and they have a Twitter account that I have no idea about, I'm part of the problem? LOL no.
The thing is Twitter actually tried combating misinformation. Especially during covid and the 2020 election. Where Facebook and Instagram did nothing.
