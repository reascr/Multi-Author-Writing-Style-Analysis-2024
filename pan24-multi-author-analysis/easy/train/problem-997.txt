He had some good photos floating around and that probably made him pretty popular alone. Then when it turned out he was pro Ukraine everybody just nutted and instantly loved him.

E.g. Russia, albeit possessing good aircrafts, it never does such trainings, most you'll see in Syria or Ukraine are pilots flying in pairs. That's part of Russian military doctrine, as they always assumed since Soviet times that NATO forces would dominate the sky, thus they never developed actively such capabilities, but instead focused on anti aircraft and mechanized forces.
The only huge thing missing in this conflict is airforce, but there's only one airforce on the planet which actively trains complex war simulations involving bombers, fighters, anti aa aircradt, etc in combination with infantry and mechanized troops and that's Nato itself.
