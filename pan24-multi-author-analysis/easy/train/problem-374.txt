They’re not far off from getting the Republican Spain treatment, western democracies are slow to move while the authoritarian axis that’s aiding Russia is much faster moving (even if what they supply is garbage, you’re far better off having immediate garbage tanks than having to wait for international consensus to get a trickle of high tech supplies when Ukrainian men and women are dying in the snow).
Wow.. you figured that out all by yourself?? Good for you shithead.. only this time there won't be a lend lease or a few million Soviet civilians from neighboring countries to save your country's sorry ass. Enjoy!
Nazi Germany was an incredibly screwed up country but they inherited the amazing skills and traditions of the German army (that broke through the Entente front in 1918 without any tanks, just by good tactics alone) and the quality of the German bureaucracy (which wasnt super efficient but very much doing their work correctly and were not nearly as corrupt as most other countries).
No. They’re just pointing out that there’s a difference between building effective military institutions and inheriting them. Any changes the Nazis introduced to the German military were usually ideologically driven rather than in the interest of making it a more effective fighting force.
