That's not an attempt at deception or anything, though. Many "Liberal Parties" in the world are rooted in classical liberalism, which specifically refers to economic liberalism and not social liberalism, with "economic liberalism" being "complete and total deregulation of capitalism". This is why the opposition to Liberal Parties are often Labour Parties - the laissez-faire policies of classical liberalism are often disastrous for the working class in the long-run and thus organized labour is naturally the opposition to it. Classical liberalism is also critically built on "individual rights" to the extent that it rejects government protection of group rights (or government protection of anything, really), which is why with the "Big Tent Party" philosophy large political parties adopt, social conservatives often fall under Liberal Parties while social liberals fall under Labour, which is built around group protectionism.
Back in the day I was a Geri fan. After the break up I think I liked Emma best. Now as an older dude looking back, yeh, Mel C was the best. And still is.
