Except when they do a buyback, to the penny there are shareholders that will be selling. Those shareholders will pay taxes on those shares sold collectively exactly the same as a dividend would pay taxes. In the case of dividends it will be many paying a small amount. Buyback will be few paying a large amount.
That's a good thing because it'll either a) increase tax revenues for the gov't which is beneficial to lower income canadians via social programs or b) encourage companies to spend more on R&D which grows the economy or c) increase dividend payouts, which are beneficial to Canadians, especially those with incomes lower than 90k.
Not how it works. Buybacks are the company acknowledging they donâ€™t have better organic uses of the capital (eg no Capex projects or R&D they can invest in), so they are returning the money to shareholders. It is most prominently a feature of mature industries / companies. The money they return to shareholders via buybacks can then be reallocated to more productive segments of capital markets (eg startups, growth companies in need of capital, etc) which is ultimately more productive for the economy.
