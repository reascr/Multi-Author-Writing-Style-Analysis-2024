One of the great downsides of the internet and all the information it provides is that people think their side has merit regardless of how stupid or ridiculous it is just because someone can make a video in their truck and yell about how they know "the truth" about any particular subject. You just have to sound like you KNOW what you're talking about (sometimes that doesn't even matter) and they'll use a clip like that as "evidence" that their side is presenting real facts and arguments instead of conspiracy nonsense.
Another Floridian; yep. Much prefer to be inland at the headwaters of three major rivers than on the coast lol.
You mischaracterize. It's not the Boomers it's all the fucking Conservatives. I live in Gilbert. It is still very Red. They just re-elected insurrectionist Biggs. Conservatives don't want to pay for schools, city services, roads, etc.
Common misunderstanding. You were hearing “research” meaning investigation and seeking of evidence and corroborating facts to test or disprove a hypothesis.
