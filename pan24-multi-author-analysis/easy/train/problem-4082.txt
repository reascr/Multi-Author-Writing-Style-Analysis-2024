Just because you know the position of a whole range of defensive guns doesn't mean you can just take them out, even if you didn't mind declaring war on turkey and NATO while losing a war against another small independent nation.
Any force large enough to simultaneously taken out all the guns before passing, ignoring anti ship missile launchers, would be very noticeable as an invasion force, and would cause turkey to send their fleet there as well as requesting NATO navy support.
No. The Bosporus will still be in Turkiye and they will still be the major power on that region of the alliance. They will not be diminished at all. The inclusion of all strenhens all.
If the worst was to ever happen NATO wouldn't stand together, to many different politics, to many different views, to many language barriers and no common goal as each country has its own interests, NATO would all disband, there is already to much inside problems and then there is also the people, alot who want sanctions lifted because of the cost of living crisis, Europe would completely turn on each other.
