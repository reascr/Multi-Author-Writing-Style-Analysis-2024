Keeping them engaged and energized is going to be tricky, especially with the Dem structure that gives positions of power based on seniority. It will require running younger candidates and raising their profile within the party. It can be done, but will it?
After someone sent Trump clips of the debate, the former president called Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel that night and floated the possibility of nixing his endorsement of Lombardo, according to The Times.
Like… i read both of your links. Im not aware nor have i ever been aware of any “seniority” system. In addition, the first link is an opinion piece from 2006 whereas the other one is 5 years old with a mention of a reliance on seniority sometimes but not like its a concrete part of the party “platform” or something.
There is no “official” “yea we use the seniority system” within the democratic party just bc there were a few articles about them doing it for some leadership positions… you’re taking a very odd stance here. Im 37 and have taken political communication type clases for a masters in comm before and have never ever heard anything about this “stance” being an “official” part of any democratic platform. Huh?
Democrats use a seniority system to choose leadership positions, while this helps to ensure a more diverse leadership, it also leads to most, if not all, Dem leadership within congress being given to people with the longest tenure, and as such, leads to most of the Dem leadership being really old in comparison to the average age of their constituents. So, when younger generations of voters look to the party, and see a bunch of people as old, if not older than their grandparents, are they going to stay engaged and excited? I hope so, but there is a risk that they won't.
