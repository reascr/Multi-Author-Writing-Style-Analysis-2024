Yeah, the point was that the medicine might have parts that don't do anything against the thing you are trying to cure trough biological means. One of these options is actually just making the medicine taste bad, because many people perceive that as being more efficient. Sometimes the secondary ingredients might be active for something else, biology and nutrition is very complex and there are very few things that pass trough us without doing anything, even sugar pills would increase blood sugar. But the point is that the ingredient doesn't have biological causal relation with the thing you are trying to cure. And it might be that if you give the patient the nutrient supplement and the medicine separately, you would not get as good results as you would get when they are administered as single product, because the patient might perceive the improvement from the nutrients as separate and think the real medicine to be less efficient.
Look into it. It's really interesting. Medication companies are realizing that a lot of their medications don't work any better than placebos (and sometimes worse than placebos), so its cheaper to use placebos. There are also placebo surgeries.
