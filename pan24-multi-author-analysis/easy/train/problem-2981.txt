The U.S. targeted the Russia-backed Wagner Group in a new round of sanctions on Thursday, labeling the mercenary group a transnational criminal organization and accusing it of atrocities in Ukraine and around the world.
Where did I say it was a failure? I said that invading and occupying Russia is a huge ordeal being suggested (countries don't tend to give up their leaders to foreign courts without a fight) and in practice it tends to end up more like Saddam Hussein being found in a ditch and unceremoniously hung followed by decades of sectarian violence than anything approximating the orderly moral courts you're suggesting.
Don’t kill me please I have a real question. What’s the difference between what was once called BlackWater and Wagner. I’m not say that they are the same or anything like that. But I had assumed mercenary’s were extremely frowned upon in the international community. Specifically meaning that you can’t use a mercenary forced to go take over another country. I understand blackwater roll was slippery slope. But more insight here would be helpful to me personally. Iraq war vet here with a huge dislike for PMC.
