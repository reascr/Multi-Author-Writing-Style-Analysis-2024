I'd 1000% be for this idea. I'd throw in that there should be greatly increased taxes for any residential property in which the owner (person or corporation) doesn't declare it as their primary residence, with some kind of grace period for changing primary residency.
It's not "oops, we spent it all". The economy changed. A budget surplus depends on revenue, and revenue increases when the economy does well. The blame here goes to a global supply chain crisis, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which created an energy crisis through much of the world at the same time. Nothing California can do to change those things.
