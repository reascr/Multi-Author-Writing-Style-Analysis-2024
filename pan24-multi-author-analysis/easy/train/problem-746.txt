"The state having to certify without the county in question" may have the effect of teaching GOP supervisors in net-GOP counties to not pull this shit in the feature for fear of losing races they won - and believe me, I would love to see Kirsten Engel and Kathy Hoffman as elected officials this time next year - but it will also set legal precedent for Republican certifiers in Dem-leaning counties to not certify, which more often than not is a lot more votes in question than your average Republican county.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yep. Maricopa County is currently 4R-1D on their Board of Supervisors, if 3 of those 4 get successfully primaried suddenly you could have a pro-"refuse to certify for the fuck of it" majority on a big Dem. county. Same goes with those certification boards in Michigan that are always 2R-2D regardless of county.
