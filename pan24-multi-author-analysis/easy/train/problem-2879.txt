Maybe don’t take loans to begin with? If your comeback is “rich bastard” I am not rich. I work full time and go to uni at the same time. I work to pay for my own school. I am not privileged. I work retail. A college degree can be achieved. Maybe attend a community college first get your basics done? I do fell bad for people that were mislead to get a loan, but I do not fell sympathy for those who willingly took a loan and knew they would not be able to pay it with the degree they were aiming for or did not use the opportunity wisely. I do not support to full blown student loan forgiveness. This greatly gives me and others who worked their asses off to pay for their school a jab in the face all our work for nothing. If I knew ppls loans would be forgiven I would have given to instant gratification and gotten them myself. I do support for a wider legislation in regards to change predatory loans given out to students. Sorry for the rant. First time I ever given my opinion on the topic on Reddit. I would like to hear your opinion about this.
What constitutes "classroom instruction"? Formal programs or a teacher having a picture of a spouse on their desk count? If they read a story that mentions people being in a relationship (like Cinderella, the Little Mermaid), is that classroom instruction on orientation? Does having something like a rainbow flag count? What if a student is facing abuse at home and is looking for a trusted adult to talk to? Is "draw a picture of your family" covered by that (and does that answer change if a student has same-sex parents)?
