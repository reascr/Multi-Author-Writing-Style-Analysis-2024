Right, if only Joe Biden had stepped in and blocked all those CEOs of all those global companies from shutting down their supply chains in anticipation of no one buying anything during COVID...oh, and override Xi's lockdowns that was grinding the Chinese economy to a halt where the world gets all it's foods processed and goods from...oh, and stopped Putin before he went to war with Ukraine that impacted global wheat and grain prices, and stopped the Saudis from raising the price of oil at the same time causing global oil prices to rise and in turn giving US oil companies an excuse to jack up gas prices making the cost of goods more expensive...actually, come to think of it, its all Hillary's fault for not beating Trump and therefore doing a far better job of managing the impact of COVID and not attacking trade agreements and putting tariffs on China that, you guessed it, jacked up prices on everything...is anyone paying attention anymore?
Yup. Trump or Biden or the Tooth Fairy president would have had the same challenges with inflation given COVID. The real question in my mind is not assigning blame for who caused it, it is what measures are being taken to reduce the problem while the system works itself out. I like problem solvers not problem makers/blamers.
