It's not. Trust me, it's not. The last time I got into a serious discussion of the engineering challenges of fusion reactors someone flat out didn't believe me because the fuel they run on is so insanely rare it literally cannot be found in nature (tritium). Challenge two is the fusion temperature of 100,000,000 C, which is what we'd tend to call "pretty hot." It kind of goes on from there...
Seeing as the technology for renewables has been available for a while, and a lack of funding or subsidies (looking at the UK here, where over 90% of money spent by fossil fuel energy research was tax deductible compared to almost no tax subsidies for renewable energy research), as well as arguments by governments the world over regarding the efficacy and "marring natural beauty" has held back their development and rollout (particularly by predominantly right wing government actors who tend to be stakeholders in the continued success of oil companies), it's actually rather easy to draw the conclusion that there has been a conspiracy behind the continued use of fossil fuels.
