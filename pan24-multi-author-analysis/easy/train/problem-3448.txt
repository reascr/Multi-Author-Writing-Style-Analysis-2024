Average Russian salary is 500 dollars per month. So many people simply can’t afford to leave. Those who can choose closer or cheaper places. IT guys go to Georgia, Turkey, Armenia, Thailand, Kazakhstan. Those who are richer try to go to Europe but without a draft notice on your ass it hard to get in. America is probably the hardest. Plus there’s those who have to leave everything behind. Some have to come back too, mostly for family reasons. I left half a year ago, found a job and got temporary residence. But my family flat out refuses to join me and blames me for abandoning them. Since I didn’t get a draft notice I’ll have to go back, knowing I’ll have to deal with the Z people and watch my every step. It’s very hard to leave. And nobody will welcome us with open arms and they don’t have to. Restarting your life is very very hard. I’m saying this from experience and I had a lot of help.
The American revolution. The leaders of the revolution were all wealthy people who had enough resources to fund an army to fight the British. Most of their families amassed their wealth in america, with American resources. And had an ocean separating them from their enemy, who was at war with their neighbours. They also got foreign aid from countries that were at war with the British.
