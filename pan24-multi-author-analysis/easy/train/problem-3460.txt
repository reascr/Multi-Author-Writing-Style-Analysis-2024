Any kiss that involves an LGBTQ character? Extremely sexually explicit! (Though the Republicans in charge will need to read the passages a few dozen more times in private just to be sure.).
And even better, they'll ban reading entirely except for the upper classes (fun fact, England's test for being a clergyman was the ability to read; punishments like execution for theft may seem harsh, but they could be "clergy-able", which means priests got a lighter sentence, though crimes like murder were not clergyable. Thieves couldn't read, naturally, but they proved they could by reading the "neck verse", so called because it saved your neck, though most of them memorized it instead of reading. Of course, if the magistrate didn't like you, he could enforce the full penalty anyways.).
Absolutely. The fact that mammary glands are intrinsic to female mammals and become active before/after child birth - which we all know is caused by sexual intercourse - means milking a cow is encouraging sexual thoughts.
