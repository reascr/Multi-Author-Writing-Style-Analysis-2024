In short, a dangerous variant would most likely mutate / appear only in an environment with a lot of immune people (this is what Lina calls "immune pressure"). In China the virus doesn't have such pressure to mutate because people have 0 immunity, so the risk of a threatening variant coming from China is low, but the risk is not 0.
Do you know that for a vaccine resistant variant to grow, it would most likely be in a population with high immunity, and given that in China, people have no immunity, the chances of such a variant to emerge are actually low?
Smh. Either a majority of people are really just guppies and canâ€™t retain any information for an extended period of time, or reddit is just a domestic propaganda machine now. Or even worse: both.
I do think we need to test people from China on arrival to monitor the variants from there (because CCP lies about the covid situation in China and is not keen to share accurate information, like they did when the pandemic started) but banning entry to people doesn't achieve anything (variants will spread anyway) and is a simple move which scores easy political points.
