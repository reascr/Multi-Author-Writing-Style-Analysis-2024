What???? foxnews with a hot take critical of biden and the dems? I don't bellieve it. I guess the only way I would believe they would write something with this angle is if I had read any of their previous 'news' articles....Dont bother clicking on the site and giving them any revenue. Just downvote and move on.
I remember after some other mass shooting a longish time ago (maybe around 2013, I think it was after the Boston Marathon terrorist attack; this will come up a bit later here) a conservative former classmate of mine (we went to the same high school but this was after we graduated) posted a video on FB titled something like "teenager DESTROYS lawmaker's arguments for gun control." I watched the video. And the argument was basically "if we have gun control it will make it harder for me to go hunting with my dad.".
