They’ll 100% run out the clock after submitting several increasingly terrible partisan maps. Then they’ll have the election with an illegal map, just like in Ohio where I voted and was wronged by the government.

People fitting this description are disproportionately non-white and vote disproportionately democrat.
I thought I explained this in my first post, but maybe I can be more clear. In the example of North Carolina, the Republican lawmakers looked at the data of what races of voters had which IDs. Based on that information, they allowed IDs for Voting that White voters tended to have more often, and blocked IDs for Voting that Black voters tended to have the most.
Republican lawmakers in North Carolina have a history of determining how Black voters vote and taking away those methods. Whether it was certain types of ID that Black voters had more often than white voters, early voting vs Election Day voting, locations that tended to have more Black voters - North Carolina Republicans targeted Black voters to try and obstruct their path to their right to vote.
