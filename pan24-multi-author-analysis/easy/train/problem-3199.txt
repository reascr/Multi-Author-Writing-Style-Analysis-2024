The Budapest Memorandum has never been some open-ended defensive pact. I'm pissed off by people with justice boners decades later insisting that international agreements that are incredibly difficult to put together as-written also include implicit terms for military intervention. The reason the Budapest Memorandum doesn't explicitly state that the US and UK will intervene with significant aid in the case of a Russian conventional invasion of Ukraine is that in 1994, when the agreement was signed, nobody was willing to make promises like that. At no point in the 20-30 years since then has any country made any amendments to the Memorandum to indicate that they would like to start offering stronger security guarantees. Everyone who actually wanted a security guarantee from the US and UK applied to NATO. Everyone that the US and UK wanted to offer an ironclad security guarantee to, they allowed into NATO.
Seriously lol. Manpads, anti-tank, and HIMARS have ruined Russia's entire modern military strategy. They're back to : blow everything up with artillery and attempt to claim the rubble heap.
