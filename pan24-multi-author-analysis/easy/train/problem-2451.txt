Nuclear is hard and only so safe because it's got expensive standards. The technology is still probably going to be renewables which have advantages in cost, speed and ease of safety over nuclear.
Nuclear. We have the technology, itâ€™s safer than Chernobyl days, and relatively clean. The only real issue is where to store the waste.
It's an accident that has cost over $100 billion dollars, nearly caused the complete collapse of nuclear power sector in Japan (which previously had 30% of its power from nuclear) and did seal the death of nuclear power in Germany, led to 154,000 people being evacuated temporarily and 28,000 of them still not returning home 11 years later, 322 square kilometres remain under evacuation orders. Yes it was a horrible accident.
This fear mongering and conspiracy theory pedaling behavior from an under-educated population is what has resulted in today's problems. I know a few Germans and I've had some frustrating conversations with them about the safety of nuclear. They think it's this really dangerous thing and their opinions are disconnected from reality.
