Fast foward a few years. My wife had a one-time windfall from joining and then leaving an employer that resulted in a significant bump in income. We paid estimate taxes during the year, then I paid the taxes due online when I mailed the return. Thirteen months later, the IRS notified us that they hadn’t received our return, so I sent another copy. Then they sent a bill for $15k as a late fee penalty, (which is based on the income for that year). I wrote written protest after written protest that it made no sense that I would pay the amount owed online and then NOT send the return. But because there was no payment included, I foolishly didn’t get confirmation of receipt. The IRS refused to waive the penalty. One reason I was told was that they could forgive late filing, but I had already had a late penalty fee waived for the tax filing fiasco. So because they had waived $37 in a late filing fee, which I wasn’t even aware that I could decline, the IRS refused to waive a $15k filing fee.
