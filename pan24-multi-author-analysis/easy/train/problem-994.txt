You’re holding and staring at something produced with oil, right now. Look around your house. Almost every single thing in it was produced with oil, somehow. You are wearing it, you brush your teeth with it, you consume your food from it. You cherish vinyl records made from it. You have breathed it, eaten it, and bathed in it every single day of your entire life. And so does every other person you’ve ever met.
Yeah, I've been harping on the Biden solar tariffs since he took office believing that if it was brought to the public's attention, that the Biden administration would be shamed into admitting it was wrong to hold onto the Trump tariffs on solar products which goes beyond PV to include things like solar water heaters but I was wrong because we're in the third year of his administration and this administration is digging in hard on these tariffs that ultimately benefit the fossil fuels lobby.
Now look down your street. See all the other houses, with all their people and things? See their cars and curtains, their roofing tiles and paint and garden hoses and lawnmowers and garbage cans? That’s just a tiny little, molecule-sized piece of how big oil is.
