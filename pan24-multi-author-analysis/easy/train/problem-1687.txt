It's much more complex than that. In order for Russia to feel "safe" geopolitically, and possess land, that allows them to make enough money to compete, they 'need' to expand. Their infrastructure is absolutely terrible.
Look, with that I agree. I'm a young person, trying to progress in my professional career, save some money, buy a nice house with a garden, start a family, all the usual. It would be fucking unfair if Russia invaded my country, killed my countrymen, destroyed our society and economy and forced me to flee as a refugee or fight as a soldier. And it would be equally unfair if my country surrendered and we had to adopt a slew of bullshit political measures to make sure that corrupt Russian oligarchs can continue exploiting my country, our citizens (including me) remain poor, my political opinions are outlawed and my right to choose my country's leader revoked, and isolated from the European Union and the Western World, which is free and democratic.
He should have asked the Marines. They would have told him at the start. If you ever find yourself in a fair fight, you fucked up. On the wrong end of an unfair fight? You really fucked up!
