Your right...I was a bit frustrated and misspoke. Thanks. Either way,, the US is being flooded by manufacturing goods from the both. However, we know how manipulative the Chinese are. Driving down market costs by flooding the market with their products. Meanwhile, it's workers are paid room n board and food rations. We can go on and on...NOW, my government, the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS EVERY BIT AS CROOKED AND CRIMINAL AS THE REST. MAYBE THE WORST. Our government attempts to mask that by advertising to the world how free its citizens are. How e eryome eats. DONT GET ME WRONG, I LOVE MY COUNTRY! BEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. All we need is all these geriatrics in US government to STEP ASIDE. For the young generation. After all, the future is the youth. Gotta stop allowing these 65yr old + Government officials to remain in office. THEY LIVE IN THE PAST. THE COUNTRIES DIFFERE T NOW. THE WORLDS DIFFERENT. (MY opinion)- I felt Trump was and could have been the most productive and best leader this countries seen in decades. HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT. THAT PELOSI AND THOSE SUPER ULTRA SOCIALIST LIBERALS FABRICATED A MOCKERY DURING TRUMPS TERM. Only in America can you have movie stars stand on stage s reaming FUCK TRUMP etc. Etc..or People like Pelosi defame our country's president the way it happened. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, CITIZENS BASH AND DEGRADE THEIR COUNTRIES LEADER LIKE THAT....THEY WAKE UP MISSING, NEVER TO BE HEARD OF AGAIN. Freedom.
The conventional wisdom was that economic development inevitably brings democratization and liberalization. Nixon had no way of knowing that the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army was going to slaughter those people in 1989.
