He definitely lost a ton of money on the Twitter deal and it’s continuing to bleed his bank account. He is autistic and doesn’t think like other people do (which has advantages and disadvantages), but he’s one of the worlds richest people and who is going to tell him that he’s wrong? Sadly he’s clearly right wing and fairly far right at that. It seems that Twitter is going to become more and more like trumps truth social, a haven for right wing people, and I believe they will continue to lose subscribers as it continues to trend more right. I think the public perception is really important to him and the fact that he’s becoming more and more vilified is upsetting to him. Not only is Twitter going down the tubes, Tesla is losing money as a lot of people are realizing that there are other better made electric vehicles with better self driving capability despite a decade of promises from Musk as well as a giant head start (which he has all but lost today) in the all electric vehicle market.
Yes. You can deactivate your account, and after 30 days your entire account will be deleted. Or should be at any rate. God knows what he’s doing these days:
his rampant stock market manipulation and his relationship with ghislaine maxwell/jeff epstein are not exactly forgettable. Neither is his dad getting his own stepdaughter pregnant twice.
