Corruption and violence is so entrenched in the American legal system that a database wouldn't do anything at all, The police departments just wouldn't report the misconduct and even if they did the prosecutors offices still wouldn't charge cops anyway because their careers are dependent on them...Except maybe if the cops were black I guess.
Thanks for all that info. If he does have some leverage I would like to see him use it. Might as well start because it will be in courts for a while if he tries to require compliance.

Absolutely not. That was a diluted executive order and exactly what I have criticism about. Biden claimed he couldn't order state & local departments to follow his EO, which is partially true. But he could've compelled them through the leverage he held. Most state/local departments do receive federal grants, and they get access to discounted or even free equipment, gear and decommissioned vehicles from the military.
