Ah ok, so Al Qaeda fought against Russia back in the 80’s with the support of USA, so they were considered good guys right? Until they weren’t?
Because Erdogan's regime is not against all Kurds but basically Apoist Kurdish groups who share the similar tenets and worldview: Ocalan's vision is democratic confederalism, a loose federation state with his own interpretation of Marxist-Leninist views. He also emphasized Jineology, which is a feminist thought of empowering women to equalize them with men to improve conservative Kurdish society. So, Turkey is against all groups under Kurdistan Communities Union that follow Ocalan's political views, in short, Apoism. This union includes both PKK and YPG along with PJAK and PCDK. Otherwise, Turkey has good relations with Barzanis of Iraq and other conservative Kurdish groups in Turkey. In fact, conservative Kurds in Turkey support AKP as well because they don't like Apoist-leftist vision. This issue is different than Armenian genocide. Still, Apoism is a strong ideology among the Kurds, and millions of people support his ideals. Rojava is the first practical test of how Apoism works. So, his intention might be considered murderous or even genocidal at some point as well.
