First off, I would love to have a genuine good faith discussion about this. What makes you think I'm inventing them and what makes you think those fools are their best? Their best aren't outing themselves as members of these crazy right wing militias, and they certainly aren't getting caught planning half-witted attempts at kidnapping governors. What makes you think these guys are all addicted to food? You can find plenty of the guys I'm talking about on youtube who are not in jail for insurrection, and have the weapons and the training to actually pull something terrible off. Look up warrior poet society or garand thumb on youtube. The warrior poet society guy is closer to those failed michigan militia people, but especially guys like garand thumb are potentially dangerous not only because they are skilled and well armed, but because they're doing a pretty good job of appearing apolitical. There are hundreds more like them, and those are just the well known ones who have youtube channels with millions of followers. If even 1% of their followers are as fit, skilled, and armed as they are, that could be a serious problem. If I'm wrong (but I'm not), then no harm done, but if you're wrong, that could be a grievous oversight that could cost lives, so why keep promoting the idea they're all fat and incapable, even if you suspect it might be true?
