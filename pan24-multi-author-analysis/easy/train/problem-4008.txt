Yeah I do one hundred percent agree that India's obligation is too its people first and while other countries can fulfill that obligation to their people while sanctioning Russia, India likely cannot. No issue with India still trading with Russia. It's not like India is supplying Russia with arms like Iran or anything. Actively supporting Russia and using the situation to your advantage to capitalize on Russia's hardships by buying cheap resources are two different things.
Right? As far as I’ve seen Ukraine has a trove of pretty talented programmers and engineers. Perhaps better post war relations with Ukraine will help in that endeavor. India doesn’t hold the monopoly on talent. You’d think with the absolutely abysmal in-field performance of these “just as good as NATO” weapons systems would make countries rethink getting in bed with Russia. If I was going to partner with a side I’d certainly pick the side that has more to offer. The west might hold stricter requirements for hanging out in its sphere, but it’s totally worth it.
