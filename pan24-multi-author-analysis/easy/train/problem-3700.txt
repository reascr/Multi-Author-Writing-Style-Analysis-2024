An accidental lab leak is possible but also very unlikely. First, the virus has all the markers of a wild virus that was circulating around when it suddenly made the jump to humans. Second, lab leaks are not easy to cover up even in an authoritarian state like China. They've had a few lab leaks before, and even in the case where the spread is contained relatively quickly, somebody always talks. It's extremely unlikely that an event of this magnitude has had no one "spilling the beans". We've seen lots of whistleblowers about the cover-up for local government incompetence, but none supporting the lab leak hypothesis so far.
It doesn't help that proponents of the lab leak hypothesis have ruined their reputation by lying extensively, thereby polluting the well when it comes to claims about a lab leak.
Seriously? How much money has been wasted over the last two decades? We are $32 trillion in debtâ€¦oh and interest rates have gone up so servicing that debt cost has gone up too. Also the NW of all of these elected officials that inside trade and make deals for themselves has also gone way up.
