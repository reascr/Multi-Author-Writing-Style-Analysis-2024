The independent state legislature theory presents an interesting problem though. Constitutionally, the congress alone has the power to reject slates of questionable electors (in which case the state legislature would vote.) This ISL scheme is simply intended to eliminate this congressional over site and as such, would be unconstitutional. However, the current SCOTUS isn't really bound by the Constitution or precedent and they might still rule in favor. If they do,there is nothing to be enforced by the executive. However, the Congress could still address it directly, ignoring this ISL claptrap by making it illegal. Constitutionally, the states can prescribe how they handle elections, however "the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations" (Article 1, Section 4).
This isn't some dude. This is a former president who may have been (extremely likely) compromised by Russia, and attempted to take over the country by force.
