It’s significantly worse at the city/state level in most states than the federal level. Oftentimes, local authorities will push the feds to try someone for a federal offense because they don’t have the resources to pursue it at their level. This is why so many people are charged just with gun possession crimes rather than the more significant crime they were conducting or accused of when arrested. They were probably caught well after the crime was committed and CCTV footage, witness accounts, etc. can all be disputed to a large extent, meaning long trials, especially in areas where witnesses are unlikely to cooperate out of distrust of the authorities or fear of the prosecuted.
The general public really has no clue the amount of crime that is not prosecuted in this country because prosecutors don’t want to risk taking a challenging case that could affect their personal trial record and/or result in the use of significant resources from their budget.
Boo! I bet if some hapless lower-income dude pulled that shit, republicans would be all over him. It’s appalling that this privileged twat can get away with it.
