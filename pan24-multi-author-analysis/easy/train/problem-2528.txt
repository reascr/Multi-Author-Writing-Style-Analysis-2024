In 2019, CAHOOTS in Eugene and Springfield, used unarmed medics and crisis workers to respond to 911 calls relating to individuals experiencing psychological crises, responding to 24,000 calls, about 20% of total 911 dispatches. It is a benefit to both law enforcement and our communities to have law enforcement more educated and programs like CAHOOTS that will alleviate the pressure from law enforcement to respond to multiple crises.
It can't just be one thing, though. Not just education, not just accountability, not just experience - but all of those things. Policing has to be restructured from the bottom up, to include Social workers and psych response teams, EMS, traffic safety, domestic abuse specialists, theft and drug specialists, comprehensive communication across agencies. And we don't have to make it up, there are countries with effective policing that doesn't routinely kill and maim citizens. They do need to see themselves as Peace officers and protectors of citizens, not as the enforcers.
