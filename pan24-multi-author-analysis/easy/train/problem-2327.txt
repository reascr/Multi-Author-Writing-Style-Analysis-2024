Guys as an indian let me tell you that we view usa very positively and India usa relations are going to get stronger in the future no matter what judgement we pass here on reddit because we both have a common adversary that is china. But it is not going to be a smooth sail because of the history between the two. Usa sided with Pakistan during 1965 war and stopped wheat shipments to India almost creating a famine, then again sided with Pakistan and decided to attack us in 1971 war of Bangladesh liberation (we were saved by ussr) then again 1999 kargil war usa didn't give us gps coordinates of Pakistan army infiltrators despite pakistan being the aggressor in all three wars. Also cia was hellbent in stopping India from carrying out nuclear test despite knowing full well that pakistan was working on their nuclear program. Then there is issue of defence exports , usa doesn't transfer technology to India and i mean why would they, they spent money in r&d to develop these weapons but we cannot keep on spending billions of dollars every year on imports that is where Russia comes in, they transfer tech which by our standards is still a jackpot deal. Also the abrupt abandonment of Kurds and Afghanistan doesn't instill a lot of confidence in the minds of policy makers. Then there's the weaponisation of human rights issue, whenever we take a stance against usa out comes a statement the next day that "we are concerned about the human rights issues in india" which can hamper our tourism industry.
Really? You're going there? We're on the verge of nuclear apocalypse and you're calling me racist because I like chicken tikka masala? You might be a little too sensitive, just thinking aloud bud.
The Indian government repeatedly appealed to the international community for assistance, but failed to elicit any response.
