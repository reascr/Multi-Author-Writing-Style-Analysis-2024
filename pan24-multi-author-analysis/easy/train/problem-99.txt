In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Great. 9-year olds can threaten each other and adults if they have a fit over any dumb thing.. That will surely make for a better society.
Well regulated=property functioning as in "well regulated clock" not necessarily legally controlled.
I don't cling to the idea. I am basing my opinion on how it has been interpreted to this point. My post was mostly calling out the inaccuracy of saying that kids guns rights aren't protected. You and I both agree that 6 year olds shouldn't have Glocks but this law is going to be a test of that. We can't just say something is against the law when it's not because we don't like how it makes us feel.
