I 1000000% agree that we should be better at public transit, but the idea that societies that couldn't come together for "wear this piece of cloth on your face to avoid getting everyone you know sick" are going to give up their cars and take buses has some viability problems.
That's it. The tech existed before Elon bought the company but the market was miniscule. Elon knew how to generate buzz and threw everything into that, and managed to make Tesla both the only real EV game in town while also making cars that were cool enough that people who weren't already looking to buy an EV would check them out.
Tesla under Elon did exactly two things right, they made EVs cool enough for both kids and the upper middle class to want one, and then they made them available enough for the upper middle class to buy one. First model was a cool sports car that celebrities bought, it out performance first so the practicality and price didn't matter and became a halo car. Next were models aimed at the upwardly mobile who has been drooling over the Model S.
