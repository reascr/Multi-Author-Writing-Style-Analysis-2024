Final step would be to partake in Rituals. Like for example making your own Shrine or Alter dedicated to whatever God or Goddess you choose, you'd have to look those up. I'm personally not super crazy into this step. Mostly because as much as I love the Old Gods and their Religions, I'm not going to worship them as if my life depends on it.
I'm not super religious either, besides old Pagan beliefs. But some of the most impressive buildings on Earth are old Churches, Mosques, and other huge Temples.
Hagia Sophia, The Rome Pantheon, The Athens Acropolis, Borobudur Temple, Masjid al-Haram Mosque, Notre Dame Cathedral, Seville Cathedral, Saint Peters Basilica and the whole of Vatican City.
Notable mention are the dozens of really awesome looking medieval Gothic architecture Cathedrals, Churches, Ministers in Germany and France built during the Holy Roman Empire.
Good. They'll build it exactly the same as it was. I was horrified at the proposals to 'glass and steel-ify' the Notre Dame. I have similar views on most iconic buildings damaged that way. Rebuild it just the same as it was. Use modern techniques if you have to - this I don't care about. But it has to look the same.
