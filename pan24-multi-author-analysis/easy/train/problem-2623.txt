When they call Baltic States "Nazis and aaargh, we're gonna nuke em all to death" It's not because they mean it, but because they genuinely feel it'd be too hard a fight. And they fear Poland so bad they don't even mention them too often...so we can send whatever we want to Ukraine. Scholz is under some weird contract it seems, and I sure af hope there's not some secret phonecalls that will get declassified in a while after his death.
Thats disappointing. It more and more looks like West is just interested in both countries bleeding out while showcasing own military products to potential buyers. Meanwhile the ukrainians die.
Logistics. The only ones in Europe that have m1s are the poles that have 7 training ones expecting the first batch of actual ones in 2024.
That's irrelevant. Germany has a bunch of retired 2A4s (which is what it would actually send if it decided to), which it has already replaced, and Germany could also give the go-ahead to other countries to send their L2s. None of this requires Germany to send what it doesn't have. Some of it doesn't require Germany to send anything at all.
