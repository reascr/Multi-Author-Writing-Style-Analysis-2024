It amazes me that some people still do not understand that this makes authoritarian regimes shit. To admit they made a mistake is to threaten their own power, so they forever triple down on their mistakes. In countries with vibrant democracies, new governments come to power all the time lambasting decisions of the last government (and quietly embracing the actions of the previous government that actually worked). There is almost never any course correction for Russia or China or Iran, to change course is to admit the leadership is fallible which suggests maybe there is a problem with there being a forever leader. No, the emperor's actions are always right, and must never be changed, and the emperor themselves must of course never be changed. And only people that agree the emperor is always right and never should be changed should work in the government. It's madness and poison by design and destroys the productivity of the people.

Wagner will have to hold it at all costs. Absolutely no way they would withdraw from their only gained territory due to attrition.
