Ignoring that the article says this isn't even gonna happen (which we knew anyway), I assume they would have kept Son regardless given that Jesu Christ was an actual human male.

Jesus refers to God as 'the Father' multiple times in the Gospels. They were likely originally written in Greek and/or Aramaic. Though the Catholic Church does indeed teach that God is neither man or woman, cause he doesn't have a body. Fair enough. They still refer to him in masculine terms just to continue the 2000+ years tradition I guess.
