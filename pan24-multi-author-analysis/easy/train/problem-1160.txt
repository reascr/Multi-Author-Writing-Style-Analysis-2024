However, those who have been tuned to this channel for a few decades have no illusions. Should nuclear war break out, some of Russias warheads will get home. They are well versed in both crucial components of rocketry and warheads. They possess sufficient volume to saturate the field. They have tested and deployed new weapons this year. Do they have some duds, I'm sure of it. Will that matter? No.
You know there’s a part of me that suggests Ukraine has the equal right to waste missiles on Russian civilian infrastructure but at the same time there’s mountains of evidence to suggest failed WW2 tactics of terrorizing people into submission aged about as poorly as you’d have expected. Those missiles are invaluable assets that Russia is not going to replace very easily atleast if not total losses, Ukraine uses its ordinance however on meaningful targets and these bombings of civilian targets just show how Russia is absolutely desperate for -anything- to feed its audience at home to show they’re not stalemated with Ukraine or outright failing to live up to their military prestige.
No one does. At this point the US and Ukraine, the two most important players other than Russia have already said under the current circumstances any talks are pointless and they wouldn't entertain it.
