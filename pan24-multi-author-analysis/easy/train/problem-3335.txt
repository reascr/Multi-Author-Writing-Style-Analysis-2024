In the early stages of the Ukraine invasion of 2022 (e.g. not 2014) there was a very clear attempt for the South military force group to link up with Transnistria, to supply their forces with ammunition and totally isolate Odesa. The Ukrainians were putting up more of a fight than they had anticipated, clearly (a bit of a theme by that point…), and had held them up at Mykolaiv - so they tried to bypass it to gain access to a route to take them into Moldova and Transnistria. Fortunately, they were repelled before they got there, primarily I think by destruction of their logistics so the armour couldn’t proceed. This quite likely saved Odesa.
I'd say it is more like deeply seeded Soviet propaganda that somehow has lingered and Russia is able to make use of it, but yeah it's incredibly weird, with the way things are going it really makes me wonder what the hell we'll see happening with it as an increasingly isolated region that is clearly sympathetic and dependent on a collapsing power.
Oh. I am an American. I just follow British and world events enough to know. I think I first learned this about ten years ago when I saw a headline "Belgium hasn't had a government in two years," that was entirely unintelligible to me with only the US sense of what "government" means.
