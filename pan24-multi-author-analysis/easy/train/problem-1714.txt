“Hey, look at all this cool art deposited between 1939 and 1945. We’ll give it back, but only if you have a hard copy of a receipt. They burned everything? Oh well.”.

Probably. We literally decided the scrap 30 old Leopards last year. Now suddenly they are not that scrappy anymore and we plan to sell them to Denmark and other Nordic countries.. Its a fking joke.
Yes, actually. My country was highly outspoken against Russia after the Crimean invasion, which is all I’m asking Brazil to do. It has also been very outspoken about atrocities committed by China in Tibet and against Muslims in Xinjiang. My country’s president just told China last year it would go to war with it to defend its sovereignty, as well.
