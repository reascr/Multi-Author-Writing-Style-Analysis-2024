I don’t buy the Russian propaganda. If Putin really believes that NATO are a threat, why is he deliberately provoking us, invading our allies and shattering the fragile post-COVID global economy? Interfering with our politics, campaigns of disinformation. He’s inviting a war, not defending his country. NATO exists because Russia are paranoid fuckups itching to destabilize the West to play to their own domestic audience of nationalists. I’m pretty sure that if Russia grew the fuck up then NATO would eventually disband because everyone else in Europe tired of these games a long time ago. Sure, the US are no angels, but there’s a big difference between cold but often pragmatic geopolitics and the actions of a madman hell bent on triggering WW3 because he sees no other way to hold onto power. I’d much rather have Russia go back to being a minor player and have us focus our energy on the real threat of China, but we have no choice.

Media desperate to normalize Christo-fascism and suppress Republican treason. Defy them - and rise up. Unite in defense of democracy - the United States needs all good people on deck.
