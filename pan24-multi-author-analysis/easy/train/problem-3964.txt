i was going to ask if you were referring to support protests outside of indy or bloom, but then i remembered there was an open nazi at the farmer’s market in crunchy ass bloominon, and nobody was brave enough to shut his shit down. it is a weird state.
Since just before my time in NM, we, the voters made childcare free for all making up to 400% the national poverty rate; we made school lunches free for all; marijuana is completely legal to where we can grow six seedlings and six saplings for 12 plants total, and we just passed a major transfer from the oil/natural gas slush fund to our teachers to revitalize our schools. Albuquerque has taken on the nickname, 'Tamalewood' because of the investments from the film industry not to mention other industries are moving in. Weirdly, the part of NM I moved into is becoming their dairy capital (though I'll admit, their cheese has a long ass way to go, and it'd help if the airforce stopped contaminating our cows) and I'd argue there's more diversity and natural beauty here than in Wisconsin.
