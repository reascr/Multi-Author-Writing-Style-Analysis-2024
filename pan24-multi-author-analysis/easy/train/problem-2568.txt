This has been true for decades, and has been extensively studied. COVID highlighted a lot of these deficiencies, but there hasn't been much in the way of mitigation.
Outrageous! Most of us went right out of our way to put a mask on a few times and not cough directly on the old and infirm, and a 'sizeable majority' of us got scared enough to get the jab at least once despite our 'very real' crippling fears of needles, hospitals, autism and nanobots. Many of our politicians started healthcare companies to 'help' by branding PPE suppliers as 'price gougers' so they could steal their customers and make bank supplying very cheap PPE from the outbreak location at a 'normally inflated' price. Some of these companies even supplied some PPE to hospitals before the public money ran out. We even helped the first carriers recover by storing them in care homes, and even added 'very efficient' separation between the olds and the highly contagious after we used statistics to discover how virulent and dangerous it was. We also compensated regular rich folks salaries and so so many shell companies before the money ran out for the poors. I mean as a super sensible species that totally cares about eachother what didn't we do to help?
