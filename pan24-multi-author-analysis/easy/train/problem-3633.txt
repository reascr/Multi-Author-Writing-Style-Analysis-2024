The abortion argument has always bothered me. The issue is there are multiple issues being discussed at the same time and it causes problems. Primarily abortion is a medical issue dealing with pregnancy and should be dealt with in a medical context. Doctors have their own ethics and licensing boards they go through so we aren't giving them free reign to murder children. Legally we should just consider the mother alone during the pregnancy, pregnancy is so complicated and messy that any other arrangement puts people in legal jeopardy for medical conditions. Morally, it depends on the situation and the parties involved and ultimately is a personal judgement, doctors will work with their patients to find the best outcomes for everyone involved. Now, having open abortions isn't everyone's favorite idea, but to reduce the total number of abortions just have comprehensive sex ed. If people understand how to have safe sex, you have less un-planed pregnancies and less abortions. Plus these are the abortions that people feel icky about, if you give them the headline grabber stories or even the more personal stories about how your sister in law lost her first pregnancy, people tend to agree that those abortions are fine, even when the are well past the cut-off dates people arbitrarily throw up.
Of course not. Republicans used abortion as a single issue to rile up their far right Christian voting base. They never had any actual opinion on abortion other than they could use it to get their base to the polls. Now that they don't have fear of abortions to rile up their base, they have moved to other single issue fears like LGBTQ, immigrants, and their ol' reliable 2A.
