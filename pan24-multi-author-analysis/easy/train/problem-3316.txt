See, your problem is you treat everything as absolutes and bogeymen. For one, banning lobbying at the conference doesn't solve the problem of lobbying. It just happens outside the conference, beforehand. It solves exactly nothing. Two, it's not their only role, protecting profits. Legitimate concerns and obstacles are also parsed in there, they do exist, it's not just bubble gum and rainbows and free money for fossil fuel companies. No matter how many fake quotes you imagine, it's not changing actual reality. Nobody says insane shit like you suggest, you desperately need that strawman that bad? Pointing out an issue like lobbying is great, your solution sucks. Banning them doesn't change the facts, it spits in the face of them. Pointing out how poorly reasoned your argument is doesn't make me a simp for big oil, but it sure does show me how dependent you are on needing that polarization to be a part of it at all. Is your entire philosophy on this good guy vs bad guys? Seriously? You need an enemy to make a point? Its not the same as your analogy, either. Nobody dies if they don't take opioids. All of civilization could collapse without fossil fuels, though. Is it a shitty spot? You bet. Is your rhetoric at all useful or helpful? Hell no.
There are plenty of independent experts who can talk about energy supply chain impacts, corporate accountability and regulatory expectations without having the perpetrators of climate crime flood the conversation with deliberate noise.
