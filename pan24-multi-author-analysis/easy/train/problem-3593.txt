Yeah, we have one higher quality company at my venue that does a pretty traditional nutcracker with a full orchestra that flies in a couple of people every year to play the leads. The other company does a bastardized version of the show with one and half casts that do all the parts. With main goal being to squeeze as many kids as possible onto the stage. And they just dance to a track.
Frankly this sorta matches with my expectations—for whatever reason, despite the US’s strong firearm industry, US-made AKs are generally below par in comparison to foreign imports, and KUSA has a substellar reputation amongst AK enthusiasts due to QC/reliability issues.
For crying out loud. Tchaikovsky died even before Russia became a Soviet republic, let alone the Russia now waging war on Ukraine. For all we know this Tkachenko's grand-grandparents might be responsible for Holodomor, or Stalin repressions, or Red Terror, or something. What now, cancel Tkachenko as well?
Culturally speaking, though, modern American culture still has heavily German influences. Almost every Christmas tradition we have, and a bunch of the foods we have (from hot dogs to pretzels to apple pie), derive in part from German immigrants. They didn't just preserve the culture, they actively spread it to the rest of America.
