I won't need to do anything. I already moved out of the DC area, so their cock up is theirs as far as I'm concerned. Either they fully prosecute the traitors, or they've just shown the whole world that you can just show up on their door step, threaten the power base and murder them. Essentially, if they don't want the job someone will show up and take it from them. Like, I stopped the first attempt and there's a very specific reason that things went off like they did, and that I was able to affect things to the extent that I was. It was a Goddamn miracle and they're not going to get another chance. So basically if they intend to stay in power, they need to either punish Trump and company with extreme prejudice, or make the US population happy enough so that we're docile again. Both parties oppose the docile option while only one opposes extreme Trump punishment.
Exactly. These thugs would have certainly gotten off scot free with rushed indictments. By waiting, over 400 plea deals have been made. Plus subpoenaed phone records. They started from the bottom and are working their way up. That's the only way you get useful plea deals and such.
