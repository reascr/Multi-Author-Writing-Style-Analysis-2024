Someone once told me that no billionaire exists that hasn’t exploited a lot of people along the way. I could feasibly see someone becoming a multi or deca millionaire and treating people right, but billions? I wouldn’t even know what would benefit my life with a billion dollars. Millions, sure. Financial security for my family and me, maybe a decent boat and a 4 bedroom beach house. But billions is crazy and it’s almost made up numbers anymore as not all of it is liquid.
I'm sure she's just an extraordinarilly gifted entrepreneur who by an AMAZING COINCIDENCE of all the many millions of angolans just happens to be the daughter of the dictator of that oil rich country (which "strangelly" remain crushingly poor) and purely on her massive personal merit she, out of millions of angolans, just so happenned to be made the CEO of the angolan state oil company and the billions that were dissapeared from it during her tenure were the handywork of evil forces trying to make this extremelly competent and gifted person look bad.
