All in all good summary of the events that took place, although I see much of the things different to you. I think there are a couple points someone could make which explain a little better the reasoning behind the actions of the UdSSR. First off it’s important to know that at this time the Soviet Union was still mostly agrarian while many other countries already went trough industrialization. Also after clearly loosing WW1, having to pay humongous Reparations and going through a revolution and years long civil war, the infrastructure and production of the UdSSR was devastated. In 1928 the UdSSR implanted it’s first five year plan which aimed to rapidly industrialize the production. The reasoning was that the UdSSR feared another world war or aggression against itself from other countries. Don’t forget that Japan, America, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Italy and a couple other nations intervened in the civil war on the side of the whites. And within devastatingly loosing the first one world war, still being in agrarian mode of production versus industrialized nations and having half the world against them they assumed to be pretty fucked. To put it in Stalin’s words:“We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this distance in ten years. Either we do it, or we shall be crushed.“.
General classification within academic discourse and official government-recognition are entirely different things.
