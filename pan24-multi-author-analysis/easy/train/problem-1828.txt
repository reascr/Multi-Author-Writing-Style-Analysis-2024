"Anyone wishing to hold on to their weapon and join the ranks of France’s 5 million legal gun owners can do so if they seek to obtain a legal permit.".
It requires a psychological evaluation and applicants with any criminal record are automatically refused. Sounds like the gun has to fit your reason for the permit also. I think if it were easy there would be a lot more permits.
Museum? Take it to the shooting range. I have two Lugers in my safe, one my grandpa took from a naval officer he captured. Uncle Sam said it’s his in 1945, now its mine. Eighty years later they are going after them? Seems silly.
Families with these heirloom firearms that haven't been maintained aren't buying century old ammunition, hell you could just get a license and then have an actual effective weapon on hand, rather than rely on something that hasn't been maintained at all for up to a 100 years, so would likely jam and get you killed in the process if you ever work up the courage to shoot it at an armed military invader.
It’s not hard at all. I have several military rifles from the 19th century. All are perfectly operational with functional modern manufactured ammunition, for less than $2 per round for most calibers.
The caliber is still one of the most ubiquitous sniper bullets ever made, and modern cartridges have made them more accurate than ever before.
