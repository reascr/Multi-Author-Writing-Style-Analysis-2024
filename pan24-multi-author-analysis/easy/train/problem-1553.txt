According to what I have been able to learn about this dinner one thing stands out to me, definitely trump didn't know Ye would bring Fuentes. Trump is definitely playing dumb about not knowing who he was, but regardless the timing of this is actually so perfect in context to everything falling apart for trump that I'm left wondering if Ye - in some twisted way of logic- purposely brought this 24 year old nazi sympathizer with him on purpose because he knew the blow back would be instant and mostly directed at trump.
This is crazy, a little too crazy. I'm thinking this is either a very cynical and clever ploy by establishment republicans to weaponize stupidity and strike while the iron's hot / Trump is weak and get rid of him. Or, Kanye and Trump, both desperate for press since the past few months have been nothing but their bullshit backfiring, individually thought they could gin up some intrigue by meeting with the other, and Fuentes just kind of tagged along Kanye's entourage.
Exactly. That stuck out. It sounded just like when kids inadvertently admit something by preemptively denying it. Like the time I greeted my nephew and he said he definitely didnâ€™t eat the cookies that were in the pantry in response.
