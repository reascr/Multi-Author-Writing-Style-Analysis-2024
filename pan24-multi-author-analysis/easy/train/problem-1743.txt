Doesn't matter. They shelling civillians almost for 10 months, marauder, torture civillians, rape them, including kids and elders, and meanwhile doing genocide to ukrainians. Even if there is somehow one soldier who never shot anyone and was just sitting in trench for 10 months in a row, he is also responsible for this war and war crimes. When you dealing with terrorists and nazis, and i just want to remind you that russians are both, you are not really bothering yourself trying to find "good guy" amongst them. If "good guy" joined terrorists and nazis, and i also want to remind you that russians can refuse to going to war, being in prison is much better than die, then this "good guy" is not so good and actually terrorist and nazi himself.
Exactly. It's not like the average conscript from some far-flung hinterland understands the core principles of infosec. I mean, I work in an office in the USA and Janet in Accounting doesn't understand the core principles of infosec and she has a masters degree. How is a barely literate conscripted peasant soldier supposed to know this shit?
