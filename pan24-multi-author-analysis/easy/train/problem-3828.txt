They'll certainly try. But there's nothing like an unambiguous bad guy to bring people together. I'd bet my entire life savings that the Russian state collapses before the US and EU stop supplying Ukraine. Even if the general public loses focus, it is a great military investment. <2% of the annual military budget to counter one of our most irritating geopolitical adversaries. Even with the rise of right wing populism in Western countries, I don't see support faltering.
As far as Trump and other right wing politicians across the West, I doubt that most would eliminate support if they gain power. If for no other reason than the fact that the American military industrial complex is a massive Republican donor and is salivating at the prospect of a new war to fund. It would certainly be far worse for Trump to be in power as I'm sure he'd find some way to fuck it up, but I'd doubt even he would stop shipping arms to Ukraine. I'd agree that he probably wouldn't have supported Ukraine in the first place, but now that we are I don't think he'd stop it. Plus the electorate has rejected Trump and his cohort for the last three elections. It is not likely he'd win.
