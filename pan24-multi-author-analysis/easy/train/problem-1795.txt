You might want to keep in mind the History of the United States. We had to fight a Civil War to get rid of slavery, but the reason for going to war was never about getting rid of slavery. It was to preserve the union it was so the United States would not become irrelevant on the world stage. The Northern states although there were abolitionists there weren't that many it wasn't the primary reason the Northern States went to war. Hell, in fact a few of the states on the Northern side were slave states so Lincoln would have lost those states if he went to war initially trying to abolish slavery . The reasons for the Emancipation Proclamation and the timing of such was much more practical than just outlawing slavery. It was so the North could free slaves that were captured. It was so slaves would turn against the South and help the North win the Civil War. Even after all that Jim Crow laws existed in this country for almost a century. It wasn't until the 1960s and those marches that we had Civil Rights Act.
This is absolutely horrendous. But can we also show this level of interest in the 11,12 and 13 year old boys that are shooting each other in atlanta everyday.
