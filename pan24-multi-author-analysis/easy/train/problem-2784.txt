The way I look at it is that there might be something there, but the right wingers have spread so much shit out there that the fact he's not involved in the government in any way contrasted with the previous presidents children....I just don't fucking care enough to wade through the bullshit. And if we're just going to let Trump and his kids off it really doesn't matter either, he could be the literal devil incarnate we've already established honesty, ethics, accountability, etc., none of it matters anymore. If we're going to hold people accountable then hold everyone accountable. If we're not, there's no point in me wasting my time caring about Hunter Biden.
Absolutely. Teenagers are often surprised when they are hit with sex trafficking charges when they send sex pictures to their boyfriend/girlfriend. If people are spreading sex pictures of him around then they are trafficking as well and should be charged. I wonder how many of the politicians in Congress could go onto sex offender lists from this if they push for charges.
