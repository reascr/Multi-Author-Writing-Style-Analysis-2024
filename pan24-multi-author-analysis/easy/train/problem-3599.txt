Look we just need to make a few intelligent people live forever so that they can teach us through history. We'll build them big comfortable mansions and cater to their every need so that they can stay focused on learning about current times and pass on the knowledge. How could that possible become a nightmare?
The rebooting came in the form of a gene therapy involving three genes that instruct cells to reprogram themselves—in the case of the mice, the instructions guided the cells to restart the epigenetic changes that defined their identity as, for example, kidney and skin cells, two cell types that are prone to the effects of aging. These genes came from the suite of so-called Yamanaka stem cells factors—a set of four genes that Nobel scientist Shinya Yamanaka in 2006 discovered can turn back the clock on adult cells to their embryonic, stem cell state so they can start their development, or differentiation process, all over again.
I disagree. Fighting against aging is also in a way fighting against all those aging related diseases you mentioned above. If we can reverse aging then we will also be able to reduce the aging related diseases cause many of those are also related to the same processes which damage our cells/ tissues and cause aging.
>That could mean that a host of diseases—including chronic conditions such as heart disease and even neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s—could be treated in large part by reversing the aging process that leads to them.
