This is part of my confusion with all the outraged conservatives. If they wanted Whelan out, why didn’t they make an uproar during trump’s presidency when it was early on. Seemed it just kinda slipped everyone’s mind, along with everything shady about him, and it only came up because Biden did a swap for a black female lesbian basketball player, which is almost everything the standard conservative could dislike about anyone brought home in a swap.
Exactly. We have two family members saying how Whelan got screwed and it was Biden’s job to fix it. Then we asked: “and how would you deal with Putin.” They then replied: “he’s insane I don’t know.”.

Civil asset forfeiture without conviction is reprehensible. But it pales in comparison to the authority police apparently have to take the lives of unarmed citizens with impunity. If they don't give a shit about killing you, they're hardly going to give a shit about seizing the $10,000 in cash you were carrying cross country to cover your rent deposit.
