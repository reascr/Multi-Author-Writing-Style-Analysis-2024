That depends on what you mean by "good faith". As much as I disagree with the repealing of Roe v. Wade which I VEHEMENTLY disagree with as it was a braindead room temperature iq decision. The decision did have merit in the majority opinion as it relates to the arguments of the past Supreme court legislating from the Bench in their original Roe decision. Maybe Clarence Thomas isnt acting in "good faith" in his rulings to protect his wife, but that has to be proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that he wouldnt be ruling the same with or without his wifes issues which I doubt.
I dont disagree, even if Thomas was a perfect arbiter when dealing with things concerning juris prudence it would still be in poor taste for him to cover these precedings. I guess one of my points was if Thomas wasnt married to his current spouse would he rule any differently? I guess that question is kind of a non starter either way.
