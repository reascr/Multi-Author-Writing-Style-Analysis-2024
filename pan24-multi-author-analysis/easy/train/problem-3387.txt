I dunno I can only speak about Guatemalan because that's where I live but besides starting a civil war and then supporting the genocidal government troops up till the mid 90's the United States has more recently threatened us when we tried to legalize marijuana to defund the gangs (gangs that in many cases were started by people who were part of the US funded army).
Now you are shifting the goal posts. The post is about Egypt calling the European Parliament arrogant for transgressing against Egyptian sovereignty. My comment was explicitly about that.
But what's even more interesting, you keep digging holes for yourself, you've stated that "so you can make people suffer without accountability" that's a great point, but the West always got away without being held accountable, from the collation that destroyed Iraq to what is relatively recent NATO's military intervention Libya, and that's just two random encounters, so yeah, talk about accountability, the West should set an example and hold itself accountable for its violations before calling out others, that's crucial if there's any actual will to actively promote human rights, but at this point, this is just virtue signaling and posturing.
