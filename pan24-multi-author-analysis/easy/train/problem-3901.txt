There are also organizations like the Waffen SS or ISIS, who deliberately encourage atrocities and give naturally murderous individuals an outlet to express their cruel impulses.
As a Russian myself (F) I would like to inform you. My close friend was enlisted. He had few options: suicide, blow up the enlisting agency with himself or enlist and have a wage x3 he had prior. If he “committed treason” his family would get nothing at best, or get fired and be an enemy to the state if he commuted treason at worst. If he died or get wounded in a combat his family would get a nice payment of 2m rubles (according to law, but not guaranteed with this government), which is a significant amount that would grand the family means to live. So. If he fought what he did not believe in his family could survive, if he objected, his family would suffer with him, meaning no job, no health insurance, no housing. Please, take into an account the reach the government has to make even unwilling people to fight for the war they do not believe in. I do not, in any way, say that people who committed suicide, to avoid enlisting are selfish. They are heroes. Just there are people who cannot afford this in the name of justice.
