Important distinction: verified oldest. There are people who may have lived longer but we have no birth record of. "Oldest person in history" is an unverifiable title because we have no idea if some random Mayan farmer or Sumarían merchant lived longer.

How? If someone's dead they're dead. I really don't get this idea that we need to use flowery terms for someone no longer alive. I mean if someone's dead, I don't think they're gonna be too concerned about how someone phrases it. What are they gonna do, rise up out of their coffin and go "Hang on, before you finish the funeral some journalist used a term I didn't like and I won't stand for it"?
