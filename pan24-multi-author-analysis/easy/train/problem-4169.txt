Let me explain. The VP, like other senior government officials, hardly ever have documents and materials in their possession. They have staff for that. Staff brings them things to read, edit, or sign and then staff takes it away to file, update, process, or send to another party. Staff are the ones who box up offices and put records in storage. Staff are also the ones who sort through materials to go into those boxes. Unless Biden specifically told his staff to box up classified material it’s not his fault. And even if he did direct them, his staff failed by following that direction. It’s also the staff’s job to protect their boss from themselves. There will be a number of folks in the GOP who are going to be very upset when the Special Counsel announces that and the Biden is not culpable for any wrongdoing.
Reality is. Trump stole the documents. Made efforts to hide them and I’m sure I’d they searched his other properties they’d find more. With Biden one document was found in a book. I think at worst it’s carelessness and just no real process for transitions. They literally work till transition day. I’m sure Trump didn’t make it easier either.
