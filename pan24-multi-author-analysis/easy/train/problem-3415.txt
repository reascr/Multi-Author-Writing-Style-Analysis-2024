Most of Canada's oil and gas goes to one market, the United States. It will take years for Canada to be able to export more than a couple percentage points of the quantity required for Europe.

Do you see where this goes? Sure, US sucks in some areas, so does NK, but Russia is the current leader for causing shit.

How many of them keep poisoning their political enemies within foreign states? How many of them have told how the rest of Africa is their enemy that needs to be destroyed? How many of them have actively tried to starve other continents to gain some international leverage?
