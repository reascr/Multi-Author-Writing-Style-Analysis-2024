The saddest thing is that their voters don't even realize that they are being played in the exact same way they were played by "Clinton's emails" in 2016. Sure, no one ever found any actual dirt in Clinton's emails, but that didn't matter. Most of the base just assumed they did, or that they would find that damning batch of emails any day now. That's what Hunter's laptop is. Republicans already believe Hunter Biden is sketchy, so they are happy to assume any laptop he once owned most contain mountains of evidence proving his corruption. The details aren't important, just like they weren't important in 2016. As long as the base can keep being upset about a "coverup" - of what, exactly, is unclear, but, again, it doesn't matter - and keep themselves convinced that the email where Joe Biden happily accepts bribes that is signed by multiple notary publics will finally see the light of the day if they just keep on digging, that's all that matters. Hunter's laptop hasn't caught on in the mainstream the way Clinton's emails did, probably because there hasn't been 25+ years of propaganda dedicated to convincing people that Hunter Biden is corrupt and evil, but the base still eats it up. And since Republicans don't really have anything else to go after Biden with, we all know they're going to just keep running with this absurd bullshit for as long as they remain in power.
Whitewater investigation ^ 2. They’ll dig here until they find that they took $25 over the limit for some sort of gift and then say how evil Democrats are. Usual bull shut from them.
Exactly. Someone could start spouting that Tiffany Trump is a drug lord and there’s evidence in a laptop. Okay…and?
Republicans hate America. It’s obvious so let’s call them on it everyday with every bs circus they perform for the corporate media propaganda machine.
