Iâ€™d suggest you go read up on what the US Military did in Korea and Indochina, places where the US went out of their way to inflict harm upon civilians and were particularly cruel about it. Historians consider the indiscriminate napalm bombing of Korean civilians a genocide, something which does not include the executions of the multiple hundred thousands of suspected South Korean communists who were purged by the US-backed South Korean dictatorship and the US Military leading up to the Korean civil war and during it. The indiscriminate B-52 bombing raids in Indochina and the use of Agent Orange were especially nasty as well.
Unfortunately scum exists. However, it's not that these people are calling for war now, but just trying to explain it's possible without having WWIII, and using that to justify coming to Taiwan's defense militarily if they were attacked by China.
Good boy. Now go do your regular day job and let the soldiers there handle the rest. No need to be holier-than-thou about this unless you're on the front lines.
