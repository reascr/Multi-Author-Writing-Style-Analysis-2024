The only Gay Republicans I’ve ever met are either completely oblivious to politics and they are parroting what their family peddles; or they are rich jerks who feel they need to perpetuate brutalist capitalism to keep their higher than average socioeconomic status.
Racism is a part of that, imo. There were some older gay men in Brevard county, FL that I knew who were republicans. They also made racist comments. My husband even had to quit a hairstylist over the racist comments he made while cutting his hair. I guess the stylist thought my husband was white so he’d agree? I don’t know. But my husband pushed back and stopped going to his business (the stylist owned the place). I’ve known a trans woman for decades (my moms best friend) who is a huge Trump supporter and been a republican long before Trump. She likes to drop the n-word.
