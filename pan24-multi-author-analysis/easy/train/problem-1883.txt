In fact everyone McCarthy picked was suspected of direct involvement in the January 6th plan to replace Electoral Certificates from 6 States and replace Pence as the one accepting them. The main target were the wooden boxes holding the certificates from the States which is why the heroes of the day were the interns that insisted on going back and getting the boxes over the rather suspiciously vehement objections of some of the Capitol Police/Secret Service who were clearing the chambers. I'm glad to hear that the investigations will continue until the very last day necessary and everything is being referred to the DOJ and some specifically to the FBI.

Yeah that was a pretty weak flex â€¦ simultaneously bragging about letting all his top staff testify to the J/6 Committee, while also saying the Committee has no right to any testimony because Pelosi (the other person next in line to the presidency that the terrorists were trying to murder) was forced to pick all of the committee members because McCarthy was so stupid, he tried to assign witnesses (and probably criminals) to the roster.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
