The Turkish government has been trying to smear YPG/SDF for years. Turkey already attacks Kurdish institutions in Iraqi Kurdistan, they don't want Syrian Kurdistan to have independent institutions too. So desperate is Turkey in this regard that they've empowered ISIS to act as a weapon against YPG. Turkey is more comfortable with religious extremism than secular Kurdish nationalism.
Cry me a river. Incompetent american leadership should ve not ally itself with the rebranded PKK. They ll get stomped and all you can do is moan about it.
Heâ€™s the definition of an Islamist turning a secular and western oriented country into an authoritarian Islamic state.
No they didn't. More lies. Even the worst accusations against YPG are relatively limited expulsions of families with ties to ISIS members.
Guess that says it ALL!.............................................................................................................................................................nah.
They are a secular, moderate, leftist force that has defended countless civilians against ISIS and other threats. Unfortunately, one of those threats is the Turkish government, which has been fighting against Kurdish self-determination in Turkey, Iraq, and Syria for decades.
French, American, and many other sources linked Turkey to Islamic State fighters, including using them in battle in Syria, Armenia, and Libya.
