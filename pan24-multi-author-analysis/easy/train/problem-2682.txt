Yeah, people don't understand just how large Disney's property in Florida is. Just the core Reedy Creek area is around 40 square miles - literally the size of a large city - including four major parks, a couple water parks, golf courses, a shopping center, numerous hotels, and the entire town of Celebration. Among other things.
DW's annual visitor count is roughly four times PR's entire population (and also around four times PR's current number of annual visitors), and 33% higher than the number of passengers PR's airport currently handles (meaning they would either have to build a new airport the size of MCO, or more than double the existing airport's size). All in an area that is only a US territory, not even a state, and doesn't have the income or Congressional power to offset those costs via government spending. The cost to Disney would be vastly more than any negative effects from being in Florida for decades.
Exactly. They don't have a large amount of land in any one state, not like they'd need to build a major theme park complex.
