"What can you learn about a military from its band? Usually, not much. But putting on great performance requires some of the same skills as conducting a military operation. It requires recruiting the right people with the right talents (and many militaries, including the American military, use bands as a recruiting tool). It requires equipping those people with the right technology—often highly specialized—so they can do their job. It requires training those people to work together to perform complicated tasks with impeccable timing. It requires developing young leaders, managing logistics, and maintaining high morale. The sergeant I spoke to observed that what came through in the Ukrainians’ performance is that they wanted to be there, they wanted to be great, and their leaders were inspirational.".
The M4 upgrades were things like a better suspension (“Easy 8”, -E8) better engine, up-gunning (Firefly 17-pounder), wet ammunition stowage, or extra armor (Jumbo) as needed, but the base model was already superior to the Panzer III / Panzer IV and there were so few Panthers and Tigers (and they were so unreliable) it was almost a non-issue on the African, Italian, and Western fronts (ballpark 30,000 M4 Shermans versus 600 Tigers and King Tigers and 1500 Panthers.).
Logistics where important but the big problem was that they where so over engineered and broke down so much that for the logistics required to keep them running was far more than Allied tanks and took logistics away from other military units, something that could have been solved by just having more tanks of a lower quality.
