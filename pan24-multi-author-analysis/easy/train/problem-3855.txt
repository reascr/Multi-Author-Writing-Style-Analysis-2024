Imagine being one of the incarcerated 1/6 rioters. Clinging to hope Trump miraculously swings back into the presidency to pardon you. Only, it never comes and you serve your time. How sweet is that? r/MadeMeSmile.
reality: he won't, he didn't pardon any of them last time, it's all talk, and these GQPers keep living in this fantasy world where they think trump is gonna swoop in and save the day, and time after time, he's shown that he'd rather throw them under the bus to save his own skin, and it keeps just not clicking with these people that trump has absolutely zero interest in actually helping them with anything.
Competing deals on the right. If Trump sits down and shuts up and throws his support behind whatever crappy DC swamp creature the right chooses, then he gets a pardon on day 1. If Trump wins then he pardons all of his idiot base that commits crimes in his name.
