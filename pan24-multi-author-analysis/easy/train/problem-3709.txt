Actually. Where I am, many police officers are not paid well. Though, there’s more of a problem in my state’s department of corrections and department of juvenile justice. Constantly hiring more prison guards. And the juvie near me actually had a riot back in October. Struggling to recruit and retain people.
Absolutely! I would love to leave my corporate job and go into teaching. I come from a family of teachers, am married to a teacher, and know exactly what the job entails and what it takes to be a good one.

Absolutely wrong. It will make education better for many reasons. When you are have the opportunity to sit in on classes, you see how some teachers teach. Some are actually engaged and want to explain things properly. Some teachers really don’t care. They will just mumble and won’t actually look for responses from students. Imagine if you had more teachers like the first, I firmly believe it will make a difference (even if it be very little. It will improve nevertheless.
