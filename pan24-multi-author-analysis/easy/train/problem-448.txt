Interesting. So DOJ didn't ask, a Judge did? Obviously, we know it wasn't going to be Cannon. So it either had to be the Magistrate Judge who signed off on the initial warrant, or maybe Special Master Dearie?
DOJ to Magistrate Judge: "Hi. We'd like a search warrant. Here's our affidavit confirming there are classified documents stored at these two locations.".
Right. And that gets him out of any (additional) provable legal jeopardy ... but it also destroys whatever "value" he felt that swiping these documents had - be it nostalgia value, barter value (make a deal with the gov. to get out of other charges), or just blatant sales/negotiating value - "hey Saudi Arabia, how about you approve me building a condo building and I just might accidentally leave some documents around at the job site one day...".
