One of the worst ever military stuffups was by the Austrians at the "battle" of Karansebes during their war with the Ottoman empire. The Austrians sent out their hussars to scout, they got drunk on schnappes, had an argument with the infantry that went to find them. Someone shot during the standoff, which caused the officers to yell stop!. Someone confused that for alah, causing the entire standoff to panic, thinking the Turks were upon them. The soldiers all retreated to camp, just as the artillary captain was having breakfast. Thinking this was a Turkish charge, he ordered the artillary to fire back. This woke up the rest of the camp, which began a panicked attack on the retreating army. During the chaos, the Austrian prince fell off his horae and needed to be rescued. He called a general retreat of his army in disgrace. As well, a chest of gold, to be used to pay for the soldiers' wages was stolen in the chaos. The Turks arrived 2 days later. The wikipedia article on the battle used to list the Austrian losses and lists the Turks as: "yet to arrive".
Hmmmmm. See there's something MUUUCH easier ruZZia.... if you REALLY want this war to end, pull ALL your troops out of Ukraine, including Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, as well as all sham referendum annexed lands, and of course Crimea. Just go home, that's ALL you need to do.
