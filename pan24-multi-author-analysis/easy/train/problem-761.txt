To me is seems like Supreme Court is testing their powers which seem to be limitless if they choose that they are limitless. And only limit on their power is that they have no enforcement power, but I am not aware of, in general, of executive branch not enforcing Supreme Court decisions. There instances like when police (executive branch) violating Supreme Court's decision that recording in public places is constitutional. But there is no mayor, governor, or president that directly directs LEO to arrest those that recording police in public.
Seriously. Our democracy is legitimately at risk. We've had an attempted coup. The other side of the political spectrum openly embraces violence, lying, and cheating to maintain control over systems that they shouldn't have access to. And we could solve a lot of these issues by tossing a small handful of douchebags into a woodchipper...But we don't.
Republican typically implies a constitutional republic. So I think a legislature operating in opposition to the constitution wouldn’t be “republican”.
