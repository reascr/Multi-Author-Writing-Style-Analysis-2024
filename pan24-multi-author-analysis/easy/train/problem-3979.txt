Also, I’m not against small studies, but if you click to look at the studies in the url you shared it goes to a German 404 error page. Also, I would imagine that the National Agency of Ukraine for Civil Service would probably have more reliable stats rather then a graduate student calling 1200 random Ukrainians from a UK based phone number. If I was an ethnic minority and someone called me to ask my status for “totally educational purposes” what is my incentive to not lie and say I’m part of the minority (why make myself a target?)?
Considering the massive population distribution that happened in the Soviet Union (bc Stalinist purges or the mere fact that SSR borders were relatively fluid being part of the same country), the happenstance of what border your family ended up in after 1991 shouldnt be politicized like this. The Baltic countries have been heavily anti-russifying. Russia can’t intervene because of NATO, and the European court can’t enforce anything (just look at the Polish judicial fiasco that the European court condemned). Who speaks for the Russians of Lithuania? No one.
