At this point, I believe putin is in his fuck everybody phase. He can get a new girlfriend, he can make new kids, he can find a new country, but he has to protect himself, in his eyes that is the one this that isn't expendable.
Really? So that's what we'd hear if we asked your soldiers that? That they would definitely rather die trying to kill people who didn't do anything to them than go home to their loving families and peaceful lives? This dude is really going to get his whole country and its people destroyed. I feel bad for any form of victim of Putin's agenda.
Soldiers aren’t average citizens. They don’t represent how majority of citizens think. And all soldiers do horrible things in war regardless of where they from. This is just the reality of war. The one that started the war and put them there is the one to blame.
Pure desperation. He's trying to keep his hide from being taken out by his own cabinet at this point. Matter of when, not if. I just hope when he's ousted that it's a more peaceful transition, which history dictates doesn't always happen in Russia.
