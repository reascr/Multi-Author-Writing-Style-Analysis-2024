I thankfully escaped from Ohio before it got this bad. The state has been losing population and Columbus is the only city that's growing, but that growth is coming from inside the state and unfortunately it's people like this from rural Ohio, so no surprise that we're seeing small town "values" surface visibly like this. The city is nowhere near turning red, but it is turning the city less blue and it's not like Columbus was a bastion of liberalism to begin with. The city was dipping its toes just barely left of center and now being inundated by country folk from crumbling Republican towns across Ohio because there are fewer and fewer jobs out there. Not a great thing in the long term.

OMG--did you see those losers? I wonder if they give themselves GI-drag names like "White Wolf" or "Strykkker"? Seems like they're just jealous that nobody wants to see them perform.
