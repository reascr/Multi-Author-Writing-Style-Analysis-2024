Hey I’m just saying it didn’t get to the way it is magically or overnight. Don’t you also elect your sheriff and aren’t LA cops nationally famous for their gangs? At the end of the day people have to take some responsibility for this shit because we keep voting for it. I’ll take responsibility for my shithole as long as you take responsibility for yours. If they think a property developer is a nice guy and can fix the homelessness crisis then more power to them I guess because it’s not like anyone else is actually doing anything about it. Don’t act all arrogant though like “LA will see though this bullshit” when it seems the majority of voters haven’t, in fact, seen though the bullshit because decades of government policy failures have contributed to everything wrong in this country.
He builds malls. He has no idea how to solve a problem as complex as homelessness in LA. We need someone who can take the real estate industry head on, not cater to their every need.
