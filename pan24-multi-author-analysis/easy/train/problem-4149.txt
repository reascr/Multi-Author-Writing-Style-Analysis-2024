It's a myth that China plays "the long game". The longest they have had a continuous government is 75 years (now). What happened over the last 40 years is they had advantageous demographics with 4 workers for every retired person. They brought farmers in from the rural areas as workers and that bought them another 15 years. They did everything quickly because they were in a race to expand and try to create a domestic consumer economy. They were unsuccessful.
You kidding right?,China is the bank of Russia,China is the reason why Europe is afraid and is the reason why usa will collapse,China is like the God in this international Game,the problem is everyone are dependent on them,and China is everyone's friend,except for Usa,their is only one enemy for Russia and China and it is usa,it isnâ€™t Germany or France,and the Arabs and Muslims and africans and everyone else are in love of this new Russia China friendship, it is because of usa stupid actions that now Russia is so powerful, they let Russia become the Gas station for China,and China the powerhouse of technology and innovation and military and mostly (finance for Russia).
By 2030 they will have more retired persons than workers. The leaders of China can read demographic tables as well as anyone else so they knew what was coming. China had a very advantageous demographic for decades. Everything went well for them and made them look like geniuses. Now those demographic has reversed and things are beginning to go wrong everywhere. They will not be successful in reversing the trend.
