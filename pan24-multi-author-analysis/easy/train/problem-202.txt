So, they're kind of saying their government and their police that keep the idea of peace law and order are more accepting of the idea that religious zealots and cultists are to be appeased than the idea that people can speak freely and do with their own reading material what they want unless they offend the crazy believers of religion in their society who will then riot and cause real harm to people and damage to another's property?
I didn't say we were. You're correct in that the average Finn isn't all that religious anymore. Rather, it's the institutions that remain, although there is indeed dwindling support for them. This law is just one such example.
Nonetheless, if burning any book one owns in public view or in a private group is made a criminal offense because it is feared someone else may perpetrate an actual violent crime in retaliation for merely being offended, then it gives the voilent criminal an easy self-justification and legal counter argument for committing an actual violent act against someone who merely did something they didn't like being done with someone's own book/property.
