Well there is housing shortage and investors know they can charge high rent and sale prices so they're building as much as possible right now. So what you are seeing is industry specific. Other economic sectors may be steady and many of them are down. So overall the economy is slow. Construction work is physically demanding sot that limits the pool of workers. And yeah I know some guys not in good shape but they have skills and experience that are in demand and can get someone younger to do the hard physical work often times. Once this building boom is over there'll be layoffs. Same old cycle. not as extreme as oil field work but all industries are subject to this.
POSSIBLE? How many of these companies shrink portions AND raise prices, purely to maximize profits. Most could care less about the struggles of the middle and lower class in this economy. We know costs have gone up… you don’t have to tell us; we see it every fucking day. God forbid you earn a little less profit than pre-pandemic. Most don’t love this country or their fellow citizens! They love one fucking thing… $.
