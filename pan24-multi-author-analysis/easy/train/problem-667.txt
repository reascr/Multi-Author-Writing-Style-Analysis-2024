This was the 1 thing that Senate Republicans got wrong in January 2021. They could have voted to convict Trump on the January 6 impeachment charges ... and remove him as a potential candidate forever. But they were cowards, they couldn't wrap their heads around what the short-term fallout would be and look at the bigger picture. But for Senator Rubio, every $20 that Trump fleeces from some little old lady in The Villages (huge retirement community near Orlando) is $20 that Rubio can't get. So now Marco gets less money, or he has to go to Mar-a-Lago and kiss the ring.
Fuck these conspiracy theorists. They're all just the gullible sheep of those with a political agenda.
Honestly? This is for the GOP to sort. In the end there may be some sort of reform around donations,.PACs and Super PACs but I doubt it. There will always be a means to skirt the laws. The trick is electing ethical leaders . The GOP of today has little interest in that pursuit. Winning by any means has become the battle cry and there is an abject, intentional, ignorance of the will and needs of the people they serve in much of politics today.
