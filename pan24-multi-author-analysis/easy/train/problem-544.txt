Except that in practice, the states are ruled by party politics, and organized by them. Any movement to change the constitution will be dictated by which party controls the votes for their states. If republican controlled, it will not be bipartisan, it will not be based on what's best for the state or nation. If democrat controlled, it won't ever happen because they will bend over backwards trying to be bipartisan. Everything they claim to want to do will depend on if Republicans will accept it. And they won't.
This is because the relationship created by the formation of a Federal government is between the states who relinquished some of their sovereignty and the Federal Government that assumed that sovereignty. It is not a relationship between the Federal government and individuals. Therefore it is states who choose the head of the Federal Government, the President, not individuals.
The electoral college scheme is the only election that counts, given by design it is the only Presidential election that takes place in our Federal Form of Government.
