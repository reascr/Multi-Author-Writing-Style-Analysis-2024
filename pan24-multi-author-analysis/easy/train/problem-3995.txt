I didn't think anything of it, but could you actually get elected as a Dem and then turn around 2 weeks later and say 'oh, I'm a Republican now?' it seems a little dishonest. How do you vote for a Dem, get them elected and then they turn around and flip their seat to the GOP? Can anyone ELI5?
If you think the Greens are spoilers just because they actually get some of the progressive votes then perhaps the Democrats should actually advocate and fight for what they get voted into do like making a Medicaid for All bill, like donâ€™t allow republicans to gut social security programs, putting a 15 dollar minimum wage bill into play, fight for abortion rights instead of using it as a way to get votes.
this is BS. there should be a law that forbids you from changing the party affiliation that got you elected until the next election cycle. she misrepresented herself to her constituents. She didn't just wake up on a Friday and say ' I feel cute, maybe I'll be an independent from now on' --- IMHO and to my eye, this was planned.
