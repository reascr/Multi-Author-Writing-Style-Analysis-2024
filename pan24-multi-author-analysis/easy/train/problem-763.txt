They can go suck a stick (read between the lines). Until now they had horrible Covid rules for all people entering there country and no one batted an eye cause their country their problem, but suddenly when it gets done back to them (and with very good reason considering the cluster Pluck that’s happening), now it’s an issue. No, we a world of independent countries that choose to live in a global world must make a decision to not let one country dictate how we choose to run our own countries. Even if we are wrong and burn our own countries to the ground the idea of sovereignty and self determination go above all. So let China bitch and complain, cause that all they will ever do, because at the end of the day they are alone, and the only reason people deal with them is out of convenience not brotherhood. So when push comes to shove they will find themselves more and more isolated from the world as more companies pull out and there economy and perceived control slips away from them.
Seriously? It was a popular theory that COVID accidentally made its way out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a lab that happens to study coronaviruses which is located in the ground zero town of Wuhan, where COVID started.
