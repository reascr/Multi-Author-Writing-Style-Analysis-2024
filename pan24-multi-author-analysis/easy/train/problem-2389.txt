The sad thing is I don't think Americans would ever vote for those trillions to be invested in America instead. It'd be politicized as socialism and therefore bad. As big government that needs to stay out of our schools. It'd be portrayed as wasteful spending. Deficit hawks will be popular again.
These are the people who get out and want to get out and as such, are going to be very culturally aligned with us, but that's not the case for so much of the peasantry that is stuck in pissed off old school religious conservatism, thats only gotten worse as the Gulf Arab states and Iran funded and pushed their respective backwards interpretations of Islam all over the world. It's led to bad miscalculations since 1979.
Muhammad was a tribal warlord who executed enemy soldiers, forced women and children of his defeated enemies into slavery, permitted slavery and sexual rights over slaves including a concubine slave gifted to him who gave birth to his child, and also started having sexual intercourse with his child bride when she was just 9 years old, amongst a lot of other horrible things. Muhammaed would absolutely be fine with this.
Indeed, that in part explain why all the social engineering effort during the American occupation failed: their leadership where so full of shit about the "superiority of western value system" that they just forgot to convince the population in any meaningful way. A population that, BTW, where living under a draconian system for centuries and centuries, and feel that this works for them and don't give a dime for "modernity".
