Actually, they wouldn’t. Al Aqsa Mosque is built on the “artificial” part of the Temple Mount. If a 3rd temple were to be built, the only thing that would have to be removed is the dome. Which i am all for and genuinely believe can be done at some point.
Exactly. I mean a lot of people on this thread are just kind of reflexively doing the "Israeli did it, so it must be bad" thing. I mean, come on. No matter what your feelings on the conflict, getting mad because a guy dared to walk near a mosque for 15 minutes is pretty ridiculous.
Exactly. Are you under the impression that the Temple's destruction means that the site of its ruins are somehow not holy to Jews anymore? Sorry my dude, your window of opportunity to convince Jews to "get over it, the ruins aren't that important" was before we spent centuries in diaspora venerating it as the holiest site in Judaism.
What do you mean? You know why he did it. It's kind of a reverse provocative statement. I don't know, but I think he's showing how ridiculous it all is.
