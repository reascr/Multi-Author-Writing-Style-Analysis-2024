Theoretically in that case you're supposed to keep track of how much the vehicle is being used for work and how much for personal use, and the percentage that is personal use is applied to employee compensation.
However, If the car or truck is simply provided to an employee as a personal vehicle for personal use, THAT is an employee benefit that has to be counted as compensation for tax purposes. You have to pay income taxes on the value of the car that was provided to you.
Wonderful explanations. Iâ€™m a younger dentist. Just got a new job. Went through all these funny discussions with people trying to commit tax crimes to lower what they were paying me.

Realistically, that never happens. The business owner has a "company car" paid for by the business, but only a small fraction of the use is actual business use and there's no documentation. But the business pays for 100% of it.
If the car stays in the office parking lot and just gets used for work miles, that's 100% a business expense. It's 100% kosher.
