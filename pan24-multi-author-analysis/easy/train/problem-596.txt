We are just north of Columbus and still have a good school system but they try to undo that every couple years. It’s all paid for through property taxes since they won’t let business move in. For every business that does make it in, ten get pushed away. Every election cycle there are people who run for the school board saying they will cut costs and get us tax money back. They then realize we are really good with what money we get from taxes and the near zero amount we get from the state. Last guy who tried ended up quitting. Blamed the other members for an unsafe environment when he was the one always causing issues and ended up costing the district a bunch of money. Good ole tea party asshats.

That’s weird. TX costs more in taxes than many other states. FL has astronomical home insurance costs if you can get it. Not sure people did the math on that one.
