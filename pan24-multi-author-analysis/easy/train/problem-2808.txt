this not mentioning that Brazil has the damaged PT/PDT which took a serious beating back during the impeachment of Dilma, which caused a general right ward shift in Brazilian Politics, the fact that Lula is building a broader coalition including former opponents who didn't lunge head first into Junta-Nostalgia or cowardice and of course the almost unique phenomenon of where nominally center right parties align with the executive branch in exchange for either favors or relevance that they can then campaign on. this may cause instability long term since the centr√£o system did lead to the effective coup that was the Impeachment of Rousseff represented. I will add, Bolsanaro campaigned on "with us or against us" rhetoric where you either were with Partio Liberal (and hand picked candidates where they faltered) or you were dirty filthy degenerate communist who hates god, Brazil and your own mother. when you contrast this to the broad coalition approach that Lula took it shows why he did so well. he tried making a multiparty system into a two party one, and his supporters followed along. expect a lot more "states rights" talk in Portuguese.
Hopefully? Labour are 20 points in the lead, and it isn't shifting. Some Tories are leaving their MP jobs now, to find work before they get kicked out.
