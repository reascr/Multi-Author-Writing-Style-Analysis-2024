My favorite Zelensky quote: "I need ammunition. Not a ride." This was when they offered to evacuate him out of the country at the start of the war. I will always remember that. Zelensky will go down as a legend.
I’ve heard opinions in the polisci department (outsider academics bullshitting without any knowledge on the ground) that from a totally cold not talking about humanity political perspective, if Ukraine ultimately wins it might be a catalyst for very positive things that we’re impossible before long term in that 1) it is a extremely unifying experience that should reduce or eliminate many ethnic and cultural tensions and create a firmly unique Ukrainian national identity across the board which is tied to 2) firmly eliminate Russian influence from the country and all the nonsense that goes with that, 3) allow Zelensky much more free reign to stamp out the previous corruption issues should he choose to (and from what I’ve seen I’m inclined to think he would) and 4) vastly accelerate being integrated to the western world both economically and militarily which will hopefully allow Ukraine to rebuild a powerful modern economy kinda like what Germany has pulled off maybe.
I agree 100%. I even heard that quote and knowing he was a former TV guy thought he's playing it up for the media. I thought Russia would have had a plan long inplace and it would be like the US going into Bagdad. Or they'd have loyalist in the country already to overthrow critical things. How wrong I was and very impressed. It's not about the size of the dog in the fight, it's about the size of the fight in the dog.
Unfortunately well-earned, Volodymyr Zelensky! You have your fellow Ukrainians to thank because of the way they implemented your leadership to fight for the good of humanity.
