The next time you see a politician talking shit or engaging in what you believe is self destructive rhetoric that will kill their careerâ€”they are aiming for a gig like this (and/or a book tour, also lucrative and no work involved). It pays so much better than their regular job, and there will almost ALWAYS be a gig like this waiting for anyone with national attention. Liz Cheney tanking her career? No fucking way, a book is DEFINITELY going to come soon, she's also due since she had books in 2011 and 2015. And it will sell like hotcakes in airports to bored liberals looking for catharsis. MTG talking the worst possible shit? Conservative media is saving a seat for her. Kyrsten Sinema fucking over the people who elected? Doesn't care, better paying gigs are coming now that she is a nationally known figure.
Disappointment? Are we talking about the same idiot who is famous because America broadly mistrusts educated, intellectually sophisticated and challenging people?
2. To go national means high chances of gigs like this, which pay a lot better than whatever you government position pays (and there is a lot less work involved!).
