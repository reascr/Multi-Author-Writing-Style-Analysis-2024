look, I've never heard of Nick Fuentes, never even seen him before this, and Ye called me and he said, "Sir, I'd love to have Dinner with you, Sir, and I want my friends to meet the Most Incredible President we've ever had," and I said that sounds ok, and they came, and we didn't talk much, and we were in a very beautiful place, Mar-A-Lago, incredibly expensive, very exclusive, and you know you would never get that if Obama was still destroying us, we had a Terrible Economy, No Military, No Jobs, almost 100% Unemployment, then I come in, and away we go, I had the Best Jobs, Best Numbers, Incredible Economy, we did a lot, and our Military was in Tip Top Shape until Sleepy Joe. you look at it now, we're running out of Army Tanks, they have no Soldiers, we're almost a Shadow, and it only took the Democrats less than 2 years to break our Country, our Beautiful Country. they don't even do The Pledge anymore. under Trump we said it every day, and don't forget I brought back Merry Christmas. it was dead, nobody was saying it, but then I brought it back. just the other day I had some very Big and Strong Men, Strong, Very Good Looking, even better than Tom Cruise if you can believe it, he likes me a lot by the way, and he's said a lot of nice things about me so I can't complain, but they came up, tears in their eyes, "Mr. President, Sir, thank you for saving Christmas and for saving The Bible, and most of all God and Jesus," and I said it's not a problem, not a problem. sometimes I'm just too nice.
