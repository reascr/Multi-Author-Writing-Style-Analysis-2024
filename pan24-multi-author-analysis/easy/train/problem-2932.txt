And yes, nobody denies the legal right of Russian soldiers to kill Ukrainians, if they're actually defending themselves. Including the people who agree that the Russian invasion is completely illegal, but understand international law. In fact, including the Ukrainians themselves. They aren't arguing that every single Russian soldier that defended himself from a Ukrainian attack is a war criminal.
The issue is with Russian soldiers claiming to be only defending themselves, when they clearly weren't. That simply isn't the case here.
The U.N. representative in this story is basically saying, "it's unfair that Israel vastly outguns, is overwhelmingly better militarily trained, has near infinitely more money and resources than Palestine- and I believe because of these things Israeli soldiers should not defend themselves against rogue attacks, and that Israel should not build missile defense systems- their citizens should just accept the bombs with open arms. Because it's not fair! [insert crying baby noises].".
