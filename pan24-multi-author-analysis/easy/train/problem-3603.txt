I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible delights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.
yes other nations will, but currently the us is funding efforts in Ukraine and the ability to do r&d, as well as test in actual battlefield conditions is a goldmine for us experts who not only look to devise a solution, but can test and see what works and what doesn't, it real time against russia on battlefield, with feedback directly from our allies in battle.
