Never took to Cannabis. It does not give me a high. Just bad vibes. I, as an individual, cannot do any thing. But, if lots of us speak as one, thing do happen. Look at what is happening in China now over their lock down. And, if we individuals stay quiet, than we passively condone it. We become a Lemming.I have walked way from jobs because of my position. Been fired from a few also. Been attacked by lower managers, who later thanked me for doing what they dared not. But, no one ever questioned my integrity, or my word. I have over 77 years on me.
