Make no mistake, the Russian government might have suppressed Ukrainian for centuries and modern Russia is a rogue state. At the same time, you can’t ignore that the Russian language has already been part of Ukraine for centuries just like English is part of Ireland and two wrongs don’t make a right. A wrongful action is not a morally appropriate way to correct or cancel a previous wrongful action. Fundamental ethics.
I live in Kyiv my whole life and I speak russian. First of all, this doesn’t change much, as when I went to school (graduated in 2010) all the education was in Ukrainian and the only russian I had was an optional lesson once a week w/o marks for those who wanted. Next thing is, it should have been done 30 years ago as studying russian is absolutely redundant . You don’t need to study it to speak, read books or watch movies. But not knowing Ukrainian here creates a lot of problems. For example, you need good mark on a mandatory Ukrainian language test to get free higher education.
Interesting. Just met an ESL teacher who has a few Ukrainian kids in his class. Said half of them speak Ukrainian, half Russian, but they all pretty much understand each other. Doesn't always seem to be the case, but it also doesn't seem like that huge of a jump for most.
