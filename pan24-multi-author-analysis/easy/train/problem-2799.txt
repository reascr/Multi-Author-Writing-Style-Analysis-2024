The African counties should pay reparations not only to the descendants of the slaves but also the white people that fought for their freedom. The slave trade was run why black kings who would capture their enemies and sell them to white people. Africa has a lot to apologize for to its people (not to mention the shameful history of Liberia, where freed black slaves who returned from America started … capturing and selling slaves as their main income. People are so rotten).
I don’t see how that’s nonsensical when the article you posted itself speculates about who would even be eligible and the city did not specify how they would accurately determine ancestral to ensure only black Americans descended from slaves kept in the United States would receive monetary reparations.
But so what? How is it close to fair to take money from someone who did no wrong and give it to someone who suffered no personal harm. The person living today has no personal experience of slavery. By that logic, everyone should get reparations (from whom I can’t imagine) because someone in their genetic past.
