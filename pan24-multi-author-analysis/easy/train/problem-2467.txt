"You jail the petty thief who stole from the bank, but you worship the banksters who steal on a grand scale. I suppose it's like the difference between murder and warfare -- kill an individual and you're a monster, but systematically kill thousands and you're a heroic genius. A saner society would punish the latter, not reward it.".
Bank regulations are followed rather strictly, and most importantly, have actual well defined penalties and regulators investigating to make sure things are done properly. The only reason you occasionally hear of bank scandals is because the financial system is regulating itself and finding those scandals. Crypto doesn’t have any of those checks and procedures, so all year you’ve just watched these massive scams and frauds one day just disappear in a puff of smoke (3AC, Luna, Stablecoins, FTX, every NFT project, etc), because it turns out the whole thing was basically just smoke and mirrors all the way down.
What a load of bs. Both him and Caroline Ellison were pretty far left and believed in altruism and philanthropy.
