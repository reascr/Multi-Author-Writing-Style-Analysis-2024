In early-1941 Stalin authorized the State Defense Plan 1941 (DP-41), which along with the Mobilization Plan 1941 (MP-41), called for the deployment of 186 divisions, as the first strategic echelon, in the four military districts\[k\] of the western Soviet Union that faced the Axis territories; and the deployment of another 51 divisions along the Dvina and Dnieper Rivers as the second strategic echelon under Stavka control, which in the case of a German invasion was tasked to spearhead a Soviet counteroffensive along with the remaining forces of the first echelon.\[138\] But on 22 June 1941 the first echelon contained 171 divisions,\[147\] numbering 2.6–2.9 million;\[2\]\[148\]\[149\] and the second strategic echelon contained 57 divisions that were still mobilizing, most of which were still understrenh.\[150\] The second echelon was undetected by German intelligence until days after the invasion commenced, in most cases only when German ground forces encountered them.\[150\].
