Then they stopped letting people speak and began showing how THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WORKS in Maricopa County. Dispelled every conceivable conspiracy theory people were claiming happened. The problem is, the vast majority of that public just up and left. They got their 2 minutes to rant and fucked right off. A few stayed but tried to heckle every chance they got. Not that anyone was going to change their mind on the matter, but the board did everything short of doing a personalized tour like Jurassic Park showing how the ballots are designed and made, to when and where it’s received and then how there are security systems in place, from the 90s, to deal with fraud or how to verify if your ballot got counted or not.
They are the same party. And do you mean “RINOs”? “Non maga republicans” didnt exist between 2016 and 2020… confusing. Are you saying “non maga republicans” are against lying about voter fraud? Because if so they sure are quiet….
Not even, the election laws in Arizona we're made by Republicans, the maricopa county board is compromised mainly of Republicans arguing against Republicans that the laws Republicans made were followed by the Republicans they elected.
