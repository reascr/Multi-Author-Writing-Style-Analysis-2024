Shrinkflation is absolutely the most infuriating part of it all. A whole store full of asshole design packaging, miniatures and then you don’t even get the satisfaction of tasting what you bought because the ingredients are trash now too. All the while gaslighting us in thinking we’re all too dumb to notice. F all of these bastards.
of course some business will try to take advantage of this situation if they don't have the same risk for whatever reason as their competitors are forced to raise their price... but those will be in minority most of the time as to get the effect to leverage on you need to have a systemic situation, otherwise the only conclusion is that we have a pan industry worldwide collusion as all profit of industry raised in 2022.
Lol. So when the money supply increases by 100% in a year, profits are supposed to remain the same? It's irrelevant to call increasing prices to combat inflation "greed". Your anger should be directed at the pandemic, and the man who gave out free money for the last 2 years.
