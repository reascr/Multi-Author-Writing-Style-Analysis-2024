But you are still right in a broader sense. This is far from over (if the battle for rights and democracy even does have an end). The right is eager to enact violence and destroy democracy. Law enforcement is filled with officers sympathetic to their cause, even at the federal level. And fascist theocratic extremists have captured the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, it’s not clear that the federal leadership of the Democratic Party sufficiently understand the threat.
Exactly. World War 3 is being fought right now. It’s not a war between nations with bombs, planes, and tanks. It’s largely an ideological war between liberal democracy and far right autocracy. It’s being fought- with the exception of Ukraine- on the internet, on the streets, and through relatively small acts of violence. We’re all in the middle of a worldwide game of chess where the pieces are being slowly and chaotically moved around the board. Elon buying Twitter is a piece moved for the right, Lola winning his election in Brazil a move for the left, Ukraine holding Russia back, the attempted kidnapping of Michigan’s governor, revolution in Iran, January 6th, protests against China’s Covid policy, the club Q shooting in Colorado. Each of these events and many others, while individually still having drastic ramifications, together tell a larger story about the situation humanity is in right now: an ideological and systematic tipping point.
