As far as i can tell the change in ownership hasn't really obviously skewed the politics of their reporting. Probably that's partly due to the fact that there's already an established culture in the KTVU newsroom, and partly i imagine that, if for no other reason, the management understands its audience and the demographics of the Bay Area and know it would be a losing proposition to go all Tucker Carleson on the station's ass. But they have brought the stations aesthetic (things like colors, logos, etc.) in line with the greater FOX brand, and i have no idea what kind of more subtle news direction choices are being decided behind closed doors (i.e. maybe they're not shoving super conservative slants down peoples' throats, but maybe they're choosing not to cover smaller local stories about progressive victories or whatever either), so that's something to be cognizant of and watch out for over the next little while.
Exactly. My father claims that all of his local news stations agree with what he hears on FOX News. I'm wondering whether any of his local stations are Sinclair and thus parrot the same stuff FOX does.
