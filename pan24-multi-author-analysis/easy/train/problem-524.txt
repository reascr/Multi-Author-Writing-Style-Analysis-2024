Aadhar is the final solution for complete autocracy. Every action of a person linked to one database, controlled by the government. Its far from a good thing, its as dystopian as any government scheme could be. The only thing holding it from already being exploited everywhere are flimsy indian supreme court orders that disallow it from being mandated for anything except income tax returns (pan card), but the government is already finding their way around it by implementing it as a soft rule hardened slowly over time. For instance, in few states its now mandated to provide aadhar for electricity, failing which your power will be disconnected. For air travel, they have brought in a face as a boarding pass (AI/biometric scan) system which works only on aadhar. This app (developed by a third party private company with no privacy policy in a country that doesnt even have data laws) scans a persons face at the airport and matches it to the aadhar. So even though supreme court has barred it being mandated for any service outside tax, the gov is finding ways to make the supreme court ruling meaningless.
Average modi-fanboy. There are basically 4 counters yall have for every argument and your single comment ticked 3 of them.
