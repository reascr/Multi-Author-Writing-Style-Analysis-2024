look, I don't know Joe Merlino ok, I barely know him, and they say there's a Picture, but maybe someone should tell the Fake News that I'm very rich and very famous, I take a lot of pictures with a lot of people believe me, they're always coming up to me, "Mr. President, Sir, thank you for saving America, can we please please get a picture?" I said not a problem, and even the Big Strong Men, very strong and tall and better looking than Brad Pitt, they come up, tears in their eyes, "thank you Sir for saving our Factories and our Military, we'd be nothing without you Sir," and I said that's probably true. I came in, Obama left us with nothing, we had no Military, no Army Tanks, we were even out of Ammo I hate to say, but on Day One I already had our Military at 100% Ready. you don't get that with the Democrats, they only want to tax you to death and make everybody act like Sleepy Joe is King of America. it's a disgrace, a complete and total disgrace what they're doing to the Presidency. we've never suffered more. ok, have a nice time, you're welcome.
