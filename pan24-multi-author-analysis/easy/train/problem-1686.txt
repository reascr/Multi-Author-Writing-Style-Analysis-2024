â€œThere was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.
Serious question. I thought Wagner recruited experienced former military personnel with an average recruitment age of 38. This guy is only 26. How high up the food chain do think he really was?
Controversial guy (understatement). His books about life in a German penal battalion mostly set on the Eastern Front were pretty much shown to be frauds - not actually his own personal experience but a composite based on things he heard from people he talked to.
