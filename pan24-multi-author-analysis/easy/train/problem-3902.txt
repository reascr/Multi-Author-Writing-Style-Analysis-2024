Theres much bigger things to worry about. This women should be warning about the oncoming Great Reset and helping him be safe when the entire market and internet collapse. Literally Mad Max in the streets. Christians are funny sometimes cuz they cant see whats before their eyes as well Anyways love everyone but donâ€™t talk bad to them. Just let em know the AntiChrist is coming sooner than we all thought. IM SO READY! WHOS READY??
What I don't understand is why conservative Christians focus on homosexuality with so much more intensity compared to others sins in the Bible. Could you imagine if someone refused to serve an overweight person at a restaurant because gluttony is a sin and they don't want to support their lifestyle? I don't think anyone should actually do that by the way, many different aspects go into a person's weight. Focusing on homosexuality just seems so hypocritical.
I'm from Tulsa. ORU is literally a mess. It cranked out Joel Osteen and Kenneth Copeland, and the amount of shady characters that pass through there is astounding. So many scandals attached to ORU also.
