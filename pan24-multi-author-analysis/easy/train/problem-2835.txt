I agree the Senate is important in balancing large vs small, but that's exactly why the house should function as designed, and provide equal representation Per Capita.
If they had wanted this lopsided they would have made it this lopsided, they chose to give small states an advantage, and they would still retain power in the Senate that would balance out the larger states.
Also, check my flair, from a small state...I'm not saying we should disenfranchise small states, just saying voters in each state should have something close to the same electoral power...
As it stands folks in smaller states have way more say in presidential elections than the founders intended. It would just be ensuring equal representation in the house, the Senate would still be tilted toward small states, and small states would still retain more political power per person through the electoral college, even if that edge is lessened.
Yeah, expanding the house of representatives, and getting ranked choice voting in place in every state is the best we can hope for without constitutional amendments.
No chance in hell that will happen, we could increase the house to around 2000 representatives... technically it would only take a federal law to do that, and it would wipe out the small state advantage and be good for politics in general...
