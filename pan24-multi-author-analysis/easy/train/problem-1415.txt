During basic I was given three or four shots and I didn’t have a clue then or now what they were. I didn’t question nor did anyone else getting shots. But now all of a sudden it’s a problem with this one shot. So strange.
The fact that senior officials at the defense department (who are presidential appointees) official position is inline with the administrations is to be expected. The secretary of defense is a political appointee who represents the president's interest in the admin The fact that you can find officers who agree with the policy is unsurprising in an organization of a few million people. I know many officers think its good and many think it's bad having talked to people in the military. The fact that there is no hard data on the subject is neither evidence for or against the policy. It simply an admission that there's no way a democratic congress or democratic president would commission a public major investigation into whether or not their own policy was reducing military readiness thats like shooting an own goal and not how Washinon works.
