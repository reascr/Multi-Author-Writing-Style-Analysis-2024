These are people I've known upwards for ten years. They aren't naming names or anything, they're just saying that they are tired. I have one friend who works at a CCTV local affiliate as a journalist who told me last night after how hard the past two years have been that "it's just as a journalist, I am frustrated because I can do nothing, be it to calm down my fellow Chinese or even say anything... absurdity." He always sticks out to me because he is fairly critical of the CCP but despite saying these things to me online and in real life in his work he makes nothing but hit pieces against the States and articles praising the party.
Not necessarily. Depends on how loved you are by the populace. A loved dictator could easily sell a policy reversal as a human simply making an honest mistake. They can't use this excuse repeatedly obviously, but if they're popular they can definitely use it as a one-off excuse. Caesar is case in point - he openly hinted at kingship which led to public backlash but they forgave him once he just dropped it.
