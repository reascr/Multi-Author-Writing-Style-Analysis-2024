In 2019 it was estimated that the breakeven price for Urals crude was around $49 a barrel. This is below the $60 cap agreed by the Western powers. So Russia can in theory continue to pump oil and make a profit. The problems arise when Russia tries stupid games like insisting on payment being made in rubles or won't sell at prices within the cap price. They have to keep pumping oil or the infrastructure will back up and literally freeze solid. Then they're faced with the facts that their Western partners who built that infrastructure will have nothing more to do with them and that they don't have access to the skills or equipment to get things moving again. So sad, never mind.
but this has the consequence of making imports more expensive and reducing business confidence, reducing the purchasing power of Russia on the international market.
Fair enough. I havenâ€™t ebooked much since finishing college but for stuff like that the best option is usually a paid app. There are some fantastic apps for productivity designed for iPads specifically, but its not free open source stuff.
