I heard them talking about this on the radio and thought 'what kind of asshole, when he hears monkey, doesn't picture a literal monkey?'.
Who usually proceed via motivated reasoning and a general mindset riddled with biases because otherwise they couldn't justify their dogshit views. These aren't people who go from evidence to conclusions, they're people who start with conclusions and then cherry-pick whatever evidence they need. You can spend your whole life trying to stomp down every little pretext they find in completely meaningless things to feel validated or get pissed or whatever, and all you'll be doing is wasting energy because to them finding a new thing is as simple as connecting random dots with a drawing that doesn't fit them and pat themselves on the back for being very smart and not thinking like the masses or the corporate media. It is, essentially, a pointless effort. They'll just go find something else to be racist about and nothing will change in the overall amount of racism.
