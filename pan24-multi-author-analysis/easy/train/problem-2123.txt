Woah, woah. Back up here. Just sort of getting caught up on this dude. So this isn't even his real identity? How does that work in terms of elections? What happens when somebody with a fake identity gets elected to an office? Has that even ever happened before?
The innocent unpolished but earnest musical stylings of a young man in the tumultuous 60's vs the ultra-perfected monster hit pop material from some of the most self absorbed, womanizing and arrogant musicians in history (not all of them). Im torn. I love me some Creedence but gd the Eagles greates hits album is damn near perfect. It just has one hit song after another and then there's Desperado. Must be soCal thing!
Perfectly reasonable. He’s a fraud. He’s a criminal. He deserves to be harassed everywhere he goes for the rest of his life. He could have said, in effect, ‘you caught me, I lied” and resigned . He didn’t and that makes scorn and ridicule fair game. If he does it down the road.?Too late. I’m not condoning anything physical, just words.
