But, by and large, a lot will depend on how suicidal Russia continues to be. The longer they drag this out, the harder it will be for them to recover. They will lose. Russia cannot compete against the military industrial capacity of NATO and aligned countries. After they lose militarily, they will lose economically as well. Although things may vary depending on what happens internal to Russia (coup, death/replacement of Putin, disintegration, etc.), significant foreign investment may not return to Russia for decades. Not only will they have failed in their goal to secure the natural resources in Ukraine, they will continue to have almost nothing the rest of the world wants to buy other than petro but will soon have far, far fewer buyers and a petro powerhouse in Ukraine. As others have remarked, they likely will not recover from this during this century. And that's before we consider reparations.
Libertarian here. Every war we we have been involved in for the past 60 years has been a waste of money. So why should democrats now flip and be on the republican side and not care how our money is now spent on another war?
