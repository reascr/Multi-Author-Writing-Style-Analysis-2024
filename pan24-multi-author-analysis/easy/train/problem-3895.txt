To actually occupy anything would take months. The heavy bombers and naval fighters would be bombing targets within 24 hours, but the US is a careful creature when it comes to invasions. They'd spend months moving men and machines into Ukraine while the air campaign keeps going while having so much AA and artillery in the area that Russia can't do anything but watch and then, once all the supplies are in place and the moment is right, the Air Force and Navy would launch a massive blitz on what's left of Russia's radar and command while the ground forces start blaring Flight of the Valkyries as they hit the gas and start charging across the border, sweeping aside whatever resistance remains.
For what? Nukes? This stupid war has proven Russia’s military is awful. The nuke threat is all they’ve got and it’s guaranteed mutual obliteration. Russia needs to cut its losses.
It's possible that the US military has infiltrated the Chinese nuclear apparatus to such a degree that we have the location of every Chinese nuke, but not particularly likely, given that the PRC has devoted so much effort to keeping that particular information secret.
