We are not closing farms to 'comply with EU rules'. This is just framing. We are cloaing farms because the biodiversity in our nature reserves is getting destroyed by NOx.
Insane, dellusional. In a year where food security is threatened around the globe, where we've had the single biggest increase in hunger deaths in the last 3 decades, these guys are more worried about the common european turtle-dove.
Nice explanation unfortunately complete horseshit. If you don’t know about a situation don’t act like you do. The netherlands has a huge amount of ‘extra’ food that is exported since the government decided that we needed to be less reliant and therefore boosted food production. So no there wont be any production pushed out of the country and ?transport costs? also won’t increase and in fact emissions will heavily go down, as is the entire intention of closing the farms. Don’t talk about things you have no clue of.
Absolutely fucking insane. Anyone who thinks this is a good thing is clearly fucking insane. How do these lunatics get into powerful positions to make these insane decisions.
