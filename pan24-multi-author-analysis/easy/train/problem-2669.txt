So anyone with an R next to their name gets voted in and does, in some cases, literally the opposite of what their constituents want.
Ok one last comment, which is that we've also run into a mismatch between the things we vote for and the people who are elected to represent us. A perfect example is Clean Missouri. In 2018 we overwhelmingly voted in a pile of laws that would have drastically improved the lobbyist revolving door, tamped down gerrymandering, made gifts to public officials more regulated and transparent, and more. But the Republicans in the legislature crafted a constitutional amendment that was basically the opposite of that, and phrased it in a way where voting yes meant no and no meant yes, but the secretary of state was a Republican so he didn't challenge it. People were confused, and then narrowly voted to undo the thing they'd just said yes to by a wide margin.
