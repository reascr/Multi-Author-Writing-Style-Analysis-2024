Hopefully someday voters will elect enough normie establishment Democrats to allow for legislation on this stuff.
Let's say the Dems got two more normie establishment sorts elected in 2020 to the Senate. Then they could bypass Manchin and Sinema. They'd still have to work with moderates. But who? Well, the biggest ones at that point would likely be Angus King and Jon Tester. What did they want and oppose? Well, they suggested they were open to filibuster bypasses for abortion, voting rights, and maybe more, and they supported Biden's $3.5t social and climate spending proposal, so if they were the necessary moderates, that's two major bills for abortion and voting rights plus around $2.8t more in spending that Biden couldn't wring out of Manchin and Sinema. King and Tester are generally pretty pro gun so they probably wouldn't budge on gun control, and if the party tried to push them beyond what they were willing to do, they'd still be liable to go on Fox News and publicly tank negotiations just like Manchin did... but their limits and possibilities would be a lot different and more favorable to regular Democrats vs what Manchin and Sinema would allow.
Exactly. Iâ€™ve also noticed the republicans in my life are against progressive policies until they are directly affected which simply shows an astounding lack of empathy. For example pro-life until their daughter needs an abortion.
