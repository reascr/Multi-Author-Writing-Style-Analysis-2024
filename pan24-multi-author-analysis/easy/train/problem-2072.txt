Ultra RW’s don’t even believe in elections any longer. So, I’m not sure about any polls that include their thoughts on anything political, except maybe fascism, dictatorship, authoritarianism and messing up our lives in general. In this case, it’s haters hating other haters. Spontaneous Combustion.
Rightwingers still don't trust pollsters like Marquette and are likely to lie to them. Its also worth noting Marquette who is based out of Wisconsin failed to call Johnson's two previous senate wins and only flipped to Johnson in 2020 at the last minute when it became clear Barnes was going to lose and RCP was serious about its polling integrity project. In that sense many rightwingers see Marquette as a polling company dedicated to promoting political establishment propaganda.
This! Thank you. America needs to learn how to manage the election cycle. Why is it always a campaign? Besides, Desantis has a state to keep afloat for a few years.
