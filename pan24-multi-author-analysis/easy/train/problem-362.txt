NC spun off almost 20 years ago and the students pushed for it. Not sure the politics of it at the time but I never got the impression it was motivated by the right. As far as Polytechnic, I heard at the time it was so some guy, forget his name, in the FL legislature could sell a bunch of land for it to be built there. I'm guessing there were other motives, but that is what faculty were talking about at the time. But the State definitely has had it in for USF for a really long time too - they have always found ways to screw USF out of funding that other schools get. There was something some years ago with Preeminence funds - once USF met the standards for that they did something to change things so USF wouldn't get the extra funding. It's an open secret they hate USF for some reason. I honestly don't know why. Seems to me the guy at USF who makes like over 400k to do state-level lobbying for USF isn't earning his keep.
