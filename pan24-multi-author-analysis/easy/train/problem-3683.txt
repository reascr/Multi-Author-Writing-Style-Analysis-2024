I would prefer to see an embracement of actual bipartisan policies instead of this own the libs mindset and I’m hopeful that we will return to it sooner or later, but thats only if the voters will realize some people aren’t working for their benefit and that they gave power to a party who hasnt had an interest in governing since Bush.
Or it started in 1789. If you want a fun history lesson, look up Speaker Cannon (for which the Cannon House Office Building is named). He selected every member of every committee, made himself Chairman of the Rules Committee and personally controlled which bills and amendments would hit the floor and who could speak and for how long. The Democrats and a few progressive Republicans (as in Teddy's Bull Moose Progressives) sided together in 1910 and used a motion to vacate the chair to strip him of much of his power (although they kept him as Speaker until he lost reelection).
True. Unfortunately, money is the root for our problems and is why we can’t really have substantial policy making that’d benefit, not only the elected officials, but America as a whole.
