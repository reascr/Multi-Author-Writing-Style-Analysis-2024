He's the most corrupt president we ever had, is guilty but could manage the justice system since he has chosen more than half of the supreme court, has already increased his, his ministers of the government and his judges salary to over 45 grand a month while the minimum is at 1 grand, has given 10 billion to the media and self declared music artists, prohibited programming lessons on schools, cut a big chunk of money from education, people that make 1,5 minimum salary will have to pay income taxes that was to over 2,3 minimum before.

Fucking really?). It's just power for the sake of having power.
