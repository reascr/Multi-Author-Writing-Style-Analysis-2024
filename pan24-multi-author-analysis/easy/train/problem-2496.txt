Oh yeah! That’s why they play Tucker in Russia now. They will applaud and praise Russia in rallies, even chant Russia the way they usually chant USA. Now your standard rational Republican does not, but any of the people voting for Ted Cruz, MTG, Boebert, Trump, or DeSantis, those people are very pro Russia and openly say things like “America should just stay out of Russia’s business” and “Russia has every right to fight the corrupt Ukrainians” the indoctrination is very obvious and out in the open.
No, that's not how it works. When racism is in decline they widen the tent and let people in. When racists get in power they start shrinking the tent. That's why "Nazi" literally has the word socialist in their name, but the poem starts with "first they came for the socialists". That's why the Irish and Italians suddenly became "white" after the civil war. That's why the proud boys used to be run by a Cuban.
