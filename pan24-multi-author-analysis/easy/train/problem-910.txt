Correct on the service fee. While I didn't work for a school loan servicer I worked for a mortgage servicer that dealt with a range of things including Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and VA loans. The way it was explained to us is there is the fee's collected for gathering the monthly payment within the month due, plus there can be percentage increases for collecting it in the month due, reducing delinquency, getting them on ACH drafts, modification of delinquent loans so they can make timely/affordable payments, ect. There are also other incentives for taking "sub prime" loans which are unlikely to be paid and getting the signer to cough up the cash, turn over the property intact (oh the horror stories I've seen in my 8 years doing it), or again modification to effectively apply a band aid on the problem and hope they can actually make payments long enough to refi before it explodes in their face because they failed to read the very easy to understand and large print conditions and terms of modification.
Hey now. I’m over 40 and am pissed…. I don’t even have any student loans left and I’m still pissed.
