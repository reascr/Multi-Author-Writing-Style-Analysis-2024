Australia has always had this element of remote living, anti-government conspiracy theorists. The number of people who live in these areas is very small, and the number of people like this is only a tiny fraction of an already small number, so it's pretty rare that anything like this happens. But they're out there.
"A decrease in the trajectory of firearm suicides was not offset by suicides utilizing other methods, and the authors noted that their findings should mitigate concerns that suicidal individuals will kill themselves by merely substituting another method when they do not have access to a firearm (116).Â ".
Australia has a reputation (especially among Americans) for its dangerous animals. It seems odd given you are many times more likely to get shot in the USA than killed by a spider or snake here ( 1-2 deaths per year).
There has been more school shooting deaths this year in the US than spider and snake deaths in Australia this century. Its crazy.
Seriously dude? A shooting of 6 people wouldn't even make any news in your country, the fact that it is maybe need here shows you how good our gun control is.
