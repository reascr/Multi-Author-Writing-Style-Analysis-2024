Germany's armies (East and West) were still mostly rebuilt by former Wehrmacht officers. In West Germany, they still had the same people who wrote the Nuremberg Laws working in government until the 1960s (they left when they retired from old age, they weren't even kicked out). The West German intelligence agency was founded by Nazis. Former East Germany today is where the AfD and NPD get the bulk of their votes. Denazification was abandoned as policy pretty early on when the occupiers realized that the Nazi generation simply wasn't "buying it" (many Germans saw it as Victor's Justice, Allied hypocrisy, etc.) and the real denazification of Germany only happened when that generation died out from being old and were replaced by their children and grandkids.
Tangentially-related thought. I wonder how much Ukrainian culture is going to start cropping up in the West as a result of this mass transplantation. It ought to be interesting.
It was their military industrial complex becoming too powerful and dominating politics that lead to their aggressive expansionist policy.
