So whether it be an official legal donation to a political campaign or taking your "close personal friend" (who happens to be a Supreme Court Justice) on an all expenses paid hunting trip, or letting your close personal friend (who happens to be a senator and presidential candidate) who Knocked Up his mistress, let his mistress stay in your guesthouse or something else, it is very very difficult to prove actual bribery unless the government can actually get its hands on a wiretap or a written document that says "we will give you money if you do x.".
