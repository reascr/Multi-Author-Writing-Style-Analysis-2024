I know! It blows my mind that any other person on earth would have been made responsible for all the treachery and chaos he has or thinks he has brought about. I just cant understand it at all. But I do think he has yet to show us his most dangerous antics. This is the first time people are really beginning to get tired of his crap and when he realizes he is no longer the most popular kid in class anymore hes going to act out like none of us can imagine. Frankly I'm a bit scared because more and more innocent bystanders are affected by his nonsense and crimes against our country and it's just not right. He needs to be stopped by any means neccessary. Bullet to the head is my suggestion, or something equally effective. And equally final, we are done with this clown.
