I wonder what the deal was… I happen to love tossing stuff in a fire. I can see myself casually tossing copies of stuff into a fire- unless I had been told that that’s unacceptable, of course. I wish there wasn’t any plausible deniability here, you know? I’d like to feel fully confident in the facts- either he was illicitly tossing documents that should have been preserved into a fire to hide evidence of crimes or he was tossing things that would otherwise be in a burn bag, and this wasn’t a big deal. I just want to know one way or the other! Ugh.
Conservatives aren’t conservative, they just want their own brand of authoritarianism. They talk about wanting limited government that stays out of everybody’s business, but they want the government involved in abortions, stopping people at the border, keeping people from receiving benefits, they want the largest military industrial complex on the planet with bases all over the world, they want Christianity in schools and government, they want to stop who can protest and where, the whole thing is just a farce.
