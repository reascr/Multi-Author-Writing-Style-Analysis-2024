Imagine three remaining candidates. Trump had 35% of the first choice votes, Clinton had 33%, and Melissa Moderate had 32%. Melissa Moderate voters are split between Trump and Clinton as their second choice, while Melissa Moderate is the overwhelming second choice favorite for Trump and Clinton voters.
At this point, Melissa Moderate is eliminated by ranked choice / instant runoff voting… even though she EASILY defeats either Trump OR Clinton by a wide margin in a head to head election.

In this case, RCV eliminates her, and (in this hypothetical) her voters split their second choice between Trump and Clinton evenly, meaning Trump narrowly wins 51% to 49% against Clinton.

5.	seriously. it’s stupidly easy. any attempt to paint rcv as hard to comprehend should be viewed with skepticism.
