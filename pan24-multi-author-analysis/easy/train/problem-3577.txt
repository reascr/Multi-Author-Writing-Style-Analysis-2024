The city i did mention in my comment is my home town Tarnów which (surprisingly) was titled as one of cities in Europe according to CNN. I can agree that our town square is nice but i cant say this city is nowhere near my top 10 in Poland. You go outside main square and you will find panel blocks built during PRL times. Im studying now in Kraków and i must say that this city is in my opinion the best both for tourists and for just living. We call it city of students but there are many things that can keep you here. Main Market Square, Wawel Castle, just alone center of Kraków has so much to visit that you wont get bored. There is cool museum under Kraków main square that not many people know about. Ok next one would be imo either Warsaw or Wrocław. The combination of modern building and part of city rebuilt from ashes and the amount of history this city has makes Warsaw breathtaking sometimes. Wrocław is controversial here i must say. I fully consider it polish city now but i cant hide it has this German influence. I was going around its town hall during late evening but it still was as beautiful as Kraków. Panorama Racławica can hold you for a long time and those cute af dwarfs everywhere lol. And i think i will put Gdańsk in top three. You go there and you can feel like youre playing witcher games. I guess i can be a little biased when it comes to Gdańsk because i love sea. There is a lot to discover in this city and if you're done with it there are also Gdynia and Sopot (they are called tricity) just few kilometers from each other and they are also worth visiting.
This is astonishingly dangerous. I work with a person living in Minsk. He is careful not to wear blue and yellow or say anything in support of Ukraine in public for fear of being arrested. So, hooray and safety to whoever raised this flag.
