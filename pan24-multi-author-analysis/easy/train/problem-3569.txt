Stealing puppies from an Amish puppy mill and then pretending to sell them for charity in order to scam people out of money and pocketing the money? That is a fucking Charlie and Frank scheme. International bank card crime? That’s a fucking Frank scheme. Faking great college graduations, working at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, and sports stardom? Mac and Dennis behavior. His only recorded “legal” jobs being a stint in a Ponzi scheme and being a call center employee? Mac and Charlie. Stealing money from disabled vet service dogs that are dying? Dennis. Incomprehensible lying about his racial background and his family being victims of various tragedies? Dee. Secretly did drag? Mac. They elected the entire Gang put into the body of one man! George Santos is single-handedly the real life Mac, Dennis, Charlie, Dee, and Frank. What the fuck????
Reports have indicated law enforcement agencies have been looking into the financing of his campaign, his stewardship of a pet charity and his work for a company that was later ensnared in a Ponzi scheme probe. Santos has denied all allegations of wrongdoing in those cases.
