Is this....supposed to be some type of cogent statement, or purely a rhetorical device? Is there actually a "thing that frustrates you about" logic which says that different people value things differently, or is that whole thing just a setup for your dime store Daily Show knockoff bit (which nails the tone almost precisely: it says absolutely nothing meaningful or in any way related to reality, but is very proud of itself for being sooo witty)?
"I like to flip it around. By this logic don’t higher personal income tax rates just get passed on to businesses as increased costs of labor? If I paid a higher tax rate I’d demand higher pay, but that’s not how it works, my pay is determined by the market based on location, credentials, experience, etc.".
