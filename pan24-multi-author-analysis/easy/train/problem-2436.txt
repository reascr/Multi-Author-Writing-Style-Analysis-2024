A reminder to everybody, the Union plan was Lukashenkoâ€™s! He used this to leverage Putins precarious position with the Nationalists and gain power. May it forever bite him in his worthless ass.
Also known as the National Guard of the Russian Federation or "Putin's private army", Rosgvardia was reported to have 340,000 personnel, 1,650 armored vehicles, and an artillery division as of 2018. Rosgvardia's stated mission is securing Russia's borders, taking charge of gun control, combating terrorism and organized crime, protecting public order and guarding important state facilities.
ME at 3:39 lol. We are so caught up in the current moment and the news and current regimes. We are all humans, we are all ALIVE (somehow, against all odds) on this oasis hurtling through space. We have to find some way to remember that. That guy gets it.
Putin also would no doubt place blame on the US/NATO as instigators for any uprising in Belarus (regardless of the truth of any such claims), , which introduces a whole new layer of uncertainty to how Russia, NATO, and Belarusians would act should protests re-ignite in Belarus.
