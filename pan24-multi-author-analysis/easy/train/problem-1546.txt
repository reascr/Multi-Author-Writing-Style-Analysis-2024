In addition, the vote is also suspicious because no way that there would be that sort of line up given the territory that Russia controls and the territory that Ukraine controls. Zaporizhzhia city was and still is under Ukrainian control when the Russians did their 'referendum' and it's pre-war population of approximately 710,052 is a notable chunk of the region of about 1.6 million. Now unless all those people were present and able to cross over a war zone to vote, I highly doubt the validity of the referendum, especially since Russia is using said referendum as an excuse to take over the whole region. This puts other referendum in question. I concede that maybe the referendums in the Donbas may be more valid, considering Russia's long term control of the main population centers, but the ongoing battles in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia makes any proper referendums conducted in those regions questionable.
This is so sad. I wish the Russian elites cared enough about their own people to stop this senseless war.
Generally speaking, an illegal occupation occurs in the aftermath of the country being attacked/invaded unprovoked.
