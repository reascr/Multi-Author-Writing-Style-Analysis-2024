Labour under Corbyn was officially agnostic on the Referendum, they treated it like a Tory internal affair that they didn't need to engage with. He was however officially very slightly pro-Remain with many caveats before the vote despite his past vocal criticism of the EU. The same went for John McDonnell and many of their fellow lefty pals. Most of the others in the left-wing faction of Labour were pragmatic enough to pivot to the EU being the lesser evil after the Referendum but pragmatism and adaptability has never been Corbyn's strong suits. His defining characteristic is that he's basically got the same firmly held idealistic convictions he had since he was 20, which is kinda admirable for a backbencher but not a great quality if you want to lead a country.
Ugh. Was the Euromaidan a good thing for the Ukrainian people? Obviously yes. Was Americaâ€™s involvement in it a very clear indicator of aggression to Russia, irresponsibly putting the Ukrainian people in even more danger? Also yes.
