It wasn't that the humans weren't telepathic, it's that they assumed the humans were a hive-species like them. Their worker drones weren't sentient, so they assumed the humans they were encountering weren't sentient either. They expected humanity to have it's hive-mind on Earth, like they had their hive-mind safely on their planet.
I’m not sure why Ukraine even wants to keep the separatist areas… the traitor population there has been fighting them since 2014… like actively killing Ukrainians in heavy military conflict; same with Crimea… that population mostly wants to be Russian (Crimea was always Russian until 1980s it was consolidated into Ukraine in the Soviet Union; but ya I can see letting your dire enemy keep a military base RIGHT next to your ports and kinda a unacceptable deal… but why keep a bunch of hostile separatists as well; Ukraine will need to Sherman’s march their asses at the very least; it could be acceptable to give them SOME territory or autonomy to the LPR/DPR (not Russia); maybe make that a DMZ buffer zone.
