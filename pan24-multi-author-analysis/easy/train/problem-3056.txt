That’s no different to many of the weapons currently dominating the Ukraine battlefield at the moment. Stugna, Milan, Kornet, Spike, Konkurs etc.
CredibleDefense: serious discussions, sourced articles and historical documents, discussions about historical battles and equipment.
TOW is fine. If you are in a situation where that tank is firing back, you shouldn’t be using TOW anyway. You use the 25mm to suppress and GTFO.
> In 2008, the massacres which were committed by the Ukrainian nationalists against the Poles in Volhynia and Galicia were described by Poland's Institute of National Remembrance as bearing the distinct characteristics of a genocide,[15][16] and on 22 July 2016, the Parliament of Poland passed a resolution recognizing the massacres as genocide.[17][18] This classification is disputed by Ukraine and some non-Polish historians. According to a 2016 article in Slavic Review, there is a "scholarly consensus that this was a case of ethnic cleansing as opposed to genocide".[19] Other victims of the massacres included several hundred Jews, Russians, Czechs, Georgians, and Ukrainians who were part of Polish families or opposed the UPA and sabotaged the genocide by hiding Polish escapees.[5] Some Ukrainian religious authorities, institutions and leaders protested against the slayings of Polish civilians but without achieving much.[9].
NonCredibleDefense: Armchair takes required. Pro-NATO and pro-Ukraine memes and self-aware propoganda. Shitposting and intentionally biased discussions. Making fun of anti-western non-credible takes and propoganda. Intentionally dumb weapon concepts, like the Airdropped HIMARS (for extra range) and the Mach 25 "Marie Curie" RAMJET.
