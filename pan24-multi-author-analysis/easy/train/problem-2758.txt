Fun Fact: If a legally recognized body of water is not transited by a foreign nation after so many years, it becomes recognized as sovereign territory for the nation bordering it. This is why you see military fleets from many nations fan out and touch every boundary around the world. Australia for example invites other nations to sail into their various major waterways to reset the clock. When a nation becomes adversarial over this practice, it becomes a FONOP (Freedom of Navigation Operation) to force a reset of the clock against a beligerant nation. In fact, you will often see Chinese and russian vessels traversing US waterways that are still recognized as international waters.
Produce your "internationally recognized legal definition". I'm pretty sure you are just wrong. One thing to keep in mind is that "captured spies" are tried on the basis of the laws of the nation they violated, not any kind of international system. I think YOU are confusing diplomatic traditions with nonexistent "international law".
