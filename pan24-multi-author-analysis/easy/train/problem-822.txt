Honestly, I think this it for "The Great American Experiment"..."Empires" usually come down around every 300 years. I majored in American history / politics so I have a good understanding of it. And this is to not say I'm not voting on Tuesday or going to give up but I have very little hope but recently we've had a sitting president that tried to overthrow the constitution through a violent coup last year and has so far not faced any consequences and will soon make his for 2024 run reveal any day now...We have an extremist supreme court who literally just overturned a half a century precedent through Roe v Wade. Massive polarization between our two parties where we only see the other as the enemy and no longer Americans. And also crazy spread of disinformation through social and 24/7 news. Rising extremism & violence....so on and so on.
History? They’re convinced the kids are using litter boxes for bathrooms because they identify as cats. That’s literally all it takes to mobilize their base.
