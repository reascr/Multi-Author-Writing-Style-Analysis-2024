Are you sure about that? I know that nitrogen fertilizers are made using natural gas, but there are other sources of nitrogen. The Norwegian company Hydro started up using hydropower to make nitrogen fertilizer by fixing nitrogen from air, using the Birkeland-Eyde process. The reason fertilizer companies moved on to the Haber-Bosch process was that it was more economical. If we had enough renewable electricity, we could go back to the Birkeland-Eyde process. There is also a lot of nitrogen in sewer. The Oslofjord is being killed, because most of the municipalities around it haven't invested in sewer treatment plants that can remove nitrogen from the sewer. If that could be removed from the sewer and used as fertilizer, we could solve two problems at the same time.
