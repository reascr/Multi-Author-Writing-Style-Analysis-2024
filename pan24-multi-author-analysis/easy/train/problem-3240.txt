>"Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other areas in the Donetsk region are under constant Russian attacks. There are constant attempts to break through our defence. The enemy does not count its people and, despite numerous casualties, maintains a high intensity of attacks. In some of its wars, Russia has lost in total less people than it loses there, in particular near Bakhmut," said Zelenskyy.
Absolutely. russia can out-last the West because they don't care about human lives. This is literally the most important shit they have going on, and it's worth every single man, woman, and child to them. We're always one news cycle away from depicting the war as tragic stalemate and pressuring Ukraine to negotiate the borders. Then russia can do this all over again in 5 years and we'll all be surprised pikachu that russia wiped their ass with a treaty.
Continue? We haven't even started that level of support. Still dusting off old equipment from the "in case Russia" warehouse. Even the "modern" stuff they're getting is still plenty old. The US just spent 30x as much waving their dicks around in the middle east, again, with nothing to show for it again.
Exactly. The Marder and Bradley will have more of an impact. Being able to outfit full combat units with IFV's is better than 1 tank battalion containing 3 different tank types.
Fantasy. The russian people broadly support this war and are willing to lose it all in support of it. This isn't a "putin thing". Even if the despot were to die all of a sudden, they would select another leader with the same, or perhaps even worse, ideals. Honestly I'd say that we'll be looking back at how moderate and level-headed putin was when the next psychopath takes office.
