The US is literally playing by the rules and using a mechanism built into them to resolve the larger dispute over how rules are created and interpreted.
Rather than abandoning the rules, the US has worked to establish new rules outside of WTO and is actively using the rules inherent to the WTO to force a renegotiation of the dispute resolution process.
Rules change based on how their interpreted and the US is facing a long term disadvantage due to the contemporary interpretation of the rules.
As WTO rules are concencus based, there is no feasible way to change rules that are being abused, without forcing the issue. As the US is doing here.
I don’t know how you don’t see 100+ countries protesting something as not a bad thing, the US us purposefully breaking the system because it has been breaking rules and doesn’t want the WTO to rule in other nations favour, then the other nations will look at reform with or without the US, because it isn’t just holding up disputes on US trade, it’s holding up disputes on, Australian trade, Chinese Trade, French, British, German trade, if they want to keep the system that rules in the USAs favour like 90 percent of the time, then they need to make sure disputes can still actually be settled there, or you may end up giving a free win to China or some other power.
