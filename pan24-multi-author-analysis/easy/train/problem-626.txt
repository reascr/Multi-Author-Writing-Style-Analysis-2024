I think Xi is trying to broker a deal in ending the attempt to take Ukraine, or give Putin an exit via asylum. It's way more profitable and fixes some economic issues for China if Russia becomes dependent on them and that will definitely happen if Xi plays his cards right, but Putin's ego may get in the way. I don't think Xi is stupid enough to provide Russia ammo for a war the west is combatting via Ukraine to avoid a world war. The last thing China needs is that shit happening to it's biggest neighbor AND destroying the economic stability of its already strained production relationship with it's biggest customer by far: the US. China is already dealing with economic bs. Sanctions will be a huge problem and nobody wants that, east or west. It is in EVERYONE'S best interest at this point that this war in Ukraine ends asap because Putin IS getting backed into a corner and according to the friends I have in Russia, he's been priming nuclear hysteria there. Nooooobody needs that shit.
The other explanation is that culturally, the US hasn’t historically thought of the Ukraine as an independent nation, but instead as a region, and so we default to adding a “the” just like we do when describing other regional descriptions like “the Rockies” “the Midwest” and “the pacific”.
