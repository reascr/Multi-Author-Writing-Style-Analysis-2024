The Senate sets its own rules. It takes 51 votes to change the cloture requirement. And again, theyâ€™ve done it recently.
The only way to fix this is to make conservatism socially poisonous, to make 'conservative' itself a pejorative, to strip right wing ideology of its fake patriotic marketing material and expose it unequivocally as deadly to American democracy and principles of freedom. We need to be the patriots, we need to take ownership of this country and its symbols and history, because it always belonged to us in the first place. The American Revolution was history's first categorical rejection of conservatism and established traditions, and it's time we start really making that our mission statement as a country. Letting these neo Confederate fascists LARP as American patriots is not just a total farce, it gives them legitimacy they don't deserve and are not entitled to.
