As others have pointed out, is that he has no charisma whatsoever. All his media appearances are heavily scripted and choreographed, he provides absolutely no entertainment value. Why does that matter? One of the many ways trumpf transformed the Republican Party was to turn it into a source of entertainment content, really capitalizing on anger-tainment. That’s what republican voters have come to expect, a strongman totalitarian leader who ridiculed his opponents into submission by sheer force of superiority and willpower alone. Never mind that trumpf was literally none of those things, aspiring, sure, but in reality he is, well we all know what a fuckin pathetic loser he is, we don’t need to dwell on him any longer than absolutely necessary. It’s easier to fake being those things if you have that entertainment value, it’s much harder to fake being entertaining and charismatic if you have no charm, allure, or magnetism to speak of at all. I’m gonna love the irony that defucktis will be eaten alive by the very same populist machine that they wanted so bad. Truly a paradigm for what is to come under a fascist dictatorship.
Seriously. A republican would eat a shit sandwich with glee if it meant a liberal had to smell his breath.
