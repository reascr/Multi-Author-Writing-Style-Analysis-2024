- I did buy the book but haven't read it yet. Aside from the interview I linked above, I heard a Rachel Maddow interview of Pomerantz, and they discussed the difficulty of going after Trump for a very big and repeated violation of the law, which is that for decades his organization routinely and arguably illegally used tactics like reneging on their debts, using their clout to negotiate downward and get better deals. Apparently this is illegal, but is very difficult for a relatively small Manhattan DA office to go after. For my point here though I think it helps enforce that justice, with respect to this fiend who has done so much damage to our country, has been delayed for decades. Why does Bragg think it's ok to delay further.
