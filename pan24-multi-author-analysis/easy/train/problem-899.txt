Nope! Actually it's much, much worse. The list of conditions they extracted from McCarthy in the end is extreme, and effectively lets Boebert and Gaetz have a veto on everything that Congress will do. Congress will also automatically re-enter speakerless limbo if McCarthy tries to allow a vote to raise the debt ceiling without securing massive and specific across the board spending cuts, and Russian-backed Congressfolk are getting all of the security and defense committee positions. Further, it gives the Freedom Caucus control over the rules committee, effectively allowing them to interpret the rules of Congress unilaterally.
