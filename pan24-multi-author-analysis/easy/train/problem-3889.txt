I don’t see many countries taking a nuclear attack and having the patience to sit back and wait for irrefutable evidence about who the perpetrators were. Especially if there’s a worry that there may be more warheads floating around just waiting to be used. I feel like the US or most European countries would at least pretend to investigate. But if Israel got hit, I don’t see them waiting even days before they started glassing countries. And then it’s a wrap.
If there is a hot conflict and Orban and Erdogan's intransigence causes loss of NATO life and severe economic consequences then neither should be treated like allies (forget quake assistance for Erdogania or "democracy packages" for Budapest) and if either gets hostile further in such circumstances then the Turkish and Hungarian army leadership should be quickly crushed (both have been purged of much of their NATO-competent leaders anyway: with Erdogan's purges dating back a decade or so IIRC and Hungary's coming only in recent weeks).
