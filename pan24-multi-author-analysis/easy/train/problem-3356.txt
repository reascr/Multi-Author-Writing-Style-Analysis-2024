Depends on how you look at it. I live in one of the few liberal areas. Great people and atmosphere, plus the tourist traps are on the islands so most of the repulsive entitled types stay in their little corners. They also have an excellent coexistence between nature and the city here. Trees in my area are literally protected by law. They can't be cut down without approval and permits. As for cult cities, yes and I live relatively close to the one taken over by scientologists. They're weird for sure. They won't talk to the general public, unless you're providing a service. I don't particularly like them but they don't cause a whole lot of trouble for the average citizen. They actually cause a LOT less problems than the people who partake in a specific, widely known organized religion with a reputation for violence that dates back to at least a couple of millenia. They actually cause a lot less problems here than they did in my home state (Georgia), where they were able influence state and local laws in ways that essentially kept minorities from being able to leave the system. Florida won't change if people with a good head on their shoulders are too afraid to move here. I can understand not wanting to deal with the heat, but blaming the people in general is just a way of saying "they really need help, but I refuse to be the one who helps them.".
Like with all these megalomaniacs, he's just a coward, a low life, loves adulation, loves marginalising large sections of their society, but when they lose, they show utter contempt to the system that brought them into power in the first place, these people are disgusting human beings.
