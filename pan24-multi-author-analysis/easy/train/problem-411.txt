Exactly. If you want another proof of how Russians perceive things differently than the rest of the world, is how they perceive the USSR's occupation of Poland for example - it wasn't occupation in their eyes, but liberation.

During the interviews with them you really have to press them to make them realize that yes, they are occupiers. Some even don't what what an occupier is, or pretend they don't.
