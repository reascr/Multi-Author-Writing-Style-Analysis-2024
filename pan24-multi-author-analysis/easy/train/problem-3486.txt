but the race IS problematic in that we harvest resources from the earth for the race. we flatten the grounds for the race. we eliminate more and more wildspaces to allow for a wider race for more people to run it. now the racetrack has gotten so wide that in some parts you can't even see trees over people's heads anymore. people warn, "6th mass extinction is here the race shares part of the blame" well, it's only part of the blame, sure, but all society can take part of the blame, not only that, but extinctions are natural. "but it's a mass extinction, not just Some species not surviving, but Lots of them not making it." well whatever, the race is what we know, do you know how many shoe manufacturers, leg trainers, dieticians would suddenly be out of work if we eliminated the race? what a joke! the race is the next logical step in human advancement, if we eliminate it, it'll return in another form.
