We'll see. The adults in the room understand that this is posturing and bad faith bullshit to appeal to a fascist voting block that loves Putin. Threats will be made, economic and military armament. They'll back down.
are swedes wants to live in a homophobic, xenophobic autocracy with near-Argentina-level of economic leadership?
Yup. Im actually glad Turkey keeps on going against NATO. It would help US leaves NATO more, and NATO needs to collapse. The US doesnt need NATO and they would grow much stronger economically since they can focus on themselves. Please Turkey and Hungary. Keep stalling haha.
I'm sure if enough journalists, which fascists totally respect, report on the problems and enough intellectuals and academics, which fascists totally respect, sit down and calmly explain the issues - those fascists will rejoin reality and abandon their pathological lies, authoritarian tendencies, and genocidal urges.
Yes. Its not Hungary who has the threat of Russian invasion hanging over their heads, so Orban takes Putin's money and KGB aid and plays these games in NATO and the EU.
