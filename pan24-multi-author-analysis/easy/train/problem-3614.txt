Edit: What also makes me sad is that there are actually so many Russian citizens who feel as horrified by this as we are. I visited Istanbul, Turkey in October and there were so many Ukrainian AND Russian citizens. Obviously the monstrous acts weâ€™ve been talking about are the main issue. But when I was there, I saw people choosing to flee to a country they donâ€™t know because their respective countries are at war. There have always been Ukrainian and Russian migrants coming to Turkey. But this time it was just different. There was a demonstration organized by Ukrainians bringing awareness to the child victims of war. Iâ€™ve heard of this over and over again. Ukrainians care so deeply about their younger generations. The monsters know about this Iâ€™m sure. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.
This isnâ€™t really the same as someone shooting someone in an armed robbery or a domestic dispute, if you can prove war crimes were committed and soldiers are willing to testify against their commanders, those commanders should hang after a military tribunal.
