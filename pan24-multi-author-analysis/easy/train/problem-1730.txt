The posts of pcx99 were much more comprehensive in coverage and included more twitter links. I'm no substitute. But I do think there's value in summarizing daily news (which I read anyway and keep notes). So I'm happy to share when I can.
Pure insanity. Russia has already lost close to 100k soldiers between killed and wounded. And they’ve failed in every offensive they’ve done… they couldn’t take Kyiv or Kharkiv and they were kicked out of Sumy, Izyum, Kherson, and other liberated areas. Yet these idiots in the Kremlin think that a fresh batch of poorly trained and ill equipped soldiers will somehow be able to go on the offensive in the spring next year and do what the experienced and properly equipped troops couldn’t do in the early months of the war. Oh and let’s not forget that Ukraine is more armed to the teeth now than they were nine months ago. Those Russian troops are being sent to their deaths.
All of that said, it would likely just be easier to push a 7500 watt generator off of the back of a moving truck along with ten gallons of gas every couple of hundred of feet, because integrating small sources of electricity for a sort of peer-to-peer electrical grid would be an absolute nightmare (and most likely, simply impossible) from an electrical engineering standpoint.
