❗️Enemy propaganda actively uses the principle of information noise, namely: intentionally overloads the information space with a large number of fakes to "smudge" the real situation on the battlefield.
I live in northern France. I had a girl and her mom stay at my home for a few days in early December. They were on their way to England with their dog and had a foster family waiting for them there. They needed a place to stay for a few days waiting for an appointment with British veterinary services. They were told by local volunteers to not wait at Calais because it's a centerplace for human trafficking and could be dangerous for 2 girls traveling alone. I had a spare room to offer. They were doing their best to be unobtrusive and gave me a hand with chores and the mom (a florist) was happy taking care of my plants. I asked them to keep me informed how they were doing in England and they sent me merry Christmas and happy new year messages. They were both looking for a job last time we talked.
