This is a conservative government using this to distract the Alberta local yokels from the fact they raised Albertans' taxes, and they brought in some of the highest cost increases in Canada, like the highest insurance rates in the country and there's an increase for 2023 as well (source, family member is a big wig in insurance in Alberta), and they added fees all over the place while deregulating utilities and industries like insurance, and they broke many many laws like hiding Oil company lobbing records from the public, etc.... it just goes on and on, attacks on healthcare, education, public access to parks, and the dumbest part is they will blame Trudeau for it even though it's 100% a provincial government jurisdiction and responsibility and the majority of Alberta voters will believe this lie because god forbid they take even a little responsibility for their own lives, they'll just vote to make things worse for everyone else even if that includes them.
Not even close. Britain is a developed country somewhat capable of self dependence and working out their own trade deals.
