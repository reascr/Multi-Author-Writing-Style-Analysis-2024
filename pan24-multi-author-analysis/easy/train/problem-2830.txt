In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Usually it’s company-to-company. Like “our teams are going to be working closely together on this project. Don’t test our team as a place to poach from, and we won’t do the same to you.”.
Exactly. Politician gives company generous legislation/votes on preferred legislation, in exchange for a wink/nudge deal on a cushy retirement "job" afterwards. And these deals are often delivered by former legislators, as a kind of demonstration of their validity (look how well we treat the last person in your shoes...). Would make it a bit harder to perform these backroom deals if there was a guaranteed couple decades before the money starts flowing.
Microsoft-Activision, no. The FTC literally claims in court documents that Microsoft lied to the analogous EU or UK (don't remember which) regulatory body over a previous acquisition (Bethesda, I believe), leading that regulatory body to state matter-of-factly that Microsoft followed through and did not lie. Their opposition to Microsoft-Activision is flimsy. Plus Microsoft has been behaving well to game studios starting to unionize.
