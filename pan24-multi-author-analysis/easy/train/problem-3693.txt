If you believe that weather exists and care about the environment, BUT you don’t think that a bunch of billionaires (who, among other things, support massively destructive, carbon-emitting global wars and live as environmentally, unethically as they possibly can) actually care about the environment, and trust them to take your rights and property away (3000 farmers in the Netherlands have just recently been informed that they can ONLY sell their property to the government for a set price) does that make you a climate denier? Is this like being a ‘Covid denier’ where you believe in the effectiveness of vaccines and microbiology in general, but don’t agree with lockdowns or think that they should be rolling out experimental drugs to the public at such an alarming rate?
