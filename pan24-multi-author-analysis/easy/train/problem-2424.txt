Imagine for a moment, you get a job as an accountant. After a week in the job your employer finds out that you did not go the university that it says on your resume. "That's odd," your employer says, so he/she calls up your previous place of employment and they have no record of you. Anywhere in this country you lose your job for falsifying your information. You'd get fired immediately. In congress however, not only do you not get fired, you voluntarily stop doing parts of your job and then continue to collect a pay check. WTF?!?
"As a life-long Californian, I have fond memories of my time at Beverly Hills High School with my friends Brandon, Kelly, Brenda, Dylan, Donna and Steve, to helping out after school at the family farm in the central valley each day, and then going to watch the sunset off the coast with the sun coming down over the Golden Gate Bridge. I will do everything in my power to fight and restore traditional Reagan values to our failed state and push out things like groomers in drag.".
