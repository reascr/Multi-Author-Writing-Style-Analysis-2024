Boebert married a sexual predator and has been arrested multiple times with numerous allegations from neighbors that her and her husband have harassed and intimidated them after they complained about them, MTG actively calls for violence in service to political objectives with ties to multiple extremist groups (ranging from Nazi's to the KKK), Trump has so many things that we could be here all night just listing them, Palin was a governor who left office the moment it was no longer convenient to remain her family has had numerous run ins with law enforcement and her eldest daughter is the penultimate example of what "Abstinence Only" education leads to.
Same. I’m sure he’s a total asshole from what we’ve heard but I don’t loath him as a person like I do trump, bobert, mtg or so many other republicans. But this guy probably did have a few too many concussions and jokes aside he’s legit not qualified because of it. Some of the stuff he says has a genuine innocence to it and he doesn’t seem like some corrupt monster because of it like many of his other party members.
