Didn't Vancouver have a 'no vacant property' rule go through a few years back? I remember reading about folks getting sweet heart rental deals on a room in or a whole mansion property when the rule eat going into affect. I think the stick motivator was a tax fine though.
Tokyo is the biggest major city in the world to fully disincentive property as an investment tool, and people in Tokyo experience low homelessness, higher housing quality, and more economic productivity as less money is invested into real estate and more is invested to things with higher societal returns like businesses.
oh hell yeah it did move by quite a while. I made an offer on a property -40k and was refused at the end of nov. Made another offer on dec 19th with -90k and was accepted 2 days later when I informed agent that my next offer will be on jan 1st at -140k. No need to make any counter-offer. He didnt like it one bit. I learned later that agent cut his share in half to convince vendor to sell hehe.
Possibly? The perk of allowing everyone to benefit from corruption and kickbacks, is that when necessary you can drop charges on an individual. The CCP is vengeful enough that they would probably manipulate systems to seize the property. Either just break the person's will and they sign over under a level of denied duress. Or the CCP just goes through the Canadian Courts and say the property was purchased with stolen funds.
