This butt fart just pushed a “teachers’ bill of rights” bullshit idea that includes outlawing unions from being able to take dues from paychecks to “raise teacher pay”. I hate it here.
Secondly, Ron DeSantis is just a power hungry narcissist who sees everyone as equally beneath him, LGBT people are just the easiest targets for him to make scapegoats out of in order to justify his multiple power grabs.
No. That's exactly the problem. It is giving people like DeSantis, a straight person, an 'excuse'. By implying he is a victim himself it not only gives him a reason, it also blames gay people for homophobia. That's problematic.
"You are free to believe what I tell you to believe. You are free to think what I want you to think. You are free to say what I expect you to say. You are free to do what I order you to do." -Ron DeSantis, probably.
No. Plenty of straight people are homophobic and bigoted just because. It doesn't mean they're secretly compensating. Sometimes a shitty person is just a shitty person.
