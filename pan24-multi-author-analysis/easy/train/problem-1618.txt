These people are stupid. Do people really want a civil war? Or do they want to fucking cos play as people with real problems in life? Iâ€™m guessing the latter. Do they hate having Amazon delivered and being able to spend a whole day doing nothing and watching tv sometimes? Do they hate food security? If they get what they want, that stuff is gone. These people are stupid.
No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.".
