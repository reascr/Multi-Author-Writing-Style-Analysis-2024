I met an Israeli chef in Thailand recently. He would brag about how Israel is the 51st US state and how they celebrate the 4th of July over there. I'm pretty sure the US sends Israel more money than it does for a lot of US states.
Palestinian is a regional/national identifier. Arab is an ethnicity. Arabs existed in the middle east way longer than the national identity of Palestinian has. You couldn't fit more wrong in your post if you tried lol.
Illegally relocating hundreds of thousands of israeli civilians including children into militarily occupied territory beyond israels borders does NOTHING to protect israelis.
It's a catch 22. Israel controls imports because a lot of materials are used for terror, also and especially building materials. Gaza is unhappy because Israel is extremely restrictive. Etc.
Anyway. Palestine, specifically the kids that are currently growing up there is what I care about in this. Just want to make this clear, bc I have no stake in defending Israel except when I feel facts that need to be addressed but aren't because 'apartheid Israel' rhetoric.
And it puts Israel in a light that makes Israel ignore them entirely, and validates Palestinian propaganda that's extremely unhelpful to any sort of lasting solution.
Nobody there really wants a one state solution (minus extremists on both sides which obviously would mean no fair state and either jews or palestinians disappear eventually).
The ones who lose to all of them are peaceful Palestinian protesters who are actually oriented towards a future of coexistence.
Peaceful protests are very often turned into aggression and violence, usually either by orthodox settlers who provoke, or Palestinians who see peaceful protesting as too weak. Usually both. Then the IDF comes, often using disproportionate force to stop things from escalating while a few Palestinians try exactly for this escalation.
