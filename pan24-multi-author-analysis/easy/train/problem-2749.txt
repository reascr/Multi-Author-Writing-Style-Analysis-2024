Fun example... So Tata (mother group of TCS) decided to launched their own super app for the Indian market - called Tata Neue. They hired the TCS leadership to drive it entirely under a new company - Tata Digital. The app took a couple of years to make. The app was launched as the title sponsor for IPL 2022 (India's superbowl). Crazy amount of marketing money spent. But the app bombed due to technical glitches. Despite being built in this decade, the app already has accumulated a huge technical debt that will take years to fix. The capable senior folks they hired quietly left, leaving a higher concentration of project managers in charge. You can to know how bad it's doing. Work culture is so toxic that Tata Digital paid Glassdoor shit ton of money to pull down the Tata Digital Glassdoor page to combat the crazy amount of negative employee reviews.
SERIOUSLY. That cost model made no sense! And it really shocks me that people are willing to put up with it because itâ€™s a dream job similar to how techies here would hopefully love to work FANG jobs one day.
