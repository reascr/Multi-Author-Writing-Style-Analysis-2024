I think after this we might actually see a revolution in Turkey. One thing is when government steals money, another thing is when your long life friend or a family member dies, and the government is at fault. Even if they didn't cause the earthquake they are accountable for the amount of improperly constructed buildings for such an environment, let alone suppressing any amount of help effort by blocking social media to its citizens. The Turkish people have to seriously consider getting a new leader, hopefully one not as corrupt as Erdogan.
Absolutely terrible. Hopefully the Turkish people get to replace Erdogan with a leader who would respond better to such situations.
It sounds like your colleague suffers from the same inflated ego that Erdogan suffers from...he should probably psychologically prepare himself for a change, come May.
Not necessarily. The point is in times of great catastrophe society has as much chance to to not good things as it does to come together, even more so when leadership's two goals are maintaining leadership and taking as much money as they can, like the earthquake fund. Scapegoats are easy to create when everyone is suffering. The danger is that society could act poorly in the coming months.
Human bodies are incredible. Through a prism of objectiveness, you can see them both as fragile and easy to break as you can see them as tough, and resilient.
