I've had a different experience with my conservative relatives. None of them had any idea about 666 Park Ave or Ivanka's Chinese trademarks or that the ACORN "sting" was a fraudulent hit job, or the Planned Parenthood video was spliced together. When you only get information from sources that present one side, you don't know these things. Fox just didn't cover Jan 6 the way real news did. Sure, they could find more balanced news, but honestly, they don't know how. The world has past them by in ways they don't understand, and they get mad about it because Tucker tells them to be. It's sad, really.
It was also exactly the kind of setup women are always accused of engaging in whenever a rightwing figure (like Kavanaugh) gets accused of inappropriate behavior, except that I believe that was projection for behavior the right is all too willing to engage in. Franken had proven himself to be a threat to Trump and company, so they found a way to ruin him. Did the left play right into their hands? Sure. The timing made that a political necessity, not to mention that Gillibrand also stood to benefit personally from eliminating him.
