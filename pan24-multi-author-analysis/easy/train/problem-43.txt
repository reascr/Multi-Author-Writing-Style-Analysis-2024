The quite part the right wing capitalist class won't tell you is that a significant portion of our economy relies on the exploitation of undocumented immigrants. The right isn't really interested in keeping people out of America; instead, what they are interested in is making an entire class of people's existence illegal so that they can curb the labor right of migrants and keep wages low. It's a cycle.
Guess those ranchers and farmers will just have to start learning how to do their own work since they’re not willing to 1- pay someone a living wage to do it for them legally or 2- stop being racist bigots to the illegal immigrants and their families who they’ve been paying low wages to do the work in the past. I don’t know where they think they’re going to get workers from “abroad” to fill positions legally (because remember, they’re against illegal immigration) for what they’re paying. Suck it up, my mans, and get to work.
