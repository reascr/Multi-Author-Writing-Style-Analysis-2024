If we don't want the "coffee boy" to take the fall for Trump, we need to acknowledge that the burden of proof in a federal court is a lot more complex than it is for a bunch of Reddit armchair prosecutors who think the DOJ can just say "duh, isn't it obvious? I rest my case!".

If a former military member's staff packed up a bunch of classified documents, haphazardly mixed them with personal items, and stored them in various locations on his multiple properties, and it were unclear what documents were still out there, and there were legal hurdles involved in accessing the documents, and burden-of-proof hurdles involved in proving that the former military member personally directed some of the documents to be hidden from investigators, and there were suspicion--but no proof yet--that the former military man didn't merely hoard the documents but actually intended to give/sell them to adversaries, then this would probably result in a much longer and more complex investigation.
