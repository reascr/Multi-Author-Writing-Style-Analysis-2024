We only need to know about a) new crimes from he and his cohorts and b) how he is hopefully paying for them. The media’s obsession around making money off of him (and his supporters eating it up like sycophants while others rage read) helped him win in 2016. (Remember when they aired an empty chair for nearly an hour just waiting for him to show up?).
I mean the suggestion of a possible investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails in the weeks before the election caused her to lose, then I’m gonna wager a full blown indictment for the piece of shit who attempted an insurrection would probably not be to his benefit.
Who. Cares. if it will help or hurt him. This is a bad faith question meant to change the conversation away from what Trump is guilty of - Sedition Conspiracy for his attempts to overthrow a democratic election and install himself as an unelected dictator.
The only question that matters is "is he guilty of committing seditious acts against the US to overthrow an election on January 6th 2022?".
