>To be clear, the Department of Transportation (“Department”) under your leadership has made great progress on expanding the rights of airline passengers and conducting rigorous oversight of the airline industry regarding flight cancellations and delays. For instance, the Department, among other things, (1) recently announced its “Airline Customer Service Dashboard,” which has helped secure commitments from airlines to cover the costs of rebooking, hotels, meals and transportation if the airline is at fault, (2) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in August that would codify and provide greater certainty for when passengers could expect ticket refunds when an airline cancels or significantly delays a passenger’s flight, (3) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in October requiring airlines to provide greater transparency in disclosing ancillary service fees, and (4) initiated enforcement actions against six airlines leading to $600 million in refunds for passengers due to a cancellation or a significantly changed flight.
No, I think they missed that one somehow. It probably went totally unenforced under the orange shit-flinger's tenure, tho.
