If you want to get depressed, go look at Google maps/earth of the Amazon. So many miles upon miles of it gone. I got to walk through the Amazon and it was one the most surreal thing ever. The sounds, smell, amazing.
Lula had two terms, and at no point in either of them he seemed even close to do what Chavez did, not only because he's not like Chavez ideologically and is very pragmatic but also because the situation in Brazil was never like Venezuela, a leftist authoritarian government was and still is a laughable idea for Brazil, the politics of the two countries are different, you can't just point at Venezuela's left and equal it to Brazil's to push fearmongering...this is getting soooo old and soooo lame.
P.S. By the way if you're going to try and play gotcha games or make assumptions about a person it helps if you're even the SLIGHTEST bit intelligent. I know, I know, that's asking a lot from someone such as yourself. Don't worry we all feel terrible about how life has failed you... repeatedly.
