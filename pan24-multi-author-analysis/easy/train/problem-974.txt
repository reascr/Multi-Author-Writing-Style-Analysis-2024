It's slightly a relief but still more frustrating to know it was such a widespread phenomenon, I remember it didn't pass over me despite being a kid because it impacted videogame prices too: from sixty thousands of our previous currency to 60€ (basically doubled), having learned by heart the exchange rate of the two since it was often on TV I couldn't help but thinking those game store owners were either very lacking math-wise or very greedy.
The Czech Republic should keep the koruna. Literally no reason for them to switch, it’s a perfectly fine currency (and one of my favorite aesthetically too lol). The best decision the lawmakers there have made has been holding off adoption of the Euro for so long. May it long continue.
Also absolutely pummeled retirees. I have a family member who though he'd live a great life on his pensione because he's reached the highest pay level for his position, then it lost half its value in the couple years after the euro was introduced. Now he lives extremely frugally and barely makes ends meet. Can't imagine what it was like for people who started off on a meager pensione.
