I imagine that Chinese aid isn't so much aid officially as it is the Chinese government turning a blind eye to Chinese companies selling all sorts of stuff to the Russians against sanctions or "letting it fall off the back of a truck". There's thousands of miles of border shared with Russia and China, they can pass stuff to the russians at will and no one will know what they're actually sending, and since it's not government mandated the Chinese government gets plausible deniability.
Lol not anymore. Only last year they had to spend something like 800 billions to replace Russian resources. German industrial capabilities are no longer competitive especially with that new USA green subsidy law that made it even more compelling to move all the production to States. EU losing autonomity is what USA and Brits want so that they can pressure them into their influence. Now USA has a place to sell their super expensive liquidated gas, steals industries and threatens euro strenh as we saw back in summer. This war bleeds EU dry all while letting States enjoy new military and trade contracts which were not on the plate before because Union did not need them thanks to cheap Russian resources.
