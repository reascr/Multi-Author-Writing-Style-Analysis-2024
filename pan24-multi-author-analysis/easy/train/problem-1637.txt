Chinese prepare for war so openly and we continue to pay for his war machine against us with every Made in China purchase. When do we move our supply chains home? After he attacks ffsâ€¦.
The tech is helping, but to conquer any country, they need troops to land on that country, how come they want to land troops on the country that they want to invade if the did not have sufficent transport over the air or water, because its imposible for any group of troops to swim or fly by theirself over ocean to conquer a country, hmmm i think it would be disaster for them before they even have make a single step over the conquerer country, if china use only long range missile or nuke they only create a terror for any other country not invade or counquer them.
Even with everything that China does wrong. I can't believe that their leader would tell their army "ðŸ¤· don't worry about preparedness. If shit goes down. Just bend over. Relax your holes. And take it".
They only have 3 aircraft carrier now, when japan deside to enter ww2 they allready have more than 20, the pacific has large area of ocean, so they would need more ship to do invation, the ground troop are useless if they did not have transport in order to make a war to another island on pacific, i think they did not ready to start a big war on pacific, unless the want to invade a country in the same continent with them.
Wellâ€¦ it is a little more complex. China ainâ€™t Russia even in international propaganda. They are more than equiped especially for modern warfare, drone, intelligence and space. Most components in your everyday devices, even Apple, Cisco â€¦ are build in china, the real realm of reverse engineering. DJI ? This is them, they own the drone market by a large margin. Old world war such as aircraft carriers, navy cannons â€¦ maybe not a efficient a top notch naval drone. To be frank I do have some suspicions over the whole situation, even in Ukraine.
