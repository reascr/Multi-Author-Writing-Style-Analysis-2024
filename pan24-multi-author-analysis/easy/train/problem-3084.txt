Furthermore...Carter was a success in every single endeavor he has ever participated in. He was well beyond an exceptional student and always at the top of his class. Hugely successful military career, he became a literal nuclear physicist who had to make split second real-time crisis decisions to save a damaged reactor...literally saving Ottawa Canada from becoming uninhabitable radiated mess. Dude just entered hero tier level here..A President who chose to run for office and deal with one of the shittiest cards one has every walked in to office with. Habitat for Humanity one of the most successful social outreach and provision charities ever...of course everything afterwards has been epic. Whenever there were conflicts and crisis? Carter long after he was President would be working on treaties with many nations..The dude is simply a badass. His resume and results are /is unparalleled.
