As for drug dealers, that's even more unlikely with the possible exception of the larger suppliers. Individual drug dealers and gangs, with the exception of the largest and most powerful gangs, don't have the kind of economic power to expand between cities, and even then, they take over existing structures. Most struggle to expand their territory even within their own cities. Steven Levitt (of Freakonomics fame) published a a few years back on the intricacies of gang finance. The original Freakonomics book also looks at how most low-level drug dealers live with their moms; they make below minimum wage. His covers the subject.
I’m not “against helping others,” I’m against throwing more money at drugged out zombies that are literally biting people’s faces off on our mass transit, blocking off sidewalks, destroying natural areas and damned tired of having dewy-eyed self-righteous jackasses assuming that the only solution is paying even more for these monsters.
