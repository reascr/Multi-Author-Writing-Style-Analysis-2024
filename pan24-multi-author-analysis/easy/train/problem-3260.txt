Lastly, I pay a shit ton in taxes. It’s not necessarily about the dollar amount, but every dollar I earn gets taxed like 4-6 times. America is awesome and shitty at the same time, but literally all I get for my America User Fee ie taxes, is an awesome American passport, the protection of the constitution (which means less and less every day) and the right to own some insanely powerful guns. I’m going to use those rights while they exist, while hoping the police can do their jobs and prevent mass shootings. I also feel like all the money I pay in taxes gives me the right to complain. So I really wish we’d spend a shit ton more money on mental health. I’ve benefited from mental healthcare and it needs to me more of a focus, perhaps above American physical healthcare. BTW, healthcare and specifically insurance is out of control in this country and is an absolute abomination.
