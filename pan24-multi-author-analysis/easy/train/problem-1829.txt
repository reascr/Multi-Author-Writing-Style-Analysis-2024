In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. More likely more, since these are estimates from NATO and western sources. Russia mobilized mobile crematoriums to dispose of the dead (those they bothered to clean up) rather than report back home and have to pay the dead's families. No body = no pay. They're making shallow mass graves for Ukranians, leaving their wounded to die in the middle of fields (and it's a vast countryside, so surveying/counting bodes isn't possible).

Fair point on casualties/fatalities semantics. However, when discussing the Russian losses, I am in fact thinking of actual fatalities. They have little to no medical training, no medical supplies, they leave their wounded to die whereever they drop, and have no facilities to treat any wounds large or small. The majority of wounds in this kind of engagement are going to be fatal, even if not immediately. The few "trained" units like the wagner terrorist/mercenaries will have better ability to treat themselves, but they are being wiped out slowly and surely and all of the mobilized citizens lately are just meat for the grinder.
