I know right? I’ve taken 1000mg of cbd isolate because i had a huge back pain and i wanted to try all these virtues, had to take some tylenol instead. Maybe its something that works long term but for acute pain i didnt see any benefits.
Hell for all we know the people who report highs from CBD have issues with their bloods ph buffering which does biological magic to convert some of it to delta 8, but the liver turning the delta 9 into delta 11 when consuming edibles is the real alchemical holy grail of buzz potency and i personally think it would be best to avoid the alternatives to the real deal delta 9 unless you are consuming the substance for some medically relevant reason beyond recreational inebriation, at least until we get full legalization and studies conducted on side effects and variables pertaining to light or heavy consumption.
Lol right?! My 70yo mother uses a cbd cream she gets from a doctors office to help with pain. I personally use a magnesium cream when I have sore muscles, and both of us have Icy Hot with lidocaine. Like, that’s what cbd is on par with, not meth lol.
Impossible to separate? Spectroscopy doesnt tell the difference? think most custom facilities have these hand hell spectroscopy devices to detect drugs.
