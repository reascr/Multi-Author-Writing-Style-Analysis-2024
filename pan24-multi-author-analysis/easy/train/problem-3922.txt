In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yeah. It isn't a solution targeting a specific problem with firearms. It is purely about erecting a barrier to firearms ownership in general.

Training/licensing requirements reduce accidents. As I have linked on this page you would be targeting .1% of injury related deaths. That is 400-500 accidental deaths a year out of a population of 320 million people. You would be targeting background noise.
So when my state legalized it recreationally, it produced this very weird state that existed for about two years, it was legal to have and to consume, however their was no legal way to purchase it, the licensing system for dispensaries had been established the same time that legalization happened, so there was no legal place to buy it in my state, buying it out of state or through the mail violated federal laws, there was no guidance to handle what to do with evidence maintaining in new dui trials, and there were a lot of weird loop holes with again no guidance on how to handle.
I am sure there is. But also just because something is presented as a middle of the road solution doesn't mean it is effective or acceptable policy. For example the previously mentioned flaws with the training mandates and assault weapons bans.
