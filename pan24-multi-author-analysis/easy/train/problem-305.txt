Literally every tech company in past 2 years. Record profits = layoffs when they start seeing slowed growth. Shareholders and investors cheer for it and stock usually goes up on the announcement. It's fucking stupid that a company like msft or Salesforce can have record breaking profits and then lay off 10% of their staff anyway. This time around they are not even considering seniority as a positive so ppl that have worked their whole career or majority of career at a company are bring thrown out like garbage even after showing loyalty to company for years. It's all horseshit imo. Fuck corporate America.
Sort of. We’re not powerless, and I don’t even mean from a protesting perspective (though strikes help). I guarantee you that right now there are people in your community working to prepare for a much more difficult future while trying to protect what we still have. It’s little stuff that doesn’t make it to Reddit or even local news sources. Things like hydroelectric, smart grid water systems that both conserve water and power themselves with clean energy. New carbon capture programs that convert captured emmissions into useable fuels like methanol. We just dumped an immense amount of funding into projects like this. We’re not giving up.
