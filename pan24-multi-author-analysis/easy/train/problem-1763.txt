True. Announcements like this have the opposite effect than intended. Far from intimidating NATO, it will just further reinforce Western nations to support Ukraine and push for Russian regime change because - if Ukraine loses - NATO will eventually fight Russia directly.
Spot on. I remember back in my military days when Crimea was taken over. Everything came to pass in 2022 that we predicted back then, except the level of corruption. Where they attacked from, what they tried to do, etc. all occurred. What we didn't know was how bad their info was, how bad their training was, and just how far they let their own military rot. We over estimated them by a mile.
Because the Ukrainians just rolled over in 2014 because they weren’t ready or didn’t have the will to fight then which is why a lot of countries including Russia believed they would roll over again in 2022 which is why many Russian soldiers were told to take their dress uniforms for march’s in Kyiv and why they attacked airports near Kyiv for a decapitation strike early on which failed spectacularly when the Ukrainians counterattacked.
I am a huge scifi nerd. The books always portray Russia as a strong power in the future. What a 180. I'm still having a hard time believing russia is so poorly equipped and trained.to even be considered a global threat. I wouldn't be surprised if he sold half his nukes and the other half don't work.
