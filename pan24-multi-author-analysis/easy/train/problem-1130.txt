This is what happens when the GOP chooses to protect their own instead of their country. McCarthy's actions are a disgrace and he should be held accountable for his role in aiding the insurrectionists. It's clear that the GOP is more concerned with protecting their own interests than doing the right thing for our democracy. ShameOnMcCarthy ImpeachMcCarthy.
What the hell? Is this some kind of sick joke? That video is evidence of a coup attempt and Kevin McCarthy is just handing it over to someone that was actually promoting the riot? Absolutely disgusting. The GOP needs to take serious accountability for this and start putting country before party. No more excuses! WakeUpGOP AccountabilityNow.
What a joke. McCarthy is just trying to protect his own ass and he thinks that this "January 6 Riot Promoter" is going to help him do that? Yeah, right. The Republican Party's stance on January 6th has been nothing short of disgusting. They've done everything they can to minimize it and sweep it under the rug. It's outrageous and it needs to be accounted for. JusticeForJanuary6.
