â€œThey seed misinformation, they seed doubt, they have everybody questioning the legitimacy of a presidential candidate, be it President Trump or potentially President Clinton," Hill said.".

Yeah, really the bar is not that high. Treat anyone like a valued worker. Pay them middle class salary, whatever benefits, suitable vacation. They're not going to become a double agent/spy.

McGonigal didn't lead the investigation. Nobody that knows what they are talking about claims that he did. I went into some details , if you are interested.
