Another situation is the idea that you could "sell" your vote. Bring your mail in ballot to a third party, fill it out they way they want you to, show them your completed ballot, sign it, and then allow them to mail it or drop it off (so you can't change it after the fact).
Your ballot arrives in the mail, your abuser demands you vote a specific way (or maybe fills the ballot out for you) gets you to sign it under threat of further abuse and then puts it in the mail.
With mail in voting itâ€™s hypothetically possible that a domestic abuser could verify their victim voted the way they wanted or your boss could verify how you voted in exchange for a bonus.
If you voted in person, you would be allowed to vote without your abuser in the booth with you and they wouldn't be able to verify who you pulled the lever for (at least that is my understanding of the situation as I've never voted in person before).
A storm is coming? What the storm of right wing nut jobs continuing to be crazy and lose elections? What are you going to try and kidnap a gov again? Storm the us capital again? You will lose again and again.
