It didn't work for stealing the election so were changing our minds. Mules? Shut up idiot do you not understand words, we're done with that. You look confused. Why. Don't you have an R next to your name? That's right you do, so you shut the fuck up and do what we say like a the dog you are. See that trail of shit from where you dragged your shitty ass across the carpet for us for the past 6 years doggy? We changed our minds. Lick it back up dog. Did we stutter? We told you to lick the shit back up dog. Now. Yeah doggy likes licking shit doesn't it? What a good doggy.

You know what guys? Maybe a wider window to voting and increasing accessibility means we may get more votes. Like how if it rains on election day and our voters don't show up.
