I'd rather have a constitutional monarchy with a powerless King any day of the week over a fixed Presidential two-party system with little to no checks and balances and mostly unfettered executive powers. After watching the incompetence that was Donald Trump remain in office for four years, believe me, the rest of us are the ones laughing. Constitutional monarchies have stood the test of time much longer. You know when you hear about governments being taken down over no confidence and elections being held? That's a good thing, that's democracy at work. When was the last time your government went down and was re-elected after going completely stupid? Never? Oh okay.
Eventually drones might be capable of defeating an air-superiority fighter. But at this stage, humans remain firmly in that role.
