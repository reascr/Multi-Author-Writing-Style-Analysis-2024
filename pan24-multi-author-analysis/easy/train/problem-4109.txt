Logistics. There’s a limit to what Ukraine can handle. NATO can give hundreds of MLRS systems but they’ll be useless if there are no rockets. Many Western systems are also very different than the Soviet era systems that Ukraine is used to. It takes time to learn those…especially combined arms.
Russia politically and militarily has a major aversion to being seen as being "on the defence" against a (sarcasm) "inferior/illegitimate opponent".
2. We don't know who's behind the attack, despite nebulous claims by Russian and Iranian state media it's "from a NATO or NATO-Linked Country". Please remember Russia/Iran don't have free media like western countries and that their state media is pure propaganda. Yes, it's at the direction of the state. But anyone that follows Julia Davis knows Russian state media =/= state policy. If it was, the world would of been nuked a hundred times over. Current speculation is it could be Israel, Azerbaijan, or even from the ongoing domestic protests/revolution.
No. Won’t be for quite awhile. We’ll almost assuredly see Leopards before Abrams. AFU is training on the new armor now, including the Bradleys. Best guess is around March for the Leos and Brads. Abrams, probably not until summer or fall.
