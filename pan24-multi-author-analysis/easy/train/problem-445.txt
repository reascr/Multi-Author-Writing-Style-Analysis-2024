"Hey Russia, could you please use your vastly superior intellect to help us repair our rocket systems? They keep doing that thing where they hit enemy bases accurately. We've tried to fix it but unfortunately our engineers aren't as smart and haven't done it as well as you have." Sips drink.
The US would be happy to engage in world peace talks with Russia as soon as Russia exits all land seized from Ukraine including Crimea, pays reparations to those who lost loved ones due to Russia's illegal war, pays to rebuild Ukraine, signs a binding treaty to never invade or molest Ukraine again, dismantles their nuclear arsenal as they have proven irresponsible in the maintenance and possession of such weapons of mass destruction, and lastly turns Vladimir Putin over to The Hague for trial and execution. Until that time, Russia can fk right off.
Exactly. The whole concept of Ukraine being “a war with the west against Russia” is Russian political messaging to.
It’s pretty clear who in the west is sympathetic towards Russia based on how they view the conflict.
Oh absolutely. I’m guessing he got a phone call suggesting it would be viewed favorably if he were to make certain statement, and take certain positions.
