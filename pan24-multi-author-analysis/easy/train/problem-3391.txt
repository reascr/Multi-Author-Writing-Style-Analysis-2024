Clinton made something of a name for himself as governor. It's also forgotten how many democrats sat out from 1992 since they were reluctant after 12 years of Republicans and didn't want to stick their necks out. If a more prominent Dem chose to run, they may have gotten the nomination. And that would be fine with me.
If you're wondering how they mean, "easier for someone like Bernie Sanders to run", the argument is that by moving moderate SC to the forefront of the Democratic primary calendar, it would make it easier for a candidate who wanted to run in order to have a national conversation (about whatever) to run in NH without damaging an incumbent or another frontrunner like Biden.
There you go again. That’s a nice gun you have there at my head. This is a false dichotomy. You’re going to see a lot of positions similar to mine coming from the left in the 2024 general election.
