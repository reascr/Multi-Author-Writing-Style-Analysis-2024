I don't know about that. MA has better education and healthcare, a wider variety of high paying jobs, more consistently blue voters (I'm gay, and have not quite gotten over Prop8), safer streets, and yes public transportation. I've worked for companies in both states, and while it definitely varies by company, I'd say that the CA companies pay slightly more but the work-life balance and health insurance coverage for the MA companies are better. There is definitely a more pragmatic vibe in northeastern companies.

Hahaha yeah seriously. Don't get me wrong, I have respect for the west coast, but I'm from Massachusetts and the things they pride themselves on, we tend to just....do better at? We're not loud about it, it's not a competition, but if I moved to CA I'd be gaining some beaches and giving up a lot.
Functioning. Like as in California so far and debate, running businesses off, and now "green" by 2025 making the surrounding states richer functioning?
