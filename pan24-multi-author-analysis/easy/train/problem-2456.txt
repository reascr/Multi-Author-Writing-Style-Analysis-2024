This midterms, Republicans outspent Democrats by over $1 Billion, and these Republican donors were expecting an even greater conversation rate in comparison to the 2018 midterms. The total spending on the Republican party is $4.8 Billion, the highest in history - eclipsing the amount spent on 2018 by nearly $2 Billion. They were expecting a 'red tsunami'. After all, last time in 2018 Democrats outspent Republicans by $500M and gained 41 seats, so this time Republicans outspending Democrats by more that double should easily flip the same number of seats, right?
During Trump's 2018 midterm elections, Democrats outspent Republicans by almost $500 Million - and the end result was Democrats gaining 41 House seats and 7 Governors. This was a very typical 'blue wave', even though Republicans still had Senate majority. At that time this was the most ever spent on a midterm election.
Absolutely! Democrats need to so something differently. It should have been much more of a blow out what with Republicans are doing with women's reproductive health and how they openly state they are going after Medicare, Social Security, and LGBTQ rights next.
Exactly. Republicans actively support positions that destabilize the United States by any measure of progress or efficiency. They donâ€™t care about results, they care about power (for themselves, for their rich donors).
