Dude is broke. I am not saying poor. Heck he probably could still buy and sell me 20 times over. I a, saying he is like Kanye, he has no liquid money. He was hoping that Twitter would be profitable enough to float cash flow. But he found it was a ruse. Now he has a choice of selling more Tesla stock or giving up more ownership in spacex or starlink. Not something he is too keen on. So the easy answer is to not pay your bills.
He's singlehandedly dismantling the closest thing there's been to a centralized platform for people to organize unionization efforts, monitor billionaire movements, speak directly to public figures, etc.
Cool. But the reason all those people were on staff is so complex. Frankly, elon has proved himself to be kinda a simpleton in terms of his actual understanding of business. Those employees might seem extraneous. But then since that's happened Twitter has had a MAJOR data breach, they've had issues like the one in this thread, they've had internal complaints and frustrations. They had a scandle where they had to ask employees to bring their own toilet paper to work?? This is all disastrous for a billion + dollar company.
