The government does not prohibit anyone's ability to worship as they believe with a few notable exceptions. However, it has an absolute interest in protecting the right of a citizens to be able to participate in society equally. If your religion tells you homosexuality is immoral and sinful, you are free to believe that. You should not be able to use that belief to deny others their ability to access government services, get married, and enjoy legal protection against discrimination.
Interesting. Where did "in god we trust" and all of our other religious based ideology get implemented then? Also, what is the reason that freedom of religion made its way into the first amendment? I have no stance (or religion) here, just curious about this.
Exactly. They’re going to have a hell of time making it so something like an architectural firm can’t legally discriminate against black people or Jewish people. Or maybe that’s what they want and they’ll overturn some civil rights legislation as unconstitutional.
