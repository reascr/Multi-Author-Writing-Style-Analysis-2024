Their way of survival is ruling and they need an obedient herd that aliegnates with their values to believe they are doing the best job, which sometimes is a lie. When these lies catch up in form of poverty and misrepresentation, people have problems to believe that the nationalist propaganda made by their own information buble makes them poor, so paranoia starts to grow. They start to believe minorities and non-nationalist groups are sabotaging them. People see this and instead of standing up against the true problems they focus on hate and vote for extremists. Gov has to tolerate it because they built it. Its a fine line until a disaster happens.
I think an organisation based on an ideology that wants to exterminate "lesser people's" and is authoritarian by nature should absolutely be banned if you want to preserve democracy, their fascist positions and violent beliefs are the antithesis to the values of a modern democracy. There needs to be safeguards. Seems some of you haven't learnt the lessons of the 20th century/WW2. Get a grip.
