It wouldn't take much to deny him the position. McCarthy is promising everything to get the votes from extremist, it's not unreasonable that if the dems have a unified front, they can convince a some republicans to vote for someone else if they are promised something of worth. Basically selling a vote for some politicians agenda.
Exactly. For all their talk of not voting for him, I'm guessing that when it's time to vote, every Republican will fall in line behind him. Fingers crossed for chaos but I'm not betting on it.

Interesting thought. Fellow Mass citizen here. If the Democratic Party could not get enough moderate / precarious seat holding Republicans to support Hakeem Jeffries, then maybe they would throw their support behind Baker. I would certainly sleep easier with him as speaker of the house. He would focus on the real issues confronting all Americans and try to build consensus.
