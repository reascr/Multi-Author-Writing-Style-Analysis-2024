The carrier was slated to sail through the Taiwanese Strait, but delayed doing so because the one exercise was directly in the middle of it, and should any missile go off course, there would be the very real possibility it hits the carrier...
Great. Now you too can not use them for fear of wiping out humanity. You are now part of the most expensive and wasteful club in the world, with the likes of the US, Russia and NK. Congratulations.
We can't write checks we can't cash. They know were not going nuclear. Anyway in case you didn't know, it's public knowledge that Israel has over 100 nukes buried in the Negev desert. They can help but give the Iranian people a chance. The average Iranian is not a terrorist. The woman are already reveling and religious leaders there are getting their turbine knocked off as a sign of discontent. They reveled and got ayatollahs and now many want to do away with that. Nukes can not be used. It will be the end of us all. Conventional means must be adhered to. See ya.
