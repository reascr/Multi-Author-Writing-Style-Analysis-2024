Lastly, Putin doesn't have a big red button at his desk to fire missles. At worst, an over ambitious general has to go through a huge series of bureaucratic channels to get approval to go through subordinate channels to actually follow through, and if Putin gives the order it has to go through a series of people, each one with less access to a nuclear bunker and full knowledge of the implication. One of the reasons nuclear weapons are so reactionary as weapons is because most people aren't psychotic enough to fire them in a first strike; reactionary policies at least have the benefit of just cause and even under these conditions history shows that soldiers have great difficulty actually firing the missiles.
I could see it. Ukraine pushed back the initial gains in the north completely and some in the west and south and then stalled them out and that was before even getting much from allies. Russia has spent its best stuff and is on fumes while ukraine is getting the good shit going now. I could see it.
