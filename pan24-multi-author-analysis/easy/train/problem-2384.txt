Significant fuel supply comes from Russia, building costs are high, build time is long, decommissioning is expensive, dealing with waste is problematic, weapons proliferation is a concern, accidents are very concerning to the public and insurance companies.
Jesus. I want to just slap the faces of every foot-dragging fucker that holds this kind of thing back. I want to slap them until they're raw. We have obvious paths to a better future and they're such shortsighted, evil fucks they wouldn't do it until forced. Fuck them.
Kazakhstan is by far the world's largest exporter of uranium for nuclear power, and in fact major western nations like the USA are completely dependent on Kazakhstan-produced uranium for their domestic nuclear power industry. Kazakhstan is one of the countries on Putin's "needs to be acquired" list as part of his attempt to rebuild the USSR in his own image, so making the west even more dependent on nuclear power fueled by a target of Russia is foolish. This just exchanges uranium for natural gas as a big lever for Putin to use against the west.
