Problem with this line of thinking is (even though I agree with you wholeheartedly), it makes one sound like a crazy conspiracy theorist if it’s explained to someone who doesn’t already agree. Conservatives have (as with many other things) destroyed the meaning of “conspiracy” and poisoned it purposefully so that anything they have done for decades like this seems to be a wild far-fetched concept and the more you try to point it out with details/evidence, the more you sound like a raving lunatic. Trust me, I’ve tried to explain this very concept to many conservatives including my own family. They just look at me like I’m insane for thinking there’s been a purposeful effort to keep people stupid and religious.

Absolutely. My daughter is pursuing her masters degree at a Catholic university despite being atheist. It’s a great school providing her with a top notch education.
