Her poll numbers in Arizona are abysmal among Democrats who mostly seem to hate her there, and even among all votes she is underwater and well below a majority or even plurality of support. If she ran as an Independent spoiler she might peel away some Independents, but most Republicans wouldn't vote for her (they prefer genuinely racist MAGA types who aren't bisexual) and Democrats would overwhelmingly vote for the Dem Senate candidate from their primaries. It's possible she would even split the GOP vote more than the Dem one. LOL.
Her gambit isn't to actually win a 3-way race (she can't, she knows it), it's to create a situation where a 3-way race is guaranteed to go to the Republican, so the Democrats have to choose between running someone and letting the Republicans have the seat, or not running someone and hoping that Sinema beats the Republican and is marginally less bad than the Republican.
4. She personally knows that she doesn't have a place in this Republican Party. I mean, seriously.... look at it. Ideologically, she's simply not a Republican. Just a corporate Democrat. They exist. Some care to hide it more than others.
