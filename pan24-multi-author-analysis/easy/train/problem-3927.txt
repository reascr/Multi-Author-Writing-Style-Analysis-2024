“Ey, look here. I’m gunnu buy some missiles, but I’m not gunnu use ‘em, okay? Sorry, mate, it’s for me other mate.”.
I have noticed it on numerous topics, from the London Olympic Committee warning Britons to refer to Americans as "Canadians" to avoid offending Canadians, to reminding Americans that Canada kicked their ass during the War of 1812, to believing that Canada created Thanksgiving (it was originally an English Medieval holiday, and Canada most likely borrowed it from early settlers from the US).
Range. NASAMs are a medium range air defense system, Patriot is a long range air defense system. Patriot also has better capability against tactical ballistic missiles, but the range and capability comes at the cost of...well, cost. Patriot missiles are expensive, and NASAM batteries fire ground-launched versions of the AIM-120 which is much cheaper, but still very capable within its range. Both are good against aircraft, but NASAM is a better option against cruise missiles/kamikaze drones because of the lower cost per missile. Air defense systems are about layering, so you want long range(Patriot, S-300), medium range(NASAM, Buk), and short range/point defense systems(Stinger, SA-7, Gepard, C-RAM, etc.) all linked and overlapping.
Definitely. The more NASMS and other systems they have the more area they can cover to protect. The more coverage, the more they can do like have electricity, water, and heating. Weapons production would be a good thing to protect as well for a belligerent. Eventially, this makes Muscovy impotent in their war criminal ways.
