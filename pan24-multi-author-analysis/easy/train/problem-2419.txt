I never said we can't criticize, but we have to be aware that we too are installing dictators. For example Iraq is one of the most corrupt countries in the world despite being under US control, as was Afghanistan. If we can't even deal with corruption under our own watch then we create the conditions for a change of power in favour of our strategic rivals. It's easy to convince people to turn against us if we are providing them a raw deal.
Hahahahaha thanks for the entertainment. You turned out not to be a clown, but the whole fucking circus in fact. As I had guessed, you've never served in the Legion.... or anywhere else for that matter. Probably never even seen a rifle in your life. Have a good week, sir.
There is a reason why France rejoined NATO in 2009: they needed fucking help from the US AFRICOM in conduction counterinsurgency in Africa, as the US had completely turned over the status quo in 2003's invasion of Iraq (France began realignment process in 2004) and stirred up every muhajideen organization on Earth -the world expected Afghanistan to get occupied because of 9/11, Iraq was a fucking overreach my generation of Soldiers bled for. Since the 60s, the frogs were prepared to sit out WWIII by offering terms to the USSR if they pushed into Western Germany. Up to the eve of the Russian Invasion, France's outlook has been to bring Putin into the fold to serve as a bulwark for a Cold War 2 detente between the US and China.
