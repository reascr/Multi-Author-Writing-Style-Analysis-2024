So, the idea is that “look - we’ve spanked you out of Kharkiv, we’ve chased you of Kherson, you’re making no progress with your suicide runs at Bakhmut, and we’re knocking on the door of Sieverdonetsk. You can give up now and withdraw to the original borders, or we will keep slaughtering your soldiers and the West guts your economy. Your choice”.
The alternative for Russia is endless further bloodshed (which they don't care too much about), losing the rest of the fighting capability of the military (which they might care about a bit), and ultimately likely losing Crimea if Western support continues.
The alternative for Ukraine is endless further bloodshed and infrastructure destruction, getting back completely razed cities, and maybe an ethnically cleansed Crimea, assuming Western support holds.
B.S. ruzzian propaganda is putting our “feelers” to see what the reaction might be. This is intended to make Citizens in Ukraine and the West question their commitment to the cause. The problem that exists for ruzzia is through its actions it had proven to the world that it cannot be trusted. Ruzzia wants to buy time, rebuild the military and try invading again.
