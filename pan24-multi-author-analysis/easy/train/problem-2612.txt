honestly... christian doctrine makes it clear that murder is the only in the ten commandments that can be committed with inaction- that's what made the parable of the good samaritan so offensive to certain legalistic parties- in the story, the priest and the rich merchant person ("upstanding members of the community") were murders for not helping the victim where the scummy samaritan wasn't. (to put it into a more modern perspective, the samaritan would be a trans woman, as far as the stereotypes the audience holds.).
Besides acknowledging it as dangerous, not lying about it, not suggesting injecting bleach and other bullshit, promoting listening to actual doctors, not playing games with ppe procurement and distribution but rather ensuring things are in fact distributed regardless of political party...
What did I want?? Suggest masks and staying home. Not mandate them. Certainly not to shut down every small business in every small town. There's not enough "shut down" in the world to keep illness from spreading. Most of the people I know got it and recovered fine. But I know some people that died from it too. It's sad. But again.... What would you guys wish Trump would've done???? China style lock downs??? Take a test to buy bread?? You can't stop covid until people build herd immunity, and all the half assed measures we've had for 2 years have done nothing but destroy the economy.
