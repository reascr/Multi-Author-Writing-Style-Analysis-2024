U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, who previously blocked other portions of the law in a separate case, quoted the opening sentence of George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” as he issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law’s higher education provisions and pushed back on the state’s arguments.
I went to UF. If the student body and faculty are anything like it was when I went there, hard right religious loonies are going to have a hard time. I hope they give these nut jobs hell.
“‘It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen,’ and the powers in charge of Florida’s public university system have declared the State has unfettered authority to muzzle its professors in the name of ‘freedom,’” Walker wrote.
It gets worse. And this is so weird it sounds like it’s out of a movie… a secret group received 3 million in tax payer dollars to set up an “academic center” on campus to teach “civics courses.” No one in the Florida state legislature could tell you who they are and what they intend to do (yet they gave the group money). Even administrators on campus don’t know them. The only thing we know is that the person heading it has a long history of working with religious right-wing groups.
