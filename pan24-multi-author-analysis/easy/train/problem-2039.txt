And also in fairness to Germany, the Russian leader they were negotiating with probably did not realize himself how badly this war would fuck Russia's economy either. Putin seemed to truly believe he would sweep over Ukraine with only short-term economic consequences. It's obvious at this point that he never thought his army would be getting bogged down in an attritional war of annihilation and that Russia would be dealing with epic, unprecedented Western sanctions for an entire year straight at the same time. If he'd known this would be the outcome, he probably wouldn't have invaded.
Remember late-September to early-October? When people were saying that having those hordes of untrained, unmotivated, underequipped mobiks on the front line will only increase the russian casualties?
Seconded. At first I thought his arm was bent weird when he first spins and lays down, but he moves it normally again when he turns over. He was probably throwing a tantrum knowing death was coming.
Precisely. You are not being 'more reasonable' by hand-waving away the General Staff figures under lazy assumptions based on some past wars without satellite/drone coverage capabilities.
