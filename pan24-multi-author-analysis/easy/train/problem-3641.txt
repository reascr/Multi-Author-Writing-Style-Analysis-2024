I was primarily suggesting it for goods imported to the US. Of course, a lot of this would be goods made for US companies by contract manufacturers. But, I suppose the federal government could use their power to regulate interstate commerce to charge taxes on domestically produced goods. If you want to, for example, build office furniture using prison labor in Alabama, you'd face the same low score and high rate charges when trying to ship that to New York distributors, no different than a clothing manufacturer in China using Uighar labor camps to assemble "fast fashion" clothes.
Russia is pretty much their only hope. What the US should have done years ago and been consistent on is breaking down the embargoes. They are silly to have kept them around for so long and does nothing but allow other nations to gain influence. Another example of this is Venezuela. We don't have to like their government, but if we are not making trade deals with them, someone else is. And better, we can make better trade deals so they are more likely to choose us in an "us vs them scenario.".
