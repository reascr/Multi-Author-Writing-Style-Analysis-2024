You're overlooking that there's a bit of nuance in the Republican party right now, and your idea that Republicans care about nothing other than the pursuit of power is a fine assumption to make when you're talking about Republicans like Ted Cruz, but it misses the fact that we have Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and Republicans who sat on the Jan 6 committee (although even then some of those Republicans signal that they still mainly care about power). But one thing a lot of those Republicans share in common is that they aren't/weren't seeking reelection. Geoff Duncan is not seeking reelection. I think it's reasonable to assume that he might just be a Republican who hates all the wackos who have taken control of their party and doesn't have to hold his tongue anymore to stay in power since his political career might be over why should he care about staying in power. (His career might not be over if Republicans can pivot away from Trumpism, but I personally doubt that will happen soon tbh).
