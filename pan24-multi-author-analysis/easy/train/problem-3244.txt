Are you not up to date on the “insurrection”? That there was no evidence that Trump created anything. He was not convicted of anything because there was no reasonable proof. How are democrats and republicans still jerking off to Jan 6th? If you actually look at all the non mainstream media video, Jan 6 was more peaceful than 95% of all the BLM riots. I’m so over democrats and republicans man. The US Government wants to tear us apart and hide all evidence and use our taxes to fund the whole democrats vs republicans. Wake up - it’s time for school.
The reason we hardly have a middle class is because of half a century of dramatic tax cuts to corporations and wealthy individuals, explosive executive income growth, weak to flat middle-class income growth, cuts and weakening of the social safety net, deregulation of companies and banks, effective anti-union legislation, and so many other reasons.
Same here. And I all my close friends have stories of life time friends who won’t speak to them anymore. It really is sad.
