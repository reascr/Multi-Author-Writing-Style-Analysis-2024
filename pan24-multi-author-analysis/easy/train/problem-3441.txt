He is, yes. But the point the person you were replying to was making was that Sanders is further to the left than the Democrats tend to be, and caucuses with the Democrats because they're the closest thing to his ideology--not because they fit his ideology. He could try to do a 3rd party thing and split the vote, but that would mean that the party least-aligned with his ideals would win, so he's choosing to back the party that will at least take baby steps toward his goals (as potential 3rd party candidates in first-past-the-post electoral systems are supposed to do).
All health care Must be free. It’s so shitty now and the costs are too high, they ain’t taking care of people anymore…. People dying over greed, you gotta be kidding me…this world is trying so hard to kill us you think humans would have banded together by now to fight back and survive…politicians are scum, especially those who make you think they are on your side like Bernie Sanders. He’s the Jon Stewart of news. A feel good distraction that ultimately does no good for society. HEALTH CARE MUST BE FREE.
