Europe used to be able to do this as late as 2014. They taught the US how to do it with US domestic cotton supply. What happened since?
Germany has been an extremly dissapointing situation. And their people don't seem to really give a fuck.
You are in dire need to read (as in actual books) if you think it's in Europe that farmers are constantly on the brink of bankruptcy, most of food is directly or indirectly dependent on a single agricultural product - corn - already draught prone areas are seeing their water tables depleted by intensive farming of stuff like almonds and agricultural food production is massivelly reliant on the kind of fertilizers made from oil.
You subsidise? That’ll take longer than you’d probably think & realistically the US can’t fund & supply every military. There has to be a line in the sand, somewhere.
In Europe farmers are actually paid from the single biggest budget slice of the EU, CAP, to "care for the land" which is kinda bullshit as excuses go but they're hardly left to starve impeded by "horrible rules" such as the ones that don't let them use pesticides that kill bees (you know, those small insects essential in polinating various crops).
Like what we're they thinking? Did they just convince themselves that Russia wouldn't take advantage of the situation? Despite historical evidence and allies warning. Like God damn Germany needs to pull its shit together and contribute to the alliance.
