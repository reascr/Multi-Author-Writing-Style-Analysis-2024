Biden inherited a pandemic in which nearly half of people had been talked into thinking it's all fake by Trump and conservatives and that doing anything to stop the spread is "fascism". He inherited a coup attempt. He inherited the withdrawal from our longest war ever, where Trump had already recalled almost all of our forces yet left all the work, guaranteeing a nasty withdrawal - while illegally blocking Biden from even receiving the intel during the transition. And set the final withdrawal date for days after Biden's inauguration. And on top of that he ousted all the top brass from the military and installed loyalists who turned around and lied to Biden about the situation. Biden also inherited an economy where Trump had just printed a staggering amount of money, essentially bankrupting us just like one of his businesses, without any sort of plan for the inflation economists all said was coming. And he inherited supply lines that were completely broken because the Trump admin was doing absolutely nothing other than trying to convince everyone that the election was "rigged".
That’s great! I believe what I see and hear. All the RR fiasco communicated to me is that when the fight for workers rights is difficult, he’ll quickly bow out and give corporations what they want. I believe that because it is exactly what happened.
