>automatic voter registration, create a permanent mail ballot list, allow for pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds, require voting materials be distributed in multiple languages, and restore voting rights to felons on probation or parole.

And that we all love. It is the best way of keeping a person like Trump from ever getting a hand in polaticks. Oh yes he studied and listened to the right wing talk shows. for 2 years before he would run for president. So he had a big head start on the rest. He knew that white Americans mostly men and some women that thought they were saving babies. Oh he hammered away at immigration, a easy issue, oh he hammered away at crime, another easy issue. He knew if he had hammered away at the blue states he would get the votes to win. He did and we all payed a heavy price. We will be paying that price for many years.
In ND, republicans effectively disenfranchised native american voters. They required that voter ID have standard residential addresses. Native americans that used PO Boxes were unable to vote.
