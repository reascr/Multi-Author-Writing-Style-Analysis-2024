Corruption is my first suspect, but it can also be a general logistical breakdown that somehow can't be fixed for the moment. If that's the case the tenor of Ukrainian arms requests fits well with the idea that they want a force large and mobile enough to one-punch these goons straight out of the war, as soon as possible. I hope they can do it.
Grisha (or “GrishaPutin”) joined up for the youth army/cadet police training program (unsure of the proper nomenclature) and kept his socials occasionally updated with various “Z” and training photos, but after a while returned to his old posting schedules saying he’d failed to meet the physical requirements, but still wanted to pursue service to his country in another way.
That sounds about right. Even when you are looking at hyper-realistic wargames, not just the consumer kind but the ones professional militaries organize themselves, it still feels like there's only so much they can capture. And even full-on annual exercises with troops and equipment in the field, it's still not going to be like the real thing. All you can do is hope it gives a little more of an edge.
