That’s what they’ve done every year for the number of flu cases. They know most people are going to tough it out at home without going to the doctor, so they can’t rely on the reported number of cases. They take millions of blood samples from around the country and test them for the virus, then use that data to extrapolate to a range for the rest of the country. If researchers need to use the total number of COVID cases for their research, you can bet that they are going to use an estimate that accounts for the unreported cases, or they simply aren’t doing their job right.
Yeaaa. China was so hell bent on their zero COVID strategy all the way til last month, that the COVID strain there never got to mutate to a weaker form like Omicron. Now that they suddenly stopped with the lockdown without an exit strategy, cases are showing up with symptoms from the initial first wave. Plus China insist on using domestically produced, inactive virus vaccine, which only worked on that one specific strain; cuz China numba one, China doesn't need help...
Really? That's weird. Everybody on street is wearing masks. I don't think people have any problems with masks other than it's uncomfortable to wear for too long.
