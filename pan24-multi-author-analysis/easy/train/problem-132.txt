I don't disagree but the levels of equivalency being thrown out by the media don't make any sense. I'm not saying "what about Trump." I'm saying both are bad but it's asinine to compare them when the situations are fundamentally different. The GQP wants to point to this and say "see, same thing and now Biden is going to get away with it." If he broke laws then he shouldn't get away with anything but the two cases aren't the fucking same and the media shouldn't concede that point by default in the name of some "unbiased" pipe dream when talking about them. It's not bias to frame similar but not the same situations differently but a lot of people in the media don't seem willing/able/some combination of both to make the distinction and that's what I'm reacting to. Biden shouldn't "get away" with anything. But if you set up the narrative to be these are somehow analogous then when inevitably his punishment is less than Trump's all you've done is proven (in their minds) Republicans' point that Biden is somehow immune from prosecution when he does the "same" things as Trump. Kind of rant there, I apologize for the wall of text.
