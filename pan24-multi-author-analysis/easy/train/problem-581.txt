That arrangement, by the way is: Ukraine gets all of Ukraine, including Crimea, plus can form whatever security pact they want with any other party for their defence. And Russia can have Russia. Or what's left of it.
The western military industrial complex is all making money off of this, They don’t want peace Boris Johnson going to Zelenski telling him not to make a peace deal was proof of it, if more countries throw themselves into this pointless clusterfuck it’s going to be world war 3 and y’all are going to be cheering as millions die over a strip of Russian speaking land on the opposite side of the planet, this is Ukraines fight, not NATOs, Not the UN’s, not the west’s and certainly not mine.
1. If the MIC is making money, more power to them. It's not illegal to make money. I find it ironic that you guys keep telling us that we are going to run out of weapons before the Russians, that Ukraine is sending us broke and on and on and in the next breath, that it's all a scheme to make some cash. Which is it? Can you not even write down your propaganda points beforehand so you can choose the ones that aren't blatantly contradictory?Oh - and if Raytheon making some money keeps you up at night, tell Putin to get out of Ukraine. No more weapons being made for Ukraine, problem solved.
