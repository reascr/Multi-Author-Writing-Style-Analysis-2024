Putin ever remind you of that annoying kid who isn’t happy with his piece of chocolate, he must have ALL the chocolate, including everyone else’s. And if he has to rip out your stomach to get it, it’s OK, it’s for your safety.
I can see it clearly now: whenever I talk to someone with a pro-Russian leaning, they have always somehow managed to randomly come across all the Russian talking points (NATO provoked them Nazi groups have been genociding in the southeast Zelenskyy is an actor, he's manipulating everyone and trying to drag us into the war Ukraine has been developing bioweapons/nukes Europe is only interested in resuming the grain trade to get theirs, barely any of it is going to poor nations USA is keeping the war going to sell weapons, etc.), but never the debunkings. Due to the preconceived notions that Russia is less bad than the West anyways, they take those claims at face value and never sufficiently scrutinize them.
Absolutely! Know how you keep them from ever thinking of doing similar shit in the future? Destroy their will to fight - wear them down on their front lines, and wear them down internally having to send their sons into a meat grinder for what purpose? Send a message that we are a unified alliance against tyranny and they won’t be meeting one nation but many behind them. One fault I have for past administrations, and I’m strongly against rushing into war/conflict, but on the other hand, you can’t give this lunatic and his sycophants so much leeway up front.
