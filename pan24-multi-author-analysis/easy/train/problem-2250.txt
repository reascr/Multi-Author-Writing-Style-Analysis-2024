That doesn't actually contradict anything they said. You're just saying military officers better in military matters than politicisns are at running the country. That can be true and still what they said about what the military leadership has to gain by war or talk of war would stand.
My opinion and guess on why this happens is that any influence military has on a nation comes from their fighting strenh and support from the populace. Both of these are usually increased during war compared to peace time.
To get promoted to flag officer ranks requires a ridiculous combination of credentials, "golden path" career experience, internal military politics, the right education (it's nearly impossible without a Master's degree, and being Academy alumni is a big plus), selection through board after board, an immaculate record (begrudgingly referred to as "zero defect" Navy, Army, etc), and all of the right checks in all of the right career blocks. Even people with all of that get passed over every year.
