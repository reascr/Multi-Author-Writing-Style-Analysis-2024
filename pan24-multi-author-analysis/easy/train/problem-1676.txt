Not to mention that nuclear is cleaner then most renewables and not that expensive over the lifetime of the plant. It's just the upfront costs that are big.
nice strawman.. the issue has been that russian oil can't be embargo'd because india keeps profiting off the situation(while ukrainians literally die) yes europe probably imports more but the issue was with the price and with international cooperation on the issue of sanctions. you refused to participate in cutting off russias money supply(oil is most of it)... and that literally is the reason this war is still going on. if india had signed on to that embargo russia would have been dead in the water. facts.
Well land acquisition is an issue in India but that is not necessarily due to lack of open land, there is a huge solar push in India along with a posh for other renewables like hydro, wind etc neuclear is also being pushed by the government for the same reason.
Is that a joke? Ukraine is literally ranked as one of the worst democracies in the world, far lower than India, and it is also one of the most corrupt countries in Europe. Even zelensky himself has been part of corruption scandals before the war, the only reason people have forgotten that is because they need a posterboy. It is far from the utopia you are portraying it to be.
