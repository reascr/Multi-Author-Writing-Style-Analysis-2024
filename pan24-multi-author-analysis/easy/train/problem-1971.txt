Precision Scheduled Railroading reduced the workforce by around 30%. They started running longer trains, and by doing so, reduced the number of trains on the railroad. Theoretically, that should reduce the number of crews needed, but longer trains equal more mechanical failures, more time spent in terminals, longer delay trying to get into terminals because of trains ahead, and just slower trains overall. Conductors and engineers are only allowed to work 12 hours before needing to get 10 hours of rest, so the railroads are burning though the crews faster than normal because they now have fewer crews. This leads to more fatigue and burnout. But with less man-power, the off time we apply for is regularly denied. Throw in a global pandemic and attrition, and the railroads canâ€™t hire fast enough to grow their work force back to a sustainable number of employees.
Interesting. I'm guessing that Democrat reasoning was that they don't have the strenh to get anything better through and that a strike would be political suicide for them right now.
