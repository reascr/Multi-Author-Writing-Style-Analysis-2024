They thought they could use it as extortion. I’m sensing the Dems anticipated the attempt and dgaf. House Repugnants don’t get a cookie this time. If they let the government shut down it’s all on them. No negotiations with terrorists.
The GOP tried to do all this stuff like 10 years ago. It didn’t work then and it won’t work now. For the democrats, giving in would be democracy breaking so they just won’t do it. The way to make changes in our democracy is to pass laws to do so. There is a process to go through to get a law passed in our democracy. That process is not for a small minority to say do what we want, or we will stop government from working, and try to force the party to go along with them. The reality is democrats won’t give up more than stuff for show because doing so would basically end our democracy. I don’t think the far right really gets this, but they are not going to give up easily this time. This is going to be messy.
