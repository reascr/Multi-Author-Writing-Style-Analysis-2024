It is legal to use for medical purposes with a script but it is still criminalised in NSW to grow it or to drive “under the influence” but there is no way to test the exposure too THC 2 hours ago vs the previous evening making it useful for anyone who drives.
Not really. You never see any opposing sides because well, you just answered that question with how one guy owns most of the media. So the only time you ever see differing views is at election outcomes. And here, if you don't win the centre, you will not win the election. Straight up. If you're pointing at how we had the LNP for 9 years, let me make it clear they did NOT win out of popularity. They didn't win as much as Labor absolutely shit the bed. They pissed away their mandate with infighting and leadership spills, and by the 2013 election we were just done with their bullshit. And then the candidate they put as leader for the next 2 elections was a guy involved in that mess, so he struggled to get support/Wasn't exactly an inspiring candidate in the first place. So 9 years of LNP because Labor just couldn't get their shit together for a while.
It’s not similar to the usual medications, in that the treatment is more akin to a small number of guided talking therapy sessions while under the influence of either MDMA or psilocybin, accompanied by multiple licensed therapists, alongside more traditional therapy sessions before and after, during which there’s no medication used.
