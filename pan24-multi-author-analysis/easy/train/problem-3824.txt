The "gap" was literally a Telegram message both Judge and Prosecuter where conspiring and agreeing on his judgment. It's pretty simple, they made a shit job, his judgment was nullified and the investigation returned to the entity responsible for investigating corruption. Now thanks to Bolsonaro that orgam had his budget and man power cut to hell !
Edit: and every anti-vaxxer I know has higher education, usually in healthcare - the danger of conspiracy ideologies is that they are designed to make people think that they concluded the crazy idea by themselves based on their own unique expertises, which is why someone can believe in insane crap and not care about the lack of general acceptance of it.
Yes. More importantly is the fact that Brazil's overall import to export ratio is 5 to 1, and the most important pf those imports are refined petroleum products and motor vehicles. The US is the largest refined petroleum exporter in the world, and one of the largest motor vehicle exporters as well. A couple tariffs or sanctions and suddenly Brazils economy is feeling intense pain.
