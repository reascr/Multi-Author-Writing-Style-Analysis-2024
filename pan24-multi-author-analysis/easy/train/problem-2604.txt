"They’re killing our dogs and people’s pets too,” said Sally Kadaoui, founder of SFT Animal Sanctuary, a non-profit that rescues and cares for the city’s homeless animals. “Some of them run off, shot and wounded. I found a dog shot in the leg who was suffering for days with a terrible wound. We had to amputate his leg. They’re trying to clear the streets of strays before FIFA’s February visit. Just today, they’ve killed over 25 of our dogs. These were lovely, friendly dogs who lived near the shops and cafes around the Corniche and everyone fed them. It’s devastating.”.
Is it right in your opinion? No, but you're just hurting yourself more. I wonder how they are killing 20K dogs/year if they don't hunt them? Let me guess. They send fliers and dogs will just show up, get arrested, and zap! At the end of the day, your's still wrong. Thanks for playing.
Hundreds of stray dogs are being brutally killed in Tangier in order to impress FIFA officials who are coming to assess Morocco’s World Cup bid this week, animal rights activists have told The Daily Beast.
Why the lies? Morocco is still trying to deal with their 3 millions straight dogs issues for years. People are getting bitten and dying for years, from bites or rabies, way before the FIFA bid. Why suddenly, it's because of the bid?
