It's nuanced. The KMT are definitely not fans of the CCP. In fact, anti-communism is part of their official party charter lol. That being said, they tend to think that Taiwan and mainland China are both "China" regardless of the actual governments involved; this actually theoretically matches the CCP viewpoint. Two generations later, this fundamental view trumps some of the more hard-line/hostile political attitudes that existed earlier in history in favor of a more conciliatory relationship with the PRC. KMT generally endorse what has traditionally been referred to as the "status quo", indefinitely deferring the sovereignty issue (note that this is also officially the same position the US takes), although they are definitely widely seen as the more China-friendly party. As an example, the DPP has worked to revise some school curricula to replace subjects like Chinese history/literature with more indigenous alternatives, while the KMT still sees Taiwan as firmly Chinese in identity, even if politically distinct. It's not completely dissimilar from North and South Korea in agreement that they are both Korean, and that in an ideal world, there would be one unified Korea, though there is obviously no way to agree how that would work politically.
??? What world do you live in? She and her administration is clear that Taiwan is not and has never been part of the PRC. She is clear that she does not support the "1992 Consensus" as it is now.
