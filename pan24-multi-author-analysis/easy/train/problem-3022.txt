Take a look whenever he appears on camera. That is not the look of a man who knows he needs to learn how to lie better. That is the look of a man who sincerely does not understand and is hurt over the question of why nobody believes a single word he says about anything. I'm not joking, or being hyperbolic, sarcastic, or even trying to insult the man when I say that he is in some serious need of psychiatric help. His criminal acts are likely to land him in jail where his lying is almost guaranteed to get him killed, or he's going to be removed from Congress and just end up continuing to lie about everything until something bad happens to him. His best option would be to resign from Congress voluntarily and check himself into a mental health facility. Doing so would also give him options that could be used when he's inevitably forced to defend himself in legal proceedings.
They also use sensationalizing-but-decidedly-neutral words to describe anything terrible Republicans do.
I think I’m starting to get this guy. Make pointless nonstop lies, then cash in on the negative publicity of “annoying liberals”. I’ve seen this trick before. This man could become President!
