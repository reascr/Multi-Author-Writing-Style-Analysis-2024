Not that I think any of this is funny. But I remember two Russian dudes giving head and then getting blown up by a UA UAV. Thereâ€™s no gay anything in Russia though. Or Iran. Or any of you tough machismo countries.
Zelensky should suggest politely that a non-democratic regime has absolutely nothing/nada to say about a dictatorship attacking without provocation a democratic state; unless of course, Xi grasps what freedom, hope, independence and rule of law mean to a democratic people, and announces he will pressure Putin to cease hostilities, cease all aid to Russia, and work with regional and other democracies to immediately institute democratic reforms, and dismantle his police state as the mainland Chinese people too deserve what the Ukrainians are so willing to die for.
Pretty sad too. I loved my students, they seemed really patriotic but in a good way. Like helping others and building community. Seemed to have very little hate and loved Western and Korean media/people. Major contrast to their parents and grandparents lol. I wonder what high school and college students are like now? Heck, I wonder what my former students are like now.
