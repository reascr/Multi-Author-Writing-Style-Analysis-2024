I wish I could be in the UK honestly there's too much wrong in this country. Someone said it well "Majority rule doesn't work in a mental institution" So I highly doubt the ANC will be out of power anytime soon plus corruption is basically advertised everywhere you go, Its too deep in the roots so cutting a few branches won't help anything. The people are easily manipulative especially the youth (my youth) as long as they get free money and beer than they will basically do anything. I get it every country has its problems but these are worse cause there was and is so much potential in this country but people only care about themselves not about the future of themselves or our country as a whole. And don't get me started on the crime rate and safety.
Cooperation with Russia while they are actively commiting large scale atrocities is both morally bad and will be remembered by any country that cares and since you lack reading comprehension and like to make bullshit assumptions, this doesn't automatically mean I support the atrocities commited by other countries and are not relevant to discussion.
