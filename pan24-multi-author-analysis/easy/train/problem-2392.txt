After Putin, Shoigu, and the rest get their share of the military budget to spend on yachts and mansions, the government pays a company (that bribed General Oligarchov into getting the contract and is probably connected to a number of shell companies of some sort) to make 10,000 tanks. They make 5,000 and pocket the rest of the contract payment, and probably cut some corners on the ones they do make to save a couple more bucks. Of those 5,000 tanks, 2,500 actually get delivered because the other half were sold off by the Colonel Kleptovskys before they reach their intended depots. Then those depots only have 1,250 tanks because the suppy officers, who are in a low-paying dead-end career at a tank depot in Siberia, sold off half of them because everyone above him is corrupt, so he might as well get his share and nobody's actually gonna count all the tanks, he'll just say they're all there or falsify the records to say they were lost legitimately, and bribe the inspector if he has to. Then all the poor Private Conscriptoviches at the bottom of the totem pole working at that depot sees how everyone else is corrupt and figures nobody will care if he strips the copper and electronics out of a couple of the tanks to sell and supplement his meager conscript salary, and combined with the ones just killed by lack of maintenance because it's easier to just say you checked them and they were good, only about half of the ones at the depot are in working order. So now out of those 10,000 tanks ordered, only 625 of them are actually useable.
Power projection. I am exceptionally thankful for US military power and I'm not even American. It's been a stablising force in the world for 70 years, despite various expeditions, just compare it to the previous 70 years...
