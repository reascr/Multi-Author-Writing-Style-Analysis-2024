Speaking as a resident this measure also had extremely low awareness around it. I only heard about it when I saw a post on one of the news subs, and no one I knew was aware of it. Also the wording of the measure isn't particularly aggressive, it doesn't call for outright secession, it's calling for the county to research methods to ensure the county gets it's fair share of resources from the state government, including possibly seceding. Of course the idea that SB county doesn't receive a fair share of the states resources is complete nonsense, but it's a popular sentiment among conservatives around here that Sacremento doesn't care about San Bernardino, specifically about the desert, which is about 90% of SB by size but only has about 20% of the counties population. It's pretty typical conservative laundering job to make a ridiculous proposal more palatable to a general population, but it does work to a degree, especially in situation with low turnout where an election can be decided by a few hundred flighty independents.
