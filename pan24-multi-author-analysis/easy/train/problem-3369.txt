Edit: And if your question is "why paintings and not oil tankers, fuel stations or something like that?" Then I have the answer right there if you just search for "climate activist" plus whatever you want them to demonstrate against. They've done the lot but those protests don't gather any attention.
I would love to see something like a nutrition facts list for all products that tell information about where materials are sourced, the pay distribution of employees, the working conditions of the lowest laborers in the productâ€™s supply chain, environmental impact, etc. That way, consumers can read the label and decide to pay more for a more ethically sourced product or less for the ones without consideration for these things. I can see a class of consumers emerging that compares labels- major crossover with the wholefoods consumers. But also, I expect the number who ignore these labels will be huge.
It's essentially unavoidable. Sure you could buy some things locally, but that local farmers market may have used Monsanto fertilizer or pesticide.
Let's go to the farmers market, except those farmers use mansanto pesticides and fertilizers. And let's be honest, a few apples a week isn't making huge strides in fighting large scale industrial pollution.
