Someone says to you "I will eat baked beans as a direct offense to you!" knowing full well you don't like baked beans. They eat the beans. You are now angry just as they wanted, they've had breakfast and whilst you have suffered absolutely no injury and didn't have to eat a single bean, you have lost the engagement and must now search for breakfast with hatred gnawing at your empty belly. None of this makes any sense at all. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with burning a Qur'an. It's even written in the damn thing that that is the correct way to dispose of it. Any offence taken is completely generated from being upset that someone wanted to upset them. Guess what? Had you just ignored the bean eater, you would never even thought about beans. They won before they ever took a bite.
The irony of India entirely believing they're suddenly a world super power when their contributions to the world include shooting farmers on their own land, uncontrolled gang rapes, shit flowing through the streets, enabling Russians to kill Ukranians just for the ability to manufacture the world's worst rifle. Despicable.
Not sure. I have no reference for how their legal system handles such things. Don't have a copy of what exact "permission" he actually received so can't comment on that.
