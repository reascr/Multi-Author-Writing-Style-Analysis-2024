True, if a stranger in Sweden has the possibility to choose a free seat, and still sits down next to you on a bus, run. That's the situation those hammers to break bus windows are for.
In Atheist societies, everyone lives alone, children abandon their parents in nursing homes, depression, suicide, and mental illnesses are at an all-time high, majority of households having divorced parents because no one cares about family or children cos everyone selfish and doing their own thing to achieve max pleasure, and children are brainwashed at school to take hormone blockers and get surgeries and encouraged to be a different gender that's much better!
Yep. Literally just a citizen, who the vast majority of Swedes (including a lot of people on the right) find despicable for multiple reasons. I'm all for freedom of expression, but if Sweden the country burnt a Quran that would obviously be a fucking diplomatic nightmare. On top of being extremely offensive and insulting to the Muslim population of Sweden who they are meant to represent. But that didn't happen. Obviously. Erdogan just wants brownie points.
