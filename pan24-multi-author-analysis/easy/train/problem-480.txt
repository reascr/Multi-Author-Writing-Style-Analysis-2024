You‚Äôve been lied too. Mass shootings are not common and account for a small percentage of overall gun deaths.
My or any random Americans chance of dying in a mass shooting is like .000001%. That percent changes if you calculate it in terms of what are the chances of an American dying from a mass shooting rather than something else to .0000036%. So I‚Äôll take my chancesüòÅ.
It‚Äôs deeply embedded in our politics and ideology because the county‚Äôs founders believed that an unarmed populace would be unable to fight back and overthrow the government if it became tyrannical. However, they also believed in chattel slavery, and that you shouldn‚Äôt be able to vote unless you owned property, especially if you‚Äôre a woman. We‚Äôve been happy to change some things about the constitution, but the guns thing stuck. The real reason is that it‚Äôs a profitable industry, and appealing to that sense of patriotism is extremely effective psychological marketing.
My gosh, how dumb are you? You have to acknowledge that video games are played all over the world and the mass shooting problems are completely unique to the USA. What a fucking joke.
Edit: obviously mass shooting by definition happen frequently in America. However, the notion that random acts of mass killings by random individuals happening frequently is a disillusion. It is not statistical and is not fact. Random people do not show up at a random place and shoot x number of random people daily, weekly or even monthly. Most classified mass shootings are gang related, drug disputes, known altercations between known individuals, random acts of violence in violence stemming from altercation, domestic disputes etc.
Wow okay cool. Less than 10 families who have had their children and/or parents torn from them days before thanksgiving. I‚Äôm so glad we could come to an agreement that this totally isn‚Äôt a problem.
