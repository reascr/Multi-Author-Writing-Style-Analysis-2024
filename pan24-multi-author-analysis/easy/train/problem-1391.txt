Looks like an existing low frequency posting account with inoffensive hobbies in relatively small subreddits, that has been taken over and used for shit stirring sometime in the past year. Or maybe just a radicalized guy that’s gone off the deep end.
Anyway this comparison doesn’t work because in one scenario you are giving Russian oligarch money which they probably obtained illegally to a country which was invaded by a totalitarian megalomaniac and desperately needs all the money it can get, in Iraq’s case neither country both invader and invadee was good so saying that it would have been ok to give the Hassad the money of Bill Gates (not sure why you chose him but Aight) is both a incredibly stupid compassion and major whataboutism, yes America also started wars for personal gain they baddddd, now that I have fulfilled your request will you guys shut up about things that have already gone and happened and focus on what’s going on right now?
So? Russia has always been a shitty totalitarian state, operating there was never a moral decision. Any company with assets in Russia deserves to lose them.
