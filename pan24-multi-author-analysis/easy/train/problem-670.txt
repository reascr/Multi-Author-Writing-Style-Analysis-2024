International sanctions/shunnings only work if the target country is sanctioned/shunned. So Russians get caught doping, their athletes are still allowed to compete in a celebration of sports and international unity. So Russians invade another country. Their athletes are still allowed to compete in a celebration of sports and international unity. A few on the IOC are getting some nice bonus checks.
all of those nations had volatile terrorist groups launching assaults on foreign nations and instigating those conflicts, and none of them were "invaded" with the intention of annexation, except you could argue palestine I guess but thats a conflict where both side's goal is annexation and has been for centuries so its kind of a moot point.
And? Germany was banned from participating in the Olympic games that took place immediately after both world wars. Afghanistan was banned from the Olympics after Taliban took over the country in the 90s. Russia and Belarus were banned from the winter Paralympics just last year. This kind of stuff has always happened and will continue to happen in the future. The only difference now is that IOC has become extremely corrupt.
