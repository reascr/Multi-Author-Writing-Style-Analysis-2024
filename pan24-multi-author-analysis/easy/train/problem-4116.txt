This illuminating ProPublica article from 2018 offers the “rest of the story”: how Republicans relentlessly demonized the IRS and after taking over Congress in the mid-1990s, at multiple points, especially starting in 2011, successfully forced cuts to the IRS that long-term effectively gutted the agency and severely hindered it from performing many of its core investigative functions.
Yah what a crock of shit. Something similar had happened to me. When i was 16 my father, who i did not live with deposited some money for me into an account for me. I forgot the exact situation but i believe he deposited the money into the wrong account, withdrew it then put it into a money market account. I did not know he did this, the way i found out was when the irs called and said i owed taxes on that money. Holy shit the hoops i had to jump through, pretty much talking to them every other day for something like $600 in taxes i "should" have payed.
