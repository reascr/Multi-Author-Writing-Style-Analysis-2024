"Sanctions on India" gang where you at? If you're from US, better stop refuelling your cars with that laundered Russian oil. /s.
India switches to buy Russian oil at ridiculously low prices, after western Europe moves in to outbid and poach energy supplies from the middle East, where the production has remained the same, thus making that energy unaffordable for most developing nations.
No they haven't. They've decided their temporary comfort is worth more. India doesn't even recognize that they've taken a "loan of blood" for this oil. One day that loan will be paid back.
I’m not saying the US is or is not sending enough modern weapons to Ukraine, I’m pointing out that it’s effectively a drop in the bucket for us monetarily, in exchange for a guaranteed ally (and, let’s face it, vassalship) with the second biggest country in the region (unless, of course, this all ends and Zelenskyy disagrees with the US in some way, or refuses to do as we say…).
People from India are such pussies. The west constantly criticizes itself and its allies over any perceived mistreatment and India is happy to join in on the criticism. But when India is criticized its racism. Spend more of your budget on education.
