Now Russia have to figure out whether this was a long range drone from Ukraine, in which case they have to massively step up radar and defence operations around every single major airbase, or whether it was a short range drone from nearby in which case they have Ukrainian assets with significant capabilities running around in their country blowing up airbases.
Edit: Why? Because they risk losing the incredible support they have from the West and most of the world. Killing civilians isn't the way to go people.
Russia's infrastructure (electricity, railways, defense manufacturing, etc.) is critical to Russia's ongoing military campaign and, therefore, those are valid targets. The fact that the destruction of those targets will hurt Russia's civilians is unfortunate, but that is Russia's fault, not Ukraine's. Demanding Ukraine spare those targets out of some sense of moral high ground is childish, and in all probability it could lead to far more death and destruction by allowing the war to continue on longer than it otherwise would.
