Yep just like the person who is: “I should be In charge, I know better.” Then when they are destroy everything and then when you have others going: “I’m willing to step in and I have a history of great decisions and I admit when I make a mistake.” It becomes: “you are weak admitting you are wrong. You need to be an asshole to survive.” Then not long after they are dead or on the street going: “but I did everything right by being an ass. What went wrong?”.

Incorrect! It's nuanced, and goes something like this: January 6 wasn't even a thing; it was a peaceful protest. A tour of a public house, if you will. It was also led by a coalition of Antifa and deep state operatives, who did the actual violence that didn't happen, and was completely justified, because the election was \stolen\. And the patriots that are in jail are political prisoners, because, uh, I forget the rest. But you get the point.
