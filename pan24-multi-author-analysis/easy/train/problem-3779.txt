Ranked choice reduces these tendencies by having voters rank the candidates in order of preference. Instead of counting only one vote per voter, the least preferred candidates are dropped and their votes transferred to the more preferred candidates. This is repeated until there is a majority or one candidate left. The result is that extreme candidates will be less likely to win, while candidates who may not be anyone’s favorite, but are the majority’s second or third choice will.
Legislation-wise, definitely not. Made all the more so by the House taken by Republicans. But this has everything to do with Sinema trying to cover herself in 2024. She knew she'd 100% lose a Democratic primary. She was advised to switch to Independent, skip the primaries, and threaten Democrats as a spoiler. Now there's going to be a question of holding the nose and voting for her, or running a Democrat anyway. Frankly, I lean toward the latter still.
Massive/instant separation, now. Point her out to NOT be a Dem, and hasn't been for a long time, and is a republican.
