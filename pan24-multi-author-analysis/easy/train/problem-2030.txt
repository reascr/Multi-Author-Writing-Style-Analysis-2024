Only reason Russia can strike at Ukraine's power grid indiscriminately is the fact Ukraine can't hit back, US doesn't really share that problem as it could easily retaliate and deter any such strike.
If Ukraine had enough long range ballistic missiles of their own I somehow doubt Russia would be so eager to shoot missiles at their power grid and civilian infrastructure.
Of course they're not going to get them from the west, because everyone is scared of escalation, but I really don't see this ending without Ukraine either destroying their army completely, getting long range missiles or making pretty painful concessions to Russia.
HOWEVER. You can make moves now, right now, that reduce these vulnerabilities. Hereâ€™s an example: solar power from a space collector, beamed down to earth to a central receiver, then distributed via the grid. The costs will be (sorry about the pun) astronomical, and the grid will continue to be susceptible to, oh just for example, ICE STORMS. But what if all the $$$ folks want to throw at such pie-in-the-sky projects instead were devoted to getting solar collectors onto rooftops right now?
