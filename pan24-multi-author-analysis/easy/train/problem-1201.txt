"One potential hurdle for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination acceptance is the risk of ADE, which may increase the severity of COVID-19. Considering earlier reports of the effect of ADE on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, the hypothesis that ADE may occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection has existed since the outbreak of COVID-19 \[29,30,31,32\]. To date, numerous in vivo and in vitro experiments have been conducted to explore the occurrence of ADE in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, only one in vitro study has preliminarily demonstrated the possibility of ADE in SARS-CoV-2 infections \[9\]. Moreover, there is no evidence that ADE occurs in the SARS-CoV-2-infected population. Thus, we cannot definitively determine whether ADE occurs in the reinfected population at present. More population studies of SARS-CoV-2 must be conducted to clarify the role of ADE.".
You are assuming (probably because you didn’t read the article) that we are talking exclusively about virus variants that are linear derivatives of the existing variants, whereas the article talks in part about recombination events with currently entirely different Corona viruses occurring in nature and leading to the ‘worst case scenario’ as they call it.
