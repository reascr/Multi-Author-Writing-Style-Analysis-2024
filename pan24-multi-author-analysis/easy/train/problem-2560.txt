Hey Mike! You could have just used the 26th, told all the Cabinet to shit or get off the pot and you could have been in charged (which he was). Showing the GOP that: "Well, he doesn't fuck around when the chips are down. Maybe he is a good choice." But nope, he let all MAGA and his own brother tell him he is weak. He back tracks on that "Trump probably is sorry for wanting me and my family dead." "Mother says to forgive and forget". Instead he pretty much sealed his fate as: "I'll just pretend it will go away on it's own if I ignore it." He will never get a nomination. His career is over.
To be charitable, one has to conclude that pence is suffering from a serious mental impairment because no rational person would respond like he has, actually making appalling lying excuses for trump, the Jan 6th attack, blaming trumps actions as reliance on “bad legal advice”. Either this, or he is being paid millions to lobby DOJ for trump to keep him out of prison.
