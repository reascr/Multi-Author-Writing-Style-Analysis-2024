Personally, I feel as if Puerto Rico, America Samoa,, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands should be granted full, unconditional, and immediate independence to operate as their own sovereign states. Much fuss has been historically made about the British and their colonization of nations under the Commonwealth umbrella. But all of those countries (all 55 of them) are independent nations who voluntarily joined the Commonwealth. That's not the case with the American territories. They should be afforded unconditional independence.
Well to be fair, the solution is obvious. They should absolutely be a state, full stop. The only reason they aren't already is because Republicans don't want more Democratic representation. That is the only reason.
Because democracy threatens their grip on power and by that measure even if it looks like things are improving we are actually getting closer to becoming a dictatorship because the people with the most power are a small group of leaders who are threatened by the idea that the majority should be represented fairly. Kinda reminds me of Iran as a recent example and the monarchy as a historical example.
