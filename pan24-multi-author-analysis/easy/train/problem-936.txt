The EV manufacturers could use relatively open standards like CANbus but therein lies the problem. The fact is that CANbus while being as close as it gets to an open standard for networked mechanical systems was created by industry insiders who intentionally left open all kinds of variations in the standard precisely so that vendor tie-in could be accomplished because it was written by people motivated to make a profit not to make the vehicles easy to maintain. It doesn't have to be that way though. It's quite a simple thing to simply put tariffs on EVs that don't follow the best practice recommendations for open CANbus systems so that anyone with a smart phone can program their car. This is not about true technical complexity but rather about a lack of will to regulate industry and to permit them to gouge the gullible public that easily falls into this mindless attitude that it's all too complicated for little ol' me to understand. That's bullshit. It's not complicated at all.
