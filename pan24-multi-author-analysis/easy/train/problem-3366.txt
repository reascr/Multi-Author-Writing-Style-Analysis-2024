My question is drag shows are considered sexual and grooming childen. Explain to me how beauty pageant for 4, 5 6 years isnt grooming them? Forcing little girls to wear heavy make up and dress up like a young women along with heels appear to groom children more for pedophile. Dont even get me started with cheer leading. During a local Football team I took my grandmother her mom was helping out in confession. Well low and behold! There were girls 13, 14, 15 moving body parts so fast I lost track. Some of dancers were grinding up against the male cheerleaders rubbing their legs against each other. I have seen Drag shows, nothing in those shows could compare to the soft porn dances being done at our local foot team by cheerleaders I dont hear a peep out of parents when their own daughters and sons are making all the moves even growning and mouning out with each hip thrust. Florida really wants make an issue of drag storyline? Wait til they se the video I took of our cheerleaders. Might be very eye opening.
Conservatives, well, authoritarians, really, donâ€™t trust people to make decisions for themselves. They see the average person as weak willed, corrupt, stupid, and are just one or two steps away from total degeneracy. To them, modern society is just Sodom and Gomorrah part deux.
