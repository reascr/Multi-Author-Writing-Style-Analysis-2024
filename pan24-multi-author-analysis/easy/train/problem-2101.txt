And I think that's entirely backwards, because not every power structure acts the same way and the values of a faith will inform its actions. I truly cannot understand people who say that Christianity has almost never upheld Christian values (except for Christian primitivists, because nothing is more Christian than accusing other Christians of being insufficiently Christian), because cultural control, domination, and colonialism are Christian values. The Roman Empire was fine with allowing its subjects to retain their own gods, until Christianity arrived and they began forcible evangelization. The Western Roman Empire collapsed when its attempts to maintain Nicene control over the largely Arian Germanic tribes backfired horribly, but that didn't stop the death march of evangelization from continuing until it had ravaged every indigenous European faith. And so it went.
These questions and a thousand more kept European Christendom at each others' throats for nigh on 1500 years, until we figured out, after millions of gallons of spilled blood, it's better to 'not make windows into men's souls' and let people worship in private how their conscience told them; and agreed on a certain degree of secularism in public and legal spaces.
Send rice and grain? You guessed it, local farmers are priced out and now their economy can't feed their own population. They have to rely on foreign aid forever now.
