People need to get their shit together. There is no “too low”. There’s new Republican legal theory that the constitution demands it be revoked in the name of the common good if necessary. Desantis lawyers had to admit that “woke” meant a belief of systemic inequality, meaning they are pro-inequality. Pro old systems. They are screaming at white america that only they can prevent america from becoming South Africa. It’s working. It’s not messaging for shock value and Twitter retweets. It’s actual messaging. There are no meaningful republican numbers who actually value the union any longer. Only their values enforced on all.
Trump mocked disabled people, had dozens of sex scandals, called dozens of countries friendly to the US shit holes, paid off porn stars, walked casually into underage girls dressing rooms, had a huge appreciation for dictators, has multiple photos with Epstein, said REALLY fucking creepy things about his daughter, had the whole "grab em by the pusy" incident, which Republicans loved by the way.. he literally called for suspending the constitution of the United States to put him back in power.
