Your position is barely rational. For example, you say 'was already planned before the invasion'. So what. The invasion changed everything and plans can and should be changed. But they weren't changed, which is reprehensible. I have pointed out that the EU has made substantial economic and material sacrifices to punish Russia but you stall babble about the EU still importing more Russian oil than India. Totally Irrelevant. India is running towards Russia economically as the West is running away. India's direction of travel is SUPPORTIVE. The West's direction of travel is the opposite. That is the bottom line. Ukraine will not forget who helped Russia whilst it's territories were invaded and it's people were murdered, nor should they. India should be ashamed.
Ah yes so the developed nations who have resources can send them to Ukraine which morally justifies their purchase of Russian oil which in turn allows them to generate more resources while the undeveloped nation that doesn't have resources to send should cease their purchases of Russian oil and stop generating what resources they can.
Really? You think the global response against the Iraq invasion and the response against the Ukraine invasion are the same? Where were/are the American sanctions, embargoes, wealth seizures? How come the world didnâ€™t isolate the US?
