The problem is also a massive campaign by France to manipulate the US foreign policy. France provided "intelligence" that was basically propaganda saying that support was greatly different and Vietnam was trying to use the US into helping it get stronger before going towards communism. This manipulation was horrid and in retrospect often viewed as France's attempt to punish Vietnam for wanting independence. For instance, it was stated by French intelligence that over 60% of the Vietnamese supported democracy. In reality, this was only a poll of French speaking people who lived in the major cities. These people would have been an extremely small fraction that worked for the French colonial government where they were largely selected for their loyalty to France. The actual polls from the general populace were about 95-97% in favor of communism or socialism as a way to fix the country as the post French colonial government seized the majority of farmable land making it where the actual citizens had very little wealth or property. The ironic part is that IIRC the goal was to use communism to even out the resources back towards the people and then use this to switch to a democracy like the US.
It’s everyone’s economic prosperity. We would greatly appreciate if other countries would help us in standing up to China.
