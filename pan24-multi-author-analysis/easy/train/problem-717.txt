Yes, especialy when it comes to tourism, i actually live in the border with french guiana, and there is a lot of people from there that cross the border to buy products that are forbidden in french guiana, but the state where the border is is very underdeveloped so we can't properly explore the benefits from living next to a country that uses the euro.
