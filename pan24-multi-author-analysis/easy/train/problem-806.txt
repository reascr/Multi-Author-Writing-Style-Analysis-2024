I've said for quite awhile now that once Americans actually get to know DeSantis they aren't going to like what they see. He's a very smarmy, needlessly hostile, cocky asshole. He's very much convinced that he's some kind of king that's going to rule America with an ultra right wing conservative iron fist. I don't think it's going to play very well across the country.
>The party became so anti-establishment and pro-iconoclast that it actually came to reject institutional procedure and tenured professionalism. You can only operate so long with a throw-the-bums-out mentality before you run out of “bums” and realize that you’re left with no one to replace them but scoundrels.
Unfortunately yes. Crist was about as exciting as the color grey. Seems like the Dem party threw in the towel on Florida. I'm not sure running a former Republican was ever going to move the left or independent voters in Florida.
