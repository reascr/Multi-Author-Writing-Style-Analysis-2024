If you haven’t heard about it, a private hospital in Brazil was abandoned and the imaging equipment was left inside. Some scavengers found a radiotherapy device and eventually broke it open, later selling it for scrap. The scrap yard owner extracted more material, even allowing his child to play with the now fully exposed and terrifically dangerous cesium-137. Apparently the material emitted a deep blue light - possibly Cherenkov radiation - which fascinated and invited the curiosity of the local community. In the end a few hundred people were exposed and several died.
Don’t governments have like sufficiently sensitive airborne scanners for radiological contamination? Seems like they could grid it out and hunt it down from the skies.
Definitely. Not being able to find it would be a really bad thing, and half life just means average 5xrays worth of energy in 30 years.
Radiographer here. Ten times xrays ain't that much. It's not great but it's not terrible. Also depending on the kind of radiation being emited then most of it may be absorbed by the air within just a couple of metres.
