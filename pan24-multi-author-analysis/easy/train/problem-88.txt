Exactly. I'm sick of articles pushing this "bipartisan" bs on us when the republicans literally tried to violently overtake the government by force. Screw that. I, and most forward thinking people, would like the GoP to get voted out entirely. Their not some "counterbalance" they are just their to obstruct progress. Young people don't want pointless obstruction. They want popular legislation to pass swiftly and consistently. Enough of this garbage.
Until Republicans participate in political discussion in good faith with the goal of affecting positive general change, instead of with the goal of consolidating power around a radicalized minority and hurting those they view as "other", compromise is impossible. It's impossible, not because the Democrats are unwilling to compromise, but rather because the definition of "compromise" differs greatly between parties. Democrats understand compromise to mean "human limitations mean that we can't all have everything- let's find a division of resources that leads to maximum satisfaction", while republicans view compromise as "Give us what we want, and we'll consider not hurting you as badly as we want to".
