^ this. Especially if you cook with mostly cast iron like we do. Show me an Iron Grated Electric that cooks as well as my Gas Range and maybe I would switch. Short of that I have no intention of switching...
I see this along the lines of the same type of study that says BBQ causes cancer, the science is there and it probably does, but does my brief blip on this planet where big oil literally has poisoned the earth mean that not eating BBQ really will prevent me from getting cancer at any faster rate than all the other shit I’m exposed to? Does not having a gas range, which basically every single high end restaurant and kitchen uses really reduce my potential for cancer so much? I get that if you stack so many carcinogenic things up they will likely cause something sooner than later but at this point I’m more worried about the types of pesticides, chemical and fertilizers used in food processing being more likely to cause harm than gas ranges, especially when so many other gas appliances are in the mix as well.
