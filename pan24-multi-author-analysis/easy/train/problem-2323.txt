In 2005/6, as Iraq and Afghanistan were revealing themselves to be more stubborn invasions, one of the head honchos from the occupation gave a speech in my rural town (I think he'd bought a vacation home and someone convinced him to speak?) And I'll never forget what he said, "democracy is a weak ideology, when it conflicts with something else people value, they'll always give it up". He wasn't saying it's bad, or valueless. He's saying that when forced to value democracy or their religion, democracy or their ethnic identity, democracy or prosperity, people always abandon the idea of democracy as important.
Oh Man, look it up. NPR had a podcast on it. Basically they put up a horn that tells all the non-whites to get out at 6pm in the 1900's. And today people still want it to play because it's their "heritage". They have such little empathy that they can't differentiate between the tiny pain at not hearing a horn they grew up with and didn't understand compared to the pain of hearing that horn and knowing that it meant you weren't welcome and were subject to arrest and violence. It's pretty sad.
