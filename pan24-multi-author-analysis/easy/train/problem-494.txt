Problem with Putin lackies and sympathizers. They think he is some strong willed genius and he is a moron who “knows where the bodies are buried” and has money to buy stupid. However he is not only getting his ass handed to him but life grows shorter and shorter. Their belief in him won’t work because they can’t accept the reality they are losing. It’s like Alex Jones. The more money being taken away the more he can’t do anything. He can’t admit he’s a moron and a grifter. He is imploding because he can’t admit he lied about everything. Even worse people who defend these people are the same. If they admit they were wrong they see themselves exploding and they can’t have that.
