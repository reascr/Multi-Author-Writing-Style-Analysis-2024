I live for the day where zelensky tells us that all Russian forces have been pushed back into Russian borders. That will be the day that putin cannot spin, you can’t say it was a tactical retreat to regroup or that you pulled out to just shell Ukraine, you had all of your forces routed out of the nation you unlawfully invaded and now they are looking to move towards crimea to reclaim it. When that day comes, his generals (or what’s left of them) will finally turn on him, the Russian population will come face to face with an army of shell shocked youths that were sent into a meat grinder and are supposed to be in Ukraine, wondering why they are advancing back into their own lands, and it will cement Russia forever as a bloated military power that inflated its strenh for decades, only to be defeated by an enemy who they initially severely outnumbered and outgunned, who had to form their army and equipment piecemeal from dozens of other nations donating to their cause, and whose colossal failure actually had the complete opposite effect from its objectives and actually strenhened nato forever.
So sad. The whole world is mistreating poor Putin and his former ally Donald Trump. All they wanted was to rule the world with violent nationalistic, domestic and/or global oppression. Can’t a kid have dreams anymore?
