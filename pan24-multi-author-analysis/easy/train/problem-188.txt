Thanks for the link with the chart that supports my point, even though it feels like you posted this as a counter.
its the human emissions sure but i never see our heat output thrown around as a consideration, an average hurricane is equivalent to many hundreds or thousands of hydrogen bombs in terms of energy dissipation but kilowatts baking off our grid through its basic resistance and inefficiency and millions of square feet of human habitation leaking off a portion of its BTU constantly as to require HVAC cycles not to mention convenient hydrocarbon wellhead flaring, not even getting to Russias extreme flaring due to circumstances in a quaint thought that they need to keep it flowing in case it will be used by europe.
No they don't. The problem is that people listen to corporations and the media, so experts don't actually get a platform. At least not one comparable to the propaganda machines that are google, facebook, reddit and popular media that mostly unfortunately copies american corporate owned media anyway.
