Seriously? Do you have a source? 'Cause it's believable, but I don't know if you're just guessing or if there's a report or something. If there is, I'd really like to read it.
Disingenuous claptrap. I wish all these Russian sympathisers would just be upfront about it. They are siding with Russia and think Ukraine was too uppity to not submit to being in their sphere and given them their land and people.

"The Russian economy is deteriorating. The war is lost. There are more and more dead bodies returning to Russia, so Russians will be coming across more difficulties and they'll be trying to find explanation why this is happening, looking around to the political process and they'll be answering themselves: 'Well, this is because our country is governed by an old tyrant, an old dictator,'" Gallyamov said, referring to Putin.
