It's fine not to engage. Glad that you are doing it respectfully. However, you made an incorrect assumption of my knowledge. I was a UPSC (akin to your CSS) aspirant before more than 10 years. Since those days I have followed Pakistani politics, and geopolitics very closely. I now work in a FAANG and stay outside India. I have interacted with more than 20 Pakistanis out of which I was able to respectfully debate with 2 about geopolitics. I have hired Pakistanis and I have fired one too. One of the best managers I had was from Pakistan (he was born and brought up elsewhere through). I mentioned these to tell you that I do not come from a biased place and, all my and my friend's hatred is only from terrorism. Anyway, since you want to not discuss, good luck with the extremist problem. Hope you come out of it for the sake of regional stability.
This isnâ€™t actually uncommon. My grandfather fought in the second world war and died a few years at 95. His wife is still alive at 91. My great grandmother, while no one knows her exact age, is at least 100. Plenty of Pakistanis live well into old age.
