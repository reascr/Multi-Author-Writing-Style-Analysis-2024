From my understanding the lignite from that mine normally is burned in nearby lignite fired powerplants - the mine is owned by RWE power, and there is even a direct conveyor connection between it and the Neurath power plant for efficient transport.
It does? I'm german and i don't feel it. Maybe because i also hear our internat disputes. Like conservatives complaining that "turbines are ruining the view of the countryside" and bullshit like that. And we have a lot of conservatives...
its a calculated maneuver regarless of whether that calculation is happening consciously or subconsciously.
What do you mean of all countries? Mining coal was the catalyst for the whole of north rhine-westphalia (the biggest federal state by population) and in part is a reason why germany was and is succesfull. The whole region went downhill because coal mining was phased out because most of it was mined. Sure germany tries to be responsible when it comes to climate from time to time, but it has still a lot of heavy industry which needs coal.
