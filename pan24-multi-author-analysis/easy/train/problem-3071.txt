At the time the DOJ was still riddled with traitors. There are still a few there. It was not that easy to root out the deep Russian moles.
Republicans have been trying to actively undermine our democracy since Nixon, but things really started going bad under Newt Gingrichâ€™s (one of the slimiest humans on the planet) reign of terror from the House of Representatives by slowly stopping away the guardrails to democracy.
Agree. My picks are: passing a US citizenship test, not being found guilty of a crime, ability to recite the Declaration and the Preamble to the Constitution at any time, as well as being able to summarize all articles and amendments, passing a robust test on American history (especially the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War) and the founding fathers, and legally signing an oath into office that also binds the individual to be booted if in violation of the Constitution or its amendments.
You see the trend. The first few presidents won, based on reputation and lifetime achievements. After the first few, campaigning became essential to win. Eisenhower was probably the last person to win primarily on reputation, and achievements. Trump, of course, had only a bad reputation (some would say very bad), and no experience whatsoever. His win in 2016 was the triumph of campaign over all sensible criteria for choosing a President.
