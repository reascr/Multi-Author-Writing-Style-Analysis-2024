The entire death toll was due to governmental corruption allowing for building code to not be enforced so what makes you think all that money is going to go the ppl. Iâ€™m guessing only 1-10% will land indirectly to victims while the rest get pocketed by politicians and their friends.
Separate incident. The US government detected two Chinese spy balloons. Which were legitimate spying craft.
12 GOP states refused federal funds to extend Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and suffered no major consequence from voters despite demonstrable negative health and financial outcomes compared to states that participated in the expansion. To be clear, they caused thousands of unnecessary illnesses, deaths, and bankruptcies by refusing federal assistance, and they were rewarded for it by their voters. Their refusal of EPA help is unlikely to cause them trouble in Ohio, and it means the feds can't come in and make the state officials look like bumbling liars. And when the feds don't come in, because they're not allowed, the national GOP can blame the Biden administration and deflect attention from the fact that it was GOP obstructionism in Congress that ended the rail union negotiations that might have prevented this. (And yes, the Biden administration signed off on the strike avoidance, but only because the GOP made it clear they'd block any further union gains and it's stupid to play chicken with the economy with lunatics that have shown they don't care if the cars crash and everyone dies.).
