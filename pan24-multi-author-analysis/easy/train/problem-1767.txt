Might matter a bit on the margins, but probably won’t make a huge difference. Seems like the expert consensus is that the overall sanctions regime has been a bit of a dud. Russia’s economy definitely took a hit from the sanctions at the start of the war but the Russian economy appears to have stabilized, albeit in a worse place than they were pre-invasion. Seems like the combination of gray markets allowing the import/export of goods through other nations and the ability to continue selling oil, gas, and other natural resources to China and India has kept Russia afloat and there’s not much we can do about it barring cooperation from those countries or a dramatic overhaul of the overall economic sanctions model the west relies on.
\- Entertainment. Gone are Netflix and Spotify. Well, I personally (I was talking about myself here) did not use them. Kinopoisk and Yandex Music are my choices. Now something is starting to disappear from subscriptions. Well, Russia has the experience of content piracy and online sites have not gone anywhere. People will get content anyway.
