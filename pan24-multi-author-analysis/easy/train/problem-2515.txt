Read this extremely slowly "India is behaving much better towards Ukraine now than how Ukraine (or any of its supporting nations) behaved towards India when India was attacked".
As I have said in reply to similar comment, you can not treat a country with hostility/indifference (everyone on Ukraine side and Ukraine itself) and ask it to turn to your ally and against someone who actually had friendly relations with India.
It has everything to do Ukraine you cannot treat a country with hostility/indifference for years and expect it to act like a friend because its convenient for you in situation on a dime, you want to avoid this in future maybe start Reciprocating the same.
Trillions? So our entire budget went to Ukraine? My guy we've looked at your previous posts you hit the conspiracy sauce too often. You're just very gullible, it's quite sad.
That's not completely true, all most all of newly independent nations(people tend to forget China was never colonised) pushed for non alignment (hence called 3rd World countries) while soviet union respected that, usa went with either with us or against us attitude and making soviet union better friends to not only India but many nations, because it is large it could maintain neutrality over years while most countries fell into either camps.
