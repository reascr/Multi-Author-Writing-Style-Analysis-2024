There was a show on PBS last night on the Western Allies response once they knew what was going on in Auschwitz (Secrets of the Dead). There was a lot of hand wringing but no action. They could have bombed the camp or bombed the railroads. One reason they took no action is because they didn't want the war to be viewed as a "Jewish" war. Some British were characterizing the people advocating for action as "wailing jews". Very frustrating to watch, although it was tragic IRL.
Moreover during September 1939 while the nazis invaded poland from the west the russians invaded from the east, until 1941 the soviets bypassed the sanctions the world put against germany and that only stopped when the germans invaded the soviet union, once the soviets managed to pushed the nazis out of their borders they stopped at the polish border, delaying the liberation of auschwitz, so the germans and the polish resistance could exhaust eachother and make it easier for the ussr to annex poland.
I hope they can earn their place back. Moscow sacrificed a lot of blood to bring vengeance to Berlin. Just like they are killing a lot of young men to steal land, babies and toilets in 2023.
