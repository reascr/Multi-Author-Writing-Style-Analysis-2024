While I think China is considering directly aiding the Russian war effort first and foremost because they are both anti-west pariah states who see each other as the only major ally they each have left... They are also probably at least marginally coming from a genuine position of not wanting the conflict to spiral 'out of control'. Along the lines of seeing Russia losing the war conventionally resulting in them using the only weapons they have left in a last ditch effort to force a victory or at the very least force concessions, nukes... Thus they justify helping Russia as a means of staving off their conventional defeat, which staves off the possibility of them resorting to using nukes. Not saying that is correct, or moral, or anything like that... Just pointing out where they might be (marginally) coming from; nobody wants Russia using nukes.
China was practically 100% isolationist and heavily agrarian. Folks, including them (apparently) forget that prior to Nixonâ€™s visit and opening up to international trade, China was a very poor country. This only changed in the last 40yrs, or so.
