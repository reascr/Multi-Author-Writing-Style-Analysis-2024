Just recently read more about pol pot and his regime. That man was actually out of his mind. I didnt feel right for a while after reading about the shit those people were doing. Sick bastards.
>The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group".
Fair. There's definitely a large portion of people who compare minor inconveniences to the Holocaust because either they just have no way of gauging actual severity outside of a personal impact (i.e. lack of empathy), or they've seen others use the Holocaust comparison and just want to mimic it, and both of those do tend to lean more conservative.
What fucking cardiologist? No one is named. If one is named then we can see all the as-of-now unpublished and unsupported evidence that there are cardiac issues to rival the Holocaust as a result of vaccines. Does that not sound a little wacky to you? Yes Iâ€™m taking the evidence from actual existing cardiologists over one with no name are you kidding me?
Or, since no source was given, there was likely no cardiologist who made such an idiotic statement.
