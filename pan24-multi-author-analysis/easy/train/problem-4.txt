Floridas insurance premiums are 4x higher than the national average. 12% of the homes are uninsured as a result, national average is 5%. Florida has above average utility costs, above average consumer costs (even with inflation), above average fuel costs, above average healthcare costs, one of the highest average rents in the nation, one of the most expensive auto insurance rates. It’s one of the most expensive states in the us to live despite its low tax rates. Right now it’s living off buckets of cash that came in a wave of new residents but that is going to burn out really fast. 2023 is when Floridas economic pain is going to really start biting hard which is why the legislature is panicking to get something done but what they are doing is going to take years before you see any effect. In short Florida is fucked, it’s why they are reluctant to spend any of that covid surplus money, they are going to need it.
Genuinely. Imagine making a vaccine that saves potentially millions of lives and then a bunch of assholes who can barely read try to put you on trial for it.
