Some are more or less just a little goofy or forgetful, but have anger management issues. It all really depends on what part of the brain was injured and how severely. So it's a wild hit and miss of ability and disability. Our job is to figure out what these folks can do, what they can be trained to do, and get them out into the workforce in some capacity if we can. For most of them that's never going to happen. But they're paid pretty fairly for the work they do, whether it's one day a week or five.
By undermining faith in public education with strawman arguments and moot points (see: CRT in elementary schools), they are making ignorance the preferred alternative to intellectualism.
Yep. And rags like the Wall Street Journal are bashing the fuck out of public education and would happily have let DeVos finish the job she started. Like maybe public schools would perform better if they were actually funded and staffed adequately? But no, they cut off funding and then point and shout “See we told you it doesn’t work!”.
