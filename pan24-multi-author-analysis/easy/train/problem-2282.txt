Yeltsin was a criminal of the same vein as Putin. The genocide of the Chechen people was massively ignored by the world and any democratic institutions which could hope to sprout were decimated during his second elections, all driven by the fear of communists.
I don’t know what 40k is ? So you have confused me. I realize that it was the KGB predecessor in WW2, but they both worked out of Lubyanka. All Soviet units had political officers who could and did arrest and or field execute anyone who violated Stalins no retreat or surrender orders. In the initial months of Barbarossa huge numbers of Soviet troops surrendered to the Nazis. The Soviet army had just gone through a series of purges and thousands of officers were killed or sent to the gulags in the late thirties and after the failure of the winter war in Finland. Some of these officers survived long enough to be re-educated in the Gulags and were returned to the army after the collapse of the army in the summer of 1941. A famous general was returned to the army with all stainless steel teeth because they had pulled out all his teeth while torturing him. The Soviets also used “punishment battalions” groups of criminals and political prisoners and officers from the gulags who were used to attack Germans at the front with the purpose of making the Germans run out of ammunition and over heat the mg-42 machine guns. Also fun totalitarian fact if you surrendered or were accused of cowardice (retreating) your family suffered they were not given food rations and were thrown out of their state housing. There were no good guys in the Soviet/Nazi conflict they were both repulsive and the Soviets did some horrible things to the German civilians as payback for the Germans atrocities.
Exactly. How else can they have their own tanks, fighter aircraft, helicopters, guided missiles etc.
