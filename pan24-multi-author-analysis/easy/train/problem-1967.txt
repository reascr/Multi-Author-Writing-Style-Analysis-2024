Cool! A quick read of the FAQs leaves me with the impression that this is purely user driven (and is private and based in Europe). It doesn't appear they crawl the internet capturing what it can like the Wayback Machine does.

How interesting. It is another indication of the fact that the Right is continuing its full court press to denigrate all things Democrat. The thing is that one would have thought that the WH would have anticipated this, or at least made an effort to inform the myriad of groups supporting student debt relief that this poll was out there, and it was in everybody's interest to provide positive or, at least, constructive input.
No it's not. It's over 10 years and graduates tend to earn more than non-degree holders. A 15% delinquency/default rate among borrowers suggest most are able to pay it.
It's 15% of borrowers, so they make up a tiny portion of the US population. The people most likely to be in that position are those who have student debt but never earned a degree, meaning they tend to have much less than that 25-30k balance since that's for those who attended for 4+ years. Their lives aren't being destroyed, if they're in delinquency/default then they should be requesting to switch to an IBR plan.
