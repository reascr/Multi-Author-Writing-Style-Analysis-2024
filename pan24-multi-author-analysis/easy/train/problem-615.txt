That would just prolong the war, since any temporary peace at this point will just give some time for Putin to prepare for another even bloodier invasion. Maximizing the civilian casulties like that doesn't really sound better than the alternatives.
Yup. The last thing I want is Russia to get even bolder and come rolling tanks up my street, here in Germany.
Obama administration did. Ukraine was armed with javelins, body armor, nightvision optics, and other essential equipment. Nato forces also have been training Ukrainian armed forces for 8 years prior to the full scale invasion. Retaking Crimea would not be as difficult as you think it would be. Supply lines are cut off for Russian forces, logistically Russia is still using WW2 era tactics (railways for supplies, where modern militaries have adapted to pallet resupplying, which is quicker, requires less manpower and can be done other areas not along railway supplies), Russia does not have air supremacy or air superiority, and their naval fleet has taken a rough beating. Forces in Crimea are fatigued, cannot be supplied or reinforced, where as UA forces can keep up logistically.
