Was listening to the latest episode of NPR’s . They interviewed a Yale professor who had the highest security clearance when she worked for the US Government. She said that staffers often mistake certain documents including them in the stack of paperwork sent to the former officials home, which most likely happened with Biden and Pence. Besides, they proactively cooperated with authorities and informed them of the documents. Trump on the other hand had over 300 documents of which the National Archives and other authorities have been requesting for some time yet refused to give up. No attempt at introducing nuance here as some have ignorantly and foolishly already claimed in this thread. Facts are facts. Biden and Pence weren’t willingly attempting to break the law, Trump was.

Neither are being investigated for the possession of classified documents. Trump is being investigated for violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction. There's your key difference.
