I've never been banned so easy before. Like I grew up conservative so I like to have real discussions as i can understand them even if I disagree with them. I think that's what pisses them off even more is how I can agree and disagree with them rather then purely disagree. I live around the conservative heartland of Canada. What makes me laugh is when they realize I'm not on their side and its like extra painful/infuriating to them. The loss of trust hahaha. Like I'm pro capitalism and that's about where I stop because what's happened I'm the last couple decades is more fascism than capitalism..im against fasicm hugely and all for socialist policies. I'm a capitalist socialist (liberal canadian, also you can be liberal and hate trudeau which cons dont understand) which REALLY pisses off conservatives. That's why I swear cons hate liberals more than NDP or any left wings lol.

Seriously. I thought those people would be just a tad bit more sensible since they all seemed to recognise Trump for what he is, but it turns out it was all for their personal gain rather than humanity .
