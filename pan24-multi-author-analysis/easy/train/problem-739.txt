This. The thing with these fascist idiots is they are allergic to government processes that are meant to find truth. This is the reason why they try to avoid subpoenas and depositions. Because if the lawyer on the opposing side can smell their bullshit he will bring it out in the open. Even if they lie under oath it will be very fucking obvious that they are lying. You want a hoot. Watch the sandy hook depositions. Alex lies and he knows he is lying though he doesn't care he is shown to be lying piece of shit ghoul.
respectfully, people don’t understand. There’s a big difference between understanding and ignorance. I brought up a very fair point that you’ll never see in the media. SMART people from either side should ask why. Also with respect, the money comes from your citizens, which impacts everything from sales tax revenue, property tax, spending, etc. Schools are falling apart, and the dems seem hell bent on sending billions away from here. It’s a fair question as people grapple with inequality as to where their priorities actually are versus what they say. Show me where politicians in the mid terms ran on Ukraine support? Yet, $37B later, here we are.
