The GOP has a lot of genuine ideological similarities and following Trumpism and what the Trump's say. It is more about ideology for a lot of the 60 or so out of 200 in the last Congress republicans who voted against Ukraine aid. That number increased since the new election now we could assume it is closer to 120/222 who are ideologically Trumpers. However the partys donor base and direction shows a desire to end Ukraine aid and financial powers are delegated in the House so with a republican majority now it is safe to say aid will end from the legislature.
Exactly. Britain was always going to come to Ukraine's aid no matter who happened to be PM. BoJo doesn't get any brownie points for happening to be in the hot seat when the invasion began.
Interesting. In any case it seemed more financial and less ideological than the GOP in the States. The GOP still loves Russia but the modern Tories seem to be backing Ukraine it seems and Boris Johnson has become very vocally and in action anti Russian and Pro Ukrainian. So any guess why?
