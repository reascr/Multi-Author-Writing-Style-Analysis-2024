Do you really need me to explain to you why trade relations between the US and China are a security concern for either country? HK and China are the same thing, sorry, no insultingly stupid loopholes will be allowed.
Go on, ask China if HK is a part of China. The suit is made in China, so it should be labelled as made in China. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too, if China wanted HK to retain its special status then they should have kept their grubby hands off of it like they said they would.

Irrelevant. The US does not need to wait for China to blow up HK's trade rules, just like China didn't need to wait until 2050 to blow up HK's democracy even though they agreed to.
