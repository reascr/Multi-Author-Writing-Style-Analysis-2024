Regardless, at the end of the day, this is a complete failure in the US government's ability to deal with any documents regardless of the sensitivity of them. There should be no way that someone like Trump can simply box up and abscond with sensitive material. There should be no situations like Biden's where sensitive documents get misplaced.
On the other hand, we have Biden who allowed etiher through his own negligence or his staff's negligence, some documents to get put in the wrong boxes. Then, by immediately dealing with those documents promptly and properly, demostrates a complete lack of corrupt intent or even willful negligence. If, as the Trump apologists claim, the "deep state" or "the radical left" is out to get Trump, then hiding the fact that these documents exist would have been the obvious move. By doing things "by the book", Biden has muddied what should be a slam dunk in charging, bringing to trial, and convicting Trump on numerous crimes.
