Unrelated… but I have some coworkers in Ukraine. They show up to work virtually every day, and yet he’s regularly telling me about middles landing within 1-2 miles of his location. I can’t believe it…I mean, I know they still need an income, despite the war, and working is how you do that, but damn….
A multirole fighter capable of aerial combat as well as ground and maritime strike, the Su-57 incorporates stealth, supermaneuverability, supercruise, integrated avionics, and substantial internal payload capacity.
Yep. The F35 is stealth, but can be detected by long range radar. They'll know its there, but the f35s stealth is more about reducing cross section of targeting radar, which it's decently proficient at. Targeting radar is turned on in 30 sec increments, and has to be relocated after 2 activations to avoid being targeted. The F117 that was shot down was caused by both the F117 and the radar commander breaking with convention. The 117 was flying a repeat route for whatever stupid reason, and the radar commander turned the radar on for a third time, and got the radar lock when the 117s doors were open and it was vulnerable to a lock.
Interesting. I find it a bit comical that the KH-59 is listed as a “cruise missile” when it’s range is barely 150 miles. But I guess they can fly the Su-57 up near the Ukrainian border and release them.
