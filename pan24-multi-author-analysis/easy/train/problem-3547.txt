And don't argue its not ethnic cleansing just because Uncle Sam doesn't call it ethnic cleaning. Driving 700,000 thousand people (70pc of all palestinians) from their homes and then not letting them return is ethnic cleansing.
Expelling 700,000 people and not letting them return to their homes and killing 5000 unarmed ones who try to come back is definitely Ethnic cleansing and genocide. It is a genocide and ethnic cleansing in all ways. Maybe not as blunt as the holocaust but still a genocide. 80% of Palestinians were displaced in 1948 alone. The whole social fabric of Palestinians was torn apart. Thousands killed and nearly a million displaced. Imagine expelling 80pc of the people of a country. That is a crime in its own right.
