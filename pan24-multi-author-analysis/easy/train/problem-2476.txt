Case in point: the Dilbert TV show was just a little too weird and dry to be a mainstream hit, so it got only two seasons. At the same time, UPN was doing a pivot towards black-oriented programming, which was the only demographic that seemed to thrive on the network in that era. Adams became convinced he was “fired for being white.” But I don’t think he was playing culture wars games: he was just failing to see that two things can be true without there being a cause and effect relationship. Adams’s show was cancelled. Adams’s show was not a fit for the push towards black and urban programming. Adams was not fired for being white.
I get what you're saying and that would be something we'd always have to watch out for after a universal healthcare plan came to be (and I'll add on the concern that Republicans might try to access and use patient information as something that we'd need to guard against), but right now this is kinda like worrying that security checkpoints for teleporters could be implemented in a racially biased way.
