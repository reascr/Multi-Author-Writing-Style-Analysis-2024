What about Jordan and black september? If Israel acted like Jordan integrating the population providing equal rights and citizenship remove military law and release all political and military prisoners then the conflict would have been over, the fact that most Jordanians and most palestinians refused to take part in the fighting should tell you something, my grandfather refused direct orders from the king and almost got to court for it, but again it was in the past like more than 50 years ago.
3. Russia had a cold mexican standoff understanding with Israel, not some kind of cuddly national relationship. They had S-300 able to knock out our jets, even over Israel itself, stationed in Syria, we wanted to be running bombing runs in Syria so Iranian weapons don't arrive in Lebanon, break Lebanon, get fired at us, and lead to more war there and here. We agreed with Russia not to shoot at each other, and kept bombing Iranian drone shipments to violent people on Israel's border while they looked the other way, while not targeting them or taking a side in the Syrian civil war. That S-300 presence is gone now (because Ukraine), and we can operate with more impunity targeting Iranian weapons.
