Today was yet another pretty quiet day. We had some country-wide air raid alerts, but it was just Russian MiG-31K as usual, which they mostly use to scare us, but also for reconnaissance, because apparently it is used in a pair with their AWACS aircraft. Thereâ€™s a pretty high chance that the next big missile strike might happen in the next couple of days, because it will be orthodox Christmas soon, and they will almost certainly try to ruin it for us.
Interesting! Previously analyses had stated offensives on both sides were waiting for freezing of soil. Unfrotunately ISW has assessed previously that a delay would reduce Ukraine's momentum and allow for Russian forces to reconstitute.
Jesus. I'd bet the FSB would just love to have that list. Not sure they have enough room in the Gulags. The ones who went through with it and surrendered are going to be the lucky ones. Maybe they can claim asylum.

This is how Ukraine did it. They bled and died and fought at Euromaiden, to kick Yanukovych out. Now they're still fighting.
