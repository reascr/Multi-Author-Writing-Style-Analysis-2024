Many embarrassing defeats aside, they even repeatedly and proudly measure their most globally crucial victory by the number of their own who died, which seems perverse. I mean, yes, a noble sacrifice to defeat Nazism, and credit to all those who died, but as a state, without Stalin’s similar psychopathic disregard for his own men dying in the tens of millions that number would be a lot lower.
Exactly. When there's anarchy on the ground, it's the psychopaths and people who are comfortable setting themselves up as local warlords to loot and plunder that are going to be setting the stage all over the place. They DGAF about equality or justice, just exploiting the situation opportunistically.
Uhm…. The US Revolution. The drafting of the Articles of Confederation it’s ratification and failure. The drafting of the Constitution; all of the aforementioned predate the events of France 1789.
Democracy, definitely. There's also a new type of class-warfare going on. Those also tie into physical warfare in places like Ukraine etc so the whole thing is mixed together.
