But none of their poking about in the guts of their religion has changed a fundamental fact: Christianity promotes genocide, heirarchal misogyny and the oppression of women, slavery, the abuse of children, collective responsibility (because there was only ONE GOOD PERSON in either Sodom or Gommorah, though they only tested men according to the Bible - women and children don't count), the inheritability of guilt (unto the tenth generation!), the systematic abuse of followers (Job and his family who were all callously murdered), expiation of 'sins' through wishful thinking, absolute religious intolerance ("You shall have no God but me" is actually the first commandment.), the murder of women on specious grounds ("You shall not suffer a witch to live" was still being used, as of a couple of years ago, in Africa to burn women, especially small female children, at the stake. The female pastor who was doing it was on Oprah I believe. Or maybe it was the View), and any number of other injustices.
