Mhm, doesn't care fr? So why don't you fuck off Slavic brothers and let them figure it out for themselves? No, your master of puppets soul won't let you let go of the situation. Remember for the ages - digging deep is dangerous for the U.S. and you know why. We Slavic people had centuries of enslavement each other and it's only OUR business. You still can't get over with enslaved africans, so why you getting in the way here?
At the actual beginning of the war BlackSky technologies and Maxar technologies said openly and publicly that they were passing all images of Ukraine and Russia, which are image multiple times a day by these satellites to the US officials and that these images were also being made available to any and all other clients that legally had right to them (read: Ukraine is allowed to access the imagery of their own country directly).
So? I imagine data is shared by countries in Europe of Russian assets in the North Sea and English Channel. They could always try being within Russia's border.
