He's no longer really likely at all to come back. He was only made leader because he was seen as an election winner and he burned that reputation through losing a two hundred year old safe seat. He may well lose his seat when the expected by-election is triggered by the inquiry into him lying to parliament. He's not coming back.
Having seen his attack lines against Jeremy Corbyn fail last week when someone pointed out that he's no longer the leader of the Labour party and the country ain't interested, Rishi Sunak is getting desperate and has decided to take aim at an easy target that every other member of the G20 (except Saudi Arabia and India) and even his two immediate predecessors has already criticised.
That wasn’t a typo. You didn’t know the statistic. You just lied on the internet. Which is more of a bitch move than someone trying to better you by correcting your mistakes.
Johnson isn't realistically coming back. He seems to have ducked it because it would hurt his post-PM earnings, he had the nominations, confirmed by the 1922 Committee, to have run in the Tory party election, where he would have beaten Sunak. He seems to have taken the nominations then backed out as a parting shot that he's still got his support base, but apparently he got warned he'd cut about 10mil a year potential year earningsmif he came back now and either lost the membership vote or the next GE.
