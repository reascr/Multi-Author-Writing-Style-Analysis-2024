I don't know what sort of dreamland people are living in where geopolitics and international relations are dictated by morality. It's entirely driven by national self-interest. The fact of the matter is that it's in the best interest of Europe(safeguarding their own borders) and the US(weakening Russia, their main geopolitical rival) to arm Ukraine to the teeth while constantly condemning Russia, and it simply isn't for India right now. They have their own citizens to care for, and they are far too dependent on Russian sources to cut them off entirely in the name of a war that in no way directly affects them. For what it's worth, the Indian government does seem to be moving towards independence and away from the Russian sphere of influence, but it's not going to happen soon enough for them to just stop buying Russian oil overnight.
Pretty disingenuous answer. OP is clearly talking about the fact that India very well may be cut off from western arms in the future given their “self interest” in supporting Russia.
