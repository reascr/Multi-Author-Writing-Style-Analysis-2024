And sadly, they are winning: they for example trapped the current Tunisian leaders in a catch 22 situation, by forcing them to pass some scary dissent supressing measures because SA were using islamist parties, some judges, and terrorists as proxy agitators. Which gives them fuel to say Tunisia is a dictatorship again or about to be because it's way too open minded and their version of islam is the only way to survive.
An other example: Tunisia, the ONLY country in the arab world that survived the arab spring with a democracy, is struggling in heavy parts due to Saudi Arabia exerting its massive religious and political influence to kill said fledgling democracy it built as hard as it can.
Dude. My aunt made my cousin marry the opposite sex or my cousin would get no inheritance. In leb btw. My other cousin just left and only person who knows about his sexuality is his mother.
maybe XD i try to jump in when i see news about Yemen bc there is a lack of information flow and i think they get a worse rep than they deserve usually hahah i've lived in way shittier places XD I think most people just hear the same perspective over and over and it dehumanizes a lot of super average people who are just caught in a shiiiiiiiiiiitty situation, and by dehumanizing entire religions/nationalities/groups based on the actions of their few worst leaders we allow more extremism to grow.
