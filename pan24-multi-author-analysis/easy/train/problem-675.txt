India's invested a ridiculous amount in solar -- its installed the amount of solar capacity. But it simply can't make up for what oil can do, such as fuel trucks that transport food. The price of oil thus directly affects the price of food, and that's a big deal for a country that is still trying to give everyone access to enough food (a third of all malnourished people in the world are in India).
1. The top importers of Russian fossil fuels, buying more than India are the EU (mostly Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium), China, Turkey, South Korea and then after that is India. (see CREA late Nov stats).
Incorrect. I asserted that because BRENT is at pre-war levels, one can't argue that India is buying Russian oil out of dire necessity given that India effectively wasn't buying Russian oil before the war (the articles says that), , and BRENT .
Duly noted that India's needs include doing, as you said, doing a diplomatic favor to a in Russia buy starting to buy its oil in huge amounts, thus perpetuating the war it wages, destruction, and endless Russian and Ukrainian deaths.
Thank you for acknowledging that India buying Russian oil is simply doing the terrorist state a diplomatic favor, and not some sort of dire need that we've been led to believe.
You're fucking up ties with both Russia and the West by trading with Russia, but continue saying it's an "Indian need" to do so.
You make it sound like the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the only thing saving India's economy from imminent collapse.
