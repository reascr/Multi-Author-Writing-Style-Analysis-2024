Not hard to see example of hindu extremism, same with all kinds of christian ones in subsaharan africa, all religions have stupid extremist, the difference is that around the persian gulf they are in power, else where they aren't.
Ok, so I own a thing. It's my thing. I bought it with my money. Paid tax on it and everything. I can burn it, pee on it, put it somewhere unsavoury or even eat it. What I do with my thing is my business. I really don't get why anyone would care what I did with my thing as long as it didn't damage anyone else's thing. Not to mention that the correct way to dispose of a Qur'an is to burn it, so even in this instance, what kind of halfwit would care? You do you and I'll do me. I was a Bible person once. I have never cared what anyone did with a Bible. It's a book. There's billions of them. Who gives a shit if someone burns their own copy of the bible? Now if they did it in a mosque, that action would be very disrespectful, but the actual loss of a single book is irrelevant. There's lots more.
