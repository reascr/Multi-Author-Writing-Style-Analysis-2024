Your inferiority complex is really showing man. Does calling people stupid over and over on the internet after they've criticised you make you feel better? Because believe it or not, calling people morons and stupid over and over doesn't actually make you sound smarter. Learn to relax buddy, go talk a walk, touch some grass, it's going to be ok brother, I'm just a comment on reddit, you don't have to get so worked up about it, you've taken this very personal, I thought what you said is pretty insensitive because the number of Poles executed for being Poles was on a far, FAR larger scale than Poles who fraternised with the German forces, that's why I criticised you, because your comparison was dumb, but hey, don't talk about that, talk about me being stupid and a moron, I'm sure that works great for you outside of the internet.
It inspires me. Thereâ€™s just something about this man, who died at the hands of people my grandfathers fought, that seems so real to me. The humanity is real. The courage is real.
