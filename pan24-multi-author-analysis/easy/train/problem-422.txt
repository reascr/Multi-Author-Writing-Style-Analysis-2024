"I mean, if America wants to send a consistent message, maybe they'd start manufacturing renewable technologies instead of relying on supply from Asian manufacturers?".

What's your point? They have more people, so of course, their emissions in totality are going to be more than most countries. That is why you look at it in per capita.
The actions of China recently are very concerning, there illegal police stations in other countries, their takeback of Hong Kong before the agreement was over, fears of them invading Taiwan, their leader being sworn in for life, the comments about the UK's response to the Chinese diplomats kidnapping a Hong Kong protestor was very disturbing, the list goes on.
Only 369 billion was allocated. Check your facts. Of that, a significant amount is going to consumer incentives for solar panel installation and electric vehicles purchases rather than, y'know, actually solving the problem with mass transit and competitive production. Meanwhile, the US is actually expanding oil and gas extraction and the transit systems of Boston, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, etc. continue to deteriorate.
What do you want China to do? Produce fewer emissions in totality than the US while having 4.3 times the population? Fuck, I should have just said that instead of typing out all that baby brain garbage for you.
