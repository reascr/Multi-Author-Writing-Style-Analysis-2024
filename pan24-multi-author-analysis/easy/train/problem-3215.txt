If you can have joint exercises with Russia, we can have joint exercises with India. Suck it up, China. Fuck the CCP. Whiny cunts.
Well I understand the US defensiveness considering when China was fighting the Korean war (when China insisted on postponing elections after a promised date, insisted on the illegitimate sygnman Rhee government who Sabre-rattled and probed the north), Chinese generals went to the papers asking for permission to nuke the US, and knowingly instigated a counterattack along the US border... oh wait that wasn't china????
Also funny how you call freedom of navigation exercises "increasingly hostile" when what they are doing is telling China it doesn't own the entire south China sea and that they do not get to bully their neighbors to accept their claims the one who is being overly hostile is China.
Because it is currently bullying it's neighbors and trying to impose ridiculous claims on the south China sea matter-of-fact it's not only the US but it's neighbors that consider China a threat.
