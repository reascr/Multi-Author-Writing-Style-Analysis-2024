Do you have a source? I would love to say this to some people I know, but don’t want to make it look like I’m making stuff up. I personally don’t doubt what you said.
One of the flimsy concerns thrown out against a national property tax is the direct apportionment clause, which states that national property taxes which apply directly to real estate should initially be apportioned between the states according to population. However the direct apportionment clause can be easily worked around by computing A) the share of population of each state, B) the share of state property values of each parcel, C) the share of national property values of each parcel. A x B is what property owners would pay if complying with the apportionment clause, C is what property owners would pay otherwise. If A x B is greater than C, offer a rebate, which eliminates the distortion caused by the apportionment clause. And the federal government can issue whatever rebates it wants due to the general welfare clause.
Whatever. I have lost faith that the government is fair and true to working class people. Trump never got audited and paid less in taxes than I did. All while average Americans are getting scrutinized for transactions above $600. Raise the taxes on billionaires before anything.
