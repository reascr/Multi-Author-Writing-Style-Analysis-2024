While i wish this was true, it probebly isn't. the public has a short attention span, and once a distraction is found people will stop showing up to those protests.
Also, many many LGBTQ+ organizations, women organiations. student organizations, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, anti-Occupation organizations, as well as other impromptu local groups that joined.
My patents were there. I went with my kids to meet them and my father told me it was the first demonstration he ever attended in his entire life. And that they intend to keep coming every week.
Another big one (at least at the protests I went to in Jerusalem) was a new organization called Habayit HaMeshutaf ("the shared home") which is portraying itself as an organization of right wing and left wing, Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Jews, Arabs men and woman who want to live in democracy and seemingly aren't taking stances on other topics to make everyone get along on this issue, because it really is so clearly anti-democratic.
This is big. This is half of all Israelis trying as hard as we can to say no to racism, bigotry, theocracy and corruption.
Kumi Israel ("Wake Up/Rise Up Israel"), an initiative of young people against corruption and racism.
