Well, the fact that not all women bleed is exactly why it became commonplace to "fake" the red stain. So, I think in most cases where this tradition became widespread, it was discussed and prepared beforehand, and everyone knows it's not necessarily real.
How? How does protesting against a government that doesn’t care, that will slaughter you for trying, and execute the rest lead to freedom for the Iranian people?
The Iranian people won’t be free until every government official backing the power of the state has been killed or put in prison, and all I’ve seen is just innocent protesters being massacred and executed. So I ask again how? How will the Iranian people be free?
“Conservative” isn’t meant literally anymore. It’s a label for everything on the right including the Q fanatics crowd. And Conservatives ruined that for themselves tbh.
The definition of insanity. Institutionalized murder. The people who should be administering the affairs of a country are instead psychopaths. An entire government of murdering psychopaths who have a thing for making women wear scarves. Insane.
Unfortunately I probably agree. Fuck totalitarian leaders. There’s never a good answer to stopping them. No matter what it seems the innocent citizens take to brunt of the violence.
