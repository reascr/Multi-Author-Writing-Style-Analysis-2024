I just wrote that I personally have sat with victims of the White Terror and they're very alive today. In response, I get a post saying --that was a long time ago, just drop it. Did you read what I wrote? The victims are alive. How do you think they feel about somebody running for political office on the reputation of the man who forced them to watch their parents being murdered? You think they should just forget about it? Would you forget it if a government official forced you to watch as they murdered your parents? Would you just let it go?
Communist Party actually first came into existence in the late 1910s, and the civil war would only be after Chiangmai had the bright idea to start murdering any communist in the KMT, starting the first phase of the Chinese civil war, which the KMT nearly won btw, and then the Japanese attacked etc etc.
Yeah idk about that. Fascism failing has more to do with the system than weather or not the people involved are competent. China has made a pretty good go at it but we'll see if CCP make it to 2030.
