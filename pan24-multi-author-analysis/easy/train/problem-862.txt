Biden didn't fail. He said "nothing will fundamentally change" and we are still a shithole corporate dictatorship descending deeper into fascism every day. Mission accomplished.
2. Crashed US economy costing $3T in lost GDP, $2T in debt due to ignorance and anti-science ideology.

That's hilarious. "Gaslighting"? That is exactly what the right has done for 6 years. This feels like an argument in middle school where whatever you say the opponent just repeats it back to you. Please provide facts and not just criticism. Please explain how worldwide inflation is Biden's fault. Please explain how Russia invading Ukraine is Biden's fault. Putin wanted Trump to be in charge so he could mop them up quickly and Trump could call him a genius and explain how it was to get to the bottom of the Clinton servers and Hunter scandal. He was willing to sacrifice a European Democracy so he could praise and worship his idol (and puppet master). Russian bots, the FBI will find you and retaliate.
Since impoverishing workers to control inflation does not address the actual causes of inflation, shortages of oil, grain and computer chips, it will not lower inflation, just impoverish working people in addition to burdening them with high inflation.
The Fed's solution to inflation is impoverishing so many people that demand for oil, grain and computers chips will fall and this will indirectly lower inflation.
