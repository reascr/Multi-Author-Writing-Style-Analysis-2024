It is Israel's land, both historically and legally. During the creation of the League of Nations and the United Nations as part of the charter there was the designation of the land, from the Mediterranean past the Dead Sea and halfway into Now Jordan the land to become the homeland and country for the Jews. All members of the UN have agreed to that. There was an agreement between the Jewish leadership (no Israel at the time), Arab leaders (the only 'Palestinians' that existed were Jews) and members of the UN that the land east of the Dead Sea be part of Jordan. The UN and the Jewish leaders offered the current believed 'partition' it Arab leaders rejected it. Therefore all land west of the Dead Sea belongs to Israel.
Really? Have you forgotten all the campaigns that Western nations have done against various nations around the world? You think Israel's actions in its own neighborhood against hostile nations and entities is far worse than what the West has done even in modern times? Please.
