It's a critical time, and the outcome of the next Russian offensive will be key. If thousands upon thousands of poorly equipped Russians are decisively slaughtered by superior Ukrainian tactics, equipment, experience, and morale where the Russians wind up with nothing to show for it but a few small villages nobody outside of Ukraine has ever heard about? If that comes to pass, then heads will probably roll sooner than later in Russia. It would prove they have no more cards left to play and no hope for success. Who knows, an ill-conceived assault on Kyiv could result in such a disaster for Russia. But any kind of meager gain or just not getting booted from the country entirely might be enough for Putin to continue to claim great success and keep the war going for a long time.
Coincidence? I dont think so. The only thing that loser Surovikin was capable was bombing civilians and buildings like he did in Syria. Since that didnt result in Russia taking over new territories, they are ditching him.
