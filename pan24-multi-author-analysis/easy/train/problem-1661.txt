ruZZia's win in Ukraine will not end the war. It will only provide blueprint for the belligerent tyrannies of this world to move forward. This would certainly include expansion of ruZZia into eastern and northern Europe. Likely invasion of Taiwan by China, return of the Balkan wars and likely escalation of tensions in the middle east with ruZZia feeding the crisis through Iran and Syria. One could ask: "how is this any of our business?" The world inflamed would disrupt trade, supply chains, logistic, create energy crisis and cause an economic crisis in our country that would make Great Depression look like "good ole' days". This crisis could introduce the level of suffering that could trigger lawlessness and create ripe conditions for things like civil war. It is obvious that I am naming pretty horrific outcomes but even the possibility of Great Depression without a civil war is bad enough. Furthermore, our help to Ukraine has already probably dramatically decreased the possibilities of these outcomes by draining ruZZia of the resources to continue their wars of conquest and, in all likelyhood, Poland, Baltic countries, and Moldova are safe for the foreseeable future. And we did that at a fraction of a price we spent in containing Soviet Union. And there are no American troops on the ground.
