First, a contingent election requires a stalemating of electoral votes or am issue receiving an electoral majority by states in time. Trump did attempt to stall the process in various states with recounts and encouraging stupid public behavior, but the states handled it professionally, because they are not fucking morons.
Sweet. More crimes committed in broad daylight that will never be reconciled. Yet, I spent a combined total of 5 years locked up for small amounts of marijuana in a state (Arizona) that now sells it legally. What a country. God bless America.
The pathetic "I know these are the words a confident, self-assured person would say but I have no ability to put any actual conviction behind them whatsoever" diction and "scared kid eyes in an adult body" are practically identical.
But it gets worse for Trump. Even Biden and Kamila could have been nuked off the face of this earth and STILL Trump would have to step down as president. He would not simply retain the role. Trump HAS to step down, and there are others already predefined to take on that role. The funny thing is no matter what Trump had to win first to retain. There was no reversing course after election night. His one move was to impede electoral certification at state level, but that failed. Literally everything he did, including Jan 6th, was am exercise in futility.
