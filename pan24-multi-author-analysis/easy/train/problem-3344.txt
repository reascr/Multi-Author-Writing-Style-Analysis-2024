In order to be a recipient of manumission, a slave had to have an owner that cared enough about him that he would not only free the slave, but also insure that the slave was set up well enough that he could be self sufficient and not become a burden on society. This came in the form of land grants from the owner as well as the gifting of livestock and farm implements. The owner also had to be willing to take responsibility for any actions of that slave once he was free and beyond his control. So if a manumitted slave were commit a crime and cause property or bodily damage, the former owner would be liable, yet some slaves were set free under manumission.
All things being relative, I would venture to say that within the paradigm of slavery, the slaves that were either manumitted or bought their own freedom were in fact treated well by their owners, although they were the exceptions. Among those who weren’t manumitted or managed to purchase their own freedom (or even given a chance to) there were some who were never the less “treated well”.
