This is the problem. It's not that we spend too much on our military, it's that it gets spent at huge contractors instead of on the military itself. Ask any former grunt, they'll tel you that training and maintenance is suffering because they don't have sufficient basic supplies (like ammo for training, parts for vehicle maintenance). One reason that ex-military mechanics are often so good is that they're forced to learn how to keep their vehicles running on duct tape and prayers instead of proper replacement parts. We don't need futuristic weapons, we don't always need to be pushing for the newest and best. We need to make sure that what we have already is top-notch first. We don't need Raytheon et al for that, or for anything for probably a decade or more. Oh, and maybe redirect a little more of their pay to the VA, while we're no longer financing the contractors...
China cannot deploy their billions of people effectively/efficiently. Although they could most likely win through attrition.
