I'm missing the part where China or the "civilians" contacted the US and said "hey this huge three school bus sized balloon with sensors all over it is accidentally going to go over your airspace.".
If you've ever studied psychology the country of China is like your typical guy who is experiencing Inferiority complex. He knows hes nothing really ("made in China" is synonymous with being the worst quality in the world) but he puffs out his chest and creates an illusion of strenh. To the T.
It's unfortunate that for the sakes of continued security and safety of all public and private commercial or otherwise air traffic that all UFO of any type will be forced to be shot down to prevent mid air collisions between 20,000 and 40,000 feet of which these balloons have been found in within registered flight paths...
not even over china. look how they act in international waters thinking it belongs to them and they get all uppity. people need to stop paying attention to these clowns and start letting them know what the outcome of their fuckery will be.
