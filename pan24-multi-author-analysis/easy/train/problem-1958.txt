It would be almost impossible for a judge to successfully sue a journalist for defamation or ordinally situations. But here, the case would almost certainly fail immediately. Here the statement that the judge is corrupt is logically supported by two facts. 1) She was appointed by Trump, which established personal gain. 2) In her verdict she established that she did not have jurisdiction in the case, but ruled anyways to protect Trump. This arguably establishes a willingness to act dishonestly. 1+2 = corruption. The ruling of a judge with respect to a case involving a former president and issues of national security is certainly an issue of public concern. Even if not true, statements drawn for reasonable logic conclusions regarding issues of public concern are protected from defamation.

According to recent security training. an individual expressing or actively seeking to know classified information is an immediate and reportable red flag.
Oh for sure. I was talking conceptually about a theoretical former presidentâ€™s theoretical continued need to know. Obviously Trump is something of a special circumstance.
