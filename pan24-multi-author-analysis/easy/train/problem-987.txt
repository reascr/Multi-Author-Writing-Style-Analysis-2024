>	For the B61 family, depending on the aircraft type, the PAL unlock code can be entered either from the AMAC system in aircraft (using a coded switch similar to the one shown in figure 16) or pre-flight via the J1 PAL socket on the preflight controller using an external code-entry device such as the one shown in figure 17 (picture is from SAND88-2986).
Make sense,…. I remember talking to a Russian couple few years back,… she was religious AF and he was just classic Russian borderline depressed lad. During some dumb conversation I sad to her,… both my language and yours are based and/or influenced by language that old Church Slavonic was using. Byzantine empire needed to cultivate all the Slav entering the Balkan’s. religion was non invasive weapon of choice at the time. Some how Kievan Russ got on the same bandwagon. That’s why Russian don’t speak Germanic or Turkish or Sarmatian language but Slavic. Yeah that didn’t went very well, and what followed was brain washing cycle of nationalism and twisted history, where Russians are only real Slavs and everyone who speak Slavic language is just version of them, therefore they have territorial rights on those lands.
