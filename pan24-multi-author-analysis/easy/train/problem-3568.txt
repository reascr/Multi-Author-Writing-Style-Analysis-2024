The west can’t operate without them either. Let’s not forget that europe is growing incredibly slowly and may be capped out population and gdp growth wise. The only western nation still growing is the states and maybe Canada and even they are not growing by massive increments. The guy your replying too is correct in his comment that the scale has tipped. Most nations already only watch the movements of America, China, India and even Russia. Europe is irrelevant and will grow in irrelevancy unless they federalize in full and throw its weight around as a group. Europe needs to make sales and china can be a buyer, it’s not nice to snub your buyer unless you don’t need them. Maybe tying your economies to countries like Russia and China for an extra dollar wasn’t the best move if you oppose them. It’s that simple.
God the hyprocrite of eu leaders are on point, they call for a reduced trade at a chinese trade conference and start bullshitting about russia ukraine war or someshit like for fuck sake when eu saction russian oil they already shot themself on the foot, now are they trying to do it again????
