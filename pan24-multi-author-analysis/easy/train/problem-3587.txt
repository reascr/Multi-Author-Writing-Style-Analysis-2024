Hartford Villa Apartments, located at 459 Hartford Avenue, in Los Angeles is a 101-unit affordable housing community for homeless and chronically homeless households living with a mental illness and homeless and chronically homeless veteran households.
Guess what? It already costs billions. City of LA already spends $3bn+ a year on the homeless, it’s just spent really badly. The IG account streetpeoplelosangeles spoke to a “homeless liaison” for the city and found out they’re paid $242,000 a year. What the actual fuck? And this wasn’t the boss of director of homeless services, just a middle management job.
