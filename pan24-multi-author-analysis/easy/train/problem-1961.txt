No, and Ukraine is hesistant/unwilling to hit targets over belarus anyways because doing so might give luka the means to join the war, his people would rebel otherwise but potentially if Ukraine hit targets in Belarus he could make decent enough propaganda to justify it and not face open rebellion.
This is great. I've been listening for a few minutes now, and it's just the anthem, over and over and over.
Exactly. Given the number of vatniks we've seen taken out by tiny drones with tiny grenades, these have a place. None of us should be expecting them to be anywhere near as effective as the bunkers on the Atlantic wall.
How interesting! I wonder what is happening there. Is the music just being broadcast on the same channel, or is it something playing in the background in the same room as the mic?
Yes absolutely. Even getting one of your own heroes back has absolute priority. Though zolkin I think said that PoWs can say they don't want to be exchanged, but maybe this doesn't apply to convicts.
