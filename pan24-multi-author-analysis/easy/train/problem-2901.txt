The problem with that is that you need active policies to diversify and use your oil money. The middle East is largely using theirs for investments, building huge megaprojects, bribing FIFA officials, and on improving the standard of living for their people. Norway uses theirs in a similar manner, albeit far fewer vanity projects. Russia doesn't even have just oil, it has an agricultural, forestry, and mining base as well. The problem is that they have been fundamentally unable to have any real domestic manufacturing because their oligarchy has just completely squashed innovation. Like they had this budget-tier tractor that they were touting as '100% Russian-made', and it was a Czech tractor that they rebadged. Like Russia has just completely squandered its domestic manufacturing after the iron curtain fell, and those in charge of the scraps that remain are basically third-rate oligarchs.
