I don't see any way for a deal to be reached. The House literally cannot do anything until a Speaker is elected, so there's no way to have a "you do this for me first, and I'll vote for your Speaker" deal. Which means Dems would have to take the GOP's word that they'll honor whatever agreement is proposed, which is obviously completely foolish. Plus, we already know that the GOP House agenda basically only consists of attempts to impeach Biden over whatever their talking point of the week is, conspiracy theory pushing with Hunter Biden, and government shutdowns. Why help them along with that?
Republicans superpower has been sticking together. The power squabble is spoiling that and to a degree that feels like new territory. Unpredictability rises.
But, our budget and debt ceiling are locked in until Septmber. The Republicans arent planning on doing anything worthwhile with their majority anyway. So for at least the short term, Democrats really dont have any incentive to step in and end this. And it is making their opponents look like clowns.
