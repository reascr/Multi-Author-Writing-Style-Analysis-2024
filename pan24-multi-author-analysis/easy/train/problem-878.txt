My family is the same way. My mom is atheist and didn’t grow up Christian. Her parents are atheists. My dad is agnostic, grew up going to church, but is against organized religion, but not entirely against the idea of some sort of deity existing. Even growing up though his dad never went to church, only his mom. And his mom only went to church as an adult, her parents were atheist. She only joined a church because she moved out at 16 because her parents were abusive and she joined for the community. She left the church when she realized that every friend she made there was entirely fake. She slowly stopped participating in church activities and volunteering and realized that her “friends” never even noticed she had stopped. To the point where 5 years after she had left the church she’d have people not even noticing she had left asking her to volunteer for things.
Aktully! They've just had an online survey in Ukraine which has shown that about 60% of respondents are going to celebrate Christmas on 25th.
