Qatar just killed a couple thousand people they were holding as slaves in order to build a stadium for a sporting event that a majority of the world watched and did business with.
Violent Religious fundamentalists ruling a nation. Bound to turn out awesome for everyone. Sure to be a winner on the economic front. Where do I invest?
Exactly. I don't feel bad for this plight they had all of the resources available to them for years and years. Friends of mine and of my family died for change in that region so it's a slap in the face they didn't last more than a few months without us.
I'm currently seeking economic self-sufficiency and foreign investment. I have 2 rolls of paper towels, and forbid anyone who enters my house from reading. The flood gates are open!
And then there is of course the minority of people who attended who are just fucking assholes that would be perfectly happy to have a return to slavery and brutality in their own countries and see nothing wrong with Qatar's way of conducting their business.
