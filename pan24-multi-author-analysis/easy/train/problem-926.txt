Funnily enough, the best Android phone brand for privacy is Google Pixel, although only because you can actually remove almost all of the tracking, unlike most (read: all) other Android brands.
Yes. Final assembly like a car only on a smaller scale. It's not like making a lego set though. There are small, despite things like flexes that have to be routed and connected. Robots are not good at this.
Unfortunately, no one is doing that because the factors that make some areas of North America good for electronics manufacturing didn't fully exist back in the 2000s, meaning Apple and the other smartphone manufacturers opened their factories in China. Sunk cost is a big factor, and the infrastructure needed for smartphones manufacturing isn't cheap to set up. This has resulted in smartphone manufacturing staying in China even when their operating costs are higher than a hypothetical North American equivalent would be.
No. It's not as simple as you make. The designs are very complex. A small company is not going to find it financially attractive to create a design from the ground up even with every datasheet available.
So you'd need to make it such that small companies can get access to Qualcomm reference designs and all the technical documentation (including datasheets) for those designs.
They'd need access to reference boards (of that design) too and Qualcomm charges for those so you'd need to fix some kind of price for that.
