I think that is a can of worms that should be opened, but thatâ€™s for another day. More related to the issues of refugees, I think there are ways to delineate the the two. For example, if the war that people are forced to participate in is primarily offensive versus defensive, if there is evidence that those forced to serve are not being adequately trained/equipped, and/or if there is no route for conscientious objectors to avoid being forced into the war.
This should be such a slam dunk. How the hell better can you help Ukraine than by assisting in the draining of Russia's conscriptable manpower? They should be giving out cash rewards to every draft dodger who crosses the border. Encourage more to do it!
Unfortunately I'm not surprised, the EU countries' migration agencies have been treating russian asylum applicants extremely harshly since forever, going as far as to deport LGBT couples and political activists facing death threats while saying "Russia is a democratic country, you're not under threat".
