Russia: Family arrested at a Krasnodar restaurant "Na Drovoi" for having an anti-war conversation. Person overheard Olesya & Alexei Ovchinnikov's table conversation and called the police. Police arrested them at the restaurant and took away their 9-year-old child.
I'm able to rate and write community notes, and since I was allowed to rate these notes I don't think I've seen a single Ukraine related tweet, it's been 99% US specific political lies (for (extremely stupid) example senator Jet Howard of the twatwangle party said Steven Bills of the Dickfart party has been embezzling 7,0000,0000 dollars and then the community note I have to rate just says "no he hasn't" with definitive proof that he hasn't).
Pretty much this. It’s like, “guys, what if we just said we won Then the Ukrainians will be demoralized and have to leave, right?” Like everything else the Russians come up with, it’s ill conceived and poorly executed.
Absolutely. They also know western aid is coming. Big time. They're not trying to drag this out; they're desperate to take as much land as possible before the Ukrainians get better weapons. People keep excusing Russian incompetence as a "strategy" of some sort. Dragging out a war where your enemy is getting resupplied by richer allies makes no sense. Russia simply can't take anything other than nominal amounts of land because their military simply sucks.
