Ya I wasn’t prepared. It bothered me for a long time. Stuck in my head. As the years pass, I don’t think of it as often, except when it pops up like now. If a movie does that to me, I am just so sad & mad for all those having such terrifying experiences in reality. PTSD is real. There should be more support worldwide for it. I’m in Canada where the help is free, plus many benefits cover private counsellors, or other ones are subsidized based on your income. Employers are more supportive than previous years, there’s job protection when dealing with mental health, & many employers have counsellors paid for by phone or online to help you in meantime. The provinces have provided some free therapy online as well since the pandemic started.
Nothing inspires loyalty like draconian cruelty. In a firefight it’s going to be tough to tell which direction that 7.62mm round came from that hit the boss.
Russian mercenary companies? Weaponized rape, mutilation, murder, these are all to be expected when the whole point of hiring them is that they will terrorize the population.
