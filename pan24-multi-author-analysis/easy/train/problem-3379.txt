Airline seats in economy are too small, that is just a fact. If you have ever sat next to an obese person and they insist on pulling the armrest up so they can fit it’s even worse. I feel sorry for them but, hell, I payed for my seat and to have it be even smaller because their body is spilling into my seat is just not acceptable.
Finally. As someone who flys every week for work, this should be the norm. Other passengers shouldn’t be made to suffer cause your fatass won’t fit in a seat.
As a 6'5", so-broke-I-can't-pay-attention-so-I-fly-economy-everywhere-I-go man this is just a fact. The limits of economy air travel is not limited to width, but lenh as well.
Seriously. If being called a fattie mcfatterson made them lose weight, don’t you think that would have worked by now?

And she gets obsessive about how much she eats and how inactive she is when she goes up or down, which, proportionately, is roughly 2x my weight gain/loss.
