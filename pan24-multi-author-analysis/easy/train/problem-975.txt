many people are saying we have a lot of Evidence, there's been so many tremendously horrible things that have been done by the Democrats, because they hate your Favorite President, even though I've done a lot, way way more than even Abraham Lincoln, Honest Abe they called him, he chopped down that Cherry Tree and he probably shouldn't have told anybody but that's ok, we know that we're smarter than that, and we've done so much more, you would've never even had a Tax Cut if it wasn't for Trump. I did more to Lower Taxes, more to even save us from Obama and Crooked Hillary, but the Fake News would never tell you that, and our Beautiful Country was never stronger, we always did the Pledge under Trump, but now that the Radical Left did an Illegal Coup against me we've had nothing but problems, it's a real shame. Ben Franklin is probably Turning Over In His Grave, just like the Great Ronald Reagan, for how I've been treated. Reagan, he liked me a lot, he said to me, "Sir, you'll be President one day," and I said everybody knows that. we have a World you know that right, and it used to be Incredible Under Trump, just like Under God we say Under Trump, it's really great, and now we have probably more than any other Nation in the History Of Our World. ok, you can have a wonderful weekend, just remember you would've never even had it this good if I didn't fire Comey, you're welcome.
Exactly. Trump was clueless, and it was Hannity who was coaching him and holding his hand for years.
