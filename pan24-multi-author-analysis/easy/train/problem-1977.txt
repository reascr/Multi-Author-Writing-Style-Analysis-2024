So everytime NATO leaders meet it is article 4? I wouldn't say it is something it is not. The NATO leaders met because well, it was probably an event worth meeting over to discuss, but maybe not in the context of article 4.
Absolutely. I cannot imagine being the guy who had to tell Putin that it happened. The Poles are barely restrained, on a fraying tether. They’ve been a NATO member since ‘99, and they’ve definitely got first-rate weapons, training, and equipment. There must be a huge, collective sigh of relief that they seem to be amenable to the idea that it was a Ukrainian stray.
Absolutely not. The US is gaining economic access to new markets, establishing trade routes, losing one of its fiercest competitors in several industries, making countries dependent on them, and improving their overall geopolitical position.
