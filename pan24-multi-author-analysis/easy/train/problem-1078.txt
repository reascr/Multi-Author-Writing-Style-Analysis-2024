Most Indian reservations are near either: superfund sites, lithium deposits, mining deposits, or toxic waste dumping. A lot of that is because during the 20th century, there was a lot of industrial expansion west, and most of the Indian reservations in the US are west of the Mississippi. Since the reservations are already on some of the shittiest land available(and this is well documented as being very calculated), they were not considered worth prioritizing, along with the obvious racism.
Thank you. Your response is the only one that did a good job of starting to dissect the extra nuances going on. I think the biggest thing I'm trying to understand is the contrast between white rich people being brought up in a super site versus the Indian reservations being the other example. I think you started to dissect that as they are made super sites for different reasons or at least held to different standards? There's a bit of a Chasm between the first paragraph and the second final point that I was trying to understand.
