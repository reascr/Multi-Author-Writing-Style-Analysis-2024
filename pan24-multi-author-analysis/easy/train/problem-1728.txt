After that, then we can discuss security, increased issues and vulnerability with centralized banks of highly sensitive information, data breaches, identity theft, ransomware, human error etc. and of course privacy issues. Governments get hacked all the time and this infrastructure has a big shiny red target on it. Third party corporations working in tandem with the government just get a treasure trove of new data points, provide another access point of vulnerability, and another way to profit off human beings data being treated as a commodity.
No,they can't. Because -as you said yourself- "that would be beyond the Great Firewall of China that is easy to get around anyway.".
If you look at what the end goal of digital id is, the objective is to have all your banking information and transactions, taxes, purchases, internet activities, medical information, social media etc. data centralized, captured and tracked. All of it. You have zero privacy. And then have government banks digitized with digital currency (CBDC's) tied to your digital id. Please actually read the entire, long term plan and educate yourself before you start cheerleading this bs.
