Nicholas the II worried that revolution might come to Russia and make it incapable of continuing to fight the war. A guy by the name of Lvov came to Nicholas, this was a lesser prince in Russia. Lvov convinced Nicholas the II to abdicate the throne and allow a government lead by him to rule.
Had Nicholas the II not abdicated the throne, he might still be alive. But that's not how history happened.
It's not a distortion of events, it's history as it happened. It's not a what if situation like you're proposing (WHAT IF HE NEVER WENT TO WAR DURING WW1) it's actually how it ran down. His decision to give up power sank him.
This is obvious government propaganda tactics in skewing historical and nationalist sentiment into something that fits it's narrative.
What? Napoleon did something to Russia. You would have thought that Russia might have mentioned something like that in the over 200 year since it happened? /s.
So many other governments use and manipulate history, cultural and civilizational sentiment in order to justify the terrible things they have done and continue to do.
