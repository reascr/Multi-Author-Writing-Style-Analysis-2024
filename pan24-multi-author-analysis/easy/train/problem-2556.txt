I saw a skirmish with armed militants in some part of Iran a couple of days ago. Honestly countries need to employ some good ol Cold War diplomacy and fund the dickins out of separatist groups and revolutionary forces. Best case scenario Iran regime falls and is replaced with one that represents the will of the people. Worst case scenario it devolves into many warlord group vying for control of different parts of Iran, fuckin the Iranian governments ability to do basically anything but attempt to put them down. Either scenario screws over the Iranian government heavily which i think is good. They need to be brought down.
There is no way a law allowing military to act in such a way would get voted on by a majority of Congress, and furthermore US military officers specifically take no oath to the President at all, while they do take an oath specifically to uphold the Constitution, and in addition the Uniform Code of Military Justice dictates several times that all members of the military are obligated to refuse immoral and illegal orders.
