The article says that "many [gunmen] then shared their own plans online. Forty-four percent of mass shooters leaked their plans, often posting about it on social media.".
I think right-wingers occasionally cling to those similar ideologies for the same reasons of blame (like those struggling to make a living in rural towns, blue-collar workers being taken advantage of looking for someone to blame for it), but I think it's more often encouraged by fear-mongering originating from those who simply find a way to profit off other's fears, like politicians creating a fear of 'the other' and claiming "they're threatening our way of life, targeting our children, taking our mounds of hard-earned money and jobs that we don't want".
No. What the person was saying is untrue. These mass shooters usually don't conform to any left wing/ right wing ideology. Mostly they follow their own warped ideologies.
Absolutely. Of course starting with the biggest narcissist of them all, trump. But so many others in this cult, as well. Have you heard OathKeeper leader, Rhodesâ€™ testimony at his trial? Unfuckingbelieveable, his narcissism is off the charts.
