People who couldn't have given fewer fucks about the Apple walled garden model a week ago are now raving about the dangerous duopoly of the App Store and the Google Play store. Which, number one, welcome to the party pal People have been complaining about the lack of a third party app store on iPhones for a dog's age Second of all, there are so many other smartphones out there, and Google Play Store allows far more kinds of content than Apple, so if you really just want Twitter on your phone, go fucking buy one of the hundreds of phones that runs Android!
People lie. Words can be tailored to the audience. But actions speak louder than words. Actions don’t lie. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. The GOP needing to have an emergency convo with Tim Cook over Twitter should be as obvious as a shout into a bullhorn. They don’t give a shit about “free speech” or “free markets”. They want their friends to be able to say racists shit on Twitter. Because that’s where their votes come from. Full stop.
