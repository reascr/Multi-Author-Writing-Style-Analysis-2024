It is not written anywhere. But...with Trump we need to continue covering the disintegration of what is left of his sick mind...he is falling even with some of his base. If you ignore him, I guarantee people will forget how bad he is and reconsider him in 2024. Pound him into the ground...pulverize him...never let up. I can do that and talk progressive policy at the same time.
> No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.
