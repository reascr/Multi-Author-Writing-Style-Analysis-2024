You dont have to peddle for the US Military Industrial Complex my guy, they make enough money as it is. Also US arm sales to Ukraine have been happening since 2014 and continued to 2017 until Trump stopped the sales and then sales resumed in 2021 under Biden. How many times was Ukraine invaded in 2016 or 2021. This argument only makes sense if you only knew were Ukraine was on a map in 2022.
This whole argument only makes sense if Ukraine as a state only exists in 2014, spoiler it existed before that. Also Crimea was resolved in 2015 cause it also corresponded with the US military unwillingness to take up Syria against Assad. The revolution in Ukraine had the support of maybe 40% of the population almost entirely based in Western Ukraine while the rest of the country remained neutral or supported the former government isnt some popular revolution. The UN got involved with Russia not even on the agreement of Minsk 2 while the US France and UK signed a deal holding Ukraine to Minsk 2. Ukraine violated Minsk 2 on every front with its paramilitary groups that they acknowledged were doing war crimes in Eastern Ukraine. Im not saying this isnt a Putin war of aggression but resolving the issues of all involved is true diplomacy and peace. Dont give Putin the perfect reason to kill everyone when he wants to. Letting a bunch of civilian die for your sensibilities is awful as well.
