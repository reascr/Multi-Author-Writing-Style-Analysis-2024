Any ceasefire with Russia is bound to be temporary, as nothing has changed within Russia that would alter its ultimate intent to conquer all of Ukraine. At the moment, the Ukrainians are successfully retaking territory invaded by the Russians earlier this year. A ceasefire would advantage Russia militarily, as it would give them time to train their mobilized troops, refill their dwindling munitions supplies, et cetera. Therefore it would be a very bad move to Ukraine to accept a ceasefire at this time.
The French also had military superiority over the Nazis in almost every military category before the invasion (and was arguably the stronger army in the world in 1939) but French military doctrine had decided that a top-down 'methodical warfare' approach could overcome improvised quick assaults based on their experiences in WWI so their battlefield leadership were wholly unprepared to act autonomously as was required by those mechanized assaults (French field leader were largely out of contact with strategic leadership while the German were using wireless communications giving them yet another tactical advantage).
