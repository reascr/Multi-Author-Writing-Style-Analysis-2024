I work in the medical field, and I got my mom, who has been pro-life their whole life, to understand why abortion bans are so dangerous and wrong. They now support pro-choice. She has said, “I understand that many abortions are medically necessary…I just don’t like it when it’s used as a form of birth control, but that’s not my business and I’m working on that”. I was so proud of that last remark. She also has started to really become perturbed and infuriated with men controlling women…..especially government and men in power. In every way they do still try to control us. Our bodies. Our clothes. She is so DONE and FED UP with misogyny (another term I explained to her). We even have had great conversations about pronouns, and she asks questions, and has been working to understand the LGBTQ+ community (I am bisexual. So I’ve been educating her on that community, since I am a part of it and it’s very important).
