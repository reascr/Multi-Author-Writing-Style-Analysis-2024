Wish we could just have facts and world news without biased opinion… it’s wild how quickly social media, and media in general, has divided and fractured humanity so severely. Whether you’re left or right, you cannot 100% trust what you’re being told, as both sides have agendas that have to do with manipulating, influencing, and controlling us. Is it even possible to get away from this extreme division and pendulum swings? On this course it seems like eventually people will be so worn out from division, that they vote for some masterful oratory authoritative leader, who promises to lead us all for a lifetime, rather than the 8 years max before the pendulum swings again….
Liar. He was so far up Trumps ass. He used his platform to lie about Obamas birtherism which all the sheeple ate up and still question today. He had and still has a cult following that believes his trash. He was once characterized as Trumpys shadow chief of staff. He’s a blight and a straight up liar.
