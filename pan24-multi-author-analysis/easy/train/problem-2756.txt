He’s got all the shitty ideas and world view Trump had, but packaged in a guy that can get things done. It’s way worse.
“Trump, who is addicted to his own press, appears to have noticed the vibe shift in Murdoch-land, and spent Thursday morning in meltdown mode on Truth Social, where he screeched, among other things, “For me, Fox News was always gone, even in 2015-16 when I began my ‘journey,’ but now they’re really gone.” He also told people to “remember” that he is a “Stable Genius,” which you know is true because he inexplicably capitalized both words.”.
Hi lotta_love. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
Desantis isn’t necessarily intelligent, but he’s far more competent & capable. Trump was so easily distracted and unable to really execute on most of his ideas. He was in it for the grift, and it never really seemed to occur to him that he could’ve had a much bigger score if he didn’t smash & grab right away. Desantis knows how the game is played, and how to make things happen.
