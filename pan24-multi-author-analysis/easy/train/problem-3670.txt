I don't think you can compare it to Embraer's regional jets. Operators seem to have a much greater respect for jets than they have for turboprops, simply because jets seem more modern (despite the fact a turboprop is just a jet turbine driving a propeller).
This is insane! By far the sketchiest flight I’ve ever been on was from the Lukla airport to the Tumlinar airport. It was a short flight but we were on a pretty small propeller plane and caught some heavy turbulence to the point where the majority of the passengers were screaming. To make it even scarier was that about 2 weeks prior, one of the four planes this airline had (Summit Air) crashed on takeoff from Lukla. The wrecked plane was still there when I flew in. Because of that, KTM temporarily cancelled all flights to and from Lukla, so we had to take a long and uncomfortable bus ride to Khandbari to take the flight from Tumlinar airport to Lukla. The flight back to Tumlinar was the sketchy one.
Pretty accurate description. A disturbing video but I have watched worse (and no I do not watch nacro videos, some descriptions I have read made me deeply uncomfortable. That shit is too messed up.).
Fucking heartbreaking. 250 kids just doing as they’re told because they have no reason to think the crew doesn’t know what they’re doing or doesn’t have their safety at heart.
