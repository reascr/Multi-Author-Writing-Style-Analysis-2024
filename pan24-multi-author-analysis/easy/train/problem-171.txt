Again, same as homosexuality. If you can have a picture on your teachers desk of your wife and family as a hetrosexual person, then there's literally no reason to deny the same for a homosexual person as being homosexual is no more sexual a state than hetrosexual is, and that's it in a nutshell. You can't define a innocuous concept as sexual in one context and not in the other when they are literally the same thing to kids. No kid is going to question a same-sex spousal relationship unless they are raised by bigoted parents who have quite literally indoctrinated them into rejecting the very existence of homosexuality.
