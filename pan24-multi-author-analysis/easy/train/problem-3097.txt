In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Thanks. I am an old-fashioned hippie who used to be a journalist. I always keep in my address the name, phone, fax, mail address and e-mail of all of my representatives at local, county, state and federal levels, as well as current media representatives. One letter/e-mail can be sent to multiple people with the CC's displayed so they all know who is reading. Hard copies sent via U.S. postal service, signed in blue ink, especially on one's own personal stationery work best. Simultaneously I make phone and fax messages. I care enough to keep trying.
= normalising Lies + distractions + Projections + repetitive Propaganda + lowering expectations of truthfulness.
Nope. It just doesnâ€™t work that way. Shit redditors say. No executive is required to do things like that. I have been an executive at companies and worked with executives at much larger ones. They often care very much about doing the right thing.
