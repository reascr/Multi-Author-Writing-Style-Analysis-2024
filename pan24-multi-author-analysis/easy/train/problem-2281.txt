My state, Nebraska, is trying for a six-week ban, which will be a complete ban. We have a 20-week ban right now. In their press conference, the woman who introduced the bill said they have met all the criteria of what "the opposition" wants and are offering a paltry "annual $10 million tax credit for donations to pregnancy help organizations — those that provide free services that 'help women carry their pregnancy to term, encourage and enable parenting or adoption, and promote healthy childbirth,'”.
Anyway…. I know that doesn’t help you or make you feel better about your situation. I’m sorry you are stuck in such a backwards place right now. The women of Nebraska (Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, etc) do not deserve to go through this. There have already been numerous horror stories and sadly there will be more. I am privileged enough to live in a state that has codified abortion rights into our state constitution. I hope someday Nebraska will do the same.
Conservatives? That’s a rally nice word to call them. It’s funny when you call your oppressors their preferred name. I call them a communist cult. That’s what they are.
