I think you’re absolutely right. It’s Trumps party and he’s their best chance at winning. But there is one strategy that is better for them that I think they are attempting. The GOP field is going to embrace Trump’s ideology, say the same divisive “own the libs” buzzwords to speak to this far right MAGA voters, while trying to appeal to moderate conservatives and independents. They will try and put Trump in the too old/too much baggage/too extreme category, while spouting off the same extremist rhetoric, but balance it with moderate talking points. Trump was never the type of politician who would change his talking points based on who he was in front of. Someone like DeSantis will. He will be the guy MAGAs want him to be in one setting, and he’ll be the Jeb Bush type in front of others. Both sides of the conservative spectrum will convince themselves that he’s actually theirs, that he’s actually moderate and not MAGA, and vice versa. What remains to be seen is if the MAGA crowd can be convinced that Trump is yesterday’s news, and whether or not Trump will burn it all down if he fails to get the nomination.
