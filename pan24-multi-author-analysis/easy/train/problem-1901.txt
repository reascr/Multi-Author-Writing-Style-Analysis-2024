Its all just old deranged leaders clinging to power, throwing populations into the meat grinder of war so they don't have to personally face a retirement.
Hahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahaahhahaha. The Belarusian military is minuscule compared to Russia. Before this war Russia was considered the second maybe third best military behind America. Now, look at them buying artillery shells from north Korea and missiles/drones from. Iran. Belarus would just be a speed bump for Ukraine at this point. Not to mention the horrible morale problem in their military and the fact that they get most(all) of their military supplies from Russia. You are either horrible uninformed or you have Putins dick so far up your ass your essentially giveing him a blow job.
No it actually undermines their already nonexistent legitimacy. "special military operations" don't have allies and multiple partners in actual war. Yes we all know what this really is but they're pretending to technically tiptoe around certain labels. Belarus, using something like this as a justification for unequivocal war makes Russia's propaganda 10x more difficult.
