Many people in Germany claimed after the war that they didn't know what was happening to all the jews, yet at the same time Goebbels was able to find enough people to cheer to his "wollt ihr den totalen Krieg" speech and people on the outside (or smarter people on the inside) didn't know how that could be. I think we see that again here... The grim reality is propaganda works. If the only language you understand is Russia (Insert any language here really) and your only Information is government controlled bullshit, you soak it up when you just suck at critical thinking, which unfortunately is a brain function of higher order that develops very late if at all. Many people are simply born to be just part of a herd, follow instructions blindly and don't question anything. Gullibility is as much a human trait as enlightenment, maybe even the default.
Exactly. Although I would say we are understanding it now. It's called "I am Russian and that makes me special". Fuck you, you're not fucking special you fucking humans.
