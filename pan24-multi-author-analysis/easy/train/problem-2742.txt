I never heard about the death of the tank until about a month ago, and I haven't once ben convinced that a mobile high-powered cannon when used in an open field, that can penetrate any and all bunkers and fortifications in rapid succession... will ever become obsolete compared to a foot soldier with a Javelin. Only one can run up on ya whole gang.
Knowing my country arms history - we will probably come up with some sort of upgraded South Korean tank in future, like we did with PT91 Twardy or like we did it with assault rifle Beryl, where we took old soviet concept and made it different/better/up to NATO standards.
