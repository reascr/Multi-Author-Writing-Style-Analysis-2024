In addition to Census Bureau ACS data every federal election year, and their "reasons for not voting" survey, many studies and observations suggest a correlation between a strong social safety net and voter turnout:
James Avery: "...I find that states with greater income bias in turnout have higher levels of income inequality than states with greater parity in voter turnout across income levels, findings that are robust across various model specifications...".
James Avery and Mark Peffley: "We find that in states where lower-class voter turnout was comparable to that of the upper class, lawmakers were less likely to pass restrictive welfare eligibility rules.".

Uneducated voters are simple creatures. This is often why the candidate with the most money wins. All it takes is 1 doubt, 1 reason of concern, or a connection with 1 other politician that they hate and poof, thatâ€™s all they need to make up their mind. Forget watching debates and reading their stances and voting history.
