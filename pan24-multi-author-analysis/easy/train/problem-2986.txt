in westminster systems the governing party(ies) usually command a majority of seats anyway, and in FPTP countries like the UK and Canada with single party government it is usually intra-party squabbling that brings governments down, unlike what the US sees with a president and two houses that could all disagree with each other.
Played ball how? Outlawed abortion or banished all LBTQ people. Or how about if they cancelled social security and Medicare. Perhaps they could kick out all the muslims and bring back slavery. No wait I know, they could help privatize education. Maybe if they just went ahead and abolished all labour laws and gave corporations control of the natural resources. Or they could help the GOP stop taxing the rich people and get all the poor people to pay the taxes required to fund the military. And finally to really play ball, cancel all elections and appoint the republicans to elected positions. Then maybe, and I say this with all sincerity, if they did all that the GOP would vote to raise the debt ceiling. But they still probably wouldnâ€™t if it was the Democrats wanting to raise it.
