Daylight saving time is fundamentally broken and creates more problems than it is worth, especially when you consider that first light is supposed to trigger people to begin to wake up and the jarring effect it has completely screws our natural rhythms up. Switching clocks twice a year is the worst thing we do and if we had to pick one we should use standard time. On standard time sunrise swings from about 430am to 730am meaning morning commutes will typically be during the daylight hours. On daylight saving time it is 530am to 830am which leaves us with driving after waking up in the dark as well as going to school in the dark when people are most groggy.
Exactly! It's much easier for our brains to accept early nighttime than late morning. All these people in northern states insisting that they want a half hour of light after they come home from work are underestimating how oppressive the dark mornings will be for them (I've seen people in the thread saying 9 am sunrise would be okay). People in northern states experiencing severe depression in the 70s when they tried permanent DST is WHY they repealed it so quickly. Every expert on sleep says the same thing: permanent standard time is much much better for our natural sleep patterns.
