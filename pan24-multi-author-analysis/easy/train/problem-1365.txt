EDIT: Basically there's a saying about the 3 Great Unifiers of Japan. One day, Oda Nobunaga heard of a marvelous nightingale that could sing the sweetest music. Desiring to hear this heavenly sound, he sent for the bird, but when he demanded that it sing to him it was silent. Angry, Oda pulled out his katana, intent on killing the stubborn bird. But before Nobunaga could kill the bird, Toyotomi Hideyoshi stepped in, saying that if the bird won't sing by choice, Hideyoshi will make it sing with force. Hideyoshi grabbed the bird and squeezed it tight, but the nightingale did not even peep. Frustrated, Hideyoshi let the bird go and walked away in a huff. Finally, Tokugawa Ieyasu took his turn with the bird. He looked at the bird, admiring its lovely plumage and strong spirit, and said that if the nightingale won't sing, Tokugawa would leave it alone until it did. So Tokugawa sat, and admired the bird, and did not try to kill it or squeeze it. A sense of calm and serenity swept over the scene, and finally, the nightingale sang.
Putin has disbanded the territory councils permanently. The last remnants of old democracy are gone now. Fear will keep the territories in line, fear of this battle force….what’s that? It’s just farmers with muskets…and rusty tools for bayonets? Wth man. I had this cool speech going.
Remember the Russian portable crematoriums? Once cremated, the soldier is given missing status and no longer qualifies for a free automobile for the family.
