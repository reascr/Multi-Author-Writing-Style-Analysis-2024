Russia is trying (not so successfully in many cases) to train and equip large numbers (though it now needs to mobilize many more troops, and outfit and train them) before it can undertake any renewed large scale offensive likely in February/March. Their big problem right now they're struggling to hold their remaining gains - they're buying time in large part with lives of conscripts and prisoners - and they're worried Ukraine will launch another big offensive in a few weeks, as soon as the ground is a little harder and some more of the promised weapons arrive. With a decent breakthrough they could well drive through to (say) Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia and if that happens their rocket artillery could effectively split the Russian forces in two. That would leave Russia in a big hole, likely worse off than before February.
Mobilisation never really stopped. They just call it "normal autumn (or winter) conscription" now, which they could only do because they "stopped" mobilisation - it's the same set of staff doing both.
