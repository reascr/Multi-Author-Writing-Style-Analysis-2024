but I doubt it's a ddos, I suppose they could null route the traffic if that were the case but /shrug.
But sadly another part of me also knows that things only build up from conflict and wars, we didn't get here as a society from fighting no wars, all the wars we got into put us into gear for a certain amt of time until our next war, the cold war only stagnated us, and Vietnam was completely our fault, nobody has any fight left so they are just trying to tamper with elections, control the youth generation, and be as predatory as possible, always adding new laws but never new rights, or revoking any, to take our rights away, so that little part in me knows that deep inside, we may need a war to fix us tf up and get our head back on, but I also don't want to be that one human thats just born into the face of WWIII and sees all the horribleness of humanity just cause some old dudes really were trying to control and have dominance over the planet, when we could've focused on ourselves a bittt more like China and Japan did and been wayyy further in other aspects and not just military, if we had our own supply, with better technology to supply the military, working on our air defense, better policies in place, we would be already be a threat that no one wants to mess with period.
This is actually easier than you might think. The internet uses a thing called the boarder gateway protocol(bgp) which is like a google maps for internet traffic. You can setup your own bgp if you want. Iirc most servers have their own bgp to tell the internet how they can be found. You can reconfigure these things pretty easily so that any/all traffic on the internet goes through your server. There have been several large incidents over the years. One time youtube missconfigured one and started getting every piece of traffic that China generated (including classified stuff).
