Same in my experience and now they've become militarized. Watch any random brutal cop encounter and just as often as not, you see cops demanding over and over that the victim "lay down", "put (their) hands behind (their) back" and etc., while other cops in the pile prevent the victim from doing so. This angers the first cop who then starts beating the crap out of them and the cop preventing the movement that the first cop is demanding joins in. In the aftermath, they always stand around and talk smack about the event. Make no mistake, this is every police officer in the United States, every day. They live to abuse because it makes them feel powerful. This isn't how police officers are supposed to behave, it's how thugs and bullies behave. We used to train police officers in law enforcement, not far too many departments accept military combat experience IN LIEU OF a law enforcement degree but these things are not the same. In fact combat and law enforcement couldn't be less similar.
Really? It's clearly the opposite in the current environment. Police brutality against whites occurs in far higher numbers than against any other race just by dint of the fact that whites make up the majority of the population, but you don't hear about it anywhere near as much because it isn't as politically fraught. Killing a black man is a sure fire way to get on the front page, killing a white man is a stat.
