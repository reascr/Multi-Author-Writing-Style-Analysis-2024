I understand completely where you are coming from. For me it was probably 55 years ago. Nobody liked me or wanted me on their team until there was a deadline to get a homework assignment turned in. Then everybody wanted to be my friend. I have had the opportunity to travel for work or recreation to many areas of the world. Just as a general observations it always seemed that Asian cultures expressed a high value for education. When I grew up a strong "herd mentality" was better accepted even if it meant taking pride in ignorance. Maybe, here in the US, we are suffering from the same "herd mentality" and an associated problem with "herd influence". We need to learn to value thinkers as much as we do our sports heroes, entertainers, and nasty mouthed politicians.
American exceptionalism is that America is exceptional: America is fundamentally different from other nations. This actually isn't about being fundamentally the best at all or even fundamentally positive, just that the American experience is different than other nations.
