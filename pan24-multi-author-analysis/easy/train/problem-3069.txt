Old and crappy revolvers you have to manually cock the hammer every time with your thumb. Like how they always show in the movies.
That being said, the point isnt that the US is an active warzone, but rather, that between the already absurdly high mass shooting rate (another uniquely american thing among western countries) and the push for expanded concealed carry laws, the US is a lot closer to failed states such as Afghanistan or Somalia, than it is to modern and functional countries like the ones mentioned above, in this regard.
Yes? I live in a disaster prone area. We have probably been under evac orders a half dozen times since ive lived her, and state of emergency even more than that. So far every time its happened, order was restored and police resumed responding within 3-5 days, maybe a week or two for some hard hit areas.
Exactly. If I’m in hunting areas it’s common to see people with guns, but I’ve never seen dudes just walking around Walmart with AK47s and AR-15s. People seem to think that’s how it is everywhere in the US just because it’s legal.
