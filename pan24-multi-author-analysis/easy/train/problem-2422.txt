Last gasp by Putin as his war is officially a failure as today is the and was to be the day he planned to present the reconstituted borders of the old Soviet Union. Trump was to have pulled the US out of NATO at the last minute before the war started leaving Europe alone in defending Ukraine. With little defenses and no real NATO Russia was to have marched on to retake all the old soviet states in a glorious rewriting of history which and blamed the previous Russian leadership for allowing it to happen.
I don't think so. The russian army's original plan was to invade in January and use armor columns to subdue the cities. But for political reasons Putin delayed until the muddy season in late february, and that's the reason why the Russian military's plan failed so spectacularly. I think their thought process is "we'll just do it right this time." If it works, Ukraine will be ready to go to the negotiating table with the understanding Russia will just do this every year and Russia will be ready to negotiate from a face-saving position. If it fails, I don't see how the Russian military leadership holds itself together behind the war effort. They'll basically just feel it was doomed from the beginning or that its unsalvagable: but either way Russia would probably give up. So I think there's actually pretty good chance of peace negotiations this spring.
