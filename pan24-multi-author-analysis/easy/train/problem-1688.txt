This is what I understood at the time of the announcement - Germany asked the US to "commit" tanks to appease internal political objections, so Germany could more easily approve their own tanks. The US can't just roll out Abrams and hand over the keys. They need an extensive supply and maintenance chain that would either take years to train Ukrainians on, or would require US soldiers in Ukraine. So, it's not happening this year, or possibly even next year, unless we are sending hundreds of soldiers to "advise" (a la Vietnam). Its a smokescreen.
It has to do with the armor, the US Abrams have super special armor that we dont give out, so when we do sell them its a different kind of armor, now we may hve 1000s of them sitting in storage, they are just not the ones we export, so new ones had to be made, and it would take congress to pass something to allow us to export the special ones, kind of like the F-22 we dont even give that to our allies, the special armor is the same, some kind of depleted uranium and ceramic blend.
WTF? Are they manufacturing brand new systems? Fairly certain it takes less than a few weeks to query, organize, and group 31 tanks from our existing armament.
