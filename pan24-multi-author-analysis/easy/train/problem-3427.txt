His bankruptcies are not really his bankruptcies. They are his business' bankruptcies. The owner of a business is shielded by law from the debts of his business. Trump extracted billions from his businesses over the decades as any owner has the right to do. Trump is the kind of guy who will exploit any loophole his lawyers and accountants find for him. He borrowed billions of dollars and just paid himself a huge salary from that money, and didn't use it to grow his business to create more revenue. He just had his business declare bankruptcy and screwed the creditors since he isn't personally responsible for his company's debts.
Exactly. This is the sort of "bend over backwards to rescue the Republicans" bullshit that Democrats love to do. They all have the same donors, nobody wants change, and as long as the Republicans exist, the Dems can get along by just being "not as bad".
Unreal. Garland's DOJ has charged some 900 people and convicted over 600. His dept has a near perfect record, so far.
