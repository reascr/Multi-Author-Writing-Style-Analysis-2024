You say that.... when in 2 years the "other" party has cut the deficit in half. Literally. Halfway through an administration. During a massive recession. During a time where we're about to hit WW3. We've cut more money out of the budget than almost ever before. One party did that, and they do something similar every single time they've been in control. Since I was a kid I even saw that from single digit ages, the GOP ruins the economy, and the DNC rebuilds it from a terrible starting position. At the time I didn't know what that meant between the parties, but it was a truism all that time ago and still is today. One party is fiscally responsible and always has been. You've just never looked, never admitted it, or been too enamored with the GOP's own press releases about themselves to notice. You aren't alone, but the facts have been there all your life. Sure as gravity pulls "down" and sure as you breathe air to live...

But you're not entirely wrong. Republicans are reckless with tax cuts and Democrats know how to keep the tax dollars flowing. They both eagerly pass new spending bills. Neither can show restraint.
