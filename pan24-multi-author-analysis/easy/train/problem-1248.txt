That gives us a month to enshrine reproductive rights. I see no problem. (Of course there is, because the GOP will summon Lucifer and wreak havoc on every other aspect of society, because—fun fact—Christian Nationalists don’t love either Christ’s words or the nation.).
In 1997 during the revolt against Gingrich, he refused to resign from the Speakership specifically because it would not result in the next ranking Republican taking it on but in a vote on a new Speaker; given how many Republicans wanted him out, it was possible some might switch to vote for the Democratic Minority Leader. He stayed on through the 1998 election and chose not to run for the next Speakership. (No I don’t know why a vacancy resolution didn’t happen.).
Personally I think it would be easier for the Democratic party to sort out House leadership struggles while in the minority, but Pelosi seems to be going the RBG route of assuming she's irreplicable and not doing anything to ensure a smooth transition to the next generation.
