It doesn't help to send rusty weapons and have conscripts purchase millitary surplus gear only to freeze in russian attrition due to lack of winter clothes. You're going to get a strenhed ukraine ready to fight your sad army or all the oblast land but ruined infrastructure, and whoever chose to stay in ukraine after a couple of mass exodus. You've lost business and international trust over recreating thicc russia. In the words of gene wilder, "you get nothing You lose Good day sir!".
Or did the heads of the russian military tell putin they had super advanced missiles, because the heads of the development team told them they had made super advanced missiles, because the development team said they were close to finishing the super advanced missiles, when in actuality the super advanced missiles never made it past the prototype phase and everyone at every level was just siphoning off money because it's not like they'll ever use the nukes anyway so no one will ever find out.
Now, I don't remember the names. But some king somewhere go taxes from different regions, he died, his son took over, one city stopped paying. He visited to demand the tax, and they brutally killed him.
