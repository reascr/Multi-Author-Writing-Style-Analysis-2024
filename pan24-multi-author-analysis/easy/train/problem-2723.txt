Nah people like that are disorganized sociopaths. This is how they operate. There is no intent behind the lies, it's a pathology. Unfortunately its a pathology that's supposed to represent the American people...
100%. Frankly, slave states should have been brought back into the US under territorial status, and after those generations died out, they could reapply for statehood and full voting rights. The idea of letting the losers in civil war regain their status as full citizens is a recent development of humanity, and it is an experiment that hasn’t worked out well. It is sad that Lincoln’s legacy will likely be tied to the fact that his decisions will have directly led to the coming conflict/civil war we are almost certain to see within our lifetimes.

I know right? The sad thing is knowing that if they were going to actually enact this it would have happened within weeks of J6. Other countries move A LOT faster with shit like this. America is always delayed because people have to feel out the "market" and yes I mean literal economic gains/losses for picking a side rather then do what's right. These people are going nowhere unless something changes...
