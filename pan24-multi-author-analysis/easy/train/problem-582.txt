From the best numbers I've seen so far, it looks like about 51% of the country voted for a Republican House candidate. Depending on the final results, that means that GOP representation in the House will probably be pretty close to the actual voter distribution, which is what you'd hope to see if gerrymandering were not an issue. Obviously with the way districts are set up across the states it's more complicated than that, and maybe Democrats would hold more seats if gerrymandering wasn't a thing, but I can't really call it an unfair result.
It was based on an analysis by Dave Wasserman, who's normally pretty good, but people are now pointing out that he might've messed up by counting votes in uncontested races, where would-be Democratic voters had no opportunity to be counted.
RIGHT??? I was like, if we actually elect a freakin meteorologist to be governor, im leaving the state. I don't agree with everything Grisham has done, but overall I'm happy with her. He looked like a train wreck just waiting to happen. Plus, his teeth were way too white.
