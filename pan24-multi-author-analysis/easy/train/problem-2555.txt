•	⁠staged a referendum to pass a law to give the Prime Minister “temporary” “emergency” power to unilaterally rewrite constitutional law. •	⁠voting for the referendum had different locations to vote “yes” and vote “no”. •	⁠all the “yes” locations were centrally located and easy to get to. •	⁠all the no locations were either in the middle of nowhere or in areas heavy with Mossedegh supporters. Both locations had pro-mossadegh street militias hanging out around them and looking at anyone funny who wanted to go in. •	⁠the vote passed 99:1 in a sham that might indicate despite the above polling location shenanigans they still just made up the numbers anyway. •	⁠Mossadegh then declared a state of emergency. •	⁠His first act was to make the power of the prime to write the constitution permanent and not dependent on a state of emergency. •	⁠all of parliament including large parts of Mossadeghs own party resigned in protest. •	⁠which was moot because Mossadegh’s second act was to dissolve parliament.
