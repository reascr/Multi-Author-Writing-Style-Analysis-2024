It's like he doesn't realize that there are WAY more people that have no problem with Jewish folks than people that hate them. When he ran, he chose the wrong side. Every 2 and 4 years, more and more old fashioned conservative thinkers like him are dying off while at the same time more and more young voters are turning 18 and are able to vote and as a demographic they are overwhelmingly open minded, kind hearted people who will vote Democrat. It's just painfully obvious that there are just millions and millions more Democrats than there are Republicans in the US and Democrats numbers grow every election. The Grand Old Party is just that, an old party. Just look at the Presidential Popular Vote results since 1992, Republicans have only out voted Democrats one time in the last 30 years. Screw the Electoral College! Lol.
They really are just clinging to propaganda, gerrymandering, and xenophobia. When's the last time they showed up with an actual idea that wasn't "tax giveaways to people wealthy enough that their great great great grandchildren can already retire".
