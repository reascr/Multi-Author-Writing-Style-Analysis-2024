Right? I look at the state of education and wonder how bad it’s going to be when my 2 yr old finally starts kindergarten. I waited till my mid 30’s to have him and I’m fairly financially stable. So I think maybe I’ll tighten the belt and send him to private school. And then I realize that that’s exactly what conservatives want. They want money to funnel to the private schools and public schools to funnel to low wage jobs and/or prison. I’m an educated person…educated enough to know that I’m not qualified to fill the gaps that private school leaves. But I’ll certainly do my best.

Incorrect. An employer is allowed to selectively enforce rules if it wants without legal consequences so long as the selection process is not based on a legally protected class such as gender, etc.
