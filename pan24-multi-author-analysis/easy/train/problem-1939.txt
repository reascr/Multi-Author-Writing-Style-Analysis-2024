Always conveniently leaving out the country that lied about WMDs in Iraq and gangbanged the place with its NATO buddies. So trustworthy.
Incorrect. Most hashes start from a seed that isn't random-enough. If I record an encrypted stream of long-enough size and I have the NSA's resources for compute, no algorithm in the world can prevent me from decrypting the stream given wall power and enough time. Good encryption builds the entropy (randomness) over several (like, 10^16) iterations to make this power/time requirement prohibitive to non-governmental actors. I have to certify my products to FIPS-140-3, this is a subject I'm familiar with. There are some Secure Hash Algorithms which are FIPS-certifiable, here's . The wiki article on AES-256 is kind of informative, too, mentioning HW acceleration as instruction sets in various processors. Since the US has the hardware that did the encryption and probably the ROM that the SW resides in (I say this because I believe the receiver for the balloon's flight-management/telecommand was probably 'blinded' by broad-spectrum noise (jammed) from Montanna to it's date with a Sidewinder over SC's coast, and thus was not command-wiped), I think this stream will have been 'broken' and decrypted.
