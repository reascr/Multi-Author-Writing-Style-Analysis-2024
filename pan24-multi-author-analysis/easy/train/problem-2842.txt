(you need 2.1 children per woman to have a perfect stable population, anything above that means growth.).
yeah they want highly qualified workers but what they actually need and what is in high supply is highly motivated and eager to learn people with a low technical background that dont just neatly integrate into their culture but have to learn language and customs - those who do the unpopular backbreaking work that probably is not fairly compensated and is shunned by the local population yet the income of the orkers in those sectors never rise.
Yup! South Korean here. I have no idea what my country is gonna look like in 50 years but I can tell it's gonna be BAD. It's been way too late about 10 years ago. I don't live in my country anymore and I don't intend to go back.
Interesting aspect. In Germany, we have a lot of things that are proposed in this thread; fewer work hours, longer vacations, extensive parental leave etc. But still the birth rate is low. France does all this, too and has markedly higher birth rates. The difference? Working mothers are much more accepted in France than in Germany. Child care is better organized and cheaper in France.
