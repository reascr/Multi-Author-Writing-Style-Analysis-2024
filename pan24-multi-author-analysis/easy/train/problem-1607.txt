Annexation of territory is a war crime yes. Additionally, when occupying territory there are laws you have to follow for it to not be a war crime, which Israel has violated. Even if you are the defender in the war, it is still a war crime to occupy their territory, and it should be noted that Israel was not the defender in the war, as they struck first, regardless of whether you think that was justified or not. As for the rest of that, that’s a wider discussion on the lasting effects of imperialism, although it’s also relevant that the laws Israel has violated did not exist for all of history, and laws are rarely applied retroactively.
Put up or shut up. A man who has praised trump (a known antisemite) has already showed his character. Also, a person who is trying to change the judiciary to be able to avoid ethical lawsuits can't be trusted. I rather clean asses than follow this clown.
UN Security Council Resolution 2334, condemning Israel’s violation of the 4th geneva convention, specifically their actions in illegally occupied territory.
