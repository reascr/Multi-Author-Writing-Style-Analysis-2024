One of the primary goals of the GOP is to show that “government doesn’t work” and do everything they can to prove it. It’s literally part of a plan laid out by archconservative billionaires to either completely dismantle the US government or turn it into a “libertarian” government. This plot is one reason why the majority of our Supreme Court justices are part of the Federalist Society, an organization essentially run by the likes of the Koch Brothers.

Hahahahahahaha ahahahahaha. I can’t even… what? This is the most basic thing a party can do and they can’t even Jesus Christ.
Democracy is majority consensus, generally speaking. No majority consensus has been reached, and it hasn't gotten to the point where they'll settle for a plurality because a majority is impossible. Like eh17368 said, you need 218 votes to win, since that is the majority (434 members in the house, currently). There's some additional rules that may lower that number, but that's the standard.
