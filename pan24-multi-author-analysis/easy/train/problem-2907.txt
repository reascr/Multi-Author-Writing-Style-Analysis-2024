At least in Canada (before 0% interest was a thing for most provinces and the fed level), if someone was making under a threshold, they would have their interest paid for them until they made more. And this applied for life of the loan. So losing your job you could call and the gov would pay your interest on your behalf for free. It was in effect a pause on the loan. But they did it this way because there were also sliding scale options where someone making just above the threshold had to make min pays that covered principal, plus some interest and any outstanding interest from the calculated sliding scale was paid by gov. There were no interest only payment options.
Absolutely. I was just staving off the inevitable comments from ones that love to drum up controversy when I said that. Last time this was brought up and I commented, I got like 30 of them.
Unfortunately, yes. Unless you have family money to help pay it down, medical school is prohibitively expensive. Private schools are more expensive thar state schools but unfortunately medical school enrollment is so selective you kind of just take what you can get.
