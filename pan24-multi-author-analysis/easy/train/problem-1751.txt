The frequency of violence and terror by right wingers versus the frequency of same by leftists. The frequency of claims of “false flag operations” (unsupported and in fact contradicted by the evidence) by right wingers versus the same by leftists. The promotion of violence and terror by right wingers versus decrying the same by leftists.
Rhetorically, the right wing are the ones primed for violence and false flags. The right wing are the ones promoting violence and terror against their “enemies” (implicitly or explicitly denying their opponents humanity). Leftists refer to them as opponents and decry violence (against anyone). Additionally, the right wing constantly makes claims of “false flag operations” in response to right wing violence, which combines well with their penchant for projecting. As a result, the balance of probability is on a false flag by her own organization. If I’m wrong, it’s because of the boy-who-cried-wolf response.
Exactly. Let's leave the misinformation and wild conspiracy theories to the _other_ side. Cold hard facts and the appropriate justice is what's needed.
