I would be for it but not for free use purpose under ukrainian command. Fire allowance by the provider only for military targets and only when they serve a preemptive purpose that helps preventing damage on ukrainian soil. Like striking airfields with bombers or choppers highly likely designated to target Ukraine, or tank columns and storages for material likely designated for shipping to Ukraine, or sevastopol Harbour, Kerch bridge and so on. Attacking power infrastructure on russian soil for example should be banned as that can fuel the russian propaganda that the west attacks russian civilians via ukraine operations for example and that is a narrative that can easily spin out of control in terms of russia aggression and their calls to retaliate against the west or even start using tactical nukes in Ukraine all the sudden.
It takes a long time to train crew and set these things up. They are very complicated. And the Iranian drones were unforeseen. They're also asymmetric because of the vast difference in costs between them and a missile with effective range needed to create a layered anti-air system. Only short range AA systems can be cost effective but since the drones can appear anywhere and are simply used on infrastructure if no military targets are around they need lots of such AA so they aren't really as cost effective. Particularly because they can always just be swarmed and overwhelmed. Might just be more effective to rebuild infrastructure later. There might not be answer that is reasonable, other than giving Ukraine even better offensive weapons to try to bring the war to a close sooner.
