I just pulled it out randomly. I could have used a whole list Japan, Canada, USA, Germany, France, New Zealand, Tokelau, Nuie. The list goes on. Being a smartass is the only thing I'm good at.
While there is a pro-Independence government an legislative majority, declaring independence requires a Constitutional Amendment, which needs a 75% supermajority vote with at least ¾ of legislators in attendance. So it'll take some time until that's achieved.
Nicuragua is both one of those nations Russia is pouring money into to try and maintain a “second world” of sorts (mainly by picking countries that aren’t already receiving a lot of western aid), and one of those nations that are so anti American imperialism (having a quick look at their history they’re in the “screwed over by Murica” club) that they fall for the “that means their enemies must be better!” trap. It’s not super surprising they voted no.
Taiwan realistically cannot change its name to the "Republic of Taiwan" or officially declare independence without provoking Chinese aggression (most likely invasion). Doing so would be seen as an official refusal of the PRC's stance that Taiwan is part of China. That's pretty much the only reason why Taiwan hasn't done it yet.
