No they are not. There is a video by a Ukrainian who said that the Russians have been going on the offensive and have actually gained some ground north and south of bakhmut. Iâ€™ll try to find the video.
So are you telling me you think thousands of dead Russians for a patch of field in a strategically unimportant area is of equal or greater relevance to Ukraine retaking Kherson and forcing Russia to retreat across the Dnieper that they had previously used as their major defensive zone? And they have now announced a planned withdrawal from the Zaporizhzhya region as well?????
This is not say that the war will be over in a few months time, Ukraine is huge, but Ukraine has reclaimed 54 percent of the land Russia has captured since the beginning of the war, according to a New York Times analysis of data provided by the Institute for the Study of War.
Pick your poison. We all get out information from bias groups and you know this. Unless you are a commander in the command center, you information is just as shitty as mine.. and you know this. ðŸ‘€.
Meanwhile Ukraine has captured vital roads, railways, and defendable terrain over vast swatches of land while absolutely devastating Russian defenders.
