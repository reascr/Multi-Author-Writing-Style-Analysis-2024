Yes, the question is "when does a sperm and egg that have combined become a person?" If you say "as soon as the meet", then you have to take a look at investor fertilization. They purposely create more fertilized eggs then they know will implant. They do this because the implant rate is not 100%. Multiple fertilized eggs are destroyed to get a viable pregnancy.
There are huge amount of women who have a fertilized egg fail to implant through natural causes. Many loose the pregnancy in the first few weeks as well. If we say life begins at conseption, then there a ton of uncounted deaths every year.

Pretty spot on definition actually. But part of the reason it exists as such is becasue of people trying desperately to twist it back and forth in ways that aren't in the clear text, and often for the purposes of limiting rights at the federal level (like what the current SCOTUS did for Dobbs/Abortion).
