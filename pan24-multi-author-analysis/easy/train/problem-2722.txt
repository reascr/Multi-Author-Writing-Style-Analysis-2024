I don't really want to discuss making light of deaths with the one who jokes about the fact that statistically more women die in car crashes. Yours is a blatant mockery of that fact. Mine is a political observation. Off with you now.
and concerning this disaster specifically, like i said, the government is in almost total failure at this moment, handling of the most basic logistic operations are compromised let alone a systemic discrimination that specifically helps ethnic "turks" but not the "kurdish", it isn't whether they want to do it or not, they're just not even capable of it right now and even if they were, they would discriminate against non-sunni people predominantly, not the kurdish.
Who's making fun? I'm pointing out the obvious fact that Turkish leadership will leverage whatever they can to get whatever they can. The fact that you want to paint it like that is kinda weird. I didn't say crap like they deserve it or something mental like that. Erdogan does not care about his people. How he handles this is a chance to help with elections.
