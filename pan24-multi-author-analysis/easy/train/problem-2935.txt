How about this? Lets lock up the entire Biden and Trump family's and just start over. I'm willing to sacrifice the Biden's if it means we also get rid of the Trump's.
No conspiracy. Just an old man with a failing memory. I'm a Democrat, but Biden's age and his memory worries me. I'll honestly feel better with Harris in charge.

On one instance, you had a guy walk out with hundreds of classified to top secret documents, some relating to US nuclear secrets, within 2 days of losing this privilege to these documents, and spending a year and half obstructing their return to the National Archives, signing sworn statements that the documents the FBI would recover there weren't there.
Like, one guy literally took national secrets home with him 2 days before he was set to leave office, the other guy, nobody knew it was even there till his team contacted the DOJ / Archives to tell them it was there.
