So it seems COP presidents are not chosen as people inside the UN that has to be delegated, and who gets the job might be down to political finagelin within that host nation's cabinet of ministers and the ruling party.
The president of any years COP is chosen from the host country for the conference, and is as far as the round 10 years I've looked at sitting politicians on the minister level in that host country.
Exactly. People here are quick to forget how dependent on oil we’ve been for the previous decades - much like coal. They’ve both been critical for driving industrial progress and thus everyone’s standards of living. If anyone is able to impact change it’s these behemoth oil companies. Whether you like it or not, they need to be on the same journey.
My biggest concern is that despite major world governments, including China, diversifying into renewable energy development, the oil world powers continue to produce/transport oil with absolutely no environmental regulations whatsoever, nor do retailers screen them, including the United States.
