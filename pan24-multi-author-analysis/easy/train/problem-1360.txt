Sirota is not a transpo expert, but he has been pretending to be one since Pete took office specifically to smear him (Biden too!). In another Pete smear article he claimed that Pete is just part of the same group of people that defended Norfolk (referring to Biden's DOJ) when they were asked to respond to a lawsuit question from the Supreme Court regarding whether or not a person who suffered torts in several states (someone sued Norfolk because they wound up with issues in Ohio, but the torts occurred in VA and PA, the state court indicated the suit couldn't be brought there and OH SC agreed) could sue in an unrelated jurisdiction. They responded by responding that they should not be able to based on the laws jurisdictional rulings - it was a defense of jurisdiction. Sirota called this a defense of Norfolk Southern.
Incorrect. Passing and repealing regulations requires an act of congress. It’s not like OSHA stops existing or there aren’t other regulations on train safety. Stop trying to reduce this to a black and white issue.
