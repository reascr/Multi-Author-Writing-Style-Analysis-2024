I don't know. Not a rich person so I can only speak for myself, but I'd be happy to be severely taxed so that I only have enough to live on so long as it means everyone is provided for and everyone else is taxed down to the same level, too. There’s something about not wanting to be the only one to play fair. I'm guessing that many (not all) richies would be okay losing the top end of their wealth if all their friends/rivals did too. But they aren't going to voluntarily avoid loopholes and tax havens if they know no one else will and it will only make them look less successful by comparison. It's all a game of status.
Worse, for 4 decades now we've had politics dominated by the political thinking that the State should get out of the business of "Regulating Markets" and, guess what, one of the main reasons for external oversight and regulation of economic activity is to prevent Tragedy Of The Commons situations from arising and reaching their natural conclusion (collapse) as those situations by their very nature can't be handled by the Market participants themselves unless they all get together and self-regulate with clear enforced penalties for non-compliance (i.e. a de facto parallel State). All this is just maths, from an area called Game Theory.
People often overestimate how far executive compensation goes. Also, just because someone said something that’s completely reasonable and true does not mean they are conservative/republican.
