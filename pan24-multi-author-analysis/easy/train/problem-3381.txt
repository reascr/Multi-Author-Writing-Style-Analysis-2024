It’s stochastic terrorism. It’s dangerous, life threatening, purposeful language levelled on a multitude of people they hate, veiled as humour within their circles. Meanwhile it’s their right wing fringe base that acts on the hateful rhetoric. Democracies are in danger as this crap is being ignored, we won’t improve until we lose some of our freedoms, I’m talking about placing penalties on social media and ‘news’ organizations like FAUX News. Until they’re held accountable for their BS, it’ll continue to degrade societal norms and step us closer to authoritarianism/fascism.
Yes! I get a lot of “well Italians were treated as non whites too and no one would give them jobs” “Irish were treated badly in America “ like nothing enrages me more when Italians and Irish Americans say things like that. I think because majority of Jews in America are white passing they don’t think the discrimination is real and yes certainly being white passing has made life more privileged than most but that also doesn’t negate the very real trauma we have. I think also some of it is well it was Europe and it was a long time ago everyone’s lives were hard back then. It’s so dismissive and insulting.
Yeah, orthodox/ultra orthodox supporters. Hasidic Brooklyn during the covid lockdowns was littered with trump signs. That was the first time I noticed it myself.
Unthoughtful and inconsiderate language perpetuates violence. This is a cornerstone of the modern Republican platform.
