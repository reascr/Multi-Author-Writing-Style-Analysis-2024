When it was leaked that Row v Wade was going to be overturned I was excited. But then I started reading people challenging republican candidates during the primaries by asking them what’s next? If it became a state’s rights issue and they outlawed abortion would the GOP start supporting all of the forced births? And every single GOP candidate said “not my concern, the mother has to carry that burden”. That finally was the point I realized I was duped. Jesus nor any prophet or apostle ever said “Abortion is wrong”. No, the Bible quotes Jesus and the apostles saying things like “Love God, love others” and “the sign of true religion is this: caring for widows and orphans in their time of need” as well as “forgive others as God has forgiven you”. The GOP is not Christian in any way shape or form. The antiabortion movement is about power, control, and racism. It’s the opposite Christian and with their plans to eliminate or defund Medicare and social security they’ve revealed themselves to be evil and despicable.
Dude. they vote against jesusy shit all the time. They cry about making this a christian nation but don't want to do the things that christ would actually call "good things".
Jailing librarians?! Let's look at our history and make note every other time period and reason why people did this in the past. Then tell me who those people were that did it, I can garuntee them were never on the side of good, and all lost.
