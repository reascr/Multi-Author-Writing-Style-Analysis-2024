In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
No. I agree with some restrictions as to who can own a firearm (ie the laws pertaining to domestic abusers and stuff like that), where you can shoot, and some other restrictions of that nature. However a law abiding citizen should be able to own any type of firearm they so choose. I think it ridiculous to limit the second amendment based on barrel lenh and rate of fire.
Absolutely. The ATF should not be allowed to interpret laws on a whim. That frustrates the hell out of me. They act like theyâ€™re both executive and judicial branch.
Correlation isn't causation. The NFA of 1934 did not decrease availability of automatic weapons at all.
