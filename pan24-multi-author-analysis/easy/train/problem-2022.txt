We have a 50-50 senate (51 at best) and the GOP will control the House. No young democrat can wield that Congress. They are too progressive. Biden can wield it.
There might be a slim chance Biden can pull that off this term. This election showed that Americans don’t want extreme right-wing politics, they want centrist politics. Lastly, don’t associate the actions of rogue citizens who believe in extremism with those who sit in congress. Most DC republicans don’t stand for any violence. Yeah, most. Not all.
While the extent of McConnell’s obstruction was unprecedented, the phenomenon is quite well documented that political opponents or lackluster allies are historically less likely to support policy initiatives at the end of terms when presidents are known not to be running again. It’s similar to how historically (though perhaps less so in recent history) presidents usually get a much more compliant congress during their first 100 days in office, as they are seen to have a mandate for the policies they ran on.
Nothing at all. All he has to do is sign any bills that come his way. Better he announce early and let democrats find a true successor with a longer amount of time, if he isn't running for reelection.
