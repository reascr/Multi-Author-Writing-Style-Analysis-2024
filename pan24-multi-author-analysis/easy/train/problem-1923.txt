After teaching for 26 years, I totally agree with you. I was actually a high school dropout and went back to college later in life and became a high school teacher. I was a landscaper, mechanic, salesman, and entertainment industry worker before going back to school. I totally support education in all of its forms as long as it is working toward a positive goal for the individual. So when you say that people should not knock the services and trades educational stream, I think you’re absolutely correct. We all need a good plumber, electrician, mechanic sometime in our lives. These are folks with a high degree of specialized skill just like a doctor or a lawyer. We need all of these different levels of educational or vocational experience in our society. It is unfortunate that we are seeing a culture war over education, and that the war is being played with misinformation on both sides. It’s unfortunate that we can’t take a few minutes and look into the benefits of higher education, whatever that means for the individual, before we start knocking one possible avenue for our kid’s future over another. In any case, I have retired from the profession and have safely survived that storm. I fear it’s only going to get much worse for teachers and students as we go forward.
