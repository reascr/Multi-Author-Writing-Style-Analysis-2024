Somewhat more seriously, in the past decade we've seen a lot of problems with countries that try to go it on their own, Brexit created a lot of problems, Trump created a lot of problems, Russia is politically isolated while everyone has Ukraine's back, the importance of NATO has been clearly demonstrated.... Like, these things go in cycles, obviously, and it would be dumb of me to presume that this cycle is finished (can cycles be "finished?") but I do still see some signs for hope.
Exactly. The people of the UK were outrageously lied to. Noone knew what the leave vote meant in reality. Snake oil salesmen selling a dream on social media and on mainstream media.
In both the Voting System referendum and the Scottish Independence one, he offered a fake choice between "Exactly how it is now, and you don't get to ask again" and "a weird horrible alternative that isn't what anyone is asking for", and unsurprisingly the status quo won out - where a proper fair voting system wasn't even on the ballot, and the independence for Scotland would mean exile from the EU and cold treatment from the remaining UK.
Is it your workload? Doesn't progress take work? No one said anything about a fuck anyone else attitude, that's your projection. Anyway I'm done with this winnet.
