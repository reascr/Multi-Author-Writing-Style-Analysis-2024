Yes I agree with you, but there isn’t anything FL can really offer younger people, excluding the major cities like Miami and Orlando. Even if I got a job paying 3x what I make now, FL still has too many problems. There are other Red states I’d consider before Florida. Florida has as python problem, a large elderly population who suck at driving, sinkholes, “Florida men” doing weird stuff, a large elderly population that is close minded, horrible social welfare programs, eroding shore lines with fear of rising water levels, and lastly too many old people. My in laws are Florida snowbirds and I occasionally get mail that is sent up here for them (they both are official FL residents now, but weren’t when they first moved this the occasional spam mail). The Republican political fliers they get are disgusting. Worse than their NH counterparts. I don’t even know what could incentivize Democrats to move there at this point. There is a great Broad City episode about the girls wanting to live in FL, sort of goes over all of this in a humorous way. I think they summed it up better than me.
Combination of gerrymandering, becoming a haven for conservative retirees migrating from more liberal northern states, and Cuban-Americans who’ve been convinced by Republicans that Democrats want to turn America into Cuba 2.0.
100% agree. There is no plan on how to get any democratic leadership beyond a city level. The Florida DNC basically put up no fight in what could have been a close race.
