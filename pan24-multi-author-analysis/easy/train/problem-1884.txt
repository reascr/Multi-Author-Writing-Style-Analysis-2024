I think we're seeing the GOP coalition start to fracture in real time. The writing has been on the wall for a while now. Religious conservatism and fiscal austerity don't share too many of the same issues. The laissez faire, small government contingent isn't going to overlap with the culture-war fascists. They've tried to keep this party together with a general "oppose the left" mentality, but now we're seeing a lack of agreement over what opposition means. The glacier isn't going to melt overnight, but the cracks are forming, and we're looking at a few more lost election cycles before the decline is inevitable.
