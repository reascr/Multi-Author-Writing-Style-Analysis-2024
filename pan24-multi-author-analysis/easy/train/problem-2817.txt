And the truly scary thing is just how many people on the right absolutely cheer these actions. They won't shut up about how they're being oppressed, while they happily call for the oppression of others.
They depend on having an out-group to hate, they love Nazi ideology, they love hypocrisy and will gladly strip rights while shouting about freedom, and so on.

Paramilitaries aligned with right wing politicians have sprung up.
