Side note regarding California affluent homeowners protecting their assets... California's abandonment of single family residential zoning theoretically should address affordable housing. This program is several years old, but has yet to take off. In my conservative neighborhood on Nextdoor, a a recent discussion about building an auxiliary dwelling unit turned into not so veiled threats from other homeowners. Although a zoning variance is no longer needed, ADU permits are still required to ensure compliance with building safety codes. The city makes ADU permit applications public on the internet which strenhens social pressure to not address this housing crisis.
Really well-written/researched article. I agree with the author's last statement as well - the leadership required to fix this hasn't been imagined yet. Grappling for position has left us completely unable to solve shared complex problems like poverty. We can't even seem to talk about them without talking past each other. I appreciate the facts that I quoted from the article above. But facts won't get bitter people to suddenly accept change. They need to be heard, not lectured at.
