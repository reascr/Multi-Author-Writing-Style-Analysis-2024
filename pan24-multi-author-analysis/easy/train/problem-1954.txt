Edit. And state officials began extracting produce from farms to pay for industrialization that followed. That process happened across the USSR and was not directed to Ukrainians specifically this it should not be called a genocide. It was rather what happened in Cambodia- deaths due to belonging to a certain class. Communist government hardly wanted to kill off millions of peasants, they needed increase in food production to pay for rapid construction of factories across the country. But the policy of moving from small farms to large industrialized agricultural production we see these days was horribly mismanaged and millions died. An uncomfortable truth is that top leadership of the communist party in Ukraine at that time was Jewish and Ukrainian, so there is that. The new Ukrainian state has been promoting “Holodomor” to get on the same level of victimhood as Holocaust but the difference is that the former had nothing to do with ethnicity of the victims.
Absolutely. I think a lot of the time, that's because it never really stopped in countries like the US. It just changes form and loses some of the violent intensity.
