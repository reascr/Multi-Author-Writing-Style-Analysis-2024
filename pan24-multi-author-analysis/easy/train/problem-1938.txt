I voted for Bass because she is the best and most qualified candidate. But I have to say, if she wins, it's going to feel so damn good having a black woman as mayor of Los Angeles. I am so proud of our city!
It's extraordinary that nearly 48% of the voters looked at these two resumes (which took only minutes for me to dig up) and said "Clearly the billionaire land developer with practically ceremonial experience in politics will do a better job and can relate to my problems.".
Caruso campaigned heavily on "solving the homeless problem" through publicly funded housing developments, which was likely to win a considerable chunk of L.A. voters. Everyone in L.A. has noticed homeless tents popping up on more and more street corners and underpasses over the past 7 to 10 years. I'm sure many preferred the promises to finally do something about them than reminders about how complex the problem is. I saw Caruso's commercials and immediately thought of the government housing projects erected as part of the New Deal with the best of intentions but which resulted in all the generational disadvantages of living in a terrible neighborhood. Not the way to solve this problem, but Caruso's heavy campaigning on the issue would have made him more likley to claim premature victory than acknowledge he began a quagmire. I'm massively relieved that he's losing.
