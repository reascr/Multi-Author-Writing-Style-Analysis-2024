That's exactly what they're pushing as a narrative. It's never their fault, nor is it because of shitty oppressive policy, nor their lack of plan, and it's definitely not because they keep selling out to corporations... (how's that Foxconn factory Paul?).

It couldn’t be the Republican’ts continual assault on basic freedoms, adherence to conspiracy theories, supporting a violent insurrection, and having wackadoodle candidates. Nope. Nope.
I'm glad Trump is falling out of regard and power in the Republican party, but they really are showing themselves (again) to have absolutely no loyalty to anything except trying to empower themselves. They debased themselves for Trump and now that the tides have turned they will debase themselves again to try and deceptively lie about their support for him in the first place. As if Trump wasn't the metastasized tumor of conservatism.
