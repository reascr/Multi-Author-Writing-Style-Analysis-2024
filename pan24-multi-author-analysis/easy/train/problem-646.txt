I mean, I’m the capital, property taxes went up 15%; there’s a proposed sales tax increase of 1% and yet, our police force has been reduced by 20% while crime is exploding, the school budget has been cut and our roads are In horrendous shape. I’m glad kids are getting free lunches, but honestly the living conditions in this city have been deteriorating significantly over the years, and I feel like residents are just getting nothing back on all the new taxes they are enacting.
This is a myth. A bill goes through a bipartisan committee to even be considered. To get something like that into the bill, there would need to be an amendment. But the amendment must first get enough endorsements from both chambers to even get considered. Then the amendment is voted on. Could something like that be an amendment that is added to free child lunch? Sure, but really, really, really, really unlikely.
It’s free to the kids. Especially at the point of service. Everyone knows what free means. It doesn’t need to be pointed out every single time.
