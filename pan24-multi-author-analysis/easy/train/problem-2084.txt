Ah. All smoke. Can’t even link to a subreddit or use a complete sentence. No, I don’t work for the FDA. I am a scientist though with 25+ years of working experience and understand how drugs are made, developed, and how the FDA works. You?

Hey folks! This is why we have the FDA. People died. Regulations were made. Literally. In 1937 a drug maker used ethylene glycol, which tastes sweet, in cough syrups for children. Unfortunately ethylene glycol is incredibly toxic, and the kids taking the medication died. Took awhile at that time to identify what the problem was. This was a new compound and medication at the time. There is no reason for this to happen in 2022. It’s either intentional or massive mismanagement. There is no non-toxic amount of ethylene glycol. That’s why if you spill antifreeze you need to clean it up or dilute it down the drain. Pets and other animals will drink it, it’s sweet tasting. Then they die.
