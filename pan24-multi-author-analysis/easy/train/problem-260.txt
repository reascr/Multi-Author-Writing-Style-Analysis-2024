Health issues are why the for-work shepherds and the show shepherds are vastly different. I personally prefer the work breed as they live longer and healthier lives. They're basically two different breeds at this point.
The difference between show breeds and work breeds is that of the breeder. A show breeder will often select based on looks alone, regardless of health impact. Note that this is one of the reasons that I despise most dog shows.
See that information isn't given in the previously provided link, just going by visual differences it's not that noticeable of a difference, but when you actually look at the medical aspects (things you can't tell from pictures) the differences become more apparent.
P.S.S. Work breeds versus show breeds are one of the things that made me want to go for a degree in genetics.
Side note: Dog genetics is one of my special interests and one of the factors that made me decide to go for a degree in genetics.
Exactly. Same reason why I found stupid having basically two "breeds" of australian shepherds. One is working and other one is only for those parades and exhibitions etc. Useless, has its tail cut off in 80 % few days after birth and has tons of health problems.
