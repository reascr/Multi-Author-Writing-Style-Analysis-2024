If laws are coded too strictly you lose the need for discernment from a judge, the concept of precedent, and the idea of community justice. That's how you end up with mandatory minimum sentences and three strikes laws. You end up with people on death row that the communities they committed the crime in and the families they affected don't want. You end up with a woman going to prison for 6 years because she tried to register to vote as a former felon, despite the state making it clear that they misinformed her of her rights; Laws that don't allow discernment and flexibility are harmful to communities and often have impacts on disadvantaged communities the most. They also allow weaseling rich people to skirts the boundaries of "not technically illegal" far too often.
Exactly. The law should be objective, not subjective. It should be applied strictly, not liberally. You can't have everyone viewed equally under the law when the law is flexible.
Yes, the law is inflexible. That's the idea. It's objective. An action has to fit the crime. The crime doesn't get molded to fit an action. That is how we ensure everyone is equal under the law. If you can't prove that an action fits the law without making the law "flexible", then you specifically make that action illegal too.
