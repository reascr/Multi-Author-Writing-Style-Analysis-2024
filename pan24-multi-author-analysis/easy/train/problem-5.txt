Andrew Schneider, the executive director of Fairness West Virginia, a statewide LGBTQ rights group, compared the bills to Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law (dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics), which prohibits classroom instruction on “sexual orientation or gender identity … in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”.
That’s the thing tho. I read their shitty comments on articles and I read the random r/conservative posts that other subs laughing at them post because I want to see wtf they’re talking about doing now. And so far on this I haven’t actually seen any wondering or surprise. Nobody even actually questions if that’s “fake news” or whatever. What I see them saying is shit about ways they can get the people against them not to be able to vote or just real ugly, hateful/violent shit directed at us. And that’s a lot scarier.

Exactly. This is likely a ploy to keep trans people "out of sight" and to create a legal pretext for police to arrest trans people in the state whenever they wish. It is very similar to the Russian Gay Propaganda Law in that respect.
