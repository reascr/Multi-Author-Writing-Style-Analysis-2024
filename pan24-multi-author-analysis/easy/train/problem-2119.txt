Whaaaa? Just one city? You could give damn near $400k to each New York City resident with that much money. You could pull quite a few cities out of poverty.
Interesting. I was involved on a project to create an application to do just that, track military assets so they could be moved around the chessboard when they were needed. We’re not talking about weapons and combat equipment, it was way more mundane, like chainsaws and bulldozers and walk-in coolers. I (as the technical lead) was in meetings with a cadre of retired generals and other officers who were looking to cash in on their awesome idea. Turns out the military had absolutely zero interest in such a thing and it died a quick death. Glad I didn’t quit my day job for that shit.
