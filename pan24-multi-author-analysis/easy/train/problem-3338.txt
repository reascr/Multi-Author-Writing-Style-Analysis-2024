I thought I was specific enough with "being on the winning side". America helped win both wars through its manufacturing/agricultural output to help its allies as much as its boots on the ground helped, IMO. America, since the Civil War, knows how to ramp up production and apply it's industry centers to make things that break things. It's our bread and butter, which we can also make. Having competent soldiers with good gear doesn't hurt either.
Isolationist policy isn’t uniquely incompatible with global influence. Isolationist policy is generally more about not getting tangled up in foreign wars and political issues, but that can be separate from a global influence on culture and economy.
Well sure. All of the US’ soft power isn’t gone either. Just eroded. It’s just interesting to see it happen in real time rather than read about it in books years or decades later.
