That argument is bullshit because we could 100% whip up a very special terrorism designation package for them, my country is literally built on loopholes. Itâ€™s loopholes all the way down. We could absolutely designate russia as state sponsors terrorism without screwing over the already screwed, a few pen strokes and a vote. We do it with omnibus bills regularly for all manner of dumb shenanigans. Unfortunately, that would take a level of cooperativeness, industry, and ethics the majority of them simply do not possess; plus it would detract from the time allocated for dumb shenanigans.
Exactly. It would would be dumb to announce that Ukraine gets tanks but they will arrive in six months. It may better to let Russia think that they won't get them and then all of sudden there are western tanks at front of the surprised Russians...?
How infuriating! If I called home from war talking about killing and losses on our own side, and my father were just non-stop spewing the latest propaganda from the telly rather than listen to the conversation, I would've felt so lost.
