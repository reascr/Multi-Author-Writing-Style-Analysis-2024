Democrats are against the current Israeli administration, and the current form of mainstream Israeli 'Zionism' (a complete bastardization of Zionism, into a far right wing authoritarian imperialist doctrine, far removed from what devout Zionist Albert Einstein practiced back in the 1940's). Albert Einstein and dozens of Jewish leaders during the time wrote and signed an open letter warning about the extremist faction that would become the current Israeli administration. But they give full support to jewish people and will call out any fascist bullshit against them, for the same exact reasons they are standing up to what israel is doing. If a pro israel supporter wants to do to Palestinians what the far right wants to do to Jews, they WILL be called out. Again, for the same exact reasons. It's wrong. It doesn't matter WHO does it.

It's a direct response on your last bit about the confusion between anti Zionism not being the same thing as being anti jewish, going further to show anti Zionism is unneeded and misguided, as what passes for the current Israel's "Zionism" is a grift, and so far removed from actual Zionism, it's practically unrecognizable to Zionists like Albert Einstein, and those other American Jews who wrote the open letter to the New York times in 1948 warning about 'Conservative Zionism".
