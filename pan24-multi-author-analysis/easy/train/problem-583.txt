Basically the problem is that there are many millions of classified documents. Most people cannot remove them from secure areas, but the president and VP may get them constantly in the White House/Naval Observatory, and those are homes as well as being secure containers. A president may ask to see something in an Office or in a living room (which they are empowered to do) and then make it harder to track.

Exactly. If you consider how many thousands of pages of classified documents are produced in executive and legislative branch offices every single day, this kind of thing is inevitable and mundane. It usually doesn't turn up until somebody doing phd research stumbles upon it decades later.
Honestly. Pence is cooperating and has been in the Capitol for ages. I am entirely able to believe that his staffers simply packed up his office and he hasnt reviewed every document packed up.
