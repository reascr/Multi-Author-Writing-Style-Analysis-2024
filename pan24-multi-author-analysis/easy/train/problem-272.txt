In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Convenient! So, to be clear, all a judge has to do to escape allegations that they're somehow being secretly paid by the gun lobby is to rule exactly how the gun lobby wants, but to avoid saying things like "the majority of gun owners are responsible" and "banning something that has long been legal will dramatically change the rules on law abiding citizens", which are apparently such controversial opinions that the only reason someone would hold them is if they have a financial interest in having them?
After what? These ideas are not going away. Make them criminals, and that goes for law enforcement who refuse to do their job. Rule of law, not desperado politics. Move forward. The demographics do not favour the "right white". Sorry.

Exactly. Shooting accurately under stress is hard as fuck. I have been training for years but when I really have to pick up the pace my heart rate goes way up and my accuracy goes low.
