Even then - this would be an entirely different story had China simply been like "yo, we lost control of a stadium-sized balloon, and it's coming your way.".
Combine that with the weight optimizations inherent to a balloon design resulting in low density (meaning low terminal velocity and high buoyancy) and it's amply probable that a disabled balloon can be recovered largely intact from the surface.
China are the bad guys. There is no reason we should continue doing business. We need to start phasing out that business and move it elsewhere (Africa? LATAM?) To continue the present course is to empower an adversary. So either they come to the light and compete fairly and without games of aggression like the balloon stunt and prefacing every diplomatic meeting with their untouchable terms. Or they get cut out like Russia.
The solar cells almost certainly were used to only power the systems and recharge whatever medium of energy storage they chose, typically batteries, which obviously get incredibly heavy incredibly fast for any decent amount of storage necessary to power equipment. There's a reason why when you see old pictures of these ginormous zeppelins you only see them with hilariously undersized carriages, and those were leveraging the much lighter (but infinitely more dangerous) hydrogen.
It could be. The issue is. The US and Europe are together the 800lb gorilla in the world. But they still for economic reasons do business with bad actors. Europe only this month weaned off Russian oil - a year after Russia attacked Ukraine. Economics should only be w concern insofar as you need to manage resources to meet human needs. If you are meeting your own human needs while allowing another to fundamentally violate human needs, there is no net benefit there. Would you light a person on fire to keep a family warm?
