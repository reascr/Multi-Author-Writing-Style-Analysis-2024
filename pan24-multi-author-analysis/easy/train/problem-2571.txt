A relative, a big fan of Murdoch’s Faux ‘News’, proclaimed in a Facebook post that it’s a lie that Republicans plan to go after Social Security. There is no convincing those brainwashed by right-wing ‘alternate facts’ that they’re being duped and voting against their own interests. This is a typical white, financially comfortable but by no means rich, conservative, very Christian who railed against the invading caravans in 2016, makes fun about climate change, constantly praised the orange Emperor Without Any Clothes and the likes of Ben “$30,000 Dollar Desk” Carson because he’s one of the good ones, he’s ‘christian’, etc. basically all of the right-wing talking points. On the one hand I’m amazed that otherwise seemingly decent people are blind to the greed, bigotry, intolerance and hatred of the party they support but I’m not when I realize Faux has been spewing its propagandist fear porn for a quarter century. A steady diet of that garbage hardwires the brain.
