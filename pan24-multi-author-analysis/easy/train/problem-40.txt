United is the absolute worst medical insurance company I have ever had to deal with. My previous employer switched to them at the beginning of 2022. I left that job in May. My current employer had some small regional insurance company who was bought by United, so now I am back on them again. I work remote, in a different state then where my company is based, so maybe it's better there. In my area, there are nearly NO doctors of any specialty "in-network." In recent years, most doctors offices here have stopped accepting, or even filing, United. Everyone I talk to about it tells me the same thing: that United demands "certification" for in-network doctors, which just means forcing them to accept payments far below market. The paperwork and ability to actually get paid by United is a nightmare. Now, none of my specialists are in-network including my ENT I've been seeing for 20 years, my neurologist treating my migraines almost as long, and my psychiatrist I've had for 8 years. Even my GP is thinking about dumping from them. There is maybe 1 specialist in any of these fields in my county who is still in-network.
Private medical insurance? Reconsider seriously if you are medically incapacitated without treatment.
