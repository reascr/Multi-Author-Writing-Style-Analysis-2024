There are certain issues which are better tackled on the local level (ex COL issues) but leaving home ownership to the states simply means there'll be a patchwork of effective, ineffective, and zero legislation regarding home ownership, and possible situations where certain states, due to lack of home ownership laws, become "haven states" for unscrupulous multiple home buyers and the problem is compounded multifold there while the state legislator remains too ineffective (read: Conservative) to act on the issue, causing it to spiral out of control.
All things that could be coded for. Like the waiver is only valid until a sale/transfer, any income on the property during the waiver period (not equity gain) voids the waiver and requires back taxes, waiver may only be taken by individuals, 1-2 year cooldown on another waiver being taken on the physical address post-sale (would also require tax disclosure that the waiver was used prior to sale), etc.
