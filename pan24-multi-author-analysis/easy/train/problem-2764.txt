Yeah there's a scene in a show about cartels that shows how simple this is. Cartel guy is nice to a prison guard. Prison guard is hell bent on not helping cartel guy in any meaningful way. They relate about something small like family. Cartel guy asks prison guard to give message to family. Guard does it out of empathy. Cartel guy gives prison guard watch. Cartel lawyer keeps evidence of prison guard delivering a message for him and receiving a watch in return and now cartel guy can blackmail the shit out of the prison guard and claim he's helping him whether the prison guard actually does or not.
Another flerfer! I've been all around the globe trying to spread the gospel of truth and so rarely do I find another free mind, irregardless of which hemisphere I travel. Are there more of us on the Internet? (It's my first day).
It's not technically an "intelligence" organization. It's a police wirh duties in counter terrorism, counter intelligence and general state security. Think more MI5 than MI6.
