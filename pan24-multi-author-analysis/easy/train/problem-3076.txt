Clinic hours exist becouse even doctors have to sleep, I don't really see how that is relevant at all but ok. Fees exist becouse no one is going to do anything for free, ever. Let me make myself clear though, If a person on the street randomly approaches me and tells me he has a fever, a headache or a stubbed toe I don't have to help him since he is not in any immediate danger of his illnesses, the least I could and should do is point him to the nearest clinic. Now let's change the scenario where a man, riddled with physical and probably mental trauma, begs for help becouse he quite literally can't breathe, move and care for himself, I can help him at least reduce the pain with basic meds any country, even at war, should have. Even if these illnesses are infective, that's what masks and gloves are for. If you choose to deny help to that kind of man, not just that you shouldn't be a doctor, but you definitely are a bad person.
Irrelevant here. Doctors are always entitled to prioritize and make judgment calls. Healing a Ukrainian soldier means a bit less harm long term.
