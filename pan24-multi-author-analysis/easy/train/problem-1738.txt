It’s sucks that Garland’s appointment of special counsel will delay the possibility of a prosecution—I mean Trump’s been out of office for 2 years for Christ sake—but, given the political climate, it is prob the right call to make. The majority of Republicans already feel the DOJ is incapable of being neutral when it comes to Trump (i.e. they believe the investigation is being driven solely by politics), by appointing a special counsel Garland is trying to remove prosecutorial decisions one extra step from politics. The sad reality is that even though the DOJ demonstrated under Trump that it can/will/does resist inappropriate political pressure—time and time again career DOJ official flat out refused to go along with Trump, often resigning or threatening to resign their positions—but the GOP has nonetheless been successful in undermining public faith in the DOJ since Biden was sworn in. It’s fucking reckless of GOP officials to ignore clear evidence of Trump’s attempts to politicize the DOJ, while pushing this baseless narrative against Biden’s administration without even a shred of evidence. Those sycophantic/opportunistic bastards.
….no? An investigation into stolen physical intel almost always precedes charges. According to the FBI, theft of physical classified material has only occurred about 10 times in the past 20 years. Only 2 were ever actually arrested before trial. The rest faced long investigations. Because that’s what you have to do with intel to know exactly what’s been compromised.
Interesting. What this signals to me is that the DOJ has more than enough evidence to indict Trump but for the sake of optics they need the recommendation to come from outside the Biden Administration. A cautious move but hardly unwise.
