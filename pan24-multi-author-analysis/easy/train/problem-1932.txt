The Attorney General of Georgia has no Constitutional power to step in and stop or take over a county prosecution.
County DAs cannot be removed by the AG, there is a judicial process to disqualify a prosecutor from a case but DAs are elected officials, and home rule is enshrined in the state constitution.
Not a chance. Fani Willis is elected by the people of Fulton County. Your should have seen the reception she received when she rode in the pride parade last fall. She was cheered like a Hollywood A-lister. She’s not going anywhere.
I actually thought it those commercials were funded by left-wing Christians at first trying to convince the right to see the hypocrisy of their actions, but no - it’s a right wing evangelical group that is conceding that they are acting hypocritically, they’re going to keep acting hypocritically, and that we should ignore “Christians” and focus on “Christ”. In my opinion they should be airing these commercials at church on Sunday, not on national TV - call out the laypeople for their hatred toward those who left / those who don’t believe.
