It is far too small to realistically hold against any ground invasion China would make if they can secure the waters and make a proper landing, we aren't talking Ukraine here (even assuming Chinese incompetence matching Russian when we don't have cause to assume it's that bad at this time), and Taiwanese forces too small without backup.
Oops! That last earthquake must have shaken up a sunken IJN ship. Cables holding down the head of one of the mines it was carrying were almost rusted through, and the shock broke them. Too bad for the Chinese dredge that ran into it.
That's probably overcomplicating things. All you have to do to cut a cable is drag an anchor from a fishing boat, like is suspected happened in these cases.
And before anyone mentions America, that's assuming America militarily intervenes. If it doesn't for whatever reason, Taiwan's future definitely isn't uncertain, it's screwed.
And that's not even looking at the serious issue of supplying Taiwan for the duration of hostilities.
