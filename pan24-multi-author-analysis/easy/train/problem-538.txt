The final sentence was no prison, 1 year of house arrest, and 10 years of probation. Of course what happened later is even sadder, as he got involved in an armed robbery and violated his probation multiple times. It seems most of his problems originate from his mother, the one who was supposed to watch the little girl but left her alone with another child almost 4 times her size; and later turned the judge and jury unsympathetic by saying "He was just playing, you can't sentence him for playing. How do you tell a kid you got punished for playing a game" like another kid didn't die due to his actions. I'm honestly surprised they did not charge her with neglect, the killing is 90% her fault. She should've been the one to get life in prison.
Exactly. This is the problem when redditors like OC jump to conclusions based on bare reading from some news outlet's limited reporting. From the Supreme Court's :
Although I will argue that as society progresses, education improves, diet and environmental factors improve, the argument that the age of 18 SHOULD decrease as a higher percentage of a younger age group will be capable of giving a reasonable independent opinion.
