If the states and only the states have complete authority over elections, which states have explicit statutory consequences for voting once in SEVERAL states in the same election? If, say, a Navy E-5 had resided in states X and Y before a current deployment, and had registered to vote in states X and Y, which state's law would s/he violate by mailing back both absentee ballots? Presumably the state in which s/he resided least recently, but CAN state law make such distinctions?

Wouldn't the most intelligent way to handle mailing absentee ballots to individual service members be for the state or county to mail ballots to the Pentagon with service members' serial numbers (presumably NOT confidential personal information since the Geneva Conventions requires captured military personnel to give their captors their serial number; if enemies of the US could know serial numbers, surely the USPS could know serial numbers). The Pentagon would then route those ballots to those service members' bases or off-base home addresses. Service members could return their ballots through ordinary mail.
