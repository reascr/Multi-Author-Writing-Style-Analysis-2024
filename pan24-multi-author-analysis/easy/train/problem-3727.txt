If you don't care who actually should win the election (i.e., the "Condorcet winner"; yes it's a technical name, but it just means the person who should win) then why vote at all? Why not just draw a name from a hat? That also satisfies "later no harm" and I'm sure all sorts of other arbitrary criteria you can make up that are not that the right person won the election (which is, of course, the only criterion that really matters).
Fun. Those 3 either feel real proud or like real shit stains, not sure which. I figure in Alaska, a Dem has to be fairly nice to the oil industry and also never ever touch gun restrictions. Not sure where Reps differ from a MAGA fuck boi beyond the education funding you just mentioned. I’m beyond intrigued…thanks for the reply.
It’s actually pretty easily manipulated by corporations who can back single issue candidates in target populations, basically building nefarious coalitions.
What does it mean? It means that satisfying the consistency criterion is useless in an election system, unless the result that it consistently reaches is actually the right one. Being consistently wrong is not a virtue.
