Been saying this. I obviously just want my gun rights left alone because it's something I personally value, but even beyond that, what we should be doing is trying to address the actual root causes of the violence rather than just slapping a gun ban bandaid over the symptoms. For example, you could eliminate over half of all US gun deaths just by ending the drug war. A giant portion of the "gun violence" problem is due to inner city gang violence, which is itself merely a consequence of drug prohibition. Whenever you ban anything, you create a black market, which then becomes the financial fuel for organized crime to develop. In the same way that alcohol prohibition lead to the 1920s mobsters and tommy gun shootouts in the streets, the modern war on drugs is directly responsible for much of the gang violence we see in our cities today. Legalize all drugs and it goes away. Plus then you're solving the problem by making people more free rather than less, which is just better.
