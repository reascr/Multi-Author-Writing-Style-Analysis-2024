The church also initially agreed with with Salt Lake City to build a ground-level crossing at Main Street as the primary method to get people from one side of the mall to the other. This was in effort to help the struggling businesses on Main Street. In exchange the city gave up an entire street to the church to be removed and used for foot traffic between the church's properties. Early in construction of the mall the church scrapped that plan, said it was just unworkable, and decided to build an enclosed pedestrian bridge over the street instead. At the time it became clear that this was the Church's plan all along and their agreement with the city wasn't in good faith. They got a free street and basically said 'screw you' to the rest of the city.

Utah is an unconstitutional Theocracy. They invalidated the terms of their statehood by legalizing polygamy. They should be a non represented territory again.
