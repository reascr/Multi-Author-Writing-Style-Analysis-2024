This is so true, and the self-centeredness is just asinine. Literally every reasonable person associates Nazis with genocidal conquest, except Russians who totally brush the mass murder and attempted world domination aside and assign them the defining characteristic of hating Russians.
Interesting question. I don't know if he really orders any crimes or military activity or whatnot, he's a diplomat, his job is just to lie Russia's lies 24/7. I don't think that he can be charged with crimes against humanity since he's just a talking head, plus he may have diplomatic immunity. In Russia, he'd only face consequences if he doesn't lie hard enough. Any realistic successor to Putin will probably more or less stay Russia's incredibly stupid course. Hell, they might even keep Lavrov on, because there aren't many people out there that can just tell ridiculous lies with a straight face day in day out like he does.
