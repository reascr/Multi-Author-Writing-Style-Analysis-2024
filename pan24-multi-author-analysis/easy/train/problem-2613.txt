“The Disney cock-up … while potentially disastrous for the taxpayers of Central Florida, was not illegal, which is why he had to maintain the special governance structure of the Disney domains, claiming victory even as he retreated at high speed,” said Mac Stipanovich, once the chief of staff to former Republican Gov. Bob Martinez.
What DeSantis is proposing is literally replacing your local town/county representatives (selectman/commissioners - whatever your state had) with 'his people' who are not elected by local residents for day to day operations.
It's still so weird. He's still now able to appoint the district board for a private company/district taxpayers? These special districts exist all over Florida, he isn't appointing boards for all of them. It's still clearly him singling out Disney to try and get revenge. Doesn't seem like it should hold up if Disney goes after it.
