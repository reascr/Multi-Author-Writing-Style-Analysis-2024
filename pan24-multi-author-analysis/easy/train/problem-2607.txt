In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Hi. I am just responding to the words that you yourself said. Your words indicated that this was a totally normal and understandable thing for this politician to do.

-	Surgeries to confirm gender identity, nominally: mastectomies, vulvaplasties, vaginoplasties, metoidoplasties, phalloplasties, orchiectomies, oophorectomies, hysterectomies, facial reconstruction, tracheal shaves, body contouring, vocal chord reconstruction, hair transplants, breast augmentation.
Don't step up. Don't engage. Dismiss as the distraction it is. This is the death spiral of the GOP. There is zero reason to buy into any of this crap. Vote against it and move on. If we engage liars at their level all we do is spread their bullshit.
-	Hormone blockers; puberty blockers for temporary use in early adolescence to keep the hormonal blank slate all kids start with before final decisions are made, after decisions MTF people will take spironolactone to block testosterone and finasteride to block DHT and prevent hair loss; FTM people don't need an estrogen blocker because testosterone overrides estrogen.
For sure man. Be vigilant. Don't let your guard down. Dying doesn't mean dead. Dying doesn't mean no terrorists. A Desantis WH could easily be the spark they need to survive, but keeping him out is also the easiest path to finishing the alt-right on the national level for the rest of us.
