Honestly, though, I don't see anything coming of this. If there were terms that both sides were willing to agree to, we'd have a peace already, without China stepping in as mediator.
If China brokers a peace in Ukraine that Ukraine can actually accept, they get their favorable reference. Then they go back to being the devil.
I think you need to do your own research about this cause a lot has been happening and there are so many details that I don't even know where to start but in a nutshell, China isn't just 3 or 4 years behind, and their domestic Chip industry, with the full weight of the sanctions implemented by the Netherlands (the country that makes the machines that allow companies like TSMC to make microchips),Taiwan, and Japan, means their domestic semiconductor manufacturing can't cover their own needs which is why they haven't and couldn't supply Russia.
Yup. But Ukraine is proud and it has every right to damage Russia as much as it can before any such deals are made. The more damaged Russia gets, the less fucked Ukrainians future. I simplified but that's the core calculation here.
If, and there a big if, they have genuine intentions of ending the war in Ukraine it's not because they care about global peace but simply bcuz they wanna boost their sphere of influence by appearing strong and influential enough to end a European war and because Russia being pathetically incompetent is embarrassing them and if Russia is no longer a concern for the west everyone will focus on them.
