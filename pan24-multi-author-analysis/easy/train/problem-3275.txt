Since escaping, I'm happy inside, but it's not easy to unlearn the default body language that optimizes for hiding all you can hide in the interest of self preservation.

Unless you’ve made any investments in your new host country, in which case taxes on that can’t be deducted against and if it’s classified as a “foreign trust” then congratulations, you’ve just added hours to your paperwork burden.

With Russia, when everyone in the West is against them, I cannot imagine a scenario of someone who is a dual citizen or even just a permanent resident of another country actually being forced to pay taxes to Russia. If they don't pay, the worst that can happen to them is that they will never be able to go to Russia again for life for any reason.
