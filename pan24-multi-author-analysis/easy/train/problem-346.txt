You are so presumptuous, you think an average person today reflects on supply chain issues? If Americans were paying attention to a single thing they wouldn’t be stressing today because they’d ne prepared. The Fed told us in 2019 that inflation was coming, they told us what they were going to do, economists told us what that would translate into - and people did nothing. I was laughing my ass off when I read yesterday that JP Morgan is putting a billion dollars into rental homes,I was like why the fuck didn’t you think of doing that in 2019 when the series of events I just spelled out was laid in front of you. People can’t see past their nose.

Completely untrue. We have had every single one of these issues since well before Covid and Covid didn’t even exacerbate them. They were always there. Covid is the example of don’t let a good crisis go to waste. It isn’t a root cause of any of these things. Wages have far more to do with most of these issues than Covid.
