> twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females.
this is the real one for me. We would solve so many problems later in life if we limited the amount of trauma children go through. Not just child poverty but abuse too. Go and find any hard drug addict and the one commonality is childhood trauma.
Government “waste and inefficiencies”? No, it’s a deliberate attempt to make government healthcare look dysfunctional so that the Tories can push for privatisation. Just like every other aspect of the existing social safety net under the Tories.
It's intentional. They see what "freedoms" big businesses, the rich and other well connected groups have in America and want the same in the UK.
I'm sure certain other countries are also more happy to also invest money in the right people and groups to further destabilize the UK.
