I have a friend who lives in the boonies and quite a few others that are just very rural farmers. Guns are a tool of protection for their animals and sometimes for themselves, too (from animals of the non-domesticated variety). Every one of them has had to use their weapon in the past couple of years in the course of their work. Until you live it, it’s hard to understand. They (those that grew up rural, understanding firearms and safety from a young age) are also by and large the safest, most knowledgeable gun owners I know. It’s the people that buy guns for “protection” from others or because they’ve adopted firearms as a hobby (or sometimes, a personality trait) that make me nervous. They’ve been scared into owning a weapon or they like the feeling of power it gives them, they don’t go to the range often, and just watching them handle their weapon makes it very obvious they only have the faintest idea of what they’re doing. Those people give me pause. But you know, second amendment and all that.
