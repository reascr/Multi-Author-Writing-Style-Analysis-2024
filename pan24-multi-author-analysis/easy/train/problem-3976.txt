France doesn’t need to decide not to host. They can crank up sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine by refusing to issue certain classes of visa (including the class used for Olympic athletes) and cancelling existing visas in those classes. If they’re not allowed into the country, they can’t compete.
I am well aware the issue is not flying over my head, i feel that as Norway has had tons of doping scandals its not at the individual level anymore and people in the comments are sinplying using the Russian state as an excuse for Norway not being as bad, doping is doping and Norway has had the issue so many times at this point its clearly an issue and people are ignoring it because of geopolitics and their own feelings, both can take their needles and shove them deep in their necks and die in a ditch i dont give a shit which country they are from, defending either is abhorrent.
Yes, and do it at the last second like Qatar. I think this needs to be normalized tbh. If authoritarian shitholes are allowed to use deception to promote theocratic nonsense, then liberal democracies should use deception to enforce democratic norms.
The point is flying over your head. Russia as a country sponsored doping for all their athletes even forcing children to do it. Norway does not do that and can’t control their athletes doing illegal stuff.
