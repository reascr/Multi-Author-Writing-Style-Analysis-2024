Well, Yes and no. You make it sound like they resorted to drafting every last One they can get, when really they haven't even started seriously drafting/mobilisation yet. Unlike Ukraine which has gone full mobilisation immediately. Most of Russias potential manpower is still sitting at home. So, desperation only in the sense that Putin fears the potential backlash of more mobilisation. But if Ukraine keeps on striking within Russia, there is a Chance the Population gets behind him, and that would be a Problem.
Not necessarily. Folks support Putin, but they aren't completely stupid. They know the government is full of shit. A lot of folks don't trust the government all that much going all the way back to the Soviet era. Not so much like “the government is plotting to kill us all” kinda paranoia you see in the west, more like “yeah, yeah, the government says a lot of things.”.
Exactly. Here in Ukraine we just accepted this, formally we didn’t recognize it but we knew that defacto we can’t do anything.
