Second, this: Once I was taken from my cell to another room, things found during the search of the apartment were laid out—flags from Ilovaisk, portraits of Bandera and Shukhevich—which an acquaintance had asked me to hide. Russian journalists were in the room, one standing with a camera, the other asking questions. She held up Bandera’s portrait and asked if he is a hero of Ukraine. I replied that I did not understand history. She then asked if I knew that Bandera collaborated with the Germans. I asked how he could cooperate if he was sitting in their concentration camp? They said they knew it for sure. I snapped: what do you say about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact then? And then I notice that the guy looks out from behind the operator's camera and threatens me with his fist.”.
So interesting! They're so brave. That one doctor who said they tell a lot of jokes to get through it, he seems like he'd be a great drinking buddy. That one soldier holding the bullet is one lucky man. Thanks for posting this.
