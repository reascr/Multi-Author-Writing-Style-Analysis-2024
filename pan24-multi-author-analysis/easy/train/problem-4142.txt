It's funny, because these people fear autism so much, but I'm autistic and just really passionate about a specific video game from 2004. Also, my blood and DNA is on file with a few international studies involving a rare intersex condition I was born with, so I'm "microchipped" in a sense - my blood literally has a QR code. Oh, the horror I am such a victim /s.
Not to be a total downer about this because it would be wonderful if this pans out, but generally speaking it might not be a good idea to blindly trust Moderna's internal studies since it was uncovered in 2016 that the Moderna CEO has fired researchers when the studies produced results the CEO didn't like (yes he's still the CEO). I must have missed that part when being taught the scientific method in elementary school. To preempt attempts at smearing the source, Statnews has a left-center bias with a high rating in factual reporting according to media biasfactcheck.
The mRNA technology is absolutely incredible. My prediction all along is that within a comparatively short period of time, any hospital lab of any significance will have a machine to manufacture custom mRNA vaccines on demand.
