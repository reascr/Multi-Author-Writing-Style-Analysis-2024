In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Oh boy. I guess it's not like those "few select states" immediately moved to ban abortion once they were given the chance (and with the votes of GOP legislators/Governors), right???
Republicans are basically the party of zero responsibility. It’s always someone else’s fault when things go wrong. Even not wrong, but something different, and Fox News will convince them someone else is to blame for what might go wrong.

Seriously. I'm queer so I never had any interest in men to begin with, but seeing multiple strong, successful, self-respecting women get dragged through hell by their husbands/boyfriends would have scared me off heterosexuality! It's just expected that a woman will prioritize being a wife/girlfriend and mother over her hobbies, friends, job, free time, health and personal growth. No thanks, I'll stick with friends and cats. I do know some decent guys who can function as full adults, but even they acknowledge that they're a minority among men.
