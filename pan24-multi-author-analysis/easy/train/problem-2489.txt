It’s so fantastic cuz when I’m out at the fair I really hope it’s just a shit ton of other dudes in hot sweaty clothes sitting next to me on the rides. Just like god intended.
Especially with gender, as women and men are so entwined with each other, it’s hard to have your father, brothers, husband and sons, community against you, and so of course a lot of women will not rock the boat and in a country where fighting for rights is risking life and limb, it’s even more challenging.
What are you on?? Women were allowed to drive in 2018 in Saudi Arabia only. They’ve been allowed to drive in UAE since it’s independence. It was even used as a comparison to other Gulf countries about how women are supposed to be treated. The cabinet of UAE has female members, plenty of powerful females within the public and elite levels of UAE. And even then, in Saudi Arabia, before 2018, women were still allowed to go to Amusement Parks and Parks, and Family mix gender parks for that fact. I grew up there, I’ve seen it from my own eyes. Iran also has done the same mistake as Afghanistan, putting Old Psycho men incharge of the country. Not their fault that some religious extremists with authoritarian minds took over the country.
