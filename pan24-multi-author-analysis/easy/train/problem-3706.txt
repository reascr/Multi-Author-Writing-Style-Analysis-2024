And you don't think the republics were not colonized by Russia? Putin is trying to grab them back while he aims to restore the glorious Russian empire. It's like the Chinese and the Uyghurs, the Muslim sect. Hypocrites. I don't trust China and how they have imprisoned Uyghurs and others and I don't believe they have the best interest of African people. Most countries on the continent are Islamic and China is engaged in genocide of Uyghurs in China. I don't trust them with black folks. During the pandemic in China, Africans were discriminated against by the country over Covid-19. Hell no I don't trust them. They are there to steal their resources just like colonists.
The banking industry is far more ancient than the automotive industry, and yet no one uses that metric to claim it has limited future viability; quite the opposite, actually; looking at it from a scientific perspective, historical longevity is usually an indication of future longevity.
Thanks! I didn't know what word to use either. I didn't like class but was bouncing off of someone else's term. I don't put the US in "classes" either, really. I've heard the UK uses the term a lot.
