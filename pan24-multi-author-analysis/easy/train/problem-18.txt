Once ‘99 rolled around we pretty much knew Y2K wasn’t gonna be a thing, like ‘96 people were starting to get freaked out and it slowly got worse and peaked around ‘98, by ‘99 they said they had it fixed and there was nothing to worry about and most people bought it. I was a stoned teenager and wasn’t 100% sold on it but I rung in the new year out in the Everglades at one of, if not the, craziest concerts/festivals I’ve ever seen in my life with a bunch of other crazy fucks taking massive amounts of LSD. So yeah I figured if the worlds gonna go to shit I’m gonna party like it’s 1999 and cross that bridge when I come to it. I’d say ‘99 to 9/11 we were optimistic about the future, at least I was, I thought Bush would be a one term president and things would get back on track, no way he would last 8 years and no way in hell we’d ever have someone worse than him. And here I am 20+ years later almost missing Bush, thinking he wasn’t THAT bad, I mean he sucked but at least he was funny, always fucking up his speeches an shit. Then 9/11 happened and it’s been downhill since….
Russia attacked Ukraine, bombes civilian population and infrastructure, attacks ships carrying grain, threatens to pull out of grain export deal, Ukraine defends it's self and attacks enemies offensive naval capabilities to protect itself and grain exports. There, fixed it for you.
