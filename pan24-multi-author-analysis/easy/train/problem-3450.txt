People are forgetting Biden got Trevor Reed out of there earlier this year - another US military service member... Russia will arrest any Americans and trump up charges just to have a trade for when we inevitably catch more Russian spies. I think it's weird that people are upset that an American is free. Plus the fact that Griner was sent to a penal colony where she would've most likely died and Whelan is sitting in a prison in Moscow. Putin is playing right into US far-right propaganda. Look at social media and the reactions of conservatives. It's fueling more division, and that's what he wants.
Propaganda value. Most of the outrage about this exchange is likely manufactured anyway. Republicans have shown they are the party more amiable to Russia, so anything they can weaponize against Democrats indirectly helps Russia.
Absolutely. The way people have frothed at the mouth about it you’d think the guy didn’t already serve 15 years of a 25 year sentence while losing any connection to the world of arms dealing. He has no value right now because his value was in personal relationships that don’t exist anymore. He was going to get out anyway.
