Kinda reminds me of the villain in Blazing Saddles he tells his 1 Goon "I want you to round up every vicious criminal and gunslinger in the west. Take this down. I want rustlers, cut throats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, halfwits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, hornswogglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass-kickers, shit-kickers and Methodists.".
Only for people with not too heavy crime code punishments (and specially no violent articles) and previous army experience, so de facto it’s some imprisoned ex officers which isn’t totally nuts vs just random criminal with no military experience — but some of them rapists, some of them murderers, some of them maradeurs who ready to steal even from 90 yo granny, and even cannibals.
Ugh, what a bummer. I’ve often thought of revisiting/finally finishing those books to see how they held up, but I think I’ll probably pass now. I find it too difficult to separate the art from the artist.
