Just please understand that not everything you read on the internet is true, and people specifically make articles to target the uninformed so misinformation and hysteria gets spread.
ya. you'd think. I'm not saying it's true. I'm just saying it popped up on my phone thru my "news break" app. There are articles online about it and it's all over Twitter. I didn't go looking for this information or saying its in anyway true. But something is definitely weird. This is the 4th "ufo" the US has shot down in the past week. The 1st one was identified as a balloon and the other 3 have just been called "objects" or ufos. They're not even dismissing the possibility of aliens either. they're just saying - "we don't know what it is or where they're coming from". And I've seen other reports that these are popping up in other parts of the world as well. Supposedly China and I think it was Australia. Who knows wtf it is. Could just be some private civilian company. Could be freaking drones. I have no idea. In any case it's concerning..
