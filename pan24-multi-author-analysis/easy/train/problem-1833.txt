Quite a lot of other developing countries are generating more CO2 per capita than western countries, so in our current days it is not so clear cut that the west is still the main responsible for CO2 emissions, especially European countries.
YES! That's exactly what they do. Scientists from all over the world, from different countries will review the observations and measurements. If ANY of them can show the experiment is flawed or the results are inconsistent, they get massive credit for proving it wrong. There is a huge incentive to prove each other's work wrong. If it survives the peer review process, it's generally accepted as being true. It's not even somewhat controversial in the scientific community. CO2 emission is quantifiable, measurable amount. Arguing against the data is like arguing against math. But I've shown you actual peer reviewed studies. Show me any scientific source that shows volcanoes emit "more co2 than humans ever will." You can't do it.
"According to the United Nations definition, countries within Eastern Europe are Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and the western part of the Russian Federation (see: European Russia map).".
