China's dollar reserves are in US Treasuries. They can't just pull the money out. They'd have to sell it on the open market, and trying to sell off their entire portfolio of USD (and probably EUR/GBP) bonds would force them to sell at a massive loss, and also completely kill their foreign currency reserves.
I know. And yes this is clearly Putin's fault. It's just that i have seen many and i mean MANY comments that more or less calls for collective punishment against the nation and it's people which is nothing but an act of senseless vengance to sate their "righteous anger" which is frankly speaking bullshit and does nothing but harming people for something they had no control over.
Russia produces close to 10 million boe per day. That works out to over $800 million US dollars of revenue per day if it were sold at world market prices. That is close to $60 billion US$ on an annualized basis. This does not include fertilizer, uranium, gas, metals etc sales. So there is a lot of money to be taken from Russia if their resources were to be back on world commodity markets and not sold a steep discount as they skirt sanctions through other friendly countries who only do it to take advantage of the stupid situation Russia put itself in.
