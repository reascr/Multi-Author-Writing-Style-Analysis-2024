He stacked his cabinet with former army officers and openly praised the old military dictatorship that Brazil used to have - up to and including openly endorsing use of political violence against the opposition as late as the middle of his 2018 presidential run.
I hope not. I don't think it's the same situation and/or generation. It's continuation of the last that was suppressed is 2019 (onset of Covid time) while the world wasn't paying too much attention. and it was brutal. and it still doesn't seem to deter.
His administration was rife with graft and corruption (which, well, that's kind of the standard for Brazil, sadly) and he attempted - and again failed - to have investigations into criminal or unconstitutional activity halted.
That's a fair counter point. It would have been better to have said "they CAN lead to" instead of tend. It's also going to be dependent on what the protests are over, how comfortable the population in general is, and how those in power react. The 99% movement fizzled out over time, despite some violent responses from authorities. In Syria the complaint was along the same lines, unhappiness over cost of living and employment opportunities that garnered a fatal reaction from authorities that lead to a massive Civil War that went in the authoritarian's favor.
That's a bit glib. Yes, usually a branch of those already in power use a revolution to gain more power and your revolution is way more likely to be successful if you get some already powerful faction on your side.
