I agree. Landlords should be required to replace all gas stoves with need based grants with a reasonable timeframe. All new properties should be required to have electric stoves of one form or another. Landlords who serve the poor such as section 8 should be given priority on grant money. Luxury rentals should get no grant.
I did not experience the power outages in California, but family routinely experiences power outages in California. U.S. Infrastructure is not what you think it is. And if it happens during the winter, it only takes one time for frozen pipes to create thousands of dollars of damage.
