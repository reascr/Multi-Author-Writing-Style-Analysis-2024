I don’t know if Herschel Walker was a pathological liar…I think he was just so stupid he would attempt to parrot back whatever script he was given that day and still mess it up. It was obvious the guy knew nothing about what he was talking about most of the time. Honestly if the views he was espousing weren’t so disgusting I would almost feel bad for the dude. Limited education and blows to head have definitely taken their toll.
