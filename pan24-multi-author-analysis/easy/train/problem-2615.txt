You know how Putin cares so much about the safety of his citizens, he even deployed rescue helicopters around the buildings to be ready to save any attempted suicides. But, OH NO, that randomly suicidal person bounced off the safety net right into the whirling propellers of the helicopter. What a tragedy!
Yea, IMO the chances they're going to be able to properly execute this pincer is slim to none, The terrain around bakhmut favors the defenders, as to the north there's an overlooking hill that UAF is in control of, and with how the Regulars are performing down south and now with Prigozi not getting anymore convicts, it's unlikely to swing far enough to force anything more than a fully controlled organized withdrawl... But knowing UAF, they could get circled and still have full operational control of the AO (See Azovastal where they were flying things into a 100km behind the lines seige all the way up to the final moments). I imagine it'll end more like the battle of the bulge than a Azovastal repeat. The Front would be too thin for RU to wrest much more than Control of the highways, and we've seen how that works out for them in Izium (Read: They don't hold those roads for long). The technological issues of the RUF, primarily their night operations capability hinder their ability to conduct a Thin salient siege of Bakhmut.
LOL... Feared Wagner Group HAS been downsized by The Ukrainian Armed Forces and permanently retired .
