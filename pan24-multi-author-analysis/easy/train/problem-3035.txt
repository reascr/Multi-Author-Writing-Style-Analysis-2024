Whether itâ€™s done through a kangaroo court or not, if you look over at /r/NewIran you will see the Iranian government is kidnapping, torturing, raping, and killing young Iranians everyday.
Exactly. That is the thing about Autocracies. You could let a little reform in and prevent some of these issues from spiralling out of control, but that would mean losing power. So instead of reforming or trying to keep the status quo, you double down on repression and oppression. You kidnap, kill, torture and rape people to try to keep them in line hoping fear will win in the end. If that doesn't work you just keep doing it, until it works or you get a civil war. All it takes is one random car bombing, assassination or internal coup attempt and all Hell will break loose. Hell the Supreme Leader is 83 years old and has been in charge since 1989. If he were to suddenly kick the bucket tomorrow from old age, what happens than. Do they put in a guy just as cruel as him or do they pull a Secret Speech talking about how terrible he as and blame all the atrocities on him to cover their ass.
