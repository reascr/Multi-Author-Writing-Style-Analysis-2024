Thank you for your report, the information contained within will be noted and possibly acted upon, however there is still the matter of the initiating insurrection and the call to action before hand, we will still be moving forward with indictments and arrests on those who acted on upon the testing of the security features noted in the report because there was no prior agreed upon and signed SoW in place prior to January 6th 2020.
No... There was a lot of Intel about there being a potential attack and stuff.. The capital police didn't prepare or get the supposed gear they needed when they had the ability to. Plenty of ppl here actively pushed that there was some sketchiness with the police and it should be investigated.
