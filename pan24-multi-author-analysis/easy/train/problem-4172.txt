We will probably all still have to pay taxes on it. Which is fine. I do believe value of the dollar and cost of tuition should be considered when paying individuals back who have paid in. I have paid mine but the cost of tuition has risen so the 20k relief for me would look a lot less in relation to of how much school was for me years ago. So like 20k is how much of the national average debt amount per person? Pay that back relative to the time debt was accrued and paid off I think would be fair enough. 20k might have covered an entire under grad, grad program, and maybe more years ago versus part of undergrad today. 20k just ten years ago is not the same as 20k now.
I’m happy I had my education in America, but—as somebody who’s spent years abroad—find it absolutely hilarious that my friends and family from a “shit-hole country” earned almost-free degrees and are, subsequently, accorded a significant advantage over their native-born counterparts.
$10-20k in relief is absolutely not crumbs. Currently, we are waiting to see if the supreme court allows it. The law is clear but this SC feels it is all up to interpretation.
