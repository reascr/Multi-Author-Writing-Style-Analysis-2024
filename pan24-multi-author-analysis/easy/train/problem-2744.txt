Heres 17 GOP that are newley elected and in relatively competitive districts. I got this information from Wikipedia page on the 118th Congress freshmen class. Theres plenty of wiggle room and at least till June. If you live in any of these districts contact your congressperson and your local parties to bully lobby them to vote for raising the debt ceiling. Copy and paste this list in any threads this comes up. No credit needed.
Just turns out that those were apparently inadequate since our founding fathers never thought of what would happen if those checks and balances refused to check or balance when it was inconvenient to their own party nor that military weaponry would get to the point where the chances of the people taking power back through force when the government failed ain't very good either.
They will once their donors start ringing their phone. Last time the debt ceiling was being blocked by Republicans Mitch McConnell ended up having to back down. All House Republicans wonâ€™t be willing to go along with it.
