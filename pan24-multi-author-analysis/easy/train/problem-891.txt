No, GA has significantly more Republican than Democratic voters at the moment. That said, while the Republicans lost the recent prominent Senate and presidential campaigns in 2020 and 2022, its because the Republican side had exceptionally poor candidates: , Trump who made a mockery of the presidency, and who both did insider trading on COVID info they received in Congress. (This is no insult to the effort on the Democratic side to get out the vote or any insult to the quality of Democratic candidate; it's just the opportunity to put the state in play only came because the GOP ran exceptionally bad candidates).
Absolutely. Runoffs were actually implemented as a way to prevent Democrats from winning. Getting rid of them would make things more fair, and thus hurt Republicans.
