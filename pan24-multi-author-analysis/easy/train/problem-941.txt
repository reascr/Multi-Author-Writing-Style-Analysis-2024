I saw your deleted message, maybe you thought better of it but I'll respond anyway. I've been speaking out and actively against police brutality since the 1990s, I've physically put myself in harms way to protect people from bigots, I've had my skin in the game and my credentials on support for civil rights for everyone are impeccable. I supported gay marriage before Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama, I didn't need polls to tell me what the right thing was. I was friends with transgender people when that was so unheard of, people had so many horrible beliefs back then and I told people to their face they were wrong. What have you done? Are you a slacktivist too? I've gone out and done my shit.
People misunderstand historical context. It doesn't mean no new laws can be created, it means new laws can't be created that directly contradict established decisions and law.
Really? I thought I could just buy a plane ticket bc I’m ‘Murican. (obvious /s if that ruffled your feathers).
Exclusively using history as a guide is… amazingly shortsighted, impractical, and fundamentally abdicating responsibility to engage with the present time.
Where will you go? Most countries are incredibly difficult to emigrate to, far harder than America even. Nobody has an "open door for disaffected Americans" policy.
