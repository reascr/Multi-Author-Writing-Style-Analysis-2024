They didn't both arrive at the same estimate. Neither Milley nor the European Commission gave an "estimate". An estimate is based on some kind of methodology that can itself be reviewed. Milley was speaking off the cuff and someone at the EC likely quoted him when they shouldn't have. I'm not sure how to make this any simpler for you.
Your top half of the comment isnt wrong, he was speaking off the cuff but I wouldn't say it was a baseless estimation, the guys a general his estimation is based on the experiences under his belt, its clear hes given it some thought, it wouldn't be the craziest thing in the world to maybe use that as a baseline for the gen pop like me and you who want some semblance of unbiased information about this topic and if you want to get more skeptical, Id say well connected and has relevant information hes seen to come to the conclusion. Devils advocate, he probably said something he shouldnt have said, had a brain fart and released sensitive info and he back tracked it.
