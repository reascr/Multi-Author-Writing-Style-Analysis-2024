Some self-styled "military" type people might disagree, and state that Ukrainian soldiers are legit targets, but that's only because they don't like the idea of soldier-killing-soldier ever being murder, because that can sometimes shine a spotlight on their own actions, or the actions of their own country.
Yes. This is conflating two different uses of the word legitimate. There are legitimate military targets in accordance with international treaties and the there is the legitimacy of any international relations due to international acceptance.
Holy shit, not even one? I'd have expected if something were a high priority target they'd pop a few. If that's true Russia really are fucking ineffective militarily.
Depends on the view point of course. From the sides involved in the war they probably both feel the other is illegitimate but from an outside perspective it should be possible to see both sides objectives and there are likely some worse than others.
Well in a way nothing is a legitimate target because its an illegitimate war in the first place but in a world were each side had a good reason to battle, yea, its a no shit sherlock comment.
