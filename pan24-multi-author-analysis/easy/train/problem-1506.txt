There's a huge difference between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russia has destabilized all of Europe. Its threatened the world with Nuclear holocaust as the world's largest nuclear arsenal and well over 100k people have died in Ukraine. Its no comparable at all. It was immoral was when the war started. Now its moved way beyond that.
The brazilian equivalent of the donald is r/bolsonaro , r/brasilivre has a wide variety of political instances from monarchists,liberals or social democrats the reason why people think it is bolsonarist is mainly because they hate lula.
Is it immoral? yes of course, however it is the norm in international relations. Or did other countries stop trade relations with the coalition of the willing over their invasion? maybe they stopped buying Saudi coalition Oil? of course not.
I guess it's too much of a hassle for the "world's fifth most populous country" to actually act in their best interest and strenhen relationships, stabilize the world and save on trade agreements later rather than make pennies and lose credibility with multiple countries. I mean fuck half the world's population. Am i right?
