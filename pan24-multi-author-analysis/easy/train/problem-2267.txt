How bad are they hurting themselves? Consider this too. There are a lot of hospitals, clinics and doctors offices that are closing in small town, rural America. Why? Hospitals and clinics have to pay their people. That includes doctors, nurses, techs, janitors, billing departments and administration. And, by law, hospitals can't simply turn someone away just because they can't pay the bills. Without Medicaid expansion, that's a lot of patients to treat without any hope of getting reimbursed. So hospitals close. Clinics close. Doctors move to areas that have patients who can pay. And people have two and three hour drives to get somewhere where they can get treatment. In emergencies. But, hey, gotta hurt the right people, yes?
Apologizing? I'm pretty sure he doesn't know the word, how to spell it, what it means, or how it is connected to the human experience by that funny thing we call empathy.
