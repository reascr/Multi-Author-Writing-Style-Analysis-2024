If he made sure there were no documents at his officers and homes, there wouldn’t have been anything there when they were moving his stuff out of his old office at The University Of Pennsylvania, and there wouldn’t have been a story. They didn’t find them as some kind of organized, specific search. They found them while they were closing out an office. I would have thought that as soon as they found out about what was going on with Trump, every property would be searched by his lawyers. They all should have been searched regardless of what is going on with Trump. It’s irresponsible that there were classified documents at an unsecured location. I’m not drawing an equivalency between what Biden did and what Trump did. Trump defied a subpoena for eighteen months. But what Biden did was irresponsible in more ways than one. There is no way you can say that leaving classified documents at an unsecured office at a university is not irresponsible. Especially when you have the resources President Biden has.
