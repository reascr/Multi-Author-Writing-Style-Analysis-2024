Yeah the major difference is that Ukraine has a significant Russian minority (according to their own census back in 2004 when 17% of the population self identified as Ethnically Russian on the census, that's 7-8 million people) Well Cuba never had a significant population of English speaking people, as it's people are Spanish decent.
1. Yes, it was a war. 2. As a Tatar I believe that Crimea belongs to Tatars, but it's situated in Ukrainian borders. 3. Of course it's a full scale war. 4. Of course Russia is an aggressor.

And it doesn't make you a good Russian, it's just make you a compassionate human being. None of us is free of responsibility, besides kids who were to young in the times of Putin's raise to power. I was, and I still know that I have my share of responsibility.
