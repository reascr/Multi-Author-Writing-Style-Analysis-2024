That's because America is so incredibly unstable since Trump/MAGA - those people love the chaos, and drama, and darkness - but the rest of the world thinks we're nuts. MAGA is slowly but surely destroying the country, which is what they want - because then they can re-make it into their Nazi paradise; everyone will be White, women will be walked on a leash by their husband, the Bible will be the law, guns everywhere, Jews in camps with the disabled/drug addicts/criminals, and medical care will consist of praying over the sick person... SMH. It's well on its way; how long will it take to get here I wonder?
A true "fair tax" regime would be eliminating federal income taxes (including the payroll tax) entirely for lower-income taxpayers, greatly increasing the rates on higher-income taxpayers, removing the cap on the payroll tax and creating additional surcharges for high-income taxpayers in states that do not tax them adequately.
It's not just me. I'd wager a very large portion of the population is against any form of UBI. This idea is one of the dumbest things i've ever heard, but that's what i would expect from a "plan" that was created and workshopped on a fucking radio program.
