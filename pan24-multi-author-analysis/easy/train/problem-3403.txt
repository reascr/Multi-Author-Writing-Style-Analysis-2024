Weird, as a defense contractor they seem just fine going through all my finances with a fine-tooth comb. Even found an old electric bill for $1.88 that went to collections 4 years prior. So weird.
A "legally blind" yet trump loyal shopkeeper politically motivated by the trump impeachment gave the impeached presidents lawyer incriminating information from a man that self identified but cannot be proven with any certainty to be the main political challengers son.
3. Current governments putting people in jail to prevent them from running is like authoritarian mock-democracy 101, and the US constitution is set up to prevent that from immediately working (although lets be honest, it would still work). People should have open and fair elections where they know all the relevant facts about their candidates, and if they choose someone with a criminal record or sketchy behaviour, so be it. "Otherwise it’s just a fucking popularity contest" yes, that is what elections always are, you pick the person you want to represent you for whatever reasons you want. That's what the imperfect system of representational democracy is?
No. They should do all of that and if there’s actual illegal activity they should not be allowed to run for president, period. The investigation should be well ahead of the primaries and rule criminals OUT of the race entirely. Otherwise it’s just a fucking popularity contest and we get criminals in the White House (like trump and likely many others).
