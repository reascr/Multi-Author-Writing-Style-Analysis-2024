Just like who knew the Taliban would be just as bad after the US pulled out of Afghanistan as before. Just a lot of reddit had been calling for the US to leave for years.
Also the EU wasn’t born out of a “let’s prevent the wars of the past and become the Federation from Star Trek but early” type of feeling that France and Germany had, it started as a coal and iron trade agreement that eventually was pushed further into cooperation thanks to the existence of an 11-time zones-big existential threat and the economic support of the US fielding the majority of the defense expenses related to prevention of that conflict (and the stabilization of international maritime trade by the sheer threat of meeting the wrong end of an USN carrier group if you try to play funny and disrupt it).
Their money? What money did they have before they extracted it from the Americas, Africa, India, etc.? They didn't come with money, they came with guns and diseases.
Well...yeah actually. It kinda sucks to listen to Europeans simultaneously complain about US force projection and complain that we were late to force project into WWII, how we should have done X, should have sent arms to Y but never Z. I realize this is like, tiny violin time but as a Regular Normal Person in the US, yeah, it gets old.
