Btw, I never saw it actually used. The closest we got was when a pleasure boater got too close and the security detail got his attention. One sailor had it ready to switch on just in case, and another had the M2 ready to fire. This was in the time after the Cole bombing. So yeah.
you do understand US war games put US capabilities at minimum, give all luck or otherwise uncontrolled variables such as weather in favor towards the enemy, and once the qargames are finished all information is taken in and analyzed to ensure that situation never comes to pass. War Games are never taken on with even footing or even the higher ground the US military would inevitably have. There's a reason virtually all nations basically do all they can to avoid all out war with the US, and it certainly isn't because they have a good, or even tangible, chance of winning.
