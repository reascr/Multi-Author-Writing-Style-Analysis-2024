For clarification do they really want to change dogmas, or did you mean doctrine? Dogma is the stuff that the church holds crucial to the tenets of Christianity- i.e. belief in one God in three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), belief that Jesus is God's only son who was sent to earth and died for our salvation, etc. These beliefs are laid out in the Nicene Creed. According to the church Dogma can't be changed.
