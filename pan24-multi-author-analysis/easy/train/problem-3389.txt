Most would be amazed at just how large the USSR's weapon stocks were (& Russia's are now, who inherited/forcefully transferred most of it after the USSR's collapse). 80ish years of a planned economy focused on heavy industry & arms production. Both conventional & weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological & nuclear) were produced at scales dwarfing anything the west could do with our market led economies producing mostly consumer goods.
Well not so much Crimea yet.. They probably think they cannot get Kherson back now so they blow it to pieces hoping it no longer holds any strategic value. If they start losing their grip on Crimea, no doubt that they will start bombing it to pieces as well. ðŸ¤”.
Amazing that video the other day of the Russian TV news anchor saying that if he says the Russian military was right for abandoning Kherson, he'll go to prison for supporting the violation of Russian territorial integrity...
But if he says they were wrong to abandon Kherson he'll go to prison for discrediting the Russian military...
