I wonder. How can you be broke if you don't pay hardly any taxes? And seems his kid said he has plenty of money coming in from Russia. Not to mention the Saudis.
But intentionally losing money (which is what I assumed you meant by "loophole," but in re-reading your comment, I notice you only use incompetentance as your example, so I may have been mistaken) and as a tax avoidance strategy is not a sound idea, and anyone trying it isn't going to have an easy time getting those loans you claim you can live off.
That's all good. However, when you spend 5-6 years trying to get someone's tax returns, I expect to see something criminal or something that is worthy of at least making headlines for at least one 24 hour news cycle.
