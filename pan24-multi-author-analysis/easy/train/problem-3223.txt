Individuals' carbon footprints do acount for the emission of these companies though. The objective really is reducing our carbon footprint, and individuals being mindful is probably insuficient but does help a lot.
Can we? I'm sorry to be Negative Nancy, but considering we are in the late stage of capitalism, I have serious doubts certain people and/or companies can be reached, let alone bothered, with the normal rules anymore. How do you think they got so far in the first place? Hard, honest, clean and moral work? They perfected loopholes. They perfected paying everything and everyone off, one way or another, so they can look the other way or hell: get a slice of the cake themselves. They perfected creating, shaping and manipulating any and all systems in their favor, including the people within and behind them: banks, laws, politics, workers, governments. And not only for a few days. This is the result of decades of preparation and planning. If you or anyone else thinks the normal people have even the slightest chance to harm these entities anymore, you are either naive, dilussional or refuse to accept the reality of the situation.
