GILMAN LOUIE: One of the critical things for us to be successful in returning manufacturing, as well as many other technologies that are going to revolutionize the economy over the next decade, is to not just get alignment from the government and the research capacity of our great universities, but we've got to get our capital markets involved, right? I mean, if you look at the US as compared to a country like China, the Chinese are investing probably in the neighborhood of 10X what we're investing in these deep technology areas. And while they're $2 trillion of commitment over the next five years is a lot of money, we have $45 trillion in capital markets. And if we can direct the capital markets to start investing in these critical infrastructures like microelectronics, not only do we shore up our supply chain challenges that we have, but we also lay the foundation for the next generation of technology that we can create a trillion or more dollars of economic wealth.
