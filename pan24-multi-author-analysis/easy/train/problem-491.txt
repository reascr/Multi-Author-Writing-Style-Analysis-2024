This sounds like a pretty solid Rorschach test to identify whether or not individual "conservatives" really are just another domestic terrorist in waiting or an actual American.
Sigh. I looked it up. Yes that was a banner displayed at CPAC. But context matters. And it was a poor attempt at a tongue in cheek joke. It's stupid and a really bad attempt at being sarcastic. But I can't blame you for your stance on this. It's not a good look.
Violence, war, authoritarianism, dictatorship or similar non-democratic strongman forms of government?
1/6. I don't think we have seen ALL the evidence, but ultimately it was a few hundred people caught up in mob mentality, and caused injury and damage to the capital and they should be arrested, tried, and sent to prison. It's an unfortunate terrible situation that definitely gives the right wing a nasty black eye and not indicative of a majority of the party. I don't think those people were anywhere near to accomplishing an "insurrection" of any kind. And I don't believe the Right as a whole thinks they're (GOP) "domestic terrorists".
