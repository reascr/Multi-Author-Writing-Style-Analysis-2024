Iâ€™m honestly afraid to watch this train of events unfold. Either the coalition fractures quickly or it will be a total calamity. A sizable portion of Israel has to be horrified.
Indoctrinating people into nigh-unquestionably respecting a hierarchy - particularly individuals in that hierarchy - makes people right-leaning.
I wish I knew. There's a lot of history of racism between different groups of Jews, and animosity between secular Ashkenazi's and the Mizrahi's and most other religious parties go back several decades. To me it all feels like a "fuck you, now it's our turn to get away with murder", very much like how people here wanna "reinstall" Trump.
Incredibly inapplicable to Israeli politics. Those German Jews believed that all Jews should assimilate to their host countries, in the hopes that subservience/showing their stomachs would save them from persecution; Israel embodies the opposite mindset.
\- compare Israel to Nazi Germany (if you feel strongly enough that Israel is authoritarian, there is a wide range of other, better comparisons to choose from, that do not weaponize Jewish history).
