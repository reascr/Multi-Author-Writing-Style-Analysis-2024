Then just photoshop Florida Ron in drag, release a few ads, and bam, you’ll connect George/Anthony’s scandals to Ron. After all, he was always a tertiary identity for George Anthony Santos. I mean, have you ever seen them in the same room?? It was clearly a con all along.
>CNN’s Manu Raju began the exchange on Tuesday by questioning Mr McCarthy over whether his resistance to calling for Mr Santos to resign, a step several of his GOP colleagues have taken, was due to his desire to protect a single-digit Republican majority in the chamber. Mr McCarthy denied this, telling Mr Raju that were he to hold Congress and the US government to that standard, many lawmakers including President Joe Biden would be unfit to serve.
Integrity? Nobody is even sure of Santos real name and he’s a congressman, with a good amount of Russian money behind him. It’s just embarrassing at this point.
