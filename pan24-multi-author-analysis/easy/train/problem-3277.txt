At least in the short term, out-voting them is going to have to be how it’s done. The decentralized nature of the American election system, once considered a bulwark against takeover attempts, has proven of the sort GOP election deniers are waging now: A victory for even one such candidate in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Minnesota or Nevada could be enough to cause chaos in future presidential elections.
Great answer, thanks! Speaking of Qanon and the 'great awakening': why do you guys think there's so little attention for the fact that a lot of the conspiracies overlap with russian domestic and propaganda rhetoric and sometimes even is a straight up copy from what people the likes of Aleksandr Dugin have written in their books? The sentiment has been in the US silently for ages i think, but it feels like we're underestimating how much of a catalyst foreign interference is with this extremist thought.
Hi! Yea totally get that. So I’ll admit it’s kind of a tough term to define, especially as the conservative movement and the GOP have basically been almost wholly subsumed by MAGA, which I would characterize as an extremist, anti-democratic movement.
In the specific context of my reporting, I’d say “far-right extremism” refers to reporting on groups that are the most explicitly white nationalist, fascist, conspiratorial etc.., and observing how those groups interact with and influence the GOP and the broader conservative movement.
