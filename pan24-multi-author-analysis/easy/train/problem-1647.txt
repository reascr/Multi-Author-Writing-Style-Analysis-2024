That's so interesting! I remember a while ago, when it discovered Fin whales were mating with Blue whales, folks were worried about the status of Fin whales. It appears like killing a Fin whale kicked-off some of the ban in Iceland? I'll definitely look into it.
i don’t mean to attack japan as a whole, or even the people who make a living in the industry; my criticism is on the officials who use ‘tradition’ to support an industry that is commercially unnecessary, globally detrimental, logistically unsustainable, and [imo] disrespectful of the culture[s] they use to deflect criticism.
Yes, we do. They are whaling within their own territory. I know this may sound insistent, but instead of focusing only on Japan, we should pay attention to other countries that are whaling.
I believe the Asian perspective from the West is the reason why Japan is in the spotlight on this whaling issue. In the West, the way we look at Japan is sometimes stereotypical and stereotyped. It is the perspective that they are a barbaric people with different values than us. This has been that perspective historically.
