GOP also benefits from an outdated political system that wildly over favours them relative to their actual numbers, extreme gerrymandering in many key states and laws that specifically depress the democrat vote, massive national news infrastructure that delivers extreme right wing propaganda 24 hours a day, incredible luck in being able to appoint most of the Supreme Court, transparent interference in the election from foreign allies who want to see the nation fail and lax regulation that allows billionaire fascists an unprecedented ability to flood elections with money.
