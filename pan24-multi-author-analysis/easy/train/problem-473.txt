Oh for fuck's sake. Somebody within the walls of the Supreme Court leaked it. The fact that "we did an investigation and found nothing" is just fucking unacceptable. It means that:
an unprecedented betrayal of public institutions and norms to suit a republican ideological concern that negatively impacts millions of Americans, and the investigation coming up just short of doing something about it because the perpetrator is a powerful person investigating themselves? couldn't be.
Now Biden has to use this opportunity to say that since guilt or innocence of all members of SC cannot be verified and corrupt Supreme Court cannot be allowed to stand as it is a serious national security risk, he will play it safe, removes every single sitting judge and nominates new set of judges all by himself.
