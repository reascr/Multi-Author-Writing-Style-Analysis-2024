We have super max prisons that go many stories under ground. There is an ADX in Florence, Colorado. It houses Robert Handssen, an FBI agent that sold classified documents to Russia, Ramzi Yousef, he bombed the World Trade Center, Richard McNair, a murderer who escaped other prisons three times, Ted the unibomber, Michael Swango aka Dr Death, a prolific poisoner of patients and colleagues, the Boston bomber, Larry Hoover, a prolific gang leader and murderer who Kanye tried to get pardoned, Dwight York, cult leader and massive pedophile who people still follow, and various other bomber murderer types.
