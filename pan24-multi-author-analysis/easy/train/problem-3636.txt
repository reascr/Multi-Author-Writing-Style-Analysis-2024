Musk makes 1.75M an hour. He doesn't earn that much but he makes it anyway. Make him and others like him pay taxes to offset our costs.

It’s capitalism. The nicer the landlord keeps the building the more attracted high income earners would be to live in the building. The capped percentage of their wealth would pay the landlord more in rent. I think for the price I’m paying for my apartment it feels like section eight with how much the landlord is making/not doing any renovations.
Yeah, I’m saying a landlord must be capped for what they can charge for monthly rent. A certain percentage of someone’s monthly gross salary. I don’t care if it’s a 60 year old retiree or Blackrock.
