Last semester, I transferred to an out-of-state university to get away from Florida’s university system. I’ll be finishing the full move by getting tf out of FL and finishing my degree on the northwest coast in a couple of months. Ive only had one full semester at my new university but I am absolutely blown away by how different the professors and atmosphere are, even as an online/distance student rn. Not only is every part of the financial aid system so straight forward and simple at my new uni, everyone is so fucking patient and understanding. Every single professor has gone the extra mile to work with me, my advisors and deans make me actually feel encouraged and motivated, and the university takes student comfort and safety seriously. Not only that, the classes feel more engaging and seem like they practice way more critical thought when teaching new concepts. I’m blown away by how different this feels than any of the three Southern universities I’ve been to. Like, it feels weird to think universities in the Northern US could be this different than Southern ones, but as someone who’s been doing the college thing for a while and spent time at universities in Texas and Florida, it really feels that way.
