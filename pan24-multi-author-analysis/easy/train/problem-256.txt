Jebus, let me tell you. I live in Washinon but probably my favorite place on the left coast is the northern Oregon coastline. It's absolutely gorgeous, all of it. I've stopped in Newport for extended periods but never stayed. Had a great stay at Deane's Oceanfront Lodge (in Yachats). The beach is a short walk and you can carve your name in the sandstone.
"In a second case, again involving an angry prosecutor, a lawyer was terminated after circulating a questionnaire about the alleged mismanagement of the district attorney’s office.

It's beautiful here and I love it. I agree with folks that, while we're sometimes too honest, we're genuine people. From the south sound, Mt Rainier is visible from about everywhere on a good day. It's seriously majestic AF and I catch my breath every time I see it, still- after living here for 25 years. If you're an active person, you'll never exhaust your opportunities. That's not including my review of Washinon coast and my beloved Oregon coast. I highly recommend visiting with a mind to move.
