A grim scene indeed. I trust the Ukranians will manage it through winter so long as they have food and the russians kept at bay, preferably dead but for now, at bay. Everything will have to be rebuilt anyways so i hope they can manage to keep fires running by using what they find and keep watching out for eachother. While noone should have to endure this pointless mess, i have faith in the resolve of the Ukranian people and that they will get through this without too many freezing to death. Victory will come.
I mean, shit, we have at least one freezing death a year on average and that’s in a town of 2000 with all amenities and next to zero homelessness (defined in this case by lack of access to shelter - actual definition is different but we’re talking pure survival statistics here.).
Let’s not forget that there are plenty of good people in Russia still, most of them are in jail for boycotting the war so in honor of all those wonderful Russians maybe we stop saying “fuck Russia” and stick to “fuck putin” or “fuck the kremlin” or some other variation which does not inadvertently group in good Russians.
