The more Democrats try to hold the center and ignore the fact that the younger generation is the only thing keeping them alive, the more conservative and right-leaning they become. You mention unity, okay - most of the conservative Democrats always say the same thing "The party needs unity." But by this they only ever mean "Progressives need to sit down and let the moderates lead.".
Multi-member districts. Countries that have younger legislatures tend to have districts where you elect more than one rep for a district at a time, so that younger, less-experienced members of a party can more easily ride the coattails of more well-known candidates. And states can do this under their own election laws, if they decide to. We just set up our system before multi-member districts were really in use. Itâ€™s time to fix that.
It's from looking at actual left-leaning countries who don't consider things like free health-care and post-secondary education as "extreme left-wing concepts" and see them as beneficial investments in future generations...
