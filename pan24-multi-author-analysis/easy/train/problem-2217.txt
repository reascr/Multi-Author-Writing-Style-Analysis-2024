I’m wholly against this child labor policy foisted by bought and paid for GQP republicans, it’s anti child and anti human. Accidents in the workplace will rise if these bills pass among many awful consequences. Their motives are not for their constituents and highly suspect across the board. They serve corporations not people, it’s obvious. That said, I started working at 14 as a cooler stocker/bottle boy when beverages came in returnable/reusable glass bottles. It was a very fun and eye opening experience for me as I saw a diverse array of customers from all walks of life and made money to spend on things like my bmx obsession. I don’t regret it.
The problems are A) expecting literal children to know the law in the first place, B) expecting parents to know the law and step in for violations (most people don't know the laws), C) expecting children to speak up/advocate for themselves when they may be working because their family literally NEEDS the money to survive, and D) eliminating retaliation for reporting violations. Much easier to just not pass this law.
