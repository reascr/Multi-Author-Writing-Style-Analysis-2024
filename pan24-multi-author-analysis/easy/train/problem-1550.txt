When Putin falls, for good and not just down the stairs with a poopy diaper, there will be an authoritarian bidding war for Republican loyalties. Will it be a new Russian oligarch, or maybe Xi seeking permission to take Taiwan, or eastern European dictators? Arab oil..o ry? Who knows? Stay tuned!
Right, but in a two-party system, you could see all former traditional GOP candidates fleeing to the newly created party, all it would take is a public perception that MAGA is somehow better branding, or that the MAGA leaders have the public spotlight to advance candidates in purple states the way Trump, uh, utterly and spectacularly failed to in 2022.
This could go on for a very long time. In a week, would 6 Republicans accept a compromise Liz Cheney as Speaker? Would McCarthy accept binding concessions to Democrats for their votes? Who else could break the performative protest by these 20 maga members?
