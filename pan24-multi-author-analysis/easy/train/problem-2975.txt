Because the easiest News-brownie points come from Ukraine. Your leaders have decided that you should just focus on that now. Once the right people cashed in their defense stocks you can be angry about Iran.
Jesus was mainly a philosoper, and his teaching were mostly related to personal lifestyle (and arguably don't lead to a functioning society if taken literally).Christian norms are general (give everything to the poor, renounce to violence, love your friends and enemies, don't betray your partner), and you're not really supposed to always follow them: everyone is a sinner, everyone can be forgiven.Of course, absolutely evil things were done in the name of Christianity (because the bible is a contradictory and somewhat vague book and you really can interpret it any way you want with enough mental gymnastics) , but nowadays being a "moderate christian" living your faith on a personal level in a secular society is easy, because that's in line with the original spirit of the founder.On the other hand Muhammad was a succesful ruler and conqueror, his norms and rewards are far more precise and quantifiable (Give x fraction of your wealth to the poor, pray x times a day, go to place x once in a lifetime, you can have up to x wives, you will get x virgins in heaven) and actually define a functional model of society.
