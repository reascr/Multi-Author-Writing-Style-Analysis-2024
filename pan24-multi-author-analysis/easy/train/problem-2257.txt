I would bet that Trump endorsements is actually a large reason the gop got ruined this election cycle. Like dude you are old news. But nope, narcissistic tendencies above the average politician and this is what happens. And if the gop really wanted a win they would have never fucking touched abortion, subsequently the people running would have never doubled down on it. That's the one thing I'm noticing, Republicans are dense and won't budge, democrats will typically say whatever it takes to not piss off the major voting base ( major metropolitan areas). Whether either side means what they say i have no clue.
Being forced to remain pregnant is extremely fucked up, especially in situations where a woman wants the child but there are complications incompatible with life but they have no option but to let everything happen naturally even if there's unnecessary risk to the mother.
Yep. People hate Manchin too much when you consider he’s a Dem in a staunchly Republican state. He’s gotta pull some foolishness sometimes and this gives him cover to do so.
