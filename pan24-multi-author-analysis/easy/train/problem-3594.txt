A lesson? Ukraine literally lost 4 regions and thousands of troops. Not to mention all of the destroyed infrastructure. I don't think many of you understand what a war of attrition really means. So cocky.
With nearly 100,000 dead troops, thousands of tanks and armored vehicles destroyed, hundreds of aircraft and helicopters shot down, their Black Sea flagship sunk and the rest of the fleet cowering out of range of Ukrainian ASMs, wasting so many missiles and guided munitions trying to terrorize the populace with war crimes that they’re now having to modify old surface-to-air missiles to act as makeshift artillery rockets, their economy and supply chain so fucked that they’re having to loot various consumer electronics from Ukraine to salvage circuit boards from washing machines and the like for making new weapons, and with Ukraine receiving billions of dollars worth of arms from the West, and having had nearly a year to train tens of thousands of new troops, dig in defenses, coordinate their supply lines and command structure, and refine their war strategy?
Genius move. Attack to unprepared positions with professional army and with better equipment did not work, so lets attack again against positions that were prepared since spring with mobiks. What could go wrong?
Putin may not be the brightest and might be a bit delusional causing him to think he has significant odds in his favor; Putin did, after all, both plan this invasion in spite of the Russian military's condition and warned the Ukrainians with rhetoric as well as limited military action in the East and Crimea (which, I suspect, spawned Zelensky the Liberator in '14 who saw this coming).
I'm sorry. I just don't see the war has been won by Ukraine. I mean yeah journalists are making the claim and plenty of internet keyboard warriors say so, but it's not reality.
