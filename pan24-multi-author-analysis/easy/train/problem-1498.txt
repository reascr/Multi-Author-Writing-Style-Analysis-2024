It's not just this. Offensive operations are WAY more complicated at all levels. Untrained conscripts do fairly well when you hand them a rifle, stick them in a foxhole and tell them to blast anything that comes from that'away. They do not do a well conducting complex, combined arms maneuvers. That shit is hard. That's what good armies spend tons of time building up to and practicing. That's why they are good at it. It takes time to make a good infantryman. It takes waaaay longer to make a good infantry nco or officer. Most of those dudes in the pre war Russian army that fit that description are now sunflower fertilizer. About the best you're gonna get from untrained conscripts are human wave frontal assaults, which don't go so hot when you're assaulting prepared positions across open ground that's pre-registered for artillery.
Massive corruption, obviously. Looking at the history of Chcen Wars (and all other Russian wars) we can safely assume Russian officers at every level will steal as much as possible to fill their pockets.
