I fail to see whatâ€™s so wrong about this. Sure these kids are sacrificing crucial years of learning to a life of mediocre wages. But the economy needs this, requires their sacrifice for the greater goods and services. Things arenâ€™t THAT bad. Shiiiiet. My great grandpappy worked 18 hour days without a complaint. Most of his pals did it with less limbs too. We as a nation have become lazy. Our precious billionaires need as much productivity from us as possible; meanwhile weâ€™ve done a good job helping them increase that number to near record levels over the past 50 years while asking for mediocre wage growth in return for our efforts. But times are TOUGH How else are they going to cut corners at every turn in order to boost the stocks so they can get their hard earned stock buy backs. Frankly, as an American! I am willing to let all future generations pull themselves up by their bootstraps so that our financial elite can rake in as much as humanly possible. I am proud to endorse child labor as a just cause for the economy. We are mere years away from the tipping point of trickle down economics FLOODING all of our bank accounts with unimaginable amounts of wealth. Thank you and god bless, baby Jesus. America ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.
Let me guessâ€¦â€¦ they want to bring back child labor. Then condition them by paying them less. Some sort of minor minimum wage. So when they become adults the wonâ€™t know the actual sort of their labor and accept lower wagesâ€¦.. or is that just republicans?
