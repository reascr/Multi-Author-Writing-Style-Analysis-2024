Another story is about a commander, who led territorial defense in Kherson, but when his units ran out of ammunition, he was ordered to have his units bury their weapons and documents, put on civilian clothes, keep phone off and each get selves to Mykolaiv. The commander stayed behind. Dressed like a drunk hobo. Doused himself in liquor. Rubbed trash on himself. Fake-staggered all over the city, laid in ditches, sometimes for over a day. So that he could observe enemy locations, hobble off somewhere, phone it in, then stagger off somewhere else. Apparently, he was responsible for calling in those Chornobaivka reports—he’d lay there, and was astounded they kept going back, so he’d call it in again. But also, they have not-normal cell phones. They have military-issued phones with encryption. But I think he said at some point, his was at a location he couldn’t access, so he started using Snapchat? (It’s in my history, where I translated and posted.) Bc he’d move around city, stay different places. He’s in Kharkiv with it seems like 2/3 of that unit now. [some were killed, some captured, and sadly, some switched sides, he said.] He wants to go back to Kherson, go dig up those weapons, lol.
In this context, I can definitely see Iran having a better chance at becoming a successful democracy... especially when you consider it's a relatively more culturally/geographically homogeneous society than Russia/China.
