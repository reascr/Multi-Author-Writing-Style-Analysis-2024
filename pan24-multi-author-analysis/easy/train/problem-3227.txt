Excellent Trump-Speak. But, I'm sure her overtures will fail as miserably as his. America is sick to death of these sore losers. The election was a emphatic rejection of these people.
Absolutely. I like the thought of all of them uniting to form one unproductive unit. It’s good enough to attract about 30% of voters but not enough to get them over the line. Thanks to their absolutely insane and random behaviour, it’s also not enough to attract huge investments from overseas trash anymore either.
Pathetic. Doubt anyone who voted for her will support this nonsense. Law suits are expensive, time consuming. How is this better for Arizona.
