It’s just annoying that everyone is some kind of expert on Reddit. If I sounded apathetic maybe it’s because I was. There are much bigger problems to focus on than this common sense article. And though I don’t agree with what the article is claiming, I do think in todays world there’s some need to incentivizing people. At least until some better system is established. Within the bounds of capitalism you’d at least like to think the incentives (on average) are focused on attracting the best and the brightest into the most important positions. That unfortunately all too often doesn’t happen and within politics it seems particularly problematic. I don’t know what the solution to that larger problem is (I’m not one of the millions of self proclaimed experts on everything), but complaining about or ultimately limiting the quality of hotels doesn’t seem like it’s much of an answer (in my admittedly ignorant opinion).
Yup. And if they're actually doing anything important, shelling out another £1000 per night would still be a bargain for tax payers, if it could make them even 1% more alert with better sleep. Of course, that's not what £1000 per night gets you (it actually gets you booze, obsequious housekeeping, and gold leaf on the taps). But 300 per night for reasonably soundproof walls and a non-crappy mattress is what the taxpayer should want.
