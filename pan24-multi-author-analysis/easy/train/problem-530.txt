It will do a smidge better than no Abrams. There's not point comparing to the Leopard. Do you know just how many Leopard 2s were built? Somewhere in the realm of 3600. That's spread across multiple countries. Do you know how many M1A2s are estimated to be in us stocks (not talking the shiny new upgraded SEPv2 or v3, just M1A2 that went into production in 92)? The number is somewhere between 2000 to 3700. The countries that operate the Leopard 2 can spare a few hundred in total and that's after giving up having any reserves. The US can spare a thousand Abrams easily and the only worry would be not having to count them. There is no comparison between Leopard 2 and Abrams. The first is a stopgap measure like the T-72 deliveries. The second is a war ender.
Absolutely! Do you see why it was weird of you to attack me and others in that way saying we would have hurt the Ukrainian people when we were right and tried to get them better equipment? And that you could have added your opinion without seeking confrontation resulting in a better discussion?
