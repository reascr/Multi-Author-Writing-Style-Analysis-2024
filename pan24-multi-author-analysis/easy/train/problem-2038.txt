In 2022 the MIC spent 28ish million on contributions and 92 million in lobbying. I looked and in 2020 and 2021 it was more. This year was slightly done but they've spent billion and maybe even a trillion the past 40 years. They're so dumb.
The theory that Putin invaded Ukraine because of NATO related reasons is you just gobbling up russian propaganda, exhibiting a shocking display of dim-witted US-centrism AND ignoring the fact that NOT EVERYTHING IN THE FUCKING WORLD IS ABOUT AMERICA, so start treating other countries like having legitimate interests outside of what america says or does.
No, NATO enchroachment and the US were a pretext for the invasion (and a flimsy one at that, seeing as how Putin is commiting the entire strategic arsenal of missiles, and the reserve forces bordering NATO, or NATO-aligned countries), the goal was always the political alignment of Ukraine or outright annexation.
Lend-lease is what I was waiting to see. Ukraine has tons of natural resources that are ripe for extraction. Just like how the US saw such a boom economy after WWII (cause all the infrastructure as destroyed in Europe), Ukraine will provide a great boon for American industry.
