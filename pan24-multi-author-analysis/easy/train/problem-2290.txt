Ok that's an ill advised way of framing his empathy. Guessing PR team is none too pleased. (Fun tip, do NOT post this on the r/soccer reddit. They are a bunch of worked up, over sensitive babies who seriously can't handle something like this. I posted a cool article I'd seen about a . It's going to also have an entirely new neighborhood around it, shops, pubs, apartments, everything. As someone from NY, I thought this was pretty awesome. Soccer is really taking off when something like this happens. Well anyway, the author of the article used a little flippin hyperbole in their headline. Kind of the norm for substack types. I mean, it's news but also fun opinion. They had a meltdown over it. Couldn't get past a headline. So stupid. ).
Criticising the preponderance of concussions, head injuries and brain damage in American football, and the contribution pads and the culture has to it (cos the same injury issues exist in rugby but to a lesser extent) seems like a valid serious criticism and a bit unfair to dismiss as "taking a dump" on it. I didn't mean to seem blas√© about the problem, it's a huge issue and it baffles me the sport continues to be played without serious action being taken when those consequences exist.
