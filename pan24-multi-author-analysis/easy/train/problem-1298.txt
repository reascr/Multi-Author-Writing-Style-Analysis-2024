Consumers approved of this behavior. While it was happening and the rust belt kept rusting we should of voted with our wallets to stop it but we didnâ€™t. This was an all sides fiasco.
Capitalism seeks to make a profit wherever it can to enrich those at the head of whatever business you look at, this generally leads towards outsourcing of labour and manufacturing elsewhere to places with lower standards of living, lower minimum wages, lower expectation or opportunity when conditions at home improve for the workers. For example the sweatshops all over Asia that we know produce cheap goods through awful conditions that we as a society tuck into. To accomplish an ideal world in which all are able to work and live in a way such that all can live in a comfortable manner the current system will not work. We absolutely can make change and that change we should make is to move away from this neo-feudalistic capitalism we find ourselves in and instea move towards social democracy or even outright socialism in any areas we can emphasising the needs of those who cannot yet live comfortably in a way that they don't need to scrounge every penny buying these cheap goods from abroad until they can. Extensive social safety nets, a cutting of wealth hoarding by the 1% via taxation to distribute it to the masses, allowing workers to own the means of production are all things an ideal system would allow for no? Policies like these are what we as a species should strive towards. We also should not be satisfied when the label of socialism or communism is slapped on something unless it truly reflects the reality that these systems describe. I think fundamentally we agree that change is necessary and possible, I and many other simply think that the system we find ourselves to be a part of functions on the backbone of exploitation of someone somewhere and thus we say that ethical consumption cannot happen under capitalism.
