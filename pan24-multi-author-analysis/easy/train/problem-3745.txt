True! Oh man, I had a roommate in college who was addicted to xanax... dude polished off a bottle in a few days and was a wandering narcoleptic for a week. Friends were texting me at all hours of the day, "hey, your roommate is passed out in the cafeteria," "hey, he's snoring in the study hall across campus.".

Good god just reschedule the damn shit. We wouldn’t need to waste time passing laws for exceptions if the drug scheduling was based on any common sense at all. Cannabis and psychedelics should not be schedule 1.
