The Central Asians are more than a little rooting for Ukraine. They likely assume two things (1) if Russia is successful in Ukraine they're likely on the menu too; and (2) do to geography they can't expect significant or likely any outside help.
Interesting. I wonder if active service means any tank in any location throughout Russia. For example, does a tank in Vladivostok or even Syria count toward the total in active service?
Really? I hadn't read the release but I didn't see it mentioned in any of the summaries posted here. e.g.
Probably both operators and mechanics. The Bradley needs a crew of 3, so for 50 they'd need a crew of 150 to operate. That leaves 350 folks that will either be trained as backup operators or mechanics/technicians, I would think. Not an expert, though.
They were doing the first official one, then that "ended", right before they had their standard autumn/winter conscription which would have just recently ended (if it did actually end), but the reality is the same set of staff is used for mobilisation and the conscriptions so it's just the same shit under a different name. They couldn't have done both at the same time anyway.
