Cnbc can be such a reality check when they do interviews with the truely stinking rich. Generally the billionaires stick to the script, "we care about workers, think the environment is important, we should have family leave". But if the interviewers scratch the surface even a little, the rich quickly become defensive. "I give lots to charity, do you know how I grew up (guy who got a loan from his rich dad to start a business), people just don't want to work now". All of them. It was really bad a year ago or two ago when covid was still hot and the billionaires wanted folks to return to the office and people couldn't for 1000 different reasons, like lack of childcare, etc. "I give millions to charity!" You are sitting on a 100 billion bucks, bud. That's the interest you make on your pocket change savings account, my man.
Everybody? Wow, this guy is clearly out of the loop on regular people's lives lmfao. He should step down from that perch he's on and see what it's like to live normally. Enjoy your riches man, whatever, but don't speak for the average family.
