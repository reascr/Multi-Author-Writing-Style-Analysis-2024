Ehh, that’s a shady bit of shade to throw. The US gets pulled down a lot by backwater rural states. For example, I live in Massachusetts and if we were an independent country, our education would be top 5 in the world and number 2 in healthcare. Our state has universal healthcare and would be 2nd in the world in human development index behind Switzerland. GDP per capita also ridiculously high in the Northeast. As a country we certainly have a ton of work to do, but I’m super pleased with the progress we’ve made in the last 15 years or so in laggard indicators (less a certain four years) anti-progression will dwindle as the boomer population declines. We’re a lot bigger than European countries high on HDI, and change takes more time. Slow change is also a feature, not a flaw of our constitution. It’s the Pareto principle: the top 20% does all the heavy lifting. I’m still super proud of what this young country has been able to accomplish and very hopeful about the future.
Resources, intelligence, and capitalism. Also the states have lots of heavy rail, waterways, and roads to ship things from. Very few countries have ports on the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. It’s multiple factors that lead to insane wealth.
