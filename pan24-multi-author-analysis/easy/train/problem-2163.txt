"We trust Israel to do the hard and right thing for us while we sit on our asses and try to point out every little thing it does wrong".
So let me get this straight, it's the US and Israel who are the monsters and a danger to the free world, yes?
First, Israel is not a massive threat to it's neighbors. It factually gave back more land mass than it's entire size in exchange for peace with it's neighbors. So your comment is very wrong.
The protesting people in Javanrud have been attacked with war bullets by the repressive forces of the Islamic Republic, the hospitals of Javanrud and Piranshahr are facing a shortage of blood, and the forces of the Islamic Republic do not allow blood shipments to enter Javanrud, the Islamic Republic is carrying out a genocide in Kurdistan.
That's a lie on your part. Trumps withdrawal from the treaty is what broke the deal and is the reason why Iran is now trying for nuclear weapons.
Counterpoint. I don't want Israel, Iran, or any nation to have nuclear weapons, but Israel does, and Iran doesn't, so Iran seems a logical place to contain the spread of something that's already spread to Israel.
