The country as a whole can't make up its mind. The pain of the defeat to NATO forces is still quite raw with many (especially considering some of the questionable targets that were hit) and a few people feel like there is unfinished business and so lean towards Putin.
I like sports. I fucking hate nationalism and how every fucking international event has to become a referendum for every limped-dick loser's sense of personal pride. Olympic medal tables are fucking cringe. The fact that something like India-Pakistan cricket (or USA-USSR contests in the recent past) is connected by media to actual geopolitical tensions is tacky and tasteless. And the fact that so many people are addicted to spectacle that they'll passively endorse this world cup, a human rights shitshow even by FIFA's own standards, by watching it is disgusting. The lowest effort thing people could do to stop this from happening in the future is just not watch the games. But they won't because it's "more than a game.".
That right there is what im trying to elude to, the armbands aint the issue here, its the organizers, i think the ones at fault are pretty obvious here (construction companies) but fifa’s a bigger target i suppose, its no wonder that big corpos contract shady companies to do their dirty work just for a cheaper sum, fifa’s just another apple/microsoft/nvidia.
Lol. You mock sports while acting like wearing a fucking armband will end prejudice. Get the fuck out of here and stop being so condescending. Do I like or agree with what FIFA did? No. But I'm not going to pretend like wearing or not wearing an armband will make a difference either way.
