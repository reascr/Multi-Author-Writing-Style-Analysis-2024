Iran are known to make performance claims way above reality too. They claimed to have built a new fighter jet not that long ago. Was an utter fabrication.
In addition to actually using them for air defense, part of the point of sending Patriots is posturing: if Russia is thinking it can wait until Western countries tire of supporting Ukraine, this signals that the US isn't planning to back down any time soon or we wouldn't be investing in sending such an expensive piece of kit, and it also signals to other European countries to not worry so much about crossing lines and being perceived to be escalatory, since apparently we're not anymore either.
No. It's cheaper and safer for us to give Ukraine the means to keep defending themselves than it is to allow Russia to invade neighbors at will. Keeping Russia broke is a good thing for all of us.
Patriot interceptors intentionally target the cockpit of aircraft they engage. I can assure you with almost complete certainty there is no ejecting after being struck by a Patriot interceptor.
