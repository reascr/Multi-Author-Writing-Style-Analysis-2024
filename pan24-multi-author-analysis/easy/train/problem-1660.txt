While nothing is really funny in war (my correction), it is quite ironic. When I read that the Russian soldiers had fled a battlefield, abandoning a functional tank and the Ukrainians just driving off in that shit, it makes me smile. I understand a lot of the military hardware in their neighbors’ armies was “left” in these countries when the USSR dissolved, but the way they sell arms to pretty much anybody, they were bound to end up in conflict facing their own weaponry. Gotta have some chill when it comes to export controls. I have a gut feeling that the US pretty much only doles out the stuff that they have definitive counter/kill capabilities for (obviously there are exceptions).
Exactly. If the options are for Estonia and the other Baltic countries to fight off a Russian invasion of their own territory, or support Ukraine so it can break the Russian military (what they used to call "defeat in detail"); well, Estonia is MUCH better off letting Ukraine do the fighting.
Within 1 day? I don't know stuff, but my best guess is that planes (and ships) are the bottleneck here figuratively, while the long convoy® through the Suwalski gap would be the bottleneck literally. Easy target for bombing.
