Exactly. The pope can’t do anything about it. The German Catholic Church is not even financially dependent on them or anything. I don’t see why they’d care that much. German society is quite progressive in some aspects and Catholicism in Germany has to adapt to the times and the people if it wants to survive. Homophobia won’t cut it.
>“Real,” meaning that objects have definite properties independent of observation—an apple can be red even when no one is looking; “local” means objects can only be influenced by their surroundings, and that any influence cannot travel faster than light. Investigations at the frontiers of quantum physics have found that these things cannot both be true. Instead, the evidence shows objects are not influenced solely by their surroundings and they may also lack definite properties prior to measurement.
Yep. No pope. What’s preached is down to who runs the church, why you get different leaders in different mega churches. Though they defo seem less strip back gold stuff and more get private jets unless I’m getting different ones mixed up.
