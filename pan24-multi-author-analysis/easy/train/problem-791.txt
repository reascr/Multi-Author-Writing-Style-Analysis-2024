Changing a window out for a vinyl double-paned one isn't actually that hard. First, figure out what kind of walls and siding you have, so you can decide what kind of window flange you need if any. If it's masonry, you generally don't want a window with a nailing flange. Watch some videos about installation for the kinds of walls and siding you have - you need to know if and how to cut back siding, make sure the rough opening is appropriate for the size of window you have, how to shim it, flash it, not damage the vapor barrier/sheathing, fasten the window, seal it with foam, trim it out and do whatever needs to be done with the sill and casing, and caulk it.
Not just Europe. It's human nature to require a personal impact to trigger action. Too many people are still not impacted enough to change, and when they are it will be too late. It's difficult to see us winning the climate change fight.
Another easy, low cost, low technical way to insulate your windows without replacing is by removing the frame around the window (wood detailing that is really just hiding where the drywall ends and your actual window frame begins) exposing the wooden frame everything is mounted on, and spraying (window and door specific!) insulation foam in the gaps to eliminate draft as much as possible.
