- This one is more about the Yugoslav Wars in general: Serbia didn’t randomly decide to just go killing all of their neighbours, it was a long process but in summary: Slovenian nationalism becomes popular due to false rumours about Serbia trying to establish a ‘Greater Serbia’, Yugoslavia says no, Croatian nationalism arises as a result of this, Yugoslavia says no. A bunch of arguments happen, the west responds poorly and Yugoslavia decides to give them free elections. Obviously a slovenian nationalist wins and a croatian nationalist who hated serbs also wins. 10 day war happened until yugoslavia says ‘it’s just slovenia’ and let’s them become independent. Croatia fires serbs from police as president hated serbs and ustasta nostalgia hits so serbs in serbian majority areas put up roadblocks. Tensions increase, yugo fears west will help them (they were secretly helping them already) so they dont invade to show how Slobodan wants peace. War happens, yugo does invade but only for an year, west’s solution: support every other republic becoming independent so NATO can expand, even if they support creating an islamic theocracy in a place where about 50% of people are not muslim. War crimes and yeah, bad explanation but gives you a general idea.
