They are fully unionized. That took 3 weeks in 80s of every single Danish union blacklisting them until they complied. No delivery, no electrician, no carpenters, roofers etc. Tough love, but now they boast of being the best workplace in Denmark, and even though I take that with a truck load of salt, I wouldn't be surprised, if most of the employees are very happy working there. And the union, one of, if not the largest unions in Denmark, has little to complain about (in Denmark unions are based on profession, not company, so the union making agreements with the Danish arm of Mcdonalds is the same union making deals with every other restaurant, hotel caf√© etc in Denmark. On top of that, the union for servers and hospitality has merged with many of the other unions to make a giant union, 3F, who represent something like 5% of the entire population in Denmark. Not just workforce.).
