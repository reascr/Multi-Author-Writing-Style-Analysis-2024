I wouldn't be shocked if MTG becomes the Speaker of the House, and even becomes Trump's VP pick for his running mate... She's everything MAGA wants; full of hate, willing to commit violent acts, homophobic, antisemitic, she fetishizes guns, she cheats on her partners, and she loves changing Trump's dirty diapers... America is caught in the gravitational pull of a Fascism Black Hole - we're going to fall in; it's inevitable. The only question left to be answered is how long will this process take? 10 months? 2 years? A decade? I suspect it'll be here sooner than we think, and it will catch us by surprise as we won't be ready for it... Well, we had a good run of nearly 250 years, so that's something, right?
