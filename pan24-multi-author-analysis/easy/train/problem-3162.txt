Not sure why this is at 0 and is being downvoted. The Democrats were in power for the past two years and didn't pass any legislation that makes this kind of suspicious trade illegal. Why has that not been done? How is this OK with anyone?
Your complaint about "both sides" is remarkably short-sighted and obfuscates the larger issue: that everyone in Congress who has benefitted from information not available to the public is the problem - regardless of the side of the aisle they sit on.
No. It is VITAL to hold the person who held the position of Speaker of the House to the fire. The person who is the leader of the democratic party.
She's the poster child because she represents Democratic leadership. When Democratic leadership engages in what would be illegal behavior for any person who isnt an elected member of Congress, she signals to every other member of Congress this kind of behavior is not only tolerated but encouraged.
The person who signals to every member of congress on both sides of the aisle that engaging in corruption by using your knowledge as a member of congress to play the stock market casino game is 100% A-OK because the leader of the Democratic party is engaging in it also.
