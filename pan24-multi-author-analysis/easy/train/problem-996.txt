"Hey, the happy couple, folks... we should be congratulating them, but really, we should get congratulating me. Tremendous, just the best. Steak, everybody likes steak, right? The best. So I won the election, everybody knows it, but they stole it from me, the lying election workers. Such a happy occasion, these weddings. Like when I ran for president, when I came down that glorious golden escalator, beautiful, those hand rails, that... lobby. But who's the real president? Me, I'm the lawful, rightful president, and believe me, 2020? It's not over. Not by a long shot. I'll win, once these activist judges make the right call, finally make the right call. Believe me. Bigly winning.".
