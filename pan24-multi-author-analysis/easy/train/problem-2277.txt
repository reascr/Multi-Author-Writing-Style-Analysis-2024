Well, what about all the people forced to undergo puberty as the gender they are uncomfortable with? Why are their feelings worth less? Once they undergo puberty, they can never reverse that. They have to live with it for the rest of their lives. A lifetime of ostracization in which they'll hate themselves and society will hate them for being different. They'll never have any normalcy.
Somehow they don't grasp that the fact that their baseless feeling that this one area of medicine is somehow their business at all, that other people should need their permission to access medical care when they have no relevant expertise and it's objectively no more their business than whether Suzi has her rumbling appendix out or Kenny gets chemotherapy treatment for his cancer is discriminatory and is necessarily driven by prejudice.
It's cool. I didn't even know I was intersex until I was in my 20s, although I certainly felt and looked different enough.
