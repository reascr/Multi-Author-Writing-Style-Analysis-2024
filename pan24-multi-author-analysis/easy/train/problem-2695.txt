Actually, no. Trump's DOJ under his AG Bill Barr, and the FBI under his hand-picked director had the laptop in question for over a year before Trump left office.
Congressional investigations into his enemies and trumps enemies. They will go no where and he knows it. He is going to try to influence public opinion about Biden and hunter and any other Democrat he can. Might not be much but we can't underestimate the damage he might do. Don't get me wrong if the people he wants to investigate actually broke any laws I am all about holding them responsible. But he is going to fabricate and speculate. And tbf, he had his hands deep in the insurrection in Jan. 6. I don't think anybody should trust this guy or want him to be the one holding anybody accountable for anything.
