I'm not surprised. You have slime balls like Ted Cruz talking about how "emasculated and WOKE" our military has become. I'd like to see them try to do a day of what you guys do in training.
However however however however! There are approximately 6,200 undervotes in this race. An undervote is a vote where the voter simply left this election blank OR marked in a faint or small way their intention (think putting a single dot with your ballpoint pen in a scantron bubble or maybe underlining a candidateâ€™s name as opposed to filling out the circle by their name). IF there is a mark or indication which election reviewers can reasonably ascertain, that undervote then becomes a real vote which is then counted. It is important to note that the vast majority of these votes will not result in a change to vote totals and that they are likely blank. I simply point out that these votes exist in case we see further changes in the coming weeks and people wonder where these new votes are being tabulated from.
Ex-military. While what you said is somehwat true....keep in mind some of the most dishonest people I ever came across in my life was during my time in the service.
