Wagner has already stated they have "millions" of Americans "volunteering" to fight in Ukraine. Any American in Russia urgently needs to understand the implications of this propaganda.
LOL. No. the embassy does not help you get out unless you have a medical emergency and then you may qualify for a loan. All the info in on the page and the page for the consulate in moscow. Family can't come if they dont already have visas and visas have not been processed in russia since covid closed down those services. all visas for russians are issued to them from us embassies in other countries, but there are no loans to go to a third country for your family members, only for repatriation of the citizen with medical need. So basically families will just need to split up for some indeterminate, but assuredly long period of time until they can secure cash for travel to a 3rd country to get visas for family members. People on here are so naieve. I used to fly the jfk ny-moscow route which flew 2 times per day and every time the overwhelming majority of people on the plane were dual citizens with family in russia. I'm talking like the whole plane unloads in NY and there's like 10 people max going through the immigration control and the rest have us passports. It's not just a handful of people.
Unfortunately, it absolutely still is. The amount of nukes, political influence, the power of their disinformation campaigns, permanent seat on the security council, G20 member, etc. It took a huge economic hit, yes, but it's dangerous to think it's not a superpower.
Whoa, we're definitely seeing history differently. Trump was always an apologist for Russia. Remember when a reporter in 2015 asked him how he felt about Russia killing reporters and Trump said America's no better?
