It’s also interesting seeing that just a week ago Russians were posting about their “big victories” in Pavlivka which is under Vuhledar. They were saying that our first line of defense had “disintegrated” and that they will be in Vuhledar soon. But today Russians suddenly started doomposting, saying that everything is lost in Pavlivka, most people are dead and the assault has completely failed. Always great to see Russian plans crumble before their eyes. And apparently people that were assaulting Pavlivka weren’t new conscripts either, but their regular army plus marines, which means that this loss is even more serious for them.
Totally. Even more, everyone I know from Ukrainian servicemen and women is also anti-war and pro-peace. No one actually dreams to spend their life in trenches, kill strangers and risk being killed.
Seems like it was a peace-negotiation-Putin's-off-ramp-topic-day today. It usual happens when it goes bad for The Russia, Kharkiv counter-offensive, when they left Kyiev/Sumi. And some Le-Penn-Berlosconi-Bolsonaro-Johnson.
