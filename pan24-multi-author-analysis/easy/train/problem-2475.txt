It takes about 2 milligrams of fentanyl to overdose. More people are overdosing in groups because of fentanyl’s potency.
Fentanyl is much more powerful than morphine or heroin. Fentanyl can produce feelings of euphoria similar to heroin. The drug can also cause reduced blood pressure, sedation, dizziness and respiratory depression, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

It’s what works, even though they pose addictive risks and of course, prior to the development of such opioids, doctors were prescribing narcotics such as Valium, Soma, Miltown, etc. My mom was hooked on those in the 70s and 80s, when Quaaludes were the big thing.
The Department of Homeland Security, whose agencies are responsible for detecting illegal drugs at the nation’s borders, failed to ramp up scanning and inspection technology at official crossings, instead channeling $11 billion toward the construction of a border wall that does little to stop fentanyl traffickers.
