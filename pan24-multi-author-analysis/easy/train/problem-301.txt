But Objective-C is like a rottweiler in a junkyard. This is his trash, and fuck all you people who want to come in and buy the trash and mess about in his junkyard. Oh, you want your stuff to continue working and be cross-compatible? Screw you, here's a forced update and now your stuff won't work anymore. Buy new stuff. Oh, you want to know why your code doesn't work? Screw you, there's an error so it won't compile. Why won't it work? What's causing the error? We don't know, figure it out for yourself, dumbass!
mostly - though Rocketdyne initiated a policy called the "knowledge retention programme" around 1971-2, specifically to record much of the institutional knowledge of the engineers and machinists who built the Saturn V's, with extensive records of those techniques and the solutions.
Oh christ. My father bought a lada when I was a kid, for some reason he was convinced that it was a good car. The salesman kept trying to steer him away from it, but he kept going right back. Turns out my dad knew fuck all about cars.
still, would be vastly cheaper to use modern processes than revert to them - while its valuable to have the institutional knowledge of how medieval castles or cathedrals were built, or shipbuilding in the Age of Sail, I think we can fairly safely say no-one with much self-preservation in 2523 is going to decide to recreate the Saturn V as a functional system... But who knows?
