What. He publicly refused to concede a presidential election for the first time in American history? That alone is one of the most treasonous things in American history? He tried to pressure Congress to refuse to certify the election? He riled up a huge mob by telling them the election was rigged that then broke into the capitol and tried to storm the floor of congress? Meanwhile trump is on the phone with besieged lawmakers trying to pressure them to overturn the election and fighting his own security detail in his attempt to get to the capitol and take charge? The Vice President of the country was literally scared to get in a car with his secret service detail because he thought they were going to whisk him away to prevent the election certification. Yes there was a coup attempt led by Trump. He is absolutely the worst traitor in American history, an insult to the constitution and the office of the presidency.
What? Trump was immensely detrimental to Iran. He scrapped the deal Iran needed to quell unrest and be economically viable. Assassinated one of their military leaders and was building up rhetoric to invade them.
