So tomorrow it happens the red and blue states part with a handshake. So first they write up a new constitution do you think they actually outlaw two parties? What amendments do they get rid of? A bunch I bet. Every way I picture it they end up with basically a white Christian one party state. What I also imagine is they will bleed people, as all the groups they say they hate flee or are forced out. I imagine borders will become very important to them to keep people in, can’t have too many women leave and they will need workers for all those farms they are so proud of. I am not trying to say “oh what a shitty country they would have” I am just trying to figure out what it would look like, which seems pretty shitty.
Absolutely. My part of NYS, Western NY, is deeply red with pockets of blue where Buffalo and Rochester are. A more realistic scenario would be rural vs urban rather than blue vs red state. And I'd be stuck in the red part of the state. So you'd probably see cities grow and maybe take over first ring suburbs, pushing red areas further away from urban areas.
