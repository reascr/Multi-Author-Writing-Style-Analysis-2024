They literally just think it's trash talk. They reject the substance of politics outright and turn it into a little pecking order game immediately. And for my part, I actually think that those people are just as pure evil as their puppetmasters. They think that you can practice hateful beliefs without actually being a bad person because it's all just a game to them; to me, that's just about the greatest imaginable moral and personal failing. They're not even brave enough to actually stand up for their cruel beliefs, so they tell themselves that "evil" is just the Republican team in a little game with no real-world consequences, so they can be maximum awful and maximum self-righteous - the society-sized version of "I was only playing around until you took it too far!".
How does that unaffiliated category usually go? I myself am unaffiliated, but vote straight blue. I just don't subscribe to the "team" way of thinking. Theoretically, I would vote for a republican if they aligned with my issues and understanding of economics, basic human ethics, and decorum, but individually and as a party, they are so far beyond the pale that I can't really foresee considering a republican vote basically ever.
