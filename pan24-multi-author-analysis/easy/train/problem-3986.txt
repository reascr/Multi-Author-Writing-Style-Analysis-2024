I genuinely like to understand how anybody can consider the US a "freekin' awesome country". I relation to what? Sure, the US is extremely powerful and influential. But on racial justice, human rights, election rights, justice and criminal system, education, health, quality of life, life expectancy, ... the US scores (often much) worse than virtually all of the Western bloc; even the "American Dream" is easier to realize in most European countries. When it comes to foreign policy, the US has started wars of aggression, torpedoes international organization, has repeatedly been condemned by the UN for "flagrant violations of international law", runs torture camps all across the globe, commits war crimes, pardons the war criminals and/or punishes attempted prosecution, topples government for corporate interests (for bananas even), ... What specifically is so fabulous about the US that it makes up for all this nastiness to be considered awesome?
Also why would you even care about IP theft? You have nothing to gain from Apple enforcing it's patent.
Seriously. I watched a bunch of Interviews with him over the past couple of weeks. He really seems to be a competent guy who actually wants to do the job. I am so glad we are finally rid of Lambrecht. She was the wrong person at the wrong time.
