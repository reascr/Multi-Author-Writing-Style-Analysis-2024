Identity politics refers to a broad range of things, including some far left nonsense like calling work ethic "white culture", some leftist stuff that may sound dumb or be difficult to message well but can have various good points still, and various basic social liberal ideas that are actually pretty popular.
That's not true. White DC at the time of the start of the war on drugs in the 70s was 60/40 in favor of lesser sentences for drug users, more money for addiction treatment centers, and the decriminalization of Marijuana. Black DC, for the reasons listed above, was 60/40 against. The war on drugs was an attempt to reduce crime. It was not the only choice, just the one that won out nationwide, largely as a response to Goldwater and Nixon's presidential campaign focusing on urban crime. It's just that it had consequences that even the harshest critics didn't forsee.
