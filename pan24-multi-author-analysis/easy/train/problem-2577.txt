"In a speech published soon after the aforementioned guidelines, Ye Qing, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce - an organization in charge of linking private businesses and CCP departments - clarified what that entails. According to Ye, firms should strenhen the socialist system with Chinese characteristics by recognizing in their charter the leading role of the party, as well as their support for party work, including through specific funding. While CCP guidelines are not binding on non-party entities, such as private businesses, writing them in corporate charters leads to a legal codification of CCP requirements. The relationship between the party organization and the board of directors should also be clarified. In practice, party secretaries in firms are hence becoming key firm actors. Large firms, in particular, are expected to appoint full-time party secretaries and party workers, as well as to give them "big stage to fully display their talents". These changes to company charters are in line with what the party-state has asked from State-owned enterprises since 2016. Private businesses have expected that the same would be soon asked from them, and some started to amend their own charters as soon as 2017.".
