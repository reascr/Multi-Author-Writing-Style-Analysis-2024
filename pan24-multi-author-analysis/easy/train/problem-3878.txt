Once something makes the front page of Newsweek magazine, it's not a secret any more. I was 15 when I read that article and thought "wow, I hope somebody does something about this." The fact that no one did is not Exxon's fault. Their business was digging the stuff out of the ground so it could be cracked and burnt; no one was paying them to prevent a climate crisis, and no one was regulating them either. Though they could have been regulated, had there been the will to do so.
Honestly? They probably are. They're working out how to transition, and more importantly - how to monopolise and control that industry as well, when they are forced to transition. So that they can do the same thing again.
Governments cannot regulate capitalism because capitalism concentrates power. It does not matter how robust a system you create to control it, given enough time, capitalism will concentrate enough power to capture, dismantle, and rebuild said system into one that reinforces the power of capital holders. It is inevitable for any system that concentrates power.
