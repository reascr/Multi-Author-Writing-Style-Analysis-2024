Stop making and regurgitating half baked virology conjecture. You can wait and isolate as much as you want. The majority of the world clearly don’t share your sentiment. So congratulation. You are special.
Having zero restrictions probably would've worked if 1) their vaccines were better and/or accepted more foreign vaccines, and 2) they were progressively lifted, allowing for an increasingly higher natural immunity, just like most European countries did.
Yeah.. I think this is going to be more consequential than people realise. It might not lead to an immediate revolt against the CPP, but there is going to be a huge crack in its legitimacy across China. This isn’t like human rights abuses against a distant minority group (e.g., uyghurs) which the privileged mainstream can just choose to ignore. Almost every single family is going to lose an old person, there’s going to so much suffering by everyone over the next few months (just wait for the lunar new year when people spread infections to countryside) and if that sadness and frustration gets directed at the CPP, then the CPP has very much fucked up.
true. dynasties fell when lots of shit hits the fan. But the current mess started with some loosening of the restrictions shortly after the October Congress. That led to a rise in cases -.
