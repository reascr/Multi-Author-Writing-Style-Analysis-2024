One difference lies in that Ukraine had a much larger and established opposition which Russia doesn't have at all. There was an alternative for people to fight for, and the very reasonable belief that if they were successful, there was a government ready to step in and take over. In Russia, there is none of that. There are no leaders (they're all dead or in prison), there is no opposition government to support or take over. There is no way to organize action without having FSB bust your door down the same day and take you out of the picture. The whole system has been organized so that unrest disappears before it can gain any momentum at all, and that is very difficult to overcome. It's not certain that the Iranian protests will succeed, and I doubt they have a better police state than Russia. China is a better analogue. Does anyone in the west really think those poor Chinese guys have a chance of overthrowing their dictator?
Honestly? After spending a good amount of time on both of those subs I think you're actually correct.
