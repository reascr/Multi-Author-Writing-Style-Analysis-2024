I'd read "premeditated" to mean the kid planned to intentionally shoot the teacher, not that the kid really fully understood that that kills people and the full implications of that (permanence, etc.).
The current popular rifle platform for the civilian population is the AR-15 which is a civilian platform built off the M16 model originally, the M-4 is a direct descendant of the M16 being a carbine variant. Regardless, the AR-15 which is only available in semi-automatic,for the most part, can be modded to be very similar to the M-4 in weight and performance (with the exception of the burst/automatic functions of the M4A1) and thus is a decent platform to practice shooting fundamentals while in a range environment.
That just breaks my heart. This is why parents not only need to be parenting their kids from a no violence/importance f empathy standpoint, but also why we have to stop pussyfooting around the concept of death with kids. No more lying about the dog going to a farm to live. No more "grandma went to a better place" with no context on the physical "dead" part. Kids can handle learning about death and what it is, and we do them a grave disservice by sheltering them from such an important and unavoidable concept in the world. Every fantasy story and video game shows death as a temporary affliction, and if we let that stand as their only experience of it, why are we so surprised when they act like killing someone is no big deal and they'll just respawn at the hospital and be back next week?
