And for added context: Russia was in process of a missile strike campaign targeting most if not all major Ukrainian cities. So, he probably had good reason to believe so.
It would take a minumum of 5 seasons of an HBO Show to get into the decision to evaluate and announce the Ukranian invasion, the ongoing relationship with NATO and Zelinsky and Putin, while also dealing with Xi's ongoing temper tantrums with Taiwan, to do justice to the last year in international diplomacy.
I am 61, a young Boomer. Dubya definitely paved the way for Trump. And I agree that they are war criminals. They came in to office wanting to rearrange the world. They wanted it so bad they were almost predestined to react to 9/11 in the most violent, least strategic ways and would say anything to achieve their ends. 9/11 was their perfect opportunity to implement their plans. Their dishonesty, idiocy and hubris led to the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, which have to to be the worst modern military disasters since Vietnam, maybe worse. And remember, a lot of the modern Republican party learned the art of propaganda from selling the wars. Tricksters like Roger Stone and Paul Manafort were doing the same stuff back then, lobbying for dictators and stomping on elections worldwide.
