It's not about progressive or moderate. If Fetterman would have been running in Oregon, he would have won handily. He's our kind of people. Tina Kotek and McLeod-Skinner are feckless political losers who are being propped up by the Oregon Democratic party because the DPO hasn't lost in 20 years and they're pushing bad candidates on us. McLeod-Skinner has run half a dozen campaigns for a different high-profile position every time, and it's time for her to settle in a low-level role until she can prove herself. I like her, but she's got the charisma of a wet paper bag sitting on a horse wearing a cowboy hat.
So basically "a pathway to citizenship and make legal immigration a bit easier but also increase border security", sounds pretty moderate compared to the progressive "decriminalize undocumented border crossings" stances we saw in the 2020 primaries.
Oh no! The Republicans are going to have a 3 seat majority. Now we don't have to hear any more about Nancy pelosi and we get to watch McCarthy make a fool of himself for 2 years.
