Clyburn, the Amy/Pete simultaneous drop out and Trump being a clown with his COVID messaging were the trifecta that got Biden elected. Gotta give them all props.
4) Finally, Democratic leadership positions, especially in Congress, are overwhelmingly concentrated in officials from the Northeast and on the west coast so I think it’s fair to balance that out by giving the South, Midwest, and Southwest earlier positions in the primaries especially as more key swing states are located in those regions.
Horrible idea. That just makes ideas meaningless and only candidates with a lot of money favored to win. It's staggered to have candidates pitch ideas and win smaller States where they can touch every part of the State and scale their campaign and build coalitions. Having it on the same day just makes it so the campaign with the most money wins every time. No thanks.
1) South Carolina is a really cheap media market to start with and bucks the trend of starting in states with overwhelmingly white populations, it’s also trending blue in the long run, and even if it’s not super competitive southern black voters are an important constituency in the party, and one that is frequently underrepresented in Congress due to Gerrymandering.
You don’t know what you’re talking about. Black people are the majority of Democrats in SC. Black people are substantial pluralities or majorities of Dems in the South and Mid-Atlantic.
I’d also argue Black voters are more aligned with the average Democratic voter and general electorate than anyone from the Bay Area. You may be able to dismiss Black voters out there but that sort of smug and dismissive tone will not work elsewhere anymore.
