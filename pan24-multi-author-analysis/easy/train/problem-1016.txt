Ok so the article explains, saying how drivers for taxi-vans and busses are getting Karma—bc they apparently suggested? the transition to only-ruble be pushed forward early (was supposed to be next year), and now it was decreed last week that hryvnias are strictly forbidden, but there’s just nearly no small bills in rubles floating around. (Implies that at least some drivers are collaborators.) So the very ones pushing are now forced to break that same law. The grocery stores are also divvied up—and the ones the Russians frequent don’t even have adequate rubles. They posted on door yesterday—it was notable bc said Russians had to see posting that change would be in hryvnias, despite new law being implemented.
Escalating is COMPLETELY irrelevant. They cannot be negotiated with. They will never honor any peace agreement, the same way they did not honor any of the previous ones.
Bruh.Dmitry Medvedev's predictions are bordering on schizophrenic paranoia. In what weird world do they think Germany is going to become a fourth reich and people will go back to the gold standard?
