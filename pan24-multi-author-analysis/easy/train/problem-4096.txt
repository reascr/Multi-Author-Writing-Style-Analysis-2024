I liked when he blamed the west for the rise of the nazis as a military power despite the fact that Nazi Germany and the USSR had a deal to invade and divide Eastern Europe and the USSR hosted 4 secret bases to train the German army and German pilots between 1922 and 1933.
Honestly. I’ve genuinely scoured the internet looking for any credible information that would justify the things Russia claim. Like, am I missing something here? Are we being misled in the West? But its not there, at least beyond Russian government press releases and propaganda, or Alex Jones’ deranged lunacy. Russia’s claims don’t stack up. At all. And they did NONE of the things one would expect a ‘reasonable’ state to do if they were fearful of being attacked or undermined by NATO. It’s all total horseshit.
Now doing it conversationally? I can't explain why it isn't as bad. Maybe it has to do with the importance of what you're trying to do, and focusing on accuracy in both tone and colloquial expression, coupled with sitting in a booth wearing headphones. There's more pressure.
