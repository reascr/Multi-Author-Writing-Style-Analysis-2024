The corporations who steward our national supply chains have proven themselves negligent and unable to self regulate the profit motive against public safety and therefore national defense. I would argue the overladen and under maintained infrastructure corporations like Norfolk Southern have neglected to maintain are now of negative value and therefore should receive no compensation if not be forced to fix the infrastructure scuttled by their failure to regulate. The impact of safer, highly regulated and optimized distribution networks will infinitely outweigh any negative economic ramifications.
I hate to say it but this is going to look like a massive lose for Biden. I’m actually amazed how Republicans haven’t spun this against him yet (Not that they would’ve supported unions, but of course they wouldn’t care, they play dirty). This is literally a perfect case of cause and effect.
