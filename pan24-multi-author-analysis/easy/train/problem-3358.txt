I don't know what the NATO equivalent to maskirovka is, but I think the idea is to publicly reinforce the idea of winter stalling ops for both sides, and then to pretend to be all surprised when the Ukrainians start overrunning Russian positions approaching Melitopol in January or whatever.
A few? Just looked in some documents and the whole shebang was using them. From Kh-55s via Kh-35, Kh-65, Kh-555, first series of Kh-101s and even... Kalibrs. They were making in the record year 1500 of them. When they stopped deliver them to Russia, Russia had to dig out the old tech drawings of it's competitor and had to make no less than 3 variants for Kalibr, Kh-101 and Iskander-M cruise missile. The Kalibr version is pretty simplistic in comparison, so they can pump them out fastest, but then never crossed 250 per year.
Absolutely. The world has forgotten somehow that these atrocities can happen. I get the sense you've also read "Eichmann in Jerusalem" and see clearly the story played out in this war.
