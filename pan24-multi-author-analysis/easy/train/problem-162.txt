From my understanding war is a living, breathing thing. Even if Ukraine was winning Russia would just reassess and redirect their military resources. I personally don’t think the United States has the support of the country to be invested in this war long term because………. We don’t really care about Ukraine if it means Americans are going to have to go through hell for 2-5 years.
And yes dislike my comment Still Americans for the most part DO NOT GIVE A FUCK This is not a war of necessity this a war ukrainian elites are choosing to have for fun. NOT OUT PROBLEM.
Completely factually they have exhausted thousands upon thousands of tanks, aircraft, and other military hardware, tens of thousands of soldiers are dead and casualties in total number in the 6 figures easily including hundreds of officers and leadership members. All without a single American soldier having to die. There has never been a more efficient military operation from the US and completely realistically we kind of have to prevent Russia from getting even closer to European borders.
Nope. I’ve only ever voted democrat. Had high hopes for Biden and Kamala. Against military grade weapons for civis. Pro choice. For legal immigration. Pretty left leaning democrat. Lmao would you believe it?!
