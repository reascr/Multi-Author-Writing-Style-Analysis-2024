So you’re almost entirely correct right for post-consumer plastics (generally, things households recycle). Contaminants make these sorts of streams very difficult to re-process. Some high-value plastics are easier to work with than others, but things like plastic wrap or grocery bags are not worth the effort from a business perspective.
Post industrial plastics (taken from unsold cars, scrapped parts or inventory, etc) is where this assertion breaks down somewhat, and are much easier to re-use / have been being re-used for some time.
For the most part, the reason why plastics weren’t recycled is because there was very little market demand; and often plastics are intended to have a very specific set of properties that can’t be easily achieved with recycled feedstock. Plastics intended to be food safe, medical device compliant, biocompatible, etc. are nearly impossible to recycle because of these standards, and make up a large portion of the plastic people throw away.
