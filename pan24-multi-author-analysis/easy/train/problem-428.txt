Unfortunately, the customer will buy it anyway. The contractor knows that the government has no teeth. That's why they're doing this. They're calling the government's bluff. That this is all talk and no bite. Boeing fucked up at nearly every possible opportunity with Starliner, and NASA cut check after check after check except for the very very last time because SpaceX started flying dragon too routinely and too successfully.
It’s the free market. Contractors are selling their services to the US government. The customer can ask contractors do things a certain way. They can refuse if they don’t want to, but the customer then doesn’t have to continue buying services from them after any preexisting contracts are completed.
Exactly. The federal government has a wide variety of specifications for products and services they buy. It's hard to see how this is different unless you're paid to see otherwise.
