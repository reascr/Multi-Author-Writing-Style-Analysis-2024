Historically, uneducated masses are easier for sly and cunning leaders to manipulate the way they need. See: dictatorships and aristocracies.
Ya think? F-ing men around the world standing by while the rights of women are being stripped away is an issue that is not being brought forward enough. I would like to praise their bravery but frankly it is BS they have stood by so long on so many issues. Hopefully this is a turning point?
Educated masses need democracy and fair and equal representation of internationally-recognised Human Rights.
Not really. They seem pretty easily led to believe X (insert women, LGBT, immigrants, so on and so forth) are the cause of all their problems and must be ostracized, demonized, or oppressed. When you are educated, you learn the real sources of the world's woes and how they pretty much all boil down to a class war.
