Your argument still makes no sense lol. The phones that sell that "cheap" aren't exported because they're made specifically for India. And, not to mention, because of PPP 10,000 is a LOT of money to a lot of people. You can get really good phones for 10,000. I have lived in the UK and in India and a phone which cost me Â£120 in the UK was worse in every way than the phone I just bought in India for Rs. 11,000 (about 100-110 GBP). It's called economics of scale lol.
constitutionally, Minorities have more rights than people of higher caste, he literally mentioned how lower caste people get special seats reserved just for them in medical, engineering colleges and they don't have pay a single rupee for 4/5 years of education plus accommodation.
Oof. I'm trying not to read too much into that. Are you talking about the gross disparity of economics between the various classes, and how that will allow for the exploitation of the underclasses to benefit the upper class? And then, are you indicating that's a good thing?
