I remember being in denial about how bad he was and laughing at the jokes. My buddy and I on the way out had a conversation about how he was just starting out and for his first outing the jokes weren't terrible, but he can grow and become a great comedian some day. Brendan then goes ahead and makes a special ... with all the same jokes I heard live, and seeing it on TV really drove home how unfunny he is.
Fun fact, I used to be a TFAK fan and I saw them live back when Brendan first started out in "comedy.".
Get out there and talk about helping the working people unionize and raise wages, tax these corporations.....I'd love to see a 21st Century WPA style program, start the recruiting in the Rust Belt and Appalachia, help those steel workers and coal miners get retrained to build bridges and rail and tunnels that we need, set them up building solar and wind farms, paving roads and repairing dams and all the other infrastructure shit we desperately need......Direct Action on this shit is far better than all these crazy tax credits and underfunded programs and and complex grants and shit you have to sign up for.
