If the same cartoon had depicted the US team as a bunch of gun-toting terrorists would you feel the same way? In a strange way we own our government's reputation, and by "we" I mean essentially all of humanity. If the World Cup were in Cairo and a cartoon had the English team looting artifacts out of the Pyramids, it's a political commentary rather than a direct accusation that the players (absurdly) are stealing ancient artifacts in between matches.
All true. Moreover, they're not Qatari players. They have the uniform of the PSG, the Parisian football team that Qatar bought. Lots of context missing.
The cartoon is pretty lazy and poorly executed (like most political cartoons) but Qatar has definitely been credibly accused of assisting terrorist groups in the region, mostly in the form of directly providing or facilitating the provision of financial assistance.
Why? Because Paris is sponsorised by Qatar (official sponsor). So while France wants to ban the world Cup, the newspaper wants to say that Paris being sponsorised by Qatar still "support" the Qatar and their laws from the past.
