Iran is not a hive minded monolith. The people are growing sick and tired of their oppressors and are slowly building the courage to overthrow in due time. The West needs to take this moment to remember history and not rush these things, especially by going in with thousands of young men to “bring freedom and democracy” there. We ought to know by now that that doesn’t work. All we can do now is help the Iranians discretely and spread awareness. As for the Iranian government, the only good solution can be achieved through a grassroots movement amongst the Iranian people. Simply put, only Iran can truly help Iran.
Inaction/thoughts/prayers only help the oppressor. Sharing what's going on in Iran, and sharing the social media of protesters, are all good ways to help from overseas.
The best thing we can do is keep protesting globally, sharing social media from Iran of what is happening on the ground there. It doesn't hurt to call on any of your reps to publicly denounce the mass murders of protesters. The best thing to do is anything you can.
