This is jargon, where a word has a very specific meaning in a very specific context, and that meaning may vary from common usage. Most professions don't have a draft, where the government compels membership. In the context of the military, where there may be a draft, we need a way to distinguish between members who joined willingly vs those who were compelled to join. People who discuss militaries refer to militaries where membership is voluntary as "volunteer" militaries.
No. I belive it was another older style cruise missile they have plenty of. However, it has a Circular Error Probability that's something stupidly huge. Like half a Kilometer.
Russia can manufacture missiles, so they will always have some to use in attacks, but they won't have as much as they like, and we are seeing now that Russia are greatly reducing the number of missiles in each mass attack, and increasing the time between attacks, as well as using missiles that are less optimal (some missiles being fired were created to carry ballistic warheads, the Russians are taking the warheads off and sending the missile without a warhead in order to soak up Ukranian anti-missile fire with the actual missiles).
It's a little off tbh. Kh-555 can be build from the Kh-55 kit, however no Kh-555 was observed in some time now. ALCMs that were used in the attacks in the last few weeks are mostly Kh-101s with some old Kh-55s as decoys. AFO Saturn is working 24/7 now trying to meet demands. Optimistic values are up to 50 Kh-101s per month, 30 Kalibrs. So roughly a single barrage per month. However their efficiency is atrocious. Even with the escort of anti-radar planes only 9% (UA sources) to 13% (RU sources) of launched missiles are reaching their targets.
