A lot of ideas promoted by non-conservative parties (not just in the US) are wildly supported by conservative voters. Strict inspection of meat, fines for corporations who cheat on their taxes, prosecution of murder, nutrition assistance for young children. When those ideas are presented in surveys independent of context or who is promoting them, they have gotten 80+% (such as the support in West Virginia for the Build Back Better bill when it was presented as the amount of money their state would be getting for infrastructure updates). However, when the policies of their own politicians are presented attached to photos and names of opposition party politicians, conservative voters often indicate negative support.
I'm not sure. There's been a lot of "nobody wants to work anymore" messaging on mainstream "news" along with tiktok blue collar workers laughing at people who want a decent work-life balance by "flexing" their 80 hour work weeks for the younger generations. People are pretty brainwashed into thinking laboring their life away reaps rewards.
