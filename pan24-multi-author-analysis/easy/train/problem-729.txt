Unlike some peoples fears about vote siphoning, i think gallego has a solid chance. I feel like even independents will be wary of sinema knowing that she already fucked over one group of voters when she didnt get her way. Gallego will be able to say to both dems and independents "im consistent and you know exactly where my values lie". that is definitely a good sell.
All I'm saying is that anyone thinking Democrats "shouldn't put forward a candidate" for this race is suggesting something impossible under Arizona nominating procedures - the state party can't decide to do what the Utah Dems did with McMullin. There will be someone who runs as a Democrat and qualifies for the ballot regardless of if the party wants that to happen or not.
If she runs and makes the ballot - and 45k valid signatures is a pretty tough hurdle - it'll make things worse for Democrats, but definitely not guaranteeing a GOP pickup.
Given that's the case, Democrats are better off fielding the strongest candidate they can for this seat, vs. trying to not have anyone get the required signatures so that the general can be an I vs. R race and running the super-high risk that a random Dem. gets on the ballot and takes 15-20% of the vote anyway.
