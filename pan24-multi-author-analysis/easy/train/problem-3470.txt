Türkiye’s lucky they weren’t invaded by Russia, or else China would have only given them $1 million (and in case you don’t understand, Ukraine only got $1 million in aid from China, and their losses are far, far greater).
What? Because how expensive something is is not the same as its price. The actual expense of an item is how much is on the price tag relative to the amount of money you have/how much you can reasonably predict to be earning. Hypothetically, let's say, in country A, Bob earns 20 shillings a day. In country B, Tim earns 10 shillings a day. They both want a nice cold beer. The price of a pint is 1 shilling in both country A and country B, but yet Tim's beer is actually gonna be 2X as expensive because he earns half what Bob earns. In country A, a beer costs 5% of your income, but in country B, a beer costs 10% of your income, even if beer is the same price in both. The beer would only be equally expensive in both countries if either the daily incomes were the same or, alternatively, if a pint cost 2 shillings in country A, but still just 1 in country B. This way, Bob and Tim would both be paying 10% of their income (it is very good beer).
