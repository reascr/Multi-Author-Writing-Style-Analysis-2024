Not entirely. The president's proposed 2023 budget included nearly a billion dollars in appropriated funding for USCIS to support e-Verify and other areas including moving more of the asylum and refugee directorate to be appropriated rather than fee funded.
For work…. Oh it’s a cluster of abuse. Employers know they can shaft your pay and keep you at the company. They would often keep you at “prevailing wage”. You see colleagues making more than you and doing less than you. You can’t switch jobs. You can’t lose your job or you lose your application. So, what do they do? They end up taking up the harder work. They work over the weekends and holidays. Some immigrants have to do this for 5-10 years because the wait time is so long. What’s worse? When the company fails or it gets acquired, your application is lost and you got to start all over. Companies tend to hire the worst batch of attorneys for handling these cases. They try to save cost. If you want to expedite the processing and pay the fee, the immigrant pays. If you want to file additional things, the immigrant pays. When a request for evidence comes in and gives the company 6 months to reply, they strategically wait till the last day. Why? To keep you at the company longer and at the “prevailing wage”.
