There is no "most qualified" person, there's a large pool of equally skilled and experienced people. Also, life experience and point of view are also qualifications. A non-white person would probably have a different experience and understanding of structural racism and how the law effects non-white people. On top of that gaining the trust of people and making them think government works for them is also a goal of appointments. If people see a government that's just old white men, they might not think that it understands them and is working for them. Having a government and judiciary that looks like the country can help build trust in institutions.
On top of that building trust in government and the law should be a goal for the government. People might not think that the government and law is working for them if it's full of just old white men. If the judicial system and government looks more like the country people would be more likely to trust it.
Absolutely. Look at the self loathing people the republicans court, Kanye, Candace, Ali Alexander etc. They are not looking for increased diversity. Quite the opposite. They are looking for different skin colours representing and reinforcing the white perspective.
