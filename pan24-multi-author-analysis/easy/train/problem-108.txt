they're losing 500-600 soldiers a day in this conquest and they're struggling to take tens of meters a day, and they've barely reached the edge of the city. i don't think ukraine will pull their soldiers there until they're at risk of encirclement. that's when it'll fall, but they've only now started evacuating civilians this week, so i think there's a ways to go. urban combat is hard for the attacker.
Seriously. We were able to give them equipment with a shelf life and then pay the military industrial complex to make replacements for us. It’s a stimulus package for the US that also helps weaken Russia. Probably the biggest win of the Cold War since the 90s.
Ya obviously. That is why is said half sarcasm. Of course it’s great for Americans to be working and this is a valid reason but we as a nation have been complaining about the defense department being a bloated and corrupt wing of the government for half a century and you know that. This just happens to be the first win they’ve had in 80 years.
