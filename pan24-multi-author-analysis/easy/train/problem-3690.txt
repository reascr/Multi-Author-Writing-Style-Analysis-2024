Exactly! This is pissing me off (an early GenX) because I've been a six figure earner now for 20 years and the age raised from 65 to 67 already. And they've borrowed from our supposedly untouchable fund many times and not paid it back properly. And changed what return we are guaranteed many times. To the point that though I'll retire in 8-10 years I still have no faith that I'll get anything out of what I've paid in. The way it's setup if I die early my wife gets little (her situation is unique but still problematic).

Exactly. I've been paying into that fund since 1994. If this happens, I'm going to play by the same rules they do. I'm sure that money will be funnelled into military spending, as all things are. I've got the time and the inclination and a stolen tank probably fetches decent money on the black market.
