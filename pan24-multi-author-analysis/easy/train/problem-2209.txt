Yeah, needless slaughter of innocent people aside, this conflict is a major lesson on international conflict in the 21st century. On paper Russia has every advantage so it’s not surprising people keep expecting Ukraine to fall, but all of those advantages are offset by foreign aid and the morale boost of defending their home. Assuming Ukraine wins, to hell with Putin, Zelenskyy can play himself in the inevitable movie adaptation, can’t say that about many wars can ya?
Yeah, but that also means even if Ukraine beats Russia, he can still push the “game over I win” button. Nukes are stupid, and humans are equally stupid creatures, but our ego won’t let us admit it. Also I like how you praise the US’s invasion of Afghanistan even though it was 20 years of unnecessary conflict followed by the suffering of pulling all the lifelines we made them dependent on because the puppet government we never bothered to flesh out crumbled immediately.
What? They retreated a few hundred metres? Well then, we shall achieve glorious victory when we block their guns with our dead, now charge!
