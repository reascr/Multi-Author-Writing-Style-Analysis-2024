Truly great idea! He’s an old man who still rides a bike, so I think that’s a great example for all of us. Physical fitness is so important since our health is our true wealth. I also admire his stances on mental healthcare. He believes in it, and understands how essential it is to overall good health. I particularly love how supportive he was of his son struggling with addiction. It showed true compassion and understanding. It’s a really touching reminder of a father’s unconditional love and commitment to his son. Don’t you just love how Biden didn’t tear his son down for having an addiction illness, making him feel like a worthless failure, and instead tried to empathize and give his son a “safe harbor” where he could anchor himself in his healing process? Or maybe even the story of Biden’s struggle with overcoming a severe speech impediment to become an extremely skilled orator and masterful statesman. I was totally unaware of this part of his history prior to his presidential campaign. Pretty amazing, don’t you think? I’m sure there’s more but that would be a great start. Any of these things would make a great exposé.
Liberal fear mongering. I’m shocked this isn’t from Salon. The party of crazy was roundly rejected by the country this week. Might a couple have slipped through the cracks? Sure, but this is a bit of an overreaction.
Exactly. It doesn't matter if the impeachments or investigations are completely bogus...Republicans have a huge media empire, and they're not afraid to lie. Like any fascist, they will repeat their lines over and over and over, until it becomes fact in minds of half of Americans.
