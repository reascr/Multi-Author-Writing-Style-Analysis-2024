"largely meaningless social issues" is exactly the kind of bullshit that shows these aren't meaningless. You're not affected by them, so you don't think they're worthwhile. The status quo specifically excludes a lot of people fighting for their "meaningless issues". One party continuously fights against changing any of these "meaningless issues" because even if they never have to engage with it or it changes absolutely nothing about their lives or finances-- they can't fucking help themselves. The republican party and it's voters very specifically want the status quo to never change from WASP above all else, you can't even pretend for a second that both sides are after the same things. There are people on both sides who are wholly interested in filling their coffers and taking a consulting job after their terms, sure. There's also a fuck load more that are determined and driven to make changes some for the better others for the absolute worst. You can look at the policies and reaction to proposed policies and see who's working in favor of who.
