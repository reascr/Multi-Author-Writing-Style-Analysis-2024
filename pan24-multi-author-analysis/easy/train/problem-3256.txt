I highly recommend anyone buying a new appliance invest in insurance coverage for them or a repair contract, because parts are extremely expensive and the complexity and lower part quality of a lot of the new appliances all but guarentee something is going to fail, and if it's a control board or interface panel you're out 400 bucks.
This right here. As someone in the trades for the past 30yrs, I remember replacing water heaters that were installed in the 70's up to about 6yrs ago. Not some much anymore, but I have replaced many that are less than 15yrs old, some no older than 8. Had a fridge when my wife and I got married that was 26 yrs old that someone have us. It gave up the ghost eventually so we replaced it. The new one lasted 15yrs. And now we're on our second new one. Same with washers and dryers been through several over the years since our initial purchases of used older one's that lasted quite a while. They just don't make things the way they used to because it's not profitable enough.
