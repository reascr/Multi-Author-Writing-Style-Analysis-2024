Being low on missiles doesn’t mean zero missiles or that there is some point where Russia cannot fire them.
If Russia was not facing problems in this area, it would not be begging third world countries for missiles and turning their air defence missiles to ground mode.
It is clear that their attrition rate is not sustainable and that Russia either needs to produce more smart weapons than they’ve ever made under sanctioned conditions or need to buy advanced weapons that are simply not on offer from their primitive allies.
Instead of being able to deploy these missiles at will at the outset of the war, Russia is resorting to limited but large waves of bombardment whose quality becomes more and more diffuse as they no longer have the stockpiled capacity they did in the beginning.
Like holy shit. Imagine Winston Churchill going: "Yeah, we're fucked, lol. They have a lot of bombs.".
The capacity to manufacture dumb bombs and the capacity to manufacture smart bombs may seem very similar, but the former has existed since before WWI if we limit ourselves to air-dropped and the latter is still relatively rare.
Right? Their current supply is running low. It would be pretty dumb to infer that that means Russia can't get any more. It means they need to do more agreements and stretch their spending even more, when they're not even giving their soldiers winter coats.
