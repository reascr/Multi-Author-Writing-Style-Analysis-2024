To be fair, Ma Ying-jeou didn't assume office until 5/20/08, so it was still under the DPP president Chen Shui-bien when the earthquake happened.
I really wouldn't say the relationship between Taiwan and China were good between 2000 and 2008, when DPP / Chen Shui-bien held the presidency. Anti-secession law was passed in 2005, and China had been buying off Taiwan's allies on the world stage (i.e. Chad, Senegal, etc). I also remembered Taiwan was invited to become a member of the World Health Assembly by the US, but under China's intense pressure, the topic never came up. When the news media asked Chinese WHO representative if their strong stance against Taiwan's participation in WHO would result in the health needs of the 23 million Taiwanese not being heard, then China to UN diplomat Zukang Sha responded angrily, "who gives a shit about them".
No. Some people actually do like authority over others. They are called authoritarians and political sycophants.
No, you don't. You clearly have no idea of Taiwanese public sentiment on this matter. Your statement flies in the face of multiple surveys of Taiwanese public opinion. Still, Taiwanese are used to being gaslit....
Earthquakes are natural disasters which don't really really show cultural weakness or superiority. No matter how great your technology, nobody currently expects you to be able to avoid the earth trying to shake you off like a dog that just got out of the bath. Disease management on the other hand isn't seen in quite the same way and how countries handle disease is a bit more of a technological, cultural, and political statement.
