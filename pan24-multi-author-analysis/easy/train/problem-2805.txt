I think it becomes even more obvious when you look at right-wing media and hosts like Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity at Fox News or even to Infowars Alex Jones. They formed 'characters' to best appeal and build-up the bases they were making money off of and try to 'maintain' the appearance of really being that even when if you begin to look at their 'real life' you would see just how different they are, see their kids going to elite 'leftist' private schools, etc...
oh no. I swear, EVERY SINGLE person that I get info on has something unsavory about them. That's just fact. He's a great wrestler, but I'm not going to vote for him or any proven fraudster for Congress or President or anything. lol.

Absolutely. Pro wrestling was absolutely massive in the late 90's. WCW and WWF were constantly trying to upstage each other every Monday night, and people wanted to see what they would do next.
