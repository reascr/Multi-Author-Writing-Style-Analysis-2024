After she entered the royal family she got welcomed by the tabloids who snuck in and took pictures of her sunbathing topless (in what should have been a private no access area) and they put pictures of her tits on the frontpage.
Even from the time frame selected the incident with the paparazzi that snuck into their private chateau to sneakily take topless pictures of Kate that they put on the frontpage somehow didn't make the cut for your idea of "kate's reception".
Yes. We also exerted control over the South after the French left. We killed hundreds of thousands, possibly several million Vietnamese people while trying to crush their rebellion. Hence my comparison to the British Raj. Not 1-1 but it’s something a lot of people have heard of, unlike most other colonial wars.
Seriously. We just got through the holidays. Who doesn’t have some kind of disagreement somewhere in their family? The rest of us just get on with it. We don’t sit in our mega mansions forcing the peasants just trying to afford rent, heat, and food to listen to us cry about it all day every day while we suck on our silver spoons. The fact that anyone in the media who calls out this fact gets slammed is absurd. The media really are just useless vultures at this point.
