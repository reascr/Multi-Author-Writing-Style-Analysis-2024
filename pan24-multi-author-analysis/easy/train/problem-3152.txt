Oh don’t misunderstand me, I agree with you, but just as i’m saying, they are following the Putin playbook, but who, as a young man, who may have children, wants to volunteer readily? They don’t. We’ve read and heard their stories on news when captured. That’s what I meant by “poor boys”.. under the circumstances how they are taken any young man in any country that way so cruelly. I feel exactly, how you feel about Russia, Heard enough about it growing up like my mom once said emphatically “don’t call me Russian!🤣.
I agree, my late mom was born in Ukraine, I as 1st gen. American/ Ukrainian, heard about Russian Stalin, cruelty.. lucky they got out, but Ukrainians Will never give up even if they’ve immigrated they still have that connection and it’s passed down.
Hopefully. Unfortunately there are laws that the west actually follows. And from what I’ve heard it’s not clear what portion of the frozen assets can be used as reparations.
Actually no. A Bond villain would plant a nuke right in the middle of Kyiv but on a timer. Then walk away very pleased with themselves that they didn't just kill everyone immediately but they used a timer for dramatic effect. Then Zelensky would defeat the nuke with 1 second to go.
