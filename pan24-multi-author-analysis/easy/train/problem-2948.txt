This will 100% happen with DeSantis. Watch his last debate for governor. When he gets to stay on message and on the attack, he comes across pretty well, but as soon as he gets pushed off message he looks like a 2nd grader who forgot his lines in the school play. This is perfectly encapsulated when his challenger asks him if he will stay for a full 4 years as governor or run for president. My guess is his prep team is phenomenal and he takes the sessions seriously and actually learns and practices, but anything he didn’t prep is a catastrophe for him. Republicans are putting a lot of stock in him because he’s the only “electable” Republican with a national profile who isn’t trump, but they’re gonna realize early in the primary they are hitching their wagon to a horse with no legs.
I agree 100%. I thought Trump was a buffoon in the 1980s. I was surprised he went hard core fascist, but not terribly. But he does have talent, you have to give credit where credit is due.
Every single candidate wanting to win the Republican presidential primary is going to have to confirm they support a national ban on all abortions, no exceptions including punishing doctors and women . . . there's going to be plenty of awful strategy all around.
