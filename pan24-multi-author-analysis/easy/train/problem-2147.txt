I forget what documentary I was watching specifically, but they were interviewing a Bradley commander from the first gulf war. A pair of Bradleys caught a number of entrenched T-72s off-guard and annihilated them with TOWs. The 25mm Cannon is more or less useless against the armor, but it'll still scare the piss out of a tank crew when they're being pounded repeatedly in the turret by it.
Exactly. Most of the missiles we’ve given to Ukraine have an expiration date, because solid rocket fuel and explosives have a shelf life. It’s better we’re giving them away rather than wasting them.
Germany also stated that while everyone is offering Leopards which is nice, pretty much all of them are different models built on different standards and there has to be refurbishment done before they are deployed, not to mention bring them all to the same standard otherwise UA logistics will have to work 40 hrs a day/9 days a week to keep them up and running which is counterproductive for a country that really needs tanks where if you send the wrong ammo to a tank company you potentially risk putting 2 companies out of action as one has the wrong ammo and the other has none as it was sent to the first one.
easy. they did it in Gulf War. and since then Bradleys have been upgraded 2-3 times, while t72 barely.
