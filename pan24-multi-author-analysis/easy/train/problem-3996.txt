This will kill parody. The Onion was right. This illegitimated court is going to make doing anything based on prior art with parody illegal. SNL will be sued for just putting on a skit.
I respectfully disagree. It isn’t a copyright lawsuit, it’s about their trademark. The purpose of a trademark it to protect a brand. (To keep people from selling products they produce under the brand or using the logo of someone else’s product.) Normally to prove trademark infringement you’d need some evidence that consumers could mistake one product for the other. This product is a dog toy. It isn’t being mistaken for a bottle of whiskey. It isn’t calling itself Jack Daniels, nor it is using a facsimile of their logo. (there’s a huge dog’s head on the dog toy label, and it jokes about dog poop.) It’s a pretty clear example of a parody. But the fact that SCOTUS has agreed to hear the case means someone is seriously questioning whether or not to restrict this form of parody…which is absolutely about free speech.
