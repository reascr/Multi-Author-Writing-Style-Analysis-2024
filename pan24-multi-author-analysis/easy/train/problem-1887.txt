There's a famous number called the "crazification factor," which is 27%, which is the percent of Illinois voters who voted for Alan Keyes, who was brought in last-minute to run against Barack Obama for Senate (after Jack Ryan was forced to drop out when his divorce records were released and it came out that he did some pretty rapey stuff to Jeri Ryan aka Seven of Nine). Illinois at the time was quite "purple" and not reliably blue like it is these days. Keyes was a carpetbagger who knew nothing about Illinois and had never lived in Illinois; his sole qualification was that he was a Black male Republican who could run against Obama. A prominent Republican columnist for the Chicago Tribune called the GOP's choice of Keyes to fill Ryan's spot "racist in the nicest possible way." (Which is such hilariously understated Midwestern nastiness that I remember it verbatim 20 years later.) Keyes had also gone absolutely nuts when Hillary Clinton moved to New York to run for Senate, but defended his own parachuting into Illinois. Keyes had no policies, no positions, no opinions; his biggest press coverage was when he announced that Obama was not actually Black, but Keyes was.
Fucking disaster after disaster. And then FIX News has the gall to pretend the shit sandwiches were delicious...
Exactly. He'll immediately stop sending help, threaten NATO and all allies if they don't stop as well, let Ukraine get rolled over and get a few deals to build Penthouses in Kiev with Russian money. And there still will be people to support this as a "smart move" as Russia starts casually invading Poland. This self-centered piece of shit is a danger to humanity.
