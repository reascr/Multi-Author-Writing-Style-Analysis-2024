For instance, I work in urban planning. Most governments and private sector firms are doing hybrid arrangements -- few days in office, few days at home. Personally, I'm a big fan of that. A lot of other people in this field are big fans of it as well. If the federal government wants to hire community planners, it's going to have to compete against those governments and private firms. It can compete on pay, benefits, and workplace culture. Benefits are set government-wide more or less, and the general schedule for pay is as well, but an agency has much more discretion in its culture, including its telecommuting arrangements.

Itâ€™s absolutely meaningless. There was a law signed in 2010 the at directed government agencies to maximize telework opportunities.
