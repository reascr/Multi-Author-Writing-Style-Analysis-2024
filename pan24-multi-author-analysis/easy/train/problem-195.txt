so, by us standards, a normal conservative then. minus trumps tariffs/protectionism shit. "conservatives,‚Äù specifically business owners, like liberal markets. For example specifically the auto industry overlords like liberalized global labor markets. they looooveee that. The owner wants to keep a bigger piece of the pie, so firing Danny and closing the plant here to either buy Japanese made robots or Indonesian hard labor in a cheap industrial zone overseas and a very free do what you want market is their best friend. ironically the people who vote for them, the voting conservatives not the business owners, shouldn't love the part of the liberalized free market sucking away their jobs, but they love jesus/caplitalism too much to care so they vote unfettered capitalism or big business man. Or even they'll vote for the home team if they're robbing them blind because the whole thing to them is supposed to be "simple". policies? fuck that. they just vote for less government, whatever that may entail. and also for whoever left they get in there... that official better love jesus. sad state of affairs for the US. i guess japan has its own weird religion issues right now too though.
It originated in post glorious revolution England (monarchist vs parliamentarian) and no longer accurately reflect modern day politics.
