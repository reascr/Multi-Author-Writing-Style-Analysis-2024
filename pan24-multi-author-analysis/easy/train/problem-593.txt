(They blamed the war in Ukraine for the same in the 2 months before that, but I guess they have realized that the "wartime inflation" phrase has lost its edge.).
\- while the opposition is completely incapable of presenting a combined front or even any kind of platform to run on, acting with such incompetence as to make a lot of people genuinely consider that Fidesz is actively paying them off to squabble ineffectively.
That's a good question. Long story short, our society is divided into two parts, younger generations are like everywhere else in Europe but the 50+ people are horrible, especially the pensioners. They believe everything, the propaganda is absolutely devastating. Furthermore, the election system is not fair, in the last 12 years they have never got more than 50% (or something like that) but they own the 70% of the parliament. The education system is dead, there are protests every week. Many of my friends are already in other countries, as well as some of my family members. And it's a growing tendency here.. That's it.
Hungarian here. See my post above. Hungary has managed to ruin diplomatic ties with nearly everyone else and has spent all of its money on buying a unprofitable telecom company and reelection propaganda.
