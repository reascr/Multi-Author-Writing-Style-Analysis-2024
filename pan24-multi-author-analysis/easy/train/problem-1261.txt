I developed a severe dust mite allergy at 32. It disrupted my sleep to the point I could not hold my arm straight out in front of me for 10 seconds. Thatâ€™s how weak I was. Once I was finally diagnosed, spent close to a $1,000 on dust mite covers, found the right allergy medication, used nasal corticosteroids as needed, dehumidified the bedroom and implemented a strict washing schedule for all dust mite covers the headaches, ear pain and sinus pain all became manageable. BUT I was still waking up constantly throughout the night (like I would wake up dozens of times for just a minute or a few seconds) and still had chronic fatigue and weakness.

Exactamundo. The ACLU is notoriously gun rights phobic, hell, their official stance is that the 2A is a collective right, and not an individual one. So having them come in is a real litmus test for "Some politician realllllly screwed the pooch here".
