No it isn't, it is simple supply and demand. If there is an oversupply of workers, they band together and only offer to provide their labor on specific terms more favorable to them. Constrain supply of a resource to increase its value. Employers are free to reject these terms the same way a worker can reject a job with low wages and poor benefits. If you oppose this, you oppose capitalism. When unemployment is high and there are fewer jobs than workers, employers are free to dictate employment terms more favorable to them. If you object to unions, then you must necessarily oppose the ability of employers to negotiate with workers in their own favor. It's the same thing: leveraging the limited supply of a resource you control to get more in exchange for it. You have to let everyone enter into contracts freely. Right-to-work laws don't do that.
Honestly either are good, I prefer Arcata as it's a single location and Bob (owner and main employee) is one of the nicest people I've ever met, he can recognise names and always has a smile on his face whenever he sees repeat customers, he even recognized me after 2 years. also their shreded peperoni is slightly better than Capri imo.
