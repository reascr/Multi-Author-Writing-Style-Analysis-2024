Europe is an important ally for the USA. USA is investing this money in Ukraine who in turn is demilitarizing Russia, our "Rival" as they have wanted to be classified. USA has no immediate threats, and can send all these arms and money over as the rate of return on these mean a less threatening Russia who wouldn't be able to project it's power in the near future to their other neighbors. A stable world is ideal for trade, a war at the doorstep of Europe signals threat to everyone in that market.
