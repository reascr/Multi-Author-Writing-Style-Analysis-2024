That state of the union was radical and beautiful. It was the educated, Biden obviously, versus the uneducated, and he single-handedly saved the Social Security and Medicare of half of the maga population, and yet they still donâ€™t get it. Smh.
When talking about protectionism there disadvantages for the federal budget and American taxpayers, there are advantages to American workers and American industries, there are disadvantages for international alliances and there are advantages for domestic politics; where you come down on the issue is going to have a lot to do with how you weight those issues.
Yup. There are a lot of times we the people can't buy American for obvious reasons. But the Federal Government, they can spend a little extra money. Via tax payers. You can't get solar panels because the tariffs make it too expensive but the Federal Government can work with people to build factories to supply them for their big projects. They can sign multi year contracts to keep those jobs up and running.
