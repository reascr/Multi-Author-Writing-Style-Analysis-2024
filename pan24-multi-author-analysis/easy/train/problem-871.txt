For many disabled people, Social Security is their only income. It’s already impossible to afford rent, food, and medicine on the below-poverty amounts young disabled people receive. Young disabled people very often have to choose between medicine and food as it already is. Even a modest cut will cause such people to starve or become homeless. Being homeless with a major disability can be a death sentence. I’m talking about people who cannot fill the gaps, cannot work, possibly were never able to have a job because they were born disabled. All they have is Social Security and Medicare.
What I was trying to illustrate was that the fact that even a scaled down austerity attack of this sort is better - both in terms of being more constructive to the discourse, and in practicality as far as solving the underlying problem of "Social Security will inevitably become insolvent unless we choose to prevent that" - than just allowing the underlying problem to fester until the program capsizes under its own weight and suddenly you're not.
No! I don't want lazy people getting money they didn't earn. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to spend a king's ransom on advertising to support candidates who want to keep the minimum wage at $7.25, or even less of the worker is a minor, disabled, or works on tips.
Exactly. And this is also a practical issue around income inequality. The more money that is getting made above 160k and the less money being made below it further drives an SS dilemma. Raising or removing it addresses the issue if not outright solving it. Like you said, I'd imagine a lot of people above 160k wouldn't really care much either.
