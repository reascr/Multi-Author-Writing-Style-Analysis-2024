The article was referencing Wyoming, so the availability of oil pumping equipment in that area is the relevant part. However, pumping out oil isn't the difficult part, it's the original well drilling operation that's expensive and difficult. A simple pump jack can generally handle pumping crude, and a lot of them are now set up to pull natural gas off the well and power themselves with that. As far as refining gasoline, if you're not trying to be efficient and get every last piece of usable hydrocarbon out of crude, it's pretty simply, just a heat and condense operation, and I'm sure you might be able to trade some of that gasoline for other folks' crops. You might even use some of that gas to run an old ford tractor to help with those crops.
Really? Both of our "good" cars are over a decade old, and although we've had problems, computer components going bad all the time (or any time) has not been one. Our other vehicle is older than me, and I spend far more time fucking with the carb and points and plugs and so on, but even I figure a year into a zombie apocalypse, usable gasoline is going to be impossible to find, and distilling alcohol fuel probably assumes an infrastructure base that won't be available. Perhaps likewise for bio-diesel. Not that I spend much time thinking about it, LOL.
