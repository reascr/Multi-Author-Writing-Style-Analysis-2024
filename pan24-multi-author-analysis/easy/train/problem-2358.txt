The police are literally the biggest line item yet all they do is sit in their offices and do fuck all. Someone drove their truck through your yard and you have video? "Not enough evidence to press charges." Literal street races through the arterial stroad? "No cops in your area." Written threats to township officials about slow roadworks? "Threats are too vague, nothing we can do." Guy plows through a guardrail and flees the scene? "We showed up 4 hours late and the guy isn't here, so we can't even investigate the video you captured of the event." Sitting around a fire pit with friends? "We were in the area and noticed that you have a fire for recreational purposes and not cooking, here's a $200 fine.".
