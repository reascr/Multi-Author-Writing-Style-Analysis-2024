I think that these forced birth children will be surrendered to the state, forced into state run facilities. We can look to the Romanian 770 Decree for a really good preview of what to expect regarding how forced birth children/unwanted children will impact American society. Contrary to the forced birth advocates these children will not be adopted by loving families. How do I know this? Forced birthers haven't made a dent in the current population of unwanted children in the foster care system, so what is going to magically change to encourage these forced birthers to adopt now? There are numerous studies done on the impact of the Romain 770 Decree, considering the states that are enacting these draconian anti quality of life laws have GDP's on par with a country like Romania it's a really good apples to apples comparison.
I've said it before here. If the Federal minimum wage (now $7.25/hour) was raised, states couldn't hide behind it. California will have $15.50/hour minimum wage -- considerably above the Federal minimum wage.
