U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown on Thursday asked Gov. Mike DeWine to officially declare a disaster in Ohio’s East Palestine after a train derailment released chemicals into its environment, Sabrina Eaton writes. A spokesman for the Republican governor said he already contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency about a potential disaster declaration and was told the derailment wouldn’t qualify because there’s a lack of unreimbursed property damage of the sort caused by tornados, floods and earthquakes.
That's funny. He could have urged Norfolk Southern to provide a complete picture of the damage and a comprehensive plan to make sure this sort of accident never happens again. Instead, he took the opportunity to punch at Democrats. Weird.
If it is apparent that a Presidential disaster declaration may be necessary to assist in the recovery of the impacted area, the State or Indian tribal government should contact their FEMA Regional Office and request a joint Federal, State/Tribal Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA). Local government representatives should be included, if possible.
