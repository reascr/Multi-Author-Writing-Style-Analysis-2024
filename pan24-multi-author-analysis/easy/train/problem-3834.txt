Thanks for providing a reference. These things are usually missing when having conversations regarding slave wages. The unpaid wages is an outrage though.
That wasn't their point, anyway the reason things cost so little are because hundreds of other retailers knock their prices down repeatedly to compete with each other so they get chosen, it's not like a company went to a retailer and forced them to sell for such small prices, they simply picked from the options that those retailers were offering, because they all want to get picked they're not going to ask for a wage befitting a completely different country, otherwise another retailer will swoop in with a lower price and get the business, as that happens over and over you eventually get to prices relative to the country they're being made in.
I couldn't agree more. It takes me focus not to boil my blood for the money they spent on stadiums for cities without a local soccer club. Most are being used at 5 to 10% capacity. Corruption is arguably one of the deepest and saddest inner flaws of human beings. Im fine with not having enough and the chase of making life better, the issue is making others worse in exchange.
