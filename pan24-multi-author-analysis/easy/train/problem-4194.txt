NATO and EU would oppose the invasion, but the energy dependency of the EU and conciliatory nature would lead to them not wanting to press too hard with sanctions. On top of that, the invasion would be over so fast, that they'd quickly stop cranking up sanctions and would start moving towards removing them almost immediately. NATO would not want to get too involved with the US focusing on China and not wanting to push Russia further towards them, dealing with a lot of economic issues and just getting out of a protracted war that cost a ton. NATO also has moved away from Russia being the focus and has been very lukewarm on the whole eastern sphere for quite a while, and so were unlikely to do more than posturing.
Totally believable. I mean, the CIA killed Seal Team 6 when they shot down that helicopter in Afghanistan. They couldn't let the truth get out that they didn't really kill Bin Laden. I learned this from my Alex Jones fanboy friend. I unfortunately, can't ask him for details because he recently won his very own Herman Cain award.
