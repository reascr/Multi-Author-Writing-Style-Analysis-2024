From everything I’ve read on this sub Reddit site you’re gonna get yourself banned here because pretty much all of these people are fully in favor of all the things you listed that you’re against. I’m a 55yr old lifelong Democrat and my head is spinning every time I read most of these comments. My assumption is that none of these “kids” have owned their own business yet and are still banking on the hopes that their worthless degrees get paid off by their teet aka government leader. I’m fully embarrassed at how my party has spun from a center leaning Democrat working man’s party to a communist/socialist leaning give me everything for free or I’ll need my soy milk and a safe space but don’t forget my trophy handout party. I’m shocked their parents didn’t spank them more and explain to them plainly, “how life is not full of rainbows and unicorns and that not everyone is supposed to get a trophy”.
