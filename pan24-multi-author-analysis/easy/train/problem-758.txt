A real piece of work as he was, Woodrow Wilson was right about one thing: "Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in its committee-rooms is Congress at work.".
Our Tory party is similarly split between Johnson/Brexit loyalists, 'moderates' (not overt fascists) and libertarians (who tend to overlap with Johnson/Brexit loyalists and have been keeping their heads down since the Truss mini arc).
Not full control, no. There's a procedural method that can be used to move a bill out of committee and force a vote. It takes a discharge petition with the majority of the House signing onto it. The problem is that a discharge petition isn't secret. Everyone who signs it is on the public record. And I don't believe that a bill can go through without going through a committee.
/r/conservative is rejoicing. The entire Republican identity at this point are obstructionists. They were proud with the turtle obstructed everything with the filibuster, and now they're happy the entire federal government is being obstructed by these clowns.
