He blamed the initial invasion of Crimea in 2014 on the European Union, not Russia. It suited him to blame the EU then so he did.
Because of his organisational skills, studious attention to detail, subtle diplomatic nuances, commitment to multi-national alliances, deep military background and experience, uncorruptible track record of refusing Russian finance, and his discipline in handling sensitive documentation that he doesn't leave lying around on the sofa of the Downing Street flat.
He just needs to stop now. He left his position in disgrace. He didn't leave because he wanted to. He is a shambles of a man. Fucking his side piece whilst his wife was having cancer treatment sums him up. Ukraine don't need people like him trying to help.
Absolutely. Right now the history books will show him as philandering idiot who presided over the greatest foreign policy blunder - only comparable with Chamberlain, the tens of thousands of COVID dead and the repeated corruption surrounding him and the Tories. He's desperate to rectify his image. Unfortunately for him, the internet exists.
