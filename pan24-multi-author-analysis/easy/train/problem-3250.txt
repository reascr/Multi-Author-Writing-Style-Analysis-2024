You don't really need a VPN to read reliable sources. Like I said, I have opened every link on r/worldnews without VPN as pretty much no website sources are blocked such as BBC, CNN, Reuters and they work perfectly fine (in fact, I don't even have a permanent or paid VPN, only use the free version when I occasionally need one for pirating stuff that is not available in India).
And also to be clear, BBC had already not made the video available in India on their Youtube channel (as in I wasn't able to watch it without my handy VPN and only countries outside India were able to watch it) so all this block includes is blocking posting to the link and the other few youtube channels that had (illegally) uploaded BBC's documentary on their own channel for Indian viewers.
Have you watched the document ? There is plenty of evidence provided in it and various independent sources. The special investigation and its problems are also covered in it. You should be very concerned it being blocked by the government.
Given the it is quite concerning that the government is blocking external reputable sources. India seems to be slowly slipping towards and authoritarian system. Attacking the source does not change the facts. Every human rights organization, even Indian ones, have about the involvement of officials and the handling of the situation.
