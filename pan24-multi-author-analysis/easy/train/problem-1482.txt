The missile that hit the Dnipro residential building is a Kh22 which is something a Patriot can intercept and down but none of the systems Ukraine currently has can. Kh22 have always been successful so far, the UAF has a 0% success rate with them. Arestovych heard from "someone" that there might have been a 2nd explosion that's why he assumed live on air that what fell on the building was the remnants of the intercept and that is not only false but the russian ambassadors used his words like as argument that "it wasn't us". Coincidentally, the same missile type was used in Kremenchuk on the shopping center months ago. Russians claimed that was a UAF missile there too but there was CCTV footage showing the massive 1 ton warhead dropping on the building. Ukraine doesn't have anything like that.
Either way it's so complicated and dumb about him, he is actually just a hired freelance adviser, not a staff member but has a loud position, he didn't have any official information available and just randomly spewed this right after it happened, later saying that "his friend was walking down the street in Dnipro and heard two explosions". That's it, all his argument.
