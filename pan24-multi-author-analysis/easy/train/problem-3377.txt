This is the only bill to get a full House vote recently. So it is relevant. Senate Dems sponsored and backed the mirroring bill in their respective body. But it needs a threshold of Republicans to pass. I said "near unanimous" and only two Dems against it is nearly that. Three Republicans in the House and zero in the Senate support legalization. So almost all the Democrats are for this. Almost all the Republicans are against this. How are you still not understanding this?
The pardon application for federal simple possession cannabis convictions is still “not yet available” on the Department of Justice’s website, more than three months after President Joe Biden announced the pardons as part of one of the most significant shifts in federal cannabis policy in decades.
So. No the DEA and Biden don't get to "just make it legal". BUT they can decided how to enforce and to what extremes.
