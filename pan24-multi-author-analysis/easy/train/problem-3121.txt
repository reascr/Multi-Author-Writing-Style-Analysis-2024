In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I agree. At this point there’s no way to bring the opposing sides together. TFG obviously made it so much worse and if he were to win again we’d definitely have a civil war. The worst part is that the far right is angry whether their party is in control or not. They WANT war. I feel like D leaders are the only thing stopping them from executing their perceived enemies. And sometimes even that doesn’t stop them.

Other commenter is being unnecessarily aggressive/unhelpful. However, in the future, I would suggest making a post with the correct title of the article, and then immediately posting a comment with any of your own commentary.
