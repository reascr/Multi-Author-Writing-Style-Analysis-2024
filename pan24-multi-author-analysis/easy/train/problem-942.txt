So that explains why,as for how, well regardless of their geopolitical situation and ass-backwards government, they are still a large country, with a large and highly educated citizenry to pull from from to develop such capabilities. To put it into perspective, their population is 86 million, more than half of Russia, about twice that of Ukraine, and more than either France or the UK. Combine that with a territory larger than either France or the UK, some of the world's largest petrochemical reserves, plus plenty of available field-testing via the (mis)adventures of its proxies, and you have many of the makings of a military competent regional power with an indigenous defense industry to match.
Legit question, how? I'm all up for it, but their situation is different from Ukraine, they're fighting against their government, how can we help them? Aside from spreading the word.
Hospital, humanitarian aid, defensive equipment, condemning Russia, accepting refugees, offering Intel, bombing an Iranian drone production facility?
P.S. , just to clarify, Iran was one of the worlds original empires, under the Achemenids, Parthians, Sassanids, etc.
