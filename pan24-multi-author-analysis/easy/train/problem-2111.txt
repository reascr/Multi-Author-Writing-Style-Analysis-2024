Can't disappear if you don't participate. Everyone made their own choice here. Or you think it would go over well if, say Britain, Germany and France just didn't go or the players just boycotted the event? There is no danger other than to your wallet in passing this wc. They all got bought, teams and players alike.
Seriously? I understand the statement itself, you lower the tension before the match itself, make them focus on the match.
Exactly. And if you pass the armband to another player after youâ€™re sent off (missing the next match of course) that next player will get a yellow, then a red. And so on.
If that's your source, then clearly what you meant to say wasn't "most of the world is anti-gay", but rather "only 32 countries expressly allow same-sex marriage, though a great many others may recognise civil unions, domestic relationships and similar".
That's marriage equality, not any kind of population breakdown of whether the actual majority of people in specific nations are vocally against anyone being gay.
