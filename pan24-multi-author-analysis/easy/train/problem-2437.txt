But Patrushev (security council) / Bortnikov (FSB) / Zolotov (Rosgvardiya) / Shoigu (army) are probably the only ones with the ability to pull off a coup, and definitely not alone. They would need to get at least one of the others on board, and that means approaching one of Putins closest friends, asking him to support your coup against him, and hope that they don't immediately tell Putin about that and have you disappeared within the hour.
2.) Putin likes saying he will use nukes for any reason, but that is mostly dick waving, this is true. However there is a distinction between occupied new Russian land and Russian land since the fall of the USSR. He can't use nukes now because while he may get fucked over by losing, many Russian oligarchs would be fine and they would fucking pissed if a nuke was used. What happens if their families/friends/their lives end up being in the line of fire? Many would become much more willing to use nukes defensively, and I promise you there will be many actors in the international community that wouldn't fault Russians for using nukes to defend their capital.
