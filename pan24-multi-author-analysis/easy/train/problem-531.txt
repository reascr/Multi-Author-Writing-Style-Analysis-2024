Turkey is arguably the second most important NATO member behind the US. They have the second largest army and are strategically important to containing Russia in the Black Sea.
Finland was always different culturally. Source, I actually live in Finland. Even under Swedish control Finland wasn't Scandinavian and still had it's own culture and language. It never diverged.
Turkey wins because they get crucial humanitarian aid, Erdogan wins because he appears to be helpful to his people (even if it's not because of him), Sweden/Finland win because they gain NATO membership, NATO wins because they gain two geographically critical nations and strenhen what it already the strongest military alliance on the planet, and everyone wins because it weakens Russia even further.
This is a bad correction. All of those countries are in the Nordic Council as well. (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, & Finland) And indeed, Finland is _HISTORICALLY_ Scandinavian, though did diverge culturally from the nations currently considered part of modern Scandinavia.
Honestly I wish the US would just strong arm them into getting this done. Turkey is geographically crucial militarily to the region so I understand why the US has been delicate to maintain their relations but it's time to use our leverage with them in my opinion. Maybe force them to give up their S-400 deal with the Russians and let them back in on the F-35 program (and then maybe provide Patriot missile systems to make up for the lack of the S-400s). Maybe that's a very simplistic view but it can be done and NATO needs Sweden and Finland just as much as they need NATO right now.
