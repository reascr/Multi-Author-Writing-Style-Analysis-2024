They are not wearing pins in the shape of dear hunting rifles either. They are pins in the shape of automatic weapons designed to kill as many human beings as quickly and efficiently as possible which are now easily obtained by the average US citizen in many states. Every few weeks to months one is used in a mass killing spree by deranged men armed with one aiming at generally random innocent people. Tell me why would a sworn-in Representative in the Legislative Branch of the United States wear a pin depicting this weapon in the floor of Congress where bills are debated? Where did the $700K come from Santos?
Because republican politicians celebrate the death of American schoolchildren. They probably get a bonus every time one of their constituents shoots up a school.
Constantly projecting. Every time they project onto us (blueanon for example), it’s an admission of guilt. They’re into q anon so they think everybody else is too, even the libruls.
