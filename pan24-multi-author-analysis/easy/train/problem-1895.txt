its a total sham. as i guess should be expected. but snowden gives his statement/speach, then there is a q&A. my buddy for example only gets to ask one question. the question has to be under a certain realm of allowable topics, which is then reviewed by russian and snowdens pr authorities, then after approval given to snowden prior to the interview. if he attempts to switch his question or make a variation of it, it is likely to be completely ignored. which is a big deal, as its very hard to even be able to ask the guy a single question. if for whatever reason snowden does respond even though its not the original question (highly unlikely), then anything that he says out of the original question can not be used in any form. if he says fuck it and tries to use it (if there even is a response), hes basically blackballed by everyone that is involved in the international journalism process and may be liable to a legal suit.
Exactly. And it's a huge unforced error on the part of the US and its allies. The sticking point on his coming back to the US was whether or not he'd get a fair trial. The US, of course, refused.
Naturalized citizenship. As someone born here I never had to swear an oath but they did make us pledge allegiance a lot of times to the flag for some reason.
