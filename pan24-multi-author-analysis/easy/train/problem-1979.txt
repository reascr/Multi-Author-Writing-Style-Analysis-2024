I am absolutely terrified that this is going to literally be the end of democracy in America. I've been following this case intensely. From everything I've gathered it seems that our democracy is going to come down to how Barrett votes on the issue. So far Roberts has indicated that he will vote with the liberal justices against this so that makes it 4-4. The 4 conservative justices have not held back their support for voting in favor of this theory that will end our democracy. They absolutely support this case and that terrifies me to death. So I have pretty much decided that since our democracy staying in place has come down to trusting Barrett to vote against it that we are screwed. I believe this so much that I'm preparing to move to an EU country. I'm absolutely exhausted by the political climate of this country. Plus my wife is a doctor and the reversal of Roe was too much for her. Especially since we live in TX. We know so many doctors that are also currently in the process of moving out of TX because of the ridiculous laws they've rushed through since Roe was overturned.
