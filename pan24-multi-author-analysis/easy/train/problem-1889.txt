That's his choice entirely. I'm sure he has a good team of people advising him on how to acquire/maintain his fan base. He's making a record amount of money so I think he knows what he's doing and it won't change much if he decides to "politicly define" himself in any way in this situation. So no need to worry about him. Like I said, let him play his tennis and let other athletes play their sports and not involve them into any political debates. Just because an athlete "joins" a political side will not help the people of Ukraine...Maybe if they directly finance something, then yes of course, but their sole opinion, a social media post and "affiliation" will NOT change any outcome. Let politicians handle that. Go heckle them.
Actually, this appears to be a vocal minority within Serbia (I dont live there so I dont know for sure) but it appears that as a whole, Serbia is having enough of Russia and pushing for more European integration over Russian.
It's interesting for sure, but I do think attitudes are starting to shift, the biggest thing that is changing is how Russia did support Serbia with Kosovo, however with their current stance and involvement in Ukraine, this make this not so certain anymore.
