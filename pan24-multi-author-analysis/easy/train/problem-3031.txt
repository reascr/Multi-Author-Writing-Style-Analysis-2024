I really don't know anything, but that's pretty much what I'm guessing too. Seems like the Trump/mob boss strategy of creating lots of layers, intentionally having commands mistranslate through the layers. So in this case. "I hired this company, they couldn't find anything" meanwhile to the company "you now the drill. Look, do your job and look to try to find everything you can. But there isn't anything embarrassing for us. So if you bring back anything embarrassing, then I guess you didn't do your job right.".
He stole classified government documents. Why is he allowed to hire his own team to look for what he stole? Thatâ€™s like the police allowing a thief to look for his loot. The FBI should be raiding every location and getting it back themselves.
Illegal? A judge signed a search warrant. Unwarranted? The DOJ found classified documents, that the FPOTUS should not have in his possession. And this was after Trump had his lawyer tell the DOJ that all the documents were returned.
