I have noticed the rightward shift, but I'm not sure what you mean about being bought by a right winger. CNN is newly owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, which is publicly traded and 63% held by institutions (i.e. retirement accounts). Do you mean that their CEO is a right winger? Just trying to understand.
I remember back in the 80s early 90s my dad and grandpa bitching about the corruption in our government and those same people are still in office today, they all have one goal and that is become millionaires and die in office, for example Nancy Pelosi, Biden, Clinton's, dianne Feinstein, Romney, John Kerry, Mitch McConnell and Trump as well since he's been a corrupt scumbag his entire life, how do these people keep getting re-elected for the past 30+ years.
No. I agree with you. I'm not a fox news or newsmax or oan fan. Trump easily has had more people that should not have been at his residence with unsecured SCI documents compared to Biden. Probably should have ended with /s.
