They've generally grown up in an environment where the emotional consideration of others was not a priority and oftentimes not even a factor. Money and the status markers that it brings are the symbol of achievement for them, not healthy relationships. Relationships, if they are to exist, must fulfill an external image. So naturally when they grow up, that's what they seek. This is the behavior they've learned to accept as a substitute for the love and parental guidance they never received, even if they start to see that this approach has consequences. Note that one doesn't _have_ to be rich to grow up this way, nor does somebody rich _have_ to grow up this way. But there's an argument that an increase in wealth is correlated with this transactional view on inter-personal relationships.
ICU doctor here. I’m sweaty and sore at the end of some days. Definitely feel like a worker. No trust funds or hand me downs. Live well, not wealthy, pay my taxes straight—ain’t nothin like amassed old money with loopholes. But no one plays us their tiny violin. Grateful for my privileges but wish we didn’t get lumped into the ultra wealthy who don’t pay their share of unimaginable wealth while they still use any public services with an air of entitlement. Wait, why can’t the government budget afford to help people with social services for the homeless, poor, young parents barely getting by, senior citizens without enough for retirement?
