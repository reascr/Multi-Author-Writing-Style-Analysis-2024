Zelensky was speaking with Darius Rochebin from news channel La Chaine Info (LCI) in an wide-ranging interview about the war and how Ukrainians were dealing with Russian strikes on energy infrastructure in the middle of winter.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky took a dig at Vladimir Putin during an interview in which he was asked about the prospect of a one-on-one fight with the Russian president.
When asked if there was a "personal hatred" from Putin towards him, Zelensky replied that Putin had an image that was "not very positive of my personality and my role as president of Ukraine.".
Putin’s “expertise” depends largely if not entirely on “knowing a few things and having a whole stable of huge, accomplished opponents who are willing to throw fights to prevent themselves and their families from being imprisoned or murdered.”.
It‘s funny. Having researched so much about Putin in the last year, I think it‘s really comments like this, that drive him furious. He doesnt like to look weak.
