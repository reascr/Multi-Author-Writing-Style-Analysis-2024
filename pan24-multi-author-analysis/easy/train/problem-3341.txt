in all seriousness, as much as i love the prospect of EV's, this is the dirty part of it. the amount of greenhouse gases and environmental destruction caused by current mining practices, is astronomical. what worries me, is that money made from mining will overtake the desire to make the battery industry self-sufficient via recycling. look at our recycling program here in Canada: it started off as "recycle, reuse, reduce", and now it's just "recycle certain things only, as companies don't make enough money off everything else". i think greed will ruin the EV industry, unfortunately...and this is why we can't have anything nice.
Seriously? Goddamn, Canada! You let China plunder your housing market, now you let them plunder your ore. You gotta step up and have some self respect.
Totally onboard for sustainability. Which leads me to the question, what happens when the lithium runs out? Can it be recycled? Are there any efforts at reclaiming used lithium? How is using lithium going to avoid falling into the same trap as oil in that regard?
