Okay, I like Biden and think he’s doing a decent job. But if we’re going to call out trump for all his lies (and we did, as we should have ) it’s only right to call out Biden on his. So, sauce for the goose, as they say. However, whose lies put America directly at risk and whose lies are convoluted stories about family members? Which have the potential to cause direct damage to our country? Which are more serious in the grand scheme of the operational function of our country? Whose “tall tales”’hold (or held) the greatest threat to our nation? It’s not just the lie, it’s the potential impact. Just my two cents.
Fox pulling shit like this is why they need to have a precedential case against then that establishes they’re not a news organization (their defense whenever they get legally pinned down and then say they’re an entertainment company - OK so stop being allowed to use the word “news” as your company name).
