Nixon admin created the Banking Secrecy Act , removed the gold standard, basically sold American jobs out to China to spite Russia and benefit corporate interests. There were so many bad things starting when Nixon admin was around, granted they didn't have the crazy church people start meddling in politics as much as Goldwater warned the GOP then with "Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them". Some of Nixon's cabinet has mentored the Trump admin like Roger Stone and probably Kissinger, both master manipulators of their day. It was worse in the 50s with their anti-communist persecution witch hunts.
