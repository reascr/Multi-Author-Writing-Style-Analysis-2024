Thats a vague comment that waives Palestinians responsibility for their own actions that led them to their situation. Palestinians continued attacks on Israeli civilians and calls to push the Jews to the sea without any real attempt to work for peace absolutely necessitates a firm Israeli response to ensure their own security.
Palestinians targeting and killing innocent women and children in an effort to continue a decades old war they already lost and cannot win is why Israel is forced to be heavy handed. You act like Palestinians have done nothing to cause their situation, but they are the only ones that can free themselves from it. Israel will never allow a hostile population to continue attacks on its civilians if it can stop it (as it should). If Palestinians want peace they can get it right away with accepting their position at the negotiating table and agreeing to realistic terms that ensure Israeli security. Anything less and they will continue to doom their future generations to a bleak future that encourages them to be martyrs in a war theyâ€™ll never win. I wish more people would understand that.
The westbank is internationally recognised as occupied by Israel, so how you view israeli military occupation is really irrelevant in the context of international law.
