I'm with you on the standing up for Ukraine thing: I think this entire year Putin basically laughed his ass off every time a Western ally said they can't send a weapon system to Ukraine because it'd be 'escalatory.' We slow walk shit out of fear of Putin and the bomb, and it plays directly into his hands. Yet probably the most important reason to oppose Putin is because if he gains even an inch of land from this, it just emboldens nuclear powers to leverage their arsenals to expand their territory.
Seriously. These questions just betray a lack of understanding of the depravity of Russian power. It doesn’t matter how illogical it is. That has no meaning.
Nuclear retaliation is the ultimate deterrent. Nobody in the world wants that. That's the power of being a nuclear nation. It doesn't matter of the nation had 1 or 100, nobody is going to fuck with a country that could potentially get a nuke into ones of their cities. That should come as a surprise to no one.
Exactly. Deporting, as far as I’m concerned, has always meant removing someone from your country, not abducting them and bringing them to your country.
