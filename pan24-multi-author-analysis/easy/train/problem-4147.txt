Shooter at Club Q? Well sure, by multiple accounts he was homophobic and had violent tendencies, but the previously-demonstrated violent tendencies didn't involve gay people and heyyyy his lawyers say he's NB, so obviously there's no issue with some of the most prominent right-wing influencers openly claiming the LGBT community is full of pedophiles--especially when they host drag events. I think it was Tim Pool who claimed, days after the shooting, that Club Q hosted "grooming events." And Rufo who warned that the dangerous rhetoric and violence will continue as long as the LGBT community keeps grooming kids. But any link between the rhetoric and the violence, oooohhhh no no no, the rhetoric is not the problem, and besides, leftists said mean things about elected officials and that one guy went to kill Kavanaugh and then didn't (which does imply a link between rhetoric and violence!).
