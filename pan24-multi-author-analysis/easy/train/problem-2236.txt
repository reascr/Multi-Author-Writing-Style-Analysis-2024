It’s important to note (in order to be clear about how hateful they are) that the cancelation/reform plan included no reforms to repayment plans for those with federal graduate student loans- the percentage of income taken on IBR plans is no different and truthfully the people most screwed by this, that are the demographic of people that those against this think of- people who went to art school or w/e for 100k- it’s not like this really released them from any shackles. This was literally a tiny bone that essentially canceled the most unprofitable paperwork (small loans that would be 0 to 200 a month on IBR plans, and the person would just be insolvent w/the tax at the end) for the department of education and loan servicers. The loan cancelation barely represented any change or reform in education and they couldn’t even let that slide. It’s so stupid and sad and cruel.

Hopefully. It's unfortunate Trump was able to exploit a technicality to avoid oversight of the program and now it's up to Biden's admin years later to try and figure it out.
