was probably always that state, only now do we see it tested and for what it really is and has always been.
Nuclear war is surprisingly complicated. There's a whole calculus of what targets you initially attack, with what weapons, what weapons you keep in reserve, what you expect to survive a country attack and have available for another wave etc.
A critical part of that calculus is how many weapons you task to a target, knowing that it may take multiple warheads to ensure a kill because some may not work, miss or be intercepted. If you attack with false assumptions about your weapons reliability there's a very real chance your initial attack won't really degrade the other sides own weapons, leaving you vulnerable, and you won't know it till it's too late for take-backsies.
Sorry. You have no idea what you're talking about. Before they swapped them to MIRV warheads, the silo launched Russian ICBM's could carry a warhead with a yield of up to 20 megatons. That's a larger yield than any ever tested by the US. Now they carry MIRV payloads they are more destructive.
The main difference is that before outside Russia we mainly believed what they told us from there and that it was a fairly complete image of what was going on, something that has completelly changed in the meanwhile: it didn't took that long from the start of the war to spot the complete total disconnect between what the Russian Government said and what Russia actually did, starting at the very first day of this invadion after weeks of saying they wouldn't invade and with examples of that disconnect pilling on, faster and faster, as they turned ever more nazi-like in both their propaganda and what they actually did on the field.
The fuck are you on about? The static bomb installations are, mostly, the same type bombs that sit on top of ICBM's. That was rather the point of testing. There are megaton scale bombs easily liftable by ICBM's. Most these days carry a bunch of few hundred kiloton bombs.
