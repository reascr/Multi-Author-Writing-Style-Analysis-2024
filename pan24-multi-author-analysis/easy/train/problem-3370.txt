So I'm gonna need the difference between UDSSR and the Soviet Union explained. When I Google it I'm told UDSSR is the abbreviation for the Soviet Union. Turkmenistan, Armenia, Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus. Russia wants them all back. Ya don't just give up that kind of power and not want it back. I completely agree those are all independent countries. Russia has to learn to live with what they got. Something they haven't been able to do since their imperial days. So much has changed yet stayed the same. Russia is still the backwaters bastard step child of Europe. Has been for centuries.
Putin is arming Europe and adding new NATO members as well as getting independent of russian energy and loosing Crimea, which he actually could have kept without the invasion exposing his shocking weak army in a newly UN named terrorist state that will last decates into the future - wow I didn't see that coming.
Depends on the business. War absolutely devastates other industries. Gas prices kind of suck as well obviously, and that effects more than just people heating their homes or driving. It hurts industry as well.
