If you expect Russians to experience a collective epiphany, realize that the current government is not working in their best interests and then install righteous and ethical leadership then you're going to be in for a long wait. Russia's history of despotism is as old as the country itself. Russians have never known freedom and are largely resigned and mostly apolitical. When political vacuums do on occasion appear in Russia, the most probable outcome is that they will be filled with figures that are at least as authoritarian and hardline as those they're replacing. TLDR; Those hoping for Putin's downfall should be careful what they wish for.
I found that law in a separate article: “A motor vehicle operator who unintentionally causes injury or death to an individual shall not be criminally or civilly liable for the injury or death, if […] the injury or death of the individual occurred while the motor vehicle operator was fleeing from a riot […] under a reasonable belief that fleeing was necessary to protect the motor vehicle operator from serious injury or death.”.
