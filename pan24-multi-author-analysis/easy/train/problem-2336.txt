With the citizen laws as well they appear to be trying to make Muslims second class citizens and we all know what happens when we go down that path. Perhaps the next step will be Muslims have to wear a crescent badge on their clothes to help easily identify them?
Silver is naturally antibacterial/anti microbial. Itâ€™s not like you can just chuck a hunk of silver in a cup and come back to purified water but a theoretical silver deposit in the banks of a river would tend to make it safer than without. The scale of that impact would be questionable though.
Another suppressive law is to make individuals classed as terrorists, not just organisations, so thousands of mostly Muslim people are forever either detained indefinitely or on bail indefinitely. Critics say Hindus have been caught out under these laws as well, however, the numbers do not reflect an even hand considering there are Proud Boy esq groups on the Hindu side. So there's a lot of people that could be caught under that law but, strangely, the numbers are mostly Muslim.
