Saudi society can’t support a tech hub. They don’t have top universities or the work ethic to be a tech hub. Their economy is pure oil and they rely on migrants workers for everything. Even if they tried to be another Dubai they’d fail as their society is decades behind.
That was before climate change, consumer interest, and geopolitical motivators expedited sustainable energy tech. Oil will always have some use/value but probably never more than it has today. The US will probably be the first superpower to have a completely electric fleet of military/civilian vehicles but I don't think that is possible for a few hundred years at least. Having the ability to spin up production of oil on a dime without having to import it means the US can operate its military equiptment unimpinged indefinately (from an energy resources standpoint).
Fair point. I’m touching on my experience of living / visiting that region of the world. The only country with good universities and smart people is iran but they’re all leaving the country due to the horrific regime there. Middle East will take decades if not a century to properly catch up to the world.
