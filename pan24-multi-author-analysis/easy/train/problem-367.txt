Dude is a Russian asset no one should take seriously, especially without specifics, because "cut military spending" sounds fine and gets you an article in The Nation apparently, but the specifics would almost certainly be "cut military spending by dropping US support for NATO entirely" which is not a serious or productive or laudable position.
Here is a fun one. The caption is "GOVERNMENT SPENDS OVER $3 MILLION WATCHING HAMSTERS ON STEROIDS FIGHT." Interestingly, the citation that Paul gives for this has nothing to do with a study on hamsters and steroids. The study was used to understand the effects of steroid use on adolescents and whether that use made them more violent. The study is certainly controversial given the animal abuse aspect. However, the study also stopped receiving federal funding in 2017, 6 years prior to this report. Also, to note, this report has just 31 instances of government waste. So, even on a list as short as 31 items Paul has to reach pretty far into the past to fill out his list.
