The main reason that the Palestinians and most of the Arab states refused to acknowledge Israel, was for three main reasons. First, not a single Arab state, or Palestinian representative was invited, consulted or involved in UN Resolution 181. Second, there was no Palestinian state created alongside an Israeli state. And third, a LOT of Arabs would have to be forced from their homes and relocated, where as very few Jews would've been required to do the same.
No, actually. As recently as 2008 under then PM Olmert the Palestinians were offered a state of their own in 97% of the West Bank, with the other 3% covered under land swaps with Israel, full control of the Jordan Valley after 10 years and a capitol in East Jerusalem...virtually everything they say they want. It was still rejected.
And an important note, in two meetings during the Annapolis peace talks, then Prime Minister Olmert promised that after a prisoner exchange with Hamas for Gilad Shalit was finished, the Israeli government would release Fatah prisoners to the Palestinians. Exchange didn't happen until 2011 and his successor, Netanyahu, refused to uphold his predecessors promise.
