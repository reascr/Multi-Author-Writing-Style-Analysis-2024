Russia has cooled down a bit with the nuclear threats since the US gave them a talking to some months ago. They still make them but not as frequently.
Attacking UA, raping, pillaging & destroying all within is acceptable, but retaliatory attacks are not permissible? The mindset!
While generally you're right, Russian government uselessly threatened a lot, there was a shift recently, it's no longer a colonial war done with expedition force of regular military, there's more and more push in the media that it's a serious all out war, including Putin's . Putin would have preferred not to do anything, there were indications that he might try another big push, which is why Ukraine asked for heavy weaponry quicker, etc.
Putin's desire to do another big offensive is due to the fact that western countries are relatively slow to give new types of weapons to Ukraine (like current conversations about Leopard tanks), so the faster he attacks, less time Ukraine and its allies have to arm the military.
8. Russia says that the weapons are useless and that Russian weapons are so much better that can easily defeat whatever was provided by the West.
