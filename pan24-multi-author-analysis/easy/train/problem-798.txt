Republicans bleat continuously they despise affirmative action because nothing should matter but merit. But here is Walker, whose only use to the GOP is that he is black, and who is otherwise unfit for anything more demanding than chasing a ball around, and they think that absolves them of racism??

Walker’s ongoing battle with the English language, plainly diminished reasoning skills and alleged status of being ‘observably stupid’ aside, Graham’s invented false choice: either the GOP sends Walker to a senate seat or no one will ever want to be a black conservative shows Walker is not alone in his low cognitive ability - though one suspects Graham’s brand of obtuseness is somewhat willful - only trotted out as a fig leaf to avoid talking about the candidate’s many many flaws.
