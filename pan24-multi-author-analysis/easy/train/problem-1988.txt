We can take it a step further and, even though we’re talking about the ramifications of the UK buying grey market oil because they’re screwing up royally and don’t want to sully their sterling image, talking about EVs vs CVs, which is an oversimplification of the overall initiative. The goal is more than just replacing CVs with EVs, it’s making cities and towns walkable again, having better public transit so fewer personal vehicles are necessary. And hey here’s a funny idea, what if people could bike to work? But that would take planning and cooperation, instead of a bunch of selfish crybabies demanding everything be done the way they’re used to because feelings and instant gratification are more important than the state we leave the world in for future generations.
I’m glad you brought up cycling though. We could go that way. But do you think someone is going to deliver the tons upon tons of materials required to sustain human life on a bicycle? Again, I’ll ask you to draw the line where you deem it acceptable even when a net gain is gleaned.
I welcome you to draw the line in that comparison. Does 50,000 internal combustion engines off the road gives the miners a pass for X amount of tons of pollutants emitted and energy expended? You tell me.
Europeans should start becoming more self reliant, especially since American politics are becoming increasingly unstable.
