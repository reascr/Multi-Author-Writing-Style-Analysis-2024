Granted, the article ignores the fact that the sub-$1 per hour pay is only part of what a prisoner gets from the state. There is also food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. You're saying that the sum of these parts equals acceptable compensation for holding a prison job, even one that could prove fatal as in the case of fighting wildfires. However, to pay anyone other than a prisoner to do these jobs, the government would have to spend a minimum of three times what they currently spend merely keeping each prisoner alive. The fact is, food, clothes, shelter, and medical care are part of the minimum quality of care the government is required to provide prisoners. So the pay prisoners receive for working - which is a small fraction of minimum wage - is given for doing jobs that the government couldn't get any free citizen to do even for minimum wage. Which is, in fact, a form of slavery.
