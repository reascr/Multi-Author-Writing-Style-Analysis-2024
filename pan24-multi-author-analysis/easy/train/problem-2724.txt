It is kind of a form of (low-level, barely violent) terrorism. Terrorism has historically been a relatively effective way to get one‚Äôs political goals realized. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
I feel the need to point out we are on track to ALL DIE and that the protests will get more extreme and eventually you will be on the same side as them, begging for water or shelter in the face of an alien climate, doing anything you can to wake the remaining people up from their sleep walk off the cliff of existence.
Yeah for sure. Deflate the tires for working class people and not the companies who are responsible for majority of the pollution. These activists continue to be more stupid with every ‚Äúaction‚Äù they take. Just increasing aggravation until some folks will actually go around looking to aggravate them by intentionally wasting resources or even harassing them. This seems like the most useless self-congratulatory ‚Äúclimate action‚Äù they could have done. What a joke.
This statement would carry more weight if these people were actually taking action against people who make meaningful decisions about the environment (corporate executives, politicans etc.). The fact that these people aren't doing anything more than just annoying randos really makes it seem like they're just doing the easiest virtue signaling they can think of to impress people who already agree with them.
