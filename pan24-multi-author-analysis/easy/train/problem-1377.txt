Well that's the thing, the US would likely only commit air units and a limited expeditionary force that's already inside Poland right now. But to counter China you'd need the navy, the navy that's already In the pacific and can't do much to help the Russian war besides take Vladivostok, which coincidentally Is on the border with China already making a nice port for supporting land invasions into China. But China would probably take the bet that the west and its Asian allies wouldn't want to take on the two wannabe world superpowers at once nuking their economies in the process. Democracies can't swing that kind of domestic mobilization and support on a whim especially when their internal stability is already not the best. They know they'd have the support for defending a NATO ally, but we don't have a formal treaty with Taiwan. So I'd honestly doubt that we'd get involved there if we're invading Russia.
Underwear. If you look at mens underwear of the 1980s they were not as tight. I suspect manufactures simply wanted more profitability so they started using less fabric over decades and people just grew up with that new normal, thinking it was always that way. Nope.
The involuntary diminishment of people's ability to self-determine their own reproduction should probably be framed less flippantly.
