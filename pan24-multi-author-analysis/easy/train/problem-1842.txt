As in, are there any moderate republicans left in the House. That would vote against McCarthy and join the Dems in voting for Cheney? Do you know?
I think they mean minority Speaker as in a member of the minority party in the House as Speaker ... which technically could happen if a couple of moderate Republicans were fed up or they did the political calculations and decided a Democratic Speaker who can't control a House (as would be the case for a minority Speaker in general) would be better than a Speaker of their own party failing to handle the GOP House civil war.
I live in Oregon. McLeod-Skinner is a wet paper bag pushed on us by the Oregon Dem Party. MS has the charisma and organizing skills of a comfortable incumbent, without all the experience of actually being one. She's lost every election she's tried to run in, for half a dozen different high profile positions throughout Oregon. Her "progressive ideas" are also boring and generic.
