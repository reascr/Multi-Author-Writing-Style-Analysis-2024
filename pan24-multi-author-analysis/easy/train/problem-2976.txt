Off top of my head, the $1 billion package included 10 120 mm, 82mm, and 60mm mortar systems plus ammo, the patriot battery, more Excalibur 155mm howitzer rounds and HIMAR rockets, more MRAPs (mine resistant trucks) and HMMWVs, more HARM anti radar missiles, and JDAM guided missiles. Then the $800 million that's actually part of the US military budget is to purchase Soviet caliber artillery munitions (122mm artillery/rocket, 152mm artillery, and 125mm tank rounds). Then there is a whole assortment of small arms and munitions.
Uneducated opinion. Takes around 1-2years to train a pilot from scratch. Couple months to retrain an existing pilot onto a whole new hardware system, which would be a poor idea anyway since Ukraine doesn’t really have the pilots to spare while they’re country is being bombed and jets are needed for air defense and infantry support.
Thank the lord. I pay a lot of taxes and definitely approve of how we're supporting the Ukraine. Finally our war machine is doing something righteous.
Two entirely different scenarios. Putin isn't trying to eradicate ethnic minorities or conquer Europe.
