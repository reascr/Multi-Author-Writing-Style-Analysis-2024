Delta? American? Southwest? None of them were fined at all last year. Did we give them a bajillion dollars in pandemic aid? Did airline cancellations increase by literally 59x over the pandemic? FUCK. YES.
It's real hard to move to the left when every Republican policy from the Iraq War to Reagan/Trump trickle down to repealing necessary banking regulations to making medical debt harder to discharge in bankruptcy is all "moderate" according to every corporate media outlet in the country.
What has happened? The Southwest issue was a few days ago and we don’t know yet, whether they need to be fined for not honoring their obligations to refund. What is wring with you?
I mean as opposed to most of corporate media that calls Manchin a "moderate centrist" for raising taxes on 100 million working American families this year while keeping tax cuts for global corporations that benefit folks like the Saudi Royal family more than any actual Americans.
Buttigieg didn’t do nothing. He forced the airlines to come up with which are biting Southwest big time. They now have to reimburse hotel, alternative tickets, etc. because that was their commitment. Pretty impressive given that Bernie and Ro did nothing in congress except for being loud mouths.
you have not stated any action your hero Ro has taken in Congress. where is the legislation? And how would the fines they suggested would have prevented this disaster?
