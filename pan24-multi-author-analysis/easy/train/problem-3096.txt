Russia is such a joke. The orthodox church is completely controlled by the FSB and the Russian government as a means of thought control and turning the population bloodthirsty and fascist. And in case there was any confusion as to their true intentions, Russian state media is calling Zelensky the antichrist, yet Russia has literally outlawed talking about Jesus Christ. Yes, really.
It's really obvious that almost all major religious organizations are political organizations first and religious organizations second it definitely fits with a lot of Muslim faiths American evangelicals and even the zionists.
...Fucking wot? Its a "cultural genocide" to say "I don't want to have the religion branch of the country, that is trying to exterminate us, doing fucked up shit in my country?" There is barely any difference between Moscow patriarchat and Kiev patriarchat, its just that Moscow patriarchat is basically FSB. I sure don't see Russia being accepting of Kiev patriarchat, so why the fuck Ukraine should host Moscow patriarchat? Their leader wants all of us dead.
