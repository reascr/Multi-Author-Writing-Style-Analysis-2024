In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
We don't. We just point out the hypocrisy of Republicans, who claim anything LGBTQIA+ people do as wicked and evil, yet won't say anything about actual abuse. The Qanon bullshit actually hurt victims of sex abuse and sex trafficking, and despite being shown the evidence of it, they refuse to stop with their bigoted hate. It's ridiculous.

Democratic donor, activist, and Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is being criminally prosecuted and civilly sued for years of sexual abuse (that was well known “secret” in Hollywood) including underage sexual activities with aspiring female actresses.
Yup. There is a huge hypocrisy standard all around. I recall when the Debra Lafave case happened way back along with the Mary Kay Letourneau case, and all I remember hearing from people like Bill Maher and so many others (mostly men) was that it what they did wasn't rape because the victims in the case must have obviously wanted it, due to them being pretty, I guess.
