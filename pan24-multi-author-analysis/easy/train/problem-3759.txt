Normal checks and balances were not adequate; they are not formal, they are not funded, nor are they mandatory. Media and opposition research failed to catch Santos before the election and even then, nothing would stop his candidacy save media coverage to inform voters. Formal means need not be expansive but could be a simple as running background checks for classified materials others must pass for access. Considering congress uses and has access to confidential, secret material without background checks, it wouldnâ€™t be difficult to include background checks before a candidate can run for office or at least before they are installed. It would be nice to know for example, if a candidate including presidential had close relations with foreign powers, including and especially financial interests.
I disagree. Donald Trump. Roy Moore who almost won - eventually Republicans regained the seat with a football coach. Matt Gaetz. Ted Cruz. Lauren Boebert. Greg Abbott. Hershel Walker came pretty close.

Modern republicans play identity politics. You can see that when John McCain conceded in his presidential election to Obama and a lady was afraid a "Muslim" was going to ruin the country.
