Maybe someone should tell the government Egyptian tourism isn’t suffering because of lack of interesting antiquities…it’s suffering because every article on the subject lists Egypt as one of the worst travel destinations in the world due to its culture of rampant fraud, scams, filthy cities, and aggressive sexual harassment of female tourists (and tourists in general for that matter).
I was there in December. But it was also the first time I bought a tour instead of planning it out myself. It was on tour radar site. Starting in Cairo with pyramids, then a cruise on Nile with a stop at Luxor and ending at a luxury resort at some city which name I never managed to remember. Was wonderful and I always felt safe. Don’t know how it would be without it.
The official reason is because of security concerns since the country has been fighting terrorists since 2013 which targeted areas like police headquarters in several provinces not to mention the checkpoints although the situation is mostly under control now.
I believe one of the most . Whoever finds that, especially if it is intact, would go down in Egyptian archaeological history with great fame. In fact, to some archaeologists it would be the tomb to find.
While on the subject of tombs, some tombs were looted using inside knowledge. Such knowledge points the finger at some of the priests either knowing or being participants in the looting. They showed one tomb in a documentary which was looted before the very hard and very heavy block was placed over it. It had not been removed since it was first put in place, which again points to an inside job.
