They weren't quite as primitive as the stupid meme photoshop, but who knows what silly looking tools they cobbled together that are actually useful or maybe Zelenskyy would do something like this to setup some kind of joke of his own. He is a comedian after all.
On paper Russia has touted the same ability in SEAD and EW to dismantle Ukraine's theater air defenses, that they won't, or more likely can't is evident that they're largely relegated to flying low level missions (hence the high number of losses to manpads), or using standoff weapons to reduce the threat to their aircraft.
True. I think everyone expected them to completely overwhelm Ukraine in the air and have control of the skies similar to what we saw with US-Iraq 2003.
Seemed like they took more casualties during the initial invasion from Ukrainian anti air systems and decided to not try any major air campaigns again.
Dude... Obviously. It may be inefficient, but it's certainly useful. These "scrap planes" were originally constructed for recon work, but recently they've been producing them at a steady pace in order for them to work in tandem with drones (air-dropping grenades, supplies, etc).
