Exactly. Trump literally spent multiple hours a day - at least 3, probably closer to 5 - watching TV and tweeting about everything he saw that hurt his feelings. We know this not only because the people who worked with him told reporters about it, but also because we could all see his twitter account. He would tweet immediate responses to segments on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, or whatever other channel he watched. I remember a bunch of people would use the time stamps on his tweets to show what was playing on TV at those exact times. He would also record a ton of cable news shows to watch later on, and we always knew when he did, because he couldn't stop himself from tweeting about it. It's just so wild to me that Trump literally didn't do any actual work while he was president, he barely even bothered to hide that fact, and Republicans were just cool with it.
