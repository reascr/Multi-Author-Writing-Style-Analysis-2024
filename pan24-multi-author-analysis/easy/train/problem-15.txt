Trump would’ve been a disaster. He was siding with Putin from way back, was anti NATO and had every appearance of literally being Putin’s stooge. He defended and praised him a year ago and again just recently stating he trusts Russian president Vladimir Putin more than the "lowlifes" who work in U.S. intelligence. He was a sellout to the USA and to Democracy itself.
yeah Trump totally knew absolutely nothing about all those times that all his inner circle was meeting with Russians repeatedly and often including Mike Flynn dining with Putin and Jill Stein, Manafort literally working for Russians by installing ANOTHER Putin puppet in Ukraine before running Trump's campaign "for free" or all the endless Rudy Guiliani Russian ties just to name the first of probably hundreds that come to mind, shit he had Russians meeting with his fucking family in Trump Tower pre-presidency around the time Trump suddenly FORCED the GOP/RNC to drop all explicit support from Ukraine from its literal party platform, in 2016.
