We also have 3 states with less than that much in population skewing the average downwards slightly. Even just changing to having 1 rep per, let's say, 250k people in each state set every 10 years based on census data would be way better. There is question if the numbers should be a round up or down, I say round based on if the excess population exceeds 125k. That would give us 1355 reps (assuming the 5 not from states stay the same, really D.C. should have like 3 in this scenario) and would much more closely match representation in the house to the population. It also more than triples the total number of reps making gerrymandering much harder. I for one would love to see them attempt to gerrymander 43 reps in NC when 6.9 million of our 10.7 million residents live in the 3 blue metro regions. We actually have a house makeup that matches our voting percentage in 2022...because we had fair court-drawn maps for this election.
