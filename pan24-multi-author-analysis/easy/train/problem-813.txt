Right? Why are we pretending like anyone is doing anything TO Russia? Everything that has transpired and will transpire in the future, Russia did to itself.
There've been nonheriditary monarchies historically. When the king dies, the bigwigs in the tribe elect a new king to lead them. Prominent examples include many of the migration-era Germanic tribes, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Ah, no? Russia chose to invade. They are committing war crimes. Theyâ€™ve taken kids as hostages. They torture captives. They target civilians on purpose. Crush them straight to hell and make sure they can never do this again.
Macron doesn't believe that this war can realistically be ended militarily: Russia is very unlikely to make a push back and take over (and virtually every European nation seems intent on preventing that from happening), but Ukraine also isn't particularly interested in taking the fight to Russia (casualties, complexity, optics of going from defender to invader, etc.). As such, he doesn't think that going so far as to "crush" Russia militarily and economically would do much good, and it'd be extremely costly to do so. Rather, they need to be present at the negotiation table.
