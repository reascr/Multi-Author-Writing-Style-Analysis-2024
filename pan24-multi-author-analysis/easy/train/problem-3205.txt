Tec is no where as easy as you think. Fundemental R&D is crazy hard and even more crazy expensive. For example computer chips. CPUs are not classified. You can go out and buy some from Amazon if you want. China has put something like 2 trillion USD into its domestic CPU development and as a result they can now make chips that are on par with the ones in the play station 2. Ie chips from 2001. This is because modern computer chips are crazy star trek level tec. They involve shooting lasers a balls of liquid tin 50 atoms in diameter as they fall through a vacuum chamber and hitting dead on ... 100,000 times a second. Bouncing the light from that off a half dozen mirrors that are perfect to within one or two atoms thick. The light then hits mask which can be positioned with nanometer accuracy. This directs the light to a silicone wafer that was cleaned with ultra pure water. (Water that has less than 1 part per trillion that is not water, and a max particle size of about 10 nanometers) all this to produce a chip with over 10 billion individual features. Which all need to be designed and planned so that the crazy laser light can draw them all.
China was literally invaded by India recently. There was a conflict with the Indians along the Chinese Indian border. The PM of India declared the Chinese did not cross into India. Pretty sure that means India crossed over into China, otherwise known as an invasion.
