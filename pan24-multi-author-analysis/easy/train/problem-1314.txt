I know an elderly woman that had to have roommates and It was scary to listen to the stories of verbal abuse. She was finally able to move and share a small house with her elderly single sister. They lucked out that the home owner was their brother and sister in law. Not everyone is lucky like she was. At 61 I barely make enough $ it’s scary to think letting someone you don’t know move in so you can pay the bills. Where I live, rent and buying a house is high considering wages aren’t that great. You can spend 400k on a house here and it’s a piece of crap. Condo 2/1 aren’t bad until you get saddled with high monthly HOA’s.
Exactly. Addressing this alone would give so much relief to SO many people. The cost of living is astronomical and damn near impossible for so many. It’s insane to me that so many 30 somethings I know can’t even afford to live alone. At least half of them college grads.
