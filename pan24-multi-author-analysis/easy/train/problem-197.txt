They already have paid sick leave, the problem (and the issue during the contract negotiations between some of the unions and the rail execs) is that the current sick leave pay requires the person to apply for retroactive pay after they get sick, rather than receive it automatically as many other companies do. The argument has never been over receiving or not receiving pay for sick leave, they already receive pay, it's that it's not automatic and some of the unions that were holding out didn't want to do the application paperwork (and I don't blame them, it should be automatic).
This is what gets me. If sick leave was such a big deal why did they turn it down in favor of more money for so long? Now they want to keep the extra money and get sick leave on top of that.
Absolutely! California teachers union sucks ass. If the whole nation had a solid teachers union, we wouldn’t be here. In California, I am pushing that teachers in the Bay Area and other expensive cities get paid 100k starting. For those of you who say this is tooooo much, I recommend everyone get their sub degree and sub around. See how hard it is when 20 students challenge you. Teaching isn’t for everyone, respect those who do the hard work.
