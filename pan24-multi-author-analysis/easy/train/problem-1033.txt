For instance Gay marriage was a big divide in the friend group at one time. My religious buddy felt it was not up to the state to permit marriage (he is Catholic) that his faith does not permit (at least that is his reading of his faith I am not educated enough in catholic religion to know). My other buddy said that the law should allow civil marriage to any couple over 18 - that lawful marriage is a right separate from the sacrament of marriage as Catholics see it. That settled the issue for them - religious folks can ‘keep’ their marriage based upon their faith, and limit it to those who practice the faith. But for civil marriage, the law must (and should ) treat all adults equally, so gay civil marriage should be allowed an celebrated. It is a fundamental right the state should recognize. And sure each faith can limit marriage to the couples their faith allows (or some religious allow multiple spouses - which the law does not allow) as that is a religious thing between the members of the faith and their god(s). And thus educated men and women - dear friends - talked through an issue at the time was very controversial and ended up agreeing and being civil/loving. I leaned so much from these discussions. I think all Americans can do so, too. No?
Conservative principles are fundamentally asymmetric. The law is supposed to bind the "outside" groups and protect the "inside" group. Resources are allocated to those that "deserve" it.
