A single MRAP style vehicle (armored jeep) has been spotted. It seems to have found its way over from South African, probably sometime after 2014, before feb 2022. Purchased privately.
No. I don't get the idea. Israel has contributed more than most yet got more shit than literally everyone but Russia themselves (Well, maybe China too, but the fact that it is even comparable just proves my point).

It's just about blind hate towards Israel and grasping at any possible excuse to shit on our country. Woke internet is weird.
Israel is the size of New Jersey with a GDP ranked 28th in the world surrounded by enemies sworn to Israel's destruction and DESPITE THAT Israel has taken in more Ukrainian refugees than most western European countries combined, provided humanitarian and intelligence support, and backs Ukraine politically.
