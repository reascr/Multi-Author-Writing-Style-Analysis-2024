Debatable. Go back and read the start of the war. The Germans were wiping out whole army groups to start but there was just too many Russians and too much ground for them to be able to fully capitalize. I forget which of their generals it was but there was a quote about how they would destroy a division only to have 5 more spring up in its place. The Red Army wasn’t particularly well run at any point in that war - Zhukov was only good because he eventually grasped that they had a sufficient numerical advantage to just sort of overwhelm the Germans and keep going. Basically, he figured out they could brute force their way over what was left of the German Army at that point.
Exactly. It was a war to create another Korea. Protect the 17th parallel and provide enough support to eventually force the North into accepting that boundary and split the country in two. The US then realized that it was a far different scenario compared to Korea. The North was not going to stop, and they sent hundreds of thousand into the meat grinder. And the US found themselves stuck for a decade because they knew leaving would mean capitulation to communism and the immediate collapse of the South.
