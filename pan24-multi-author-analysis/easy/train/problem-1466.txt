Methinks sparse details about the inquiry were given because there was entirely baseless. While they're criticizing AOC for wanting to tax the rich, are they also going to investigate MTG for tax fraud or Boebert for encouraging her followers to "exercise their second amendment rights"? If not, I can hardly think this is anything other than a political farce. Stop wasting taxpayer dollars, Republicans. That's the nicest thing I can say about this.
