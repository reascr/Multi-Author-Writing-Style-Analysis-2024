By god I would buy an American flag and wave it everyday they bomb some fucking cartel hideout , deploy full force, please I'm begging you americans who cares what other dumb narco culture Mexicans think, what they gonna do? Bitch about it and that's it.
It also probably wouldn't be good for business or their collective life expectancy if they managed to goad the US into an active military response against the cartels, which I'm pretty sure is exactly what would happen if they committed an overt assault on a federal facility on US soil.
No. We (as a country) don’t want to legalise drugs. Why should we do something we don’t want to do just because a separate country can’t get its shit together? We don’t have drug cartels here, how come they do?
Unironically though. It would be politically unpopular so they know they can get away with some shit but every cartel boss also knows that if they piss the US off enough to make it politically feasible they will be killed and there is 0 they could do to stop it.
