You can network almost any old piece of hardware with some small computer upgrades, I don't think this is where the F35 really shines. Where it really shines is the ability of the United States to sell the F35 to any country it likes. The F22 was so highly classified, that it couldn't be sold to any country. It also had limited upgrade capabilites and so not as many units were made, this meant fewer spare parts available to service a fleet. With the F35, the profits made from the sale of the planes can finance the creation of new planes and the research and development costs of 6th generation fighters, whiles being able to keep a steady supply of serviceable parts to repair planes when needed.
Indeed. Winning wars is about making smart use of limited resources. The F22 is hideously expensive and already it vastly outnumbers the tiny number of competitors that theoretically could rival it. Spending more money on them is simply not a good move under the current state of things.
- probably also more people in command/coordination positions due to the F35's specific capabilities.
