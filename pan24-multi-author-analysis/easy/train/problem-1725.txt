"The Royal Netherlands Army operated 445 Leopard 2s. 330 of these were updated to 2A5 standard in 1993, and later, 188 of these were converted to 2A6 standard. Many Leopard 2s were sold after the end of the Cold War. In April 2011, the Dutch Ministry of Defence announced that the last remaining tank division would be disbanded and the remaining Leopard tanks sold due to large budget cuts.[235] In May 2011, the last tank fired the final shot at the Bergen-Hohne Training Area. They were due to be delivered to the Indonesian Army, which planned to purchase the entire Dutch stock of Leopard 2A6s.[236] The deal was scrapped after opposition from the Dutch Parliament.[237] The Dutch Army offered its formerly operated Leopard 2A6s for comparative tests to be conducted by the Peruvian Army for possible acquisition.[238] By September 2013, the Leopard 2A6 had been disqualified by Peru due to logistical complexities.[239] The Leopard 2s were eventually sold to Finland in a deal signed in January 2014 for â‚¬200 million with deliveries to start from 2015 to 2019.[240] In September 2015, the Dutch government published that the army would have 16 tanks put out of storage and 18 were to be leased from Germany for a new tank squadron by 2016 as part of a German armoured battalion. One Leopard 2 tank is exhibited at the military museum.".
Tanks are good for mechanized assaults where you use them in combination with IFVs (edit: infantry fighting vehicles, things that are armed and armoured enough to support infantry directly) to rapidly break through defensive lines, drop off troops, and then hold positions. Using them unsupported like the Russians did in their assault on Kyiv would be foolish, but I don't think Ukraine is going for that approach.
