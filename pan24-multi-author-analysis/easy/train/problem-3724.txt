This is absolutely insane, I'm glad it's not happening in the US or it would kill the fast food industry. Imagine only being able to eat at McDonald's if you dine in, it would be pretty infuriating. It's all Bs anyway, the way to save the Earth ecologically has to do with stopping big companies from doing the big stuff, making it harder for people to eat fast food isn't going to do very much on the grand scale of things except piss people off and make them less supportive of the big measures.
I'm all for stopping the big stuff and backing down on corporations that are actually polluting the world directly, but micro scale junk like this can get way too intrusive for what in effect won't even be that big a deal, while harassing people just trying to live their lives without unnecessary hassle.
Food? Vegetarian diets are time and time again proven to be cheaper and healthier. Problem is you dont think that cause youll buy the shitty five pound tube of beef at walmart, but when you think vegetarian, suddenly you shop at whole foods.
Exactly. I worked in a McDonalds. A favoured motto among the late shift staff was “minimum wage; minimum effort”.
