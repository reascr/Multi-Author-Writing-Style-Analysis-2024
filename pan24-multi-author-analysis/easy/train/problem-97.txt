Well Steve Bannon did go on his show and advise Bolsonaro to not concede and contest the validity of the votes. When he did not on Election Day I thought he would ignore that advice, I guess he had not watched his TiVo yet.
The party he is in contested it officially, bolsonaro has been completely silent since the elections,its good to note bolsonaro does not have a established party,he got elected with the social-liberal party in 2018 but ran the country as independant and joining the liberal party this year, the liberal party had less than 10 elected politicians but after bolsonaro they were able to elect 56 politicians so its easy to see why they want to keep him,the liberal party isnt much liberal altough it does push to a more liberal economy but the real liberal party would be NOVO with 3 elected politicians and one governor,the reason for being so silent we dont know but i believe its to make things related to lula to pop more on the news and i think its working considering how widely spread things like lula going with a CEO charged with fraud+other things to the climate reunion in egypt,the market crashing after lula speech about public spending with meirelles saying he "dilmou" and his transition team having a lot of people charged with corruption being widely reported.
Yeah, he talks a lot of shit. Good thing there was a decrease in homicides of LGBT people during his rule. I for one prefer that over nice words.
