Essentially, no one is denying the fact that the west is arming Ukraine. It's literally public information. The minister in question was denying the Chinese claim that the west was making the situation worse by arming Ukraine; anyone with two brain cells to rub together knows that the alternative is far worse.
Me too. But that’s probably where it’s heading. It’s not a no contest per se, but the US has the advantage in nearly every sphere. I don’t think pooh understands that when he directs diplomats to say wildly antagonistic things. I also don’t think he realizes it makes people in Western countries care way less about Chinese diasporas. You can make the argument that they don’t care, or that people know they aren’t responsible. But a lot regurgitate CCP rhetoric and it generally doesn’t inspire much trust. Antagonizing the values of a country that welcomed you is never a good idea. Australia has already pretty much rejected the Chinese community and Canada isn’t far behind. I can’t imagine most of Europe offering many warm tidings either.
