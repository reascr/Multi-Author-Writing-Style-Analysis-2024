This has always been the case with Tesla, it's been a ponzi scheme cloaked in a legitimate buisness for years. Elon and Tesla have been lying about FSD for years, claiming it's 'safe now' and will be 'fully ready' next year, claiming that if you buy a car now it will drive itself around and you'll make your money back, pretending they've reinvented the trucking buisness and making it cheaper than rail. They call it Full Self Driving, even though it can't drive itself in many situations, and even when it can, you need to be behind the wheel because it's fucking dangerous. They've been getting people on this for years, because people buy the car because Elon keeps promising the software will be upgradeable to FSD 'within a year' for the past what, 7 years?
Exactly. I've worked on projects for marketing where everyone is nervous until the CEO sees it because it can change drastically or even be cancelled after the top dog sees it. Showing a demo for autodriving did not get past Elmo without his final approval. He might have even overturned legal department's recommendations on what they can and can't claim.
