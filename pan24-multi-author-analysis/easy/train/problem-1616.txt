It’s not some conscious design, it’s a dysfunctional bureaucracy that presents its superiors with a far more rosy image of the country’s mobilizational capabilities (to justify the budget it receives, that gets stolen along every step of the governance ladder all the way to the bottom), and then, when it receives quotas during unexpected mobilization with no real resources to back them up, it just dumps people there hoping to pass the bucket to other bureaucrats along the line.
