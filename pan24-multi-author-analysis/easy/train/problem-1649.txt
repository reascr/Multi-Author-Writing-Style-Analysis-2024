“Faced with these facts, it’s quite easy to see how a casual observer might conclude that the only obstacle to paid sick time for more than one hundred thousand railworkers is the obstinacy of congressional Republicans.
“Even with the genuine threat of a nationwide rail strike, Republicans and (very likely) many Democrats as well could well have refused to give any ground — thus compelling workers to go on strike. This underscores another important truth in all of this, which is that Biden and the Democrats could simply have refrained from doing anything at all and instead hammered away at the message that the railway companies’ refusal to grant basic dignity to workers was risking a disruptive shutdown only weeks before Christmas.”.
Yup. It's obvious and incontrovertible. I still say it's a mistake to strictly let Republicans off the hook though, as they're in virtual lockstep against everything good and decent in the world, but it must be acknowledged that Democrats as a party were 100% on the side of corporations in this fight.
