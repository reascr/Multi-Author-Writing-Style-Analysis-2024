This has absolutely nothing to do with customs and culture. If it did, I could easily argue in favor of FIFA culture, which consists of getting to have a few drinks while watching your favorite football team with your best mates as it has been done for so many years. Again, there is a huge difference between knowing those rules/customs prior to paying to attend. While on the subject of culture, most westerners have a hard time with anything that impedes on basic human rights and equality. Itâ€™s a pretty simple concept.
If Qatar didn't want any of that to happen inside its borders it shouldn't have bribed a corrupt body to give them the tournament that the festival comes with and with alcohol in particular it shouldn't have signed a massive contract over it, or allowed the construction of beer facilities, or releases plans for alcohol plans with the release of tickets and accomodation, or canceled sales literally the day before the arrival of fans.
oh! and quick edit to add. not related to the event but related to alcohol bans in general. Is that making alcohol is actually pretty easy.
Exactly. Obviously the fans will survive, but it's the principal of it. Qatar lied, that's what pisses fans off. Especially since they're now there hearing this news.
