You are talking on two separate planes. As far as participating in office, impeachment is an indictment of conduct and the holder of that office—with respect to having the capacity to continue to hold either that role or public office in general. Congress does not have the capability to criminally indict, that is for the DOJ, which is why Congress is making referrals I.e. the strongest condemnation they can give. There are laws relevant to criminal indictment that may also prevent someone from regaining that role or holding public office, but those are still handled separately from Congress. Congress can, however, make amendments or pass legislation that can prevent future cases like this, which we are also seeing, but they cannot target a specific person or private citizen with this so it’s not an indictment, at least not formally.
No. A referral would be the House committee doing their duty. If others later don't do their own, that's entirely on them.
