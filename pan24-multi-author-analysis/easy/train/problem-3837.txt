Great, he can start with all the people he exploited in his hell-hole warehouses and give them what they deserved in the first place. Then he can move on to all the family business he obliterated in the process of creating his monopoly. Fuck Jeff Bezos and his false charity. That money he's "giving away" already belongs to us, he and every other billionaire on earth got what they have through theft, period. You cannot amass that kind of wealth with fucking over thousand, millions of people it simply can't be done. If you didn't make your money through your own labor or the product of your own time and energy you stole it from someone who did. It's not complicated. Landlords, CEO'S, venture capitalists etc are the actual parasites of society. They contribute NOTHING to progress or culture they exist simply to take and hoard wealth they don't deserve, and as such should be eliminated from society. They have no place in a truly equitable world.
Exactly. I want to hear that they already gave their money away and are now living on a paltry 1m a year. Which is still rich as fuck but at least a sincere attempt.
