Belarus has an army that hasn't fought anyone or really upgraded anything since the cold war, if even then. They have like 50k troops who've never seen a day in combat and a bunch of old Soviet shit that probably barely works because they've given all the good stuff to Russia.
Situation escalates. Russian advance would still have stalled (they ran out of supplies in their dumb tank convoy, more tanks would have made it worse). If Russia is allowed a 2nd, Poland decides to join too as soon as the moment swings back to ukraine. Net benefit for ukraine.
They put him in a cell, hold him there for a night with all the eventual beating, then shot him (they wanted to be sure that this time no german commando could save him), then hung his body upside down with his cronies (some of them seem that were still alive) in Piazzale Loreto where people gathered around to spit on his corpse, then he was tied to a car and his body was dragged for all Milan "Until his blood cleaned all the street of Milan" all the while people still spit on him.
It won’t be. There is a small area of Northern Ukraine that isn’t soupy muck and marshes. The areas free of this muck has been entrenched and fortified by Ukraine. It would not go well for the Russian assault from Belarus. These troops in Belarus are merely tying down Ukrainian troops that could be used elsewhere in Ukraine.
