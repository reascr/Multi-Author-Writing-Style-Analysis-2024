The Czechs, Poles, and Lithuanians (not to mention a few others) know what it is like to be under Russia's oppression. They don't want to ever be back there again.
I can’t count the number of nuking threats by all my fingers and even if I borrow 40 more, and the imaginary red line as well, first it was javelin then it went to small arms then drones then artillery then HIMARS then HAARM then tanks then patriot and counteroffensive and etc etc etc etc, it seems like the line infinitely stretches, now US has pledged longer range bombs and even those haven’t been threatened or the new tanks or they say they will destroy, this fear mongering has been going on since 2014 and it hasn’t led anywhere but death and destruction on Ukraine because of how we reacted to it, it’s time for a change and a little bravery.
that is still movies mate. I wont argument this because its based on nothing but made up scenarios. sorry.
Ukraine is literally buying lots of those equipments, continuously making ammo and weapons they can, continuously rebuilding infrastructures, civilian homes, hospitals, vehicles, training, rescue and building shelters, how on earth did you think Ukraine is spending 0 dollars on their defense?
