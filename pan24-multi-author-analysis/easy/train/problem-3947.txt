Oh really? And how are the homeless supposed to afford those apartments and houses? Where do they have hundreds of thousands saved in cash to buy brand new units? Which banks are giving them mortgages and loans? How are you going to convince the investors spending millions to sell those properties at a loss? Where are the New Deal-esque policies for mass home affordability?
Sorry, but that's really not how the housing market works. It's under a capitalist model with absolutely zero incentive or effective regulation to make housing affordable rather than profitable. More houses just means more speculation, and the price of housing stock is tightly controlled by the people financing the system, because they want to maximise profits. They're not going to keep mindlessly building houses until they start losing money, they'll swap to luxury units or just stop altogether to protect their profit margins. There's literally an endless amount of case studies all over the world showing this. Furthermore, you're completely ignoring the fact that even for the upper middle class, houses are too expensive to buy in cash and require life-long mortgages. There's no fucking bank in the world that would lend half a million to a homeless person. 'Irresponsible' lending like that is actually illegal because the subprime mortgage bubble caused the 2008 credit crisis.
