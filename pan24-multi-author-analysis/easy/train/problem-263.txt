“Drawing on centuries of philosophy and scientific advancements, Mokyr argues that there's a reason the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not, for example, in China, which had in previous centuries shown signs of more scientific advancement: Europe developed a unique culture of competitive scientific and intellectual advancement that was unprecedented and not at all predestined.”.
That was a big mistake. However, USA trying to throw down with China because of this previous mistake, I think, is the bigger mistake. We don't have the time.
Running headlines claiming the Biden is some kind of renewable energy superhero while the administration is effectively encouraging gun imports from China while squashing solar is simply propaganda. This madness has to end. Biden is proving to be a kind of Manchurian candidate doing the dirty work for the Republicans while smiling at the camera and insisting he's some kind of progressive superhero. The facts don't match the rhetoric.
