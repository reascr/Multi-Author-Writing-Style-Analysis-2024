Traditional Medicare is much easier to get on initially without having to get examined and under written than if you leave it for Advantage Scams, then try to come back to traditional Medicare when you have to be examined and under written. I got some pretty good discounts and minimal deductibles, lowest premiums, lowest copays and highest possible maximums of coverage per year by choosing to join AARP for $60 for 5 years and have great discounts on everything.
Yes. The Federal government should stop shoveling public funds into the feed troughs of private, for-profit, NYSE-listed trading symbols. There is no crack, corner, or crevice within American health care financing, provisioning, or delivery in which NYSE-listed trading symbols have not intrenched themselves. The parasite has become the host.
I will probably have to choose Physicians mutual for dental insurance but I'm waiting to see what actually makes it through the already running legislation where those "extras" gimmicks of Advantage Plans will actually be countered by Traditional Medicare adding Dental and Optical currently being legislated.
