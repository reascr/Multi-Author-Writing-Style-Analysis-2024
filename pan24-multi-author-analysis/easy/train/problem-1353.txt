It is all our governor's solution to getting more people into the low paying jobs. We are short of low-quality workers here. Due to lower childcare standards (the ratio of workers to child has also been relaxed) the cost goes down “allowing” more mothers to work. The approval of “charter” schools has been taken away from the local level and is now under state authority. She wants to use tax dollars to fund Christian schools. This has not passed into law yet but may this year. The cities are liberal, but the state is controlled by the poor uneducated rural religious right. AND this year (2023) I begin living state tax free in Iowa. As a millionaire living off my retirement funds, I pay no state taxes. Imagine that! My Governor is letting me go tax-free while finding ways to improve my ability to go to restaurants (many fast-food places only offer drive through service and restaurants often close off sections due to staff shortages) and to find people to help with my lawn work.
No, it’s not. IF someone has a land slide lead it can seem that way, but any close race is decided by all delegates. You could fall asleep for a few weeks, wake up to the total, and not know the difference.
