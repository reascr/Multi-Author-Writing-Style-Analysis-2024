But Rubio did introduce a bill to ban TikTok in the US. Hasn’t been voted on, and I don’t imagine it will be. But I’ve been wrong before.
However, what I’m mentioning here in relationship to this topic (being shut down for US gov employees) is that they can geolocate soldiers and other gov employees, potentially discovering military targets, etc. These are common occurrences with social media, but having the platform under direct control of an enemy state makes it exponentially easier, as they have internal access to location data etc rather than having to design tools or AI to compile external data.
What has happened? Camebridge Analytics was dismantled and Facebook kept on with their sheneganians.. all over the World. YouTube? Is funneling the Echo Chamber aswell.
A lot of the hatred towards people that use Tiktok here is because redditors think that everybody else should be just as bitter and angry about everything as reddit and so tiktok, by allowing people to actually have fun, is "distracting" them from whatever redditors think should be the most important.
Like Huawei is spying on me via the Hardware. Is a US "agency" concerned to be caught by a chinese agency?
