They're not using those post partum centers because there's no parental leave (which by the way many companies offer, though not as great as some other countries obv). They're using it because it's the new normal, and they've been brainwashed with the belief that korean women have tougher times recovering due to the structure of their body and therefore need extra care post partum which is a bunch of BS. The care centers are like a hotel with food, excercises and having older women teach you how to take care of your newborn. It's a huge waste of money, but many Koreans will never admit it cause they won't dare to break the norms, despite complaining about everything 24/7. 90% of all issues in Korea stem from mindset / cultural issues, rather than pure economy or X Y Z hardship, despite what the western media would have you believe, they constantly misunderstand the true reason behind many of these issues.
Counterpoint. A system that allows a product so obviously predatory is broken. The greasy haired financier who invented it is not absolved of guilt because a sucker fell.
That nurse/doctor/contractor/service worker/ etc. taking care of you when you are 80 is the person who would have been born by someone your age. If you have too many people in the country not having kids, there will be serious consequences down the road unfortunately.
And aren't the Chaebols hyper-capitalist institutions? They operate practically unrestricted by the government because they control so much money in the country.
