> “Just had a call with a guy; so they basically formed a convoy, but did not get to their f positions by some three hundred meters. One unit moved forward, the convoy remained in place, about 300 meters from the others. The others raised the American f flag and their artillery started f ours really hard. Then their f choppers flew in and starter f everybody. Ours just running around. Just got a call from a pal, so there are about 215 f killed. They simply rolled ours out f hard. Made their point. What the f ours were hoping for in there?! That they will f run away themselves? Hoped to f scare them away? Lots of people f so bad [they] can’t be f ID-d. There was no foot soldiers [on the American side]; they simply f our convoy with artillery.”.
Great recommendation. Like "Munich" the message is basically, Israel has perhaps the best assassins in the business but the consensus of his interviewees is that targeted killing is at best a short-term security solution and has an anesthetic effect on politicians that lets them procrastinate on working towards political compromise that will result in lasting security for the people they serve.
