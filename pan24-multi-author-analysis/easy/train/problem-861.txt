The Lawrence Livermore Laboratory cost 4.22 billion USD to build and has annual operating costs of 108 million USD. Obviously this isn't the only experiment that has been performed, but I am asserting that fusion is an extremely energy-intensive, long-term investment with an uncertain outcome. The 1:1000 ratio I selected, was an arbitrarily conservative estimate. The sum of the amount of fusion energy actually produced (none of which is actually used for electricity generation) is very, very small compared to the energy it takes to build and operate such a facility.
Damn. Sadly the person(s) who just made this discovery have all sadly perished from naturally occurring gunshot wounds. Luckily we have our wonderfully benevolent oil barons to turn to in this time of crisis/j.
Fusion reactors are completely different technology then fission. If you think the general technological advancements that come with projects like these are dangerous and should be kept from spreading, your just a Luddite and should stop typing on your device and go churn some butter.
Really? My big worry is that goverments will start to see fusion as a climate change solution before contained fusion has actually been successfully demonstrated as a potential power source.
