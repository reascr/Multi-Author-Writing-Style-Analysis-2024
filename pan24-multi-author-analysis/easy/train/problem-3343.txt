Yeah we can walk and chew gum at the same time or at least theoretically we should be able to. 38 billion is a drop in the ocean to our budget and on top of that it generates jobs for Americans and the restraunts, schools, shopping centers that service the people living in the towns who work at those companies. We also are cleaning out our reserves from the draw down that would have been destroyed anyway as well as financially crippling one of our biggest adversaries behind China which means less money allocated towards their threat in the future. We can't pass even the most basic bills to help our own people and we've had that opportunity across presidents of all types and still didn't do shit. But now because you see a dollar sign next to an aid package you want us to cut it off and spend money on the homeless even though we have the money for both but refuse to do shit anyway?
Americans. Newsflash, we can’t spend the defense budget on homeless and “food” and “heating”. Should have paid attention to civics class in high school, then you wouldn’t have to ask dumb questions.
