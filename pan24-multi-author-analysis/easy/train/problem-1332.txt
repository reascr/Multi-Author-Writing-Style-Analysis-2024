Good point. But still, I've yet to hear a convincing argument from any of my Republican relatives or coworkers why they think the people that didn't vote for him in 2020 will go and vote for him in 2024, especially now that abortion is effectively outlawed, and gay rights appear to be next on their list.
I doubt that the RNC will make the same mistake they made in 2016 by allowing 17 people on the ballot, which ultimately boiled down to some number, around 10 in most states, of moderate experienced Republicans, and a Washinon-outsider underdog populist, who was able to grab enough votes to move on as the moderate vote was fractured. In 2024, Trump will be facing everyone trying to be a bigger populist, along with having to defend his record. And he just sounds tired and boring at this point, no wonder security wouldn't let people leave the other night during his announcement.
