Edit: I’ve looked into it a bit more. The initial reports that I saw suggested that it had been set up specifically for kids. However, the reports out now say that it was an adult torture center that had a cell specifically for kids where they were starved and abused. According to victims, it seems that the kids were mainly subjected to mental torture: telling them that their parents had abandoned them and forcing them to scrub the blood from the room where the actual torture took place.
Definitely. I think there’s a point where you’re aware of the scale of atrocities and being exposed to more stories of them does nothing to help at that point. It’s definitely still good for people who don’t believe what’s going on over there to read/see these accounts, and to never forget historically, but yeah. This stuff does take a toll mentally.
Absolutely insane. We need more boycotts and sanctions not just against Russia, but also against all its allies and trade partners. It's time to punish the big ones, India and China, who are feeding the Russian war machine with money, parts and supplies.
