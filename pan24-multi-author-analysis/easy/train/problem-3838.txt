More like Russia being cut off like North Korea. For this to be a proper cold war, Russia would need to be a near peer adversary, which suggssting nowadays would rightly get you laughed out of a room.
Democratic? Lol. Yanukovich illegally changed our Constitution to give himself governmental power over parliament. Your propaganda takes are always so damn funny, you guys literally have no idea what are talking about. People overthrew “president” because that’s our constitutional right. We didn’t overthrew “government” because we still have parliament. Armed Forces' deputy chief of staff Yuri Dumansky chose people’s side and resigned opposing the involvement of the army in the conflict against civilians. Constitutional guidelines about impeachment were broken only because they require Constitutional Court and Yanukovich already illegally used this court to change the way government works.
It’s likely a blend. We are now a year into all the fucking right wing propaganda supporting Putin, so of course there’s gonna be a percentage of people who got sucked in by that and legitimately believe it. Even if they live in the west.
