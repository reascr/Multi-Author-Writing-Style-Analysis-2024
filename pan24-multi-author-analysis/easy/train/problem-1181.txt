You expect me to believe that Hunter took his laptop to be repaired 100's of miles from where he lives, to a technician that just so happens to have face blindness (so he can't give testimony as to whether it was actually Hunter who dropped it off). Said tech upon finding incriminating evidence does not do the thing he's trained to do in those scenarios (copy the hard drive and submit it to the authorities) and instead held it for a while before giving it to Rudy Giuliani, a man with an obvious conflict of interests, who himself did not turn it into the authorities. The chain of evidence alone makes it inadmissible to a court of law, so the only possible use for it is to try and change people's minds ("the court of public opinion" as it's occasionally called). And Trump and Co. have never been constrained to reality when it came to their talking points.
Unprovoked? I am not saying that invading a neighboring country was the right thing to do, but you may want to do a bit more reasearch before you say it was "unprovoked".
