I mean, Title 42 was incredibly stupid and used COVID policy as a cudgel to enact racist policy, the data was clear from the beginning that immigration across the border wasn't a significant factor to the spread of COVID. Student debt forgiveness is to help those struggling under student loan debt in an economy wrecked both locally and internationally by COVID. The economic hardships and effects of COVID haven't gone away even if it is largely under control now. Furthermore, this action was started while we were still under a state of emergency, but has been held up by the very people trying to get rid of it because they held it off long enough. This is as dumb as the argument that the second impeachment of Trump had to be dropped because he lost the election even though the people making that argument were the ones that dragged it out that long. It isn't a contradiction because the basis is different. The fact that these people had this debt and suffered over 2 years of financial hardship and are still feeling the lasting effects of it makes your argument nonsensical. The fact that so many people are either completely incapable of understanding nuance or are just so often arguing in bad faith is just so frustrating.
The liberals in America are actually internationally considered conservative or at best right leaning/neoliberals.
