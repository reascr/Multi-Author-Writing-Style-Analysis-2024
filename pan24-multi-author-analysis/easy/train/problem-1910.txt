Listen, please: stop underestimating the strenh of governments and the weakness of citizens around the world. These are simply fallacies. There is no reason at all to believe that we citizens are as powerful as we like to think we are. We tend to overestimate our strenh and underestimate the strenh of governments the world over due to growing used to Democracy. Well, listen up: Democracy is rare, and it is NOT the "obvious" state of affairs to most people around the world, regardless of how beneficial a system it is. In the real world, governments wield more power (especially militaristically) over their citizenry than most citizens would like to believe (especially those spoiled enough to be living in a Democracy who tend to overestimate their own power) and could crush their citizens â€“ they just need a good enough reason to do it.
