The second type of plan is a short term plan. These types of plans have pre-existing condition clauses. And you may say, "Well, I don't have pre-existing conditions." But, what you need to realize is that they are short term plans. You enroll in them every year. Anything that occurred in the previous year is now considered a pre-existing condition and is no longer covered. So, say you get diagnosed as a diabetic and need insulin in 2023. The plan will pay for insulin in 2023. When you enroll in the plan for 2024, the diabetes diagnosis is now considered a pre-existing condition and insulin is no longer covered. For other serious illnesses (and even things like diabetes), they can deny coverage by just stating that the condition must have been a pre-existing condition because it could not have developed within the short amount of time the plan was in place. ACA plans, must cover pre-existing conditions no matter when they occur and continue coverage for pre-existing conditions rather than start over at renewal.
Don't get me wrong. Insurance is a middle man but the real profiteer in pharma over the last several decades is the rise of PBMs. It's not talked about in really any conversation about drug prices but it is a central figure in the decline of pharmacy work conditions due to underpayment to pharmacies and the managed inflation of pharmaceutical care.
Yeah. Agents make a killing off of those types of plans. The exchanges have basically made agents obsolete for real, quality health insurance plans as all ACA-compliant plans that are available for an area are right there for a person to compare themselves rather than being hidden away from the public.
1. When Obama Care was first rolled out, health insurance was required at the federal level. And wasnâ€™t there a tax penalty for not having adequate coverage?
