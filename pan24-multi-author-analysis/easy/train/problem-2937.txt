And the FSD thing is dead from the get-go. Speaking as a Computer Scientist researching AI, FSD will never happen on a large scale as Musk and Tesla would have you believe. We will never have "robotaxis" and the like. Tesla engineers even admitted themselves it will never happen. From a technical standpoint, FSD systems are, on a low level, like any other computational system, i.e., deterministic algorithms that, given a primitive input value, computes a primitive output value. The deterministic nature of algorithms means that an algorithm always produces the same output for a given input, no matter how complex the ML model is. It's essentially just a set of arithmetic computations like multiplications. Such a model will inherently make mistakes that get people killed.

Exactly. It really is time for Twitter to die a messy, horrible, death; and he's just the manchild edgelord to kill it.
