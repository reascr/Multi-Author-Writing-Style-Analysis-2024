3) He found another Mike Pence. I personally believe people greatly, dangerously underestimate the role Pence played in getting Trump in the WH. He legitimized him. I was living bouncing back and forth between Bucks County PA and Broward County FL back in 2016, and particularly for the oldhead classic Republicans that loved say, Nixon but hated the Tea Party and Gingrich- these are people who would say they didn't think they could bring themselves to vote for him. Openly. Then pence came along and to quote them "oh well there will be an adult in the room. He'll keep trump in line". And off they went, voting for Trump bc they could tell themselves they were actually voting for Pence. Especially in PA.
