I would rather have a billion assholes who acknowledge climate change is real than a billion nice people who deny it. One group will fucking act on it if only out of self-interest. Repeat ad fucking nauseum for literally anything. A billion selfish assholes dedicated to facts will pick single payer because the facts show it's cheaper for everyone and more effective where a billion charitable churchgoers who refuse to acknowledge it's more efficient won't. This isn't a fucking hypothetical it's actually what we see. More devoutly religious people in this country skew heavily towards the political party that tries harder to undo what small progress we make in expanding access to healthcare. Countries with stronger social safety nets tend to be far more atheistic and secular. Shocker. When you don't delude yourself that there's an afterlife where the good get their reward and the bad get their punishment, you know you have to take care of business in this life.
Revolutionary period? Sure, not everyone is really equal. But an aristocracy of businessmen beats a monarchy, right?
