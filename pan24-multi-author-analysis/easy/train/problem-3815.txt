You "might" not wrong but "might" not right either. Iran, UAE and Saudi Arabia are hardcore Islamist states but Iran is hold by Syiah Islamist regime while UAE and Saudi Arabia are Sunni Islamist regimes. Just because they're "Islam" doesn't mean they belong in the same basket. If UAE and Saudi Arabia really do buy into the same shit as you mentioned, they would've killed women for not wearing hijab like Iran as well but nope, hijab is not mandatory in UAE and Saudi Arabia unlike Iran, and here's Reddit inserting Mr Incredible "Islam is Islam" meme without making a single research for the differences and only look on killing people for breaking Islamic laws for the commons. Saying that Sunni and Syiah is the same is the equivalent of calling Chinese is a Japanese but oh wait, I'm in Reddit so my opinions probably doesn't matter.
