I do school work for roughly 10 hours a day everyday. Whether it’s being in class or actively working on projects, I’m putting in rough 70 hours a week. On top of this I’m working part time 10 hours a week. I’ll add probably 10 hours a week next semester when I’m taking more credits and the semester after that I’ll add another 10 hours a week as a TA (I’d work 20 hours but would leave my other job). By the end of next year I’ll be working 100 hours a week, all the while consuming and producing like any other economically productive adult. I’ll be educating others in my STEM field and am dedicating my life to becoming a boon for the US economy, as the value I’ll produce in my field far exceeds what I’ll be paid for my work. Why should I also be weighed down by debt? How is it not advantageous for the US economy to relieve the debts of people like me, and ultimately maximize our productive potential. If my debts are ridden, I’m not slowing down, but I’m also not just pouring money into a bottomless pit. I’m considerately investing in my own ability to achieve the highest degree of financial success I can in my societally crucial field. And with as much effort as I’m putting in, why should I have to choose between retiring at a typical age or being saddled with debt? Why should the circumstances of my birth destine me to only one of these options?
