The question isn't whether she can peel off Democrats; it's whether she can get votes from unaffiliated voters. Someone else posted exit poll numbers that say only 27% of Arizona voters are Democrats, compared to 40% independent and 33% Republican. Democrats don't win there by focusing on that 27%; they win by getting votes from the 40% independent voters, too.
Sinema ceasing to register as a Democrat doesn't really change the situation with votes at all. Sinema didn't become a Republican. She was already not a reliable vote for some Democratic bills, so that's not new. By all accounts, she will still be a vote for Democratic leadership positions. And with a Republican house, it's unlikely that much progressive legislation will be a possibility anyway. The Senate for the next 2 years is there to confirm Biden's nominees, and little else, and Sinema and Manchin are both relatively supportive of Biden nominees.
