Only on Reddit would this be seen as a win. Even moderate Republicans believe everything is a conspiracy these days. To them it looks like something between the pettiest of sour grapes on one end and a downright usurping on the other. It'll never pass, but it will be seen as vindication for wing nuts. He's yesterday's news, let him die a natural political death (but yeah, please prosecute him in the areas where the law is very cut-and-dried).
That sounds, to me, in my personal opinion, like a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge mistake. That's like 2016-election-there's-no-way-trump-wins-the-GOP-primaries-oh-oops-well-there's-no-way-he-wins-the-presidency-oh-oops level mistake.
But that isn't the same as going to jail. He would have to be convicted. By a jury. Where if even one juror turns out to be in his little cult, there's a 0% chance of conviction. With fox news screaming every second that this is a political witchhunt and completely illegitimate (and half the country eating it up). With the complete certainty of being appealed to a 6-3 supreme court that he appointed 3 members to.
