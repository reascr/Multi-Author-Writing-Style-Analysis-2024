I could see this argument, but the Ukrainian military is requesting Abrams and presumably they know best what tanks are best suited to their needs. The weight of the Abrams isn't classified after all.
Most of the conflicts the US has been involved in over its history have been disasters at best and actively morally evil at worst, but they’ve played their cards perfectly in Ukraine and are achieving incredible results on both a cynical cost-benefit level and a moral protecting-innocent-people one simultaneously.
What issues? I can still eat, barely pay rent, and get gas. Meanwhile Russia thinks it can do what it wants. Right now we are getting great results on the cheap. No need to stop.
Oh…you mean modify Ukrainian tanks to use standardized encrypted comms, adapting defensive packages, maybe thermal imaging, nato weapons like an addon multi role missile capability, ability to mesh together a battle space with localized info?
Your opinion. The vast majority of Americans want us to help Ukraine and I am one of them and the best part is we are doing it on the cheap. Want to fix American issues then stop Fucking voting RED.
