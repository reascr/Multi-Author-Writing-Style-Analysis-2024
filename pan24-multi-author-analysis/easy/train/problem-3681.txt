Yeah, that's why I think that even if they have reasons to dispute the results of the PL/US investigation, it would be best to just say something like "we want to learn the truth as much as the next guy, and we will happily participate in the investigation once we have some more resources to spare, because right now we've got Russia to fuck up" instead of quarreling.
Low chances. It was launched well outside the Russian attack swarm (10+ hours) and appears to be an S300 air defense rocket that failed to self detonate. UA have had these for years.
My guess was he may think that this could spark more anti-Ukraine sentiment (and I have no doubt Pootin is already mass-producing some sort of farcical propaganda based on this) as crazy pro-Russian conspiracy theorists and other morons around the world hop on this as "evidence" of how "look look Ukraine is the real bad guy" or "they want WW3 not Russia" and thus wants blame shifted away.
Same here. Ukraine wants access to the evidence so they can determine if it was their missile or not. They don't believe it was, and they feel that they should at least be allowed to be a part of the investigation if they're going to eat the blame for it.
