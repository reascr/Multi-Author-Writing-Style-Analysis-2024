Seriously though, Costa Rica is amazing, and ever since my trip there a few years ago I've been planning on going back. It's safe, the people are genuinely friendly (including the nicest, funniest bartenders on the planet), the infrastructure is modern and for the most part better than the US, and it's easily the most beautiful country I've ever been to. Natural beauty is everywhere. And it's not at all an expensive trip Our hotel was amazing; it was $80/night for a big suite with two balconies, one with an ocean view, plus an outdoor pool (this proved to be essential to our trip), full kitchen, free AMAZING breakfast, super cheap cocktails delivered to your room... 80 bucks? You can get a great meal - your choice of meat plus rice, beans, salad and fried plantains - for $5 at any of the "sodas" which are everywhere. And our direct flight from the northeastern US was only 5 hours and no more expensive than a comparable domestic flight. There's so much to do there too.
It was literally a money laundering operation. Set up a bank account in XXX country, buy all 45000 of them for 4.5 million. Stupid fucking easy. The fact that ACTUAL people bought them on top of the planned 4.5 million clean was simply icing on the cake.

Also - infrastructure modern?? Lol cmon man theres barely roads in many places, theres no address system - you cant even get a package delivered from the US without going through a lot of trouble.
