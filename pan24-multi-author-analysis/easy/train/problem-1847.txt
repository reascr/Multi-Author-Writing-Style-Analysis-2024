Blaming the US for Iran's religious extremism is fucking hilarious. The main spark for the revolution starting from 1978, was because the clerics thought that American culture was taking way too much of an influence in everyday Iranian life.
This is what happens when you learn history off Reddit and twitter; apparently the Iranian revolution was spearheaded by the Americans and Khomeini was installed by the US. Lmao.
The country only needs a little of support for its highly educated large portion of population to fully wipe off Islamic backwardness altogether. I really sincerely hope to see this in my life time.
There were secular opposition political figures and parties against the Shah, but the Iranians chose the clerics; because ultimately the revolution was a reactionist attitude towards increasing Western 'soft power' and populist dictators like Khomeini exploited and manipulated the public into giving them power. Iranians chose Iranian extremism, it's not the west's fault. Don't know why people are so eager to rob them off their own responsibilities.
