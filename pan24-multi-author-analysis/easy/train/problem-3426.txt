Conservatives believe in natural hierarchies. There are people who are better, and there are people who are lower, and it is that way for a reason. People who are smart, talented, and/or blessed by God, are the rich and powerful. Therefore, the flip must also be true. The rich or powerful must be our betters.

Look, politicians have always lied — as George Carlin famously joked, the reason we can’t display the 10 Commandments in a courthouse is you can’t post Thou shall not lie in a building full of lawyers, judges and politicians - but we seem to have reached another level at this point in history, when an entire percentage of our country dismisses a pathological liar as the President of the United States, and now this guy comes in, and appears to be a total fraud with crickets from the republican party.
PS. I dare anyone to prove me wrong. Because if you find anything that contradicts what i said its probably some Infowars lie and just proves you swim in some tainted waters because this all on national news and on camera or newspaper.
