I seem to remember pictures of dead bodies just laying in the streets not that long ago. People here are it up. Iâ€™m not sure I trust these new videos.
Having said all this, the vaccine situation among the elderly is extremely poor, and this sudden reopening has obviously been the opposite of how a reopening should be done. Most under-60s will be vaccinated but will most likely be more symptomatic than people elsewhere who had the modern vaccines.
With the under-60s however, vaccine uptake was quite forceful and even compulsory across some areas and occupations. Myself as an example; my wife and I both worked in education, so it was either take the vaccine + all boosters or lose our jobs. It wasn't a "get it by x day" sort of thing, it was more an "everybody lines up now and gets the vaccine today or so help you". It's difficult to measure the overall situation though, because each city government has its own power to choose how to enforce the vaccine. The city I lived in made it mandatory for anyone they could legally mandate.
