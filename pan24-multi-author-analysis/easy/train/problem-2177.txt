But, furthermore, the entire argument you're making is predicated on the fact that the things the democrats are fighting for are their end goals. If they accomplished the things they're after and then stopped trying to make progress, then your view might hold water. But instead, I think they're fighting for those things because they are the next step to actual left wing policies. When you compare them to the left wing in Europe, it looks like the American left is so far to the right because European societies are to the left of American society. When American society catches up to where European society and we have things like universal healthcare, then the left in America will look like more like the European left currently does.
