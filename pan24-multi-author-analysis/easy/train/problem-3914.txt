It really is crazy that after the way the GOP has fared so badly at the polls in three straight elections they don't seem to want to change things up. My guess is it's because they don't think they have anything else to offer. It's bigotry and intolerance or nothing I guess. That's why Mitch McConnell preferred that the GOP's message was quite literally nothing as opposed to what they ran on this year. I can see them saying behind closed doors "if we're not trying to strip away rights and freedoms from marginalized communities, then who the hell even are we?".
the Republican party is a domestic terrorist organization bent on white, Christian supremacy. They've already managed to turn this country into a theocracy through the Supreme Court which trots out twice a year to issue it edicts we all must follow and have zero accountability. They refused to punish Donald Trump for leading a terrorist attack on the Capitol on Jan 6th 2020. They're not hiding they're waiting for the chance to complete the take over.
