Often when I complain about politics I get asked some version of "If you're so smart what would you do". And my answer is always to commit rampant plagiarism. In school copying someone's homework is bad, but in government you can just copy what another country does well and you don't get a call to the principal's office. Like pick any issue at all. Then look at countries that addressed the same or a similar issue. See who did it best, copy past the replace country name with my country's name. (Possibly get the document translated if languages don't match). Like I can't think of an easier job to have a near guarantee at improving the lives of a very very large number of people's lives. Only downside is in order to get elected with a platform like this you need the masses to be okay saying other countries are better at stuff (and in the US that cuts the number of people who will consider voting for you by a large amount).
