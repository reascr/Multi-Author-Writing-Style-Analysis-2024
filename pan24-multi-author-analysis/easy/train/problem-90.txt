And what does some of their politicians recommend? Close markets early as well as "Abdul Qadir Patel, a Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) member, suggested that couples wanting to have children should leave Pakistan and add to the population in countries where Muslims are a minority."<- export their religious fundamentalism.
When these countries built the bulk of this debt they had no other options. The IMF and world Bank have never had a successful rebuild post loan. They enforce liberalization (selling of public assets, and decrease public service and institutions.).
Neoliberalist-managed IMF has always imposed draconian austerity measures. It is better for nations to just stay the hell away from IMF than to borrow from IMF and get into it's grasp.
Pakistan is extremely over-populated and entirely unsustainable. There really is nothing to be done at this point given the climate situation (outside of their control), rampant corruption and religious extremism, not to mention they've been spending almost 4% of their GDP on the military/the military own massive parts of the economic and political landscape (obviously corrupt as well).
