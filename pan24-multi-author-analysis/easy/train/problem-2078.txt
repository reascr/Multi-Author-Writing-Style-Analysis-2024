I was reading up on his policy decisions while in office, and as far as Republicans go, he's been pretty inoffensive. Like, I'm a full blown socialist who thinks Bernie would be moderate left in any other country, but if there has to be a Republican party, I'd much rather it be represented by people like him. At least when we lose to him, we just get some policies we don't agree with rather than someone who is a literal existential threat to anyone who disagrees with him. And he's even shown a capacity to support progressive policies when they have bipartisan support...he's been pro-choice, pro-lgbtq, recently pro-weed after hearing compelling arguments supporting it, pro-vax, pro-mask, pro-conservation, and he endorsed every police reform strategy from the independent oversight commission he created as a response to George Floyd.
Don't buy his moderate ploy. He's an 80s era republican dinosaur, talking about abortion restrictions and "needing more information" about Marijuana. He's a selfish prick who's angling for a presidential run.
