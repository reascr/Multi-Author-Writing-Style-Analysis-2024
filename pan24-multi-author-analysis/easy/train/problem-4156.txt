The reason this EU-NATO partnership is significant is because Sweden and Finland want to join NATO but are being blocked by Turkey. While Turkey has the power to do this they don’t have the power to block NATO and the EU from more closely working together which means Sweden and Finland can get more of the benefits of NATO even if they’re not able to join outright. It should be remembered that one of NATO’s biggest strenhs is that the militaries all coordinate and standardize everything so they can essentially work together as one big unit rather than 30 independent militaries.
They arent able to. You can justify this with any reason you want. Many have said this is because NATO and the USA are scared of Russia since it has nuclear capabilities. That’s fine. China also has nuclear capabilities. So if we cant even handle dealing with Russia because we are terrified of escalation, why the posturing with China as well? Deal with one threat at a time.
The ones feeling "cornered" are the much smaller Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia etc that are seeing large swathes of their traditional (and internationally recognized) territorial waters being literally taken over violently by China who claims waters 1000s of KM from their own shores. Or India who has received multiple PRC incursions across previously stable Lines of Actual Control. Or Japan who regularly receives threats from China that it will take over some of their islands. Let alone Taiwan which is under direct pressure not withstanding a possible invasion in the future.
