So let me get this right you support that people highjack airplanes and fly them in to towers? Yes Guantanamo bay is wrong. And i agree whit you Iraq did better under Saddam Hussein even if he torture and tested gas on his own population, as for Syria what are you referring to? The president or isis, the kurds?
In my city here in Canada they built a cycle centre for the Pan Am games … it’s a cycling centre now, has basketball courts, tennis courts, they do giant yoga sessions, spin classes, kids classes, and tons of other things to bring the community out and promote healthy lifestyles … these spaces can be used after they are done with them for other purposes you know.
Is Qatar worse? Very likely. But let's not pretend the US is anything but a warmongering imperialist nation with no respect for human rights.
As if the US had any respect for human rights. Millions of deaths due to their 21st century wars. No-trial torture prison. Largest prison population, relative and absolute, in the world. Constant war. Etc.
