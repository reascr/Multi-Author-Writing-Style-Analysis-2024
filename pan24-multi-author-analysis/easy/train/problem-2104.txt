If, in either case, Germany had invaded one other country and then pulled back within its own borders, I suspect the war would have quickly been over, particularly if the invaded country wasnâ€™t tied up in a bunch of mutual assistance pacts.
Naive. They align themselves with dictators because they want to find force their system on the entire world. Do you know how fucking easy it is to get dictators under their thumb? Just bribe the top guy and the entire country belongs to them. North Korea, Myanmar, Cambodia, South Africa, Pakistan(under imran khan). The buzzword for tankies is "propaganda". Normal humans dont go around saying that when others comment about something, its "literally propaganda" lmao. Look, if you enjoy sucking the teets of dictators, just move to a dictatorship country and enjoy yourself. Just dont start crying when you complain about how hard your life is online and find out that your entire social media accounts got banned and the fucking police comes knocking on your door.
