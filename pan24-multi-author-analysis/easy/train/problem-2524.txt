This. Every time Democrats want to spend money, the media uses the total value not the amount per year. The military gets 800 billion PER year. 40 million Americans are asking for 1/60th of that.
If you get a degree from 123 Academy and their reputation is that they pump out electricians assistants who are not trained adequately and the student can't get hired as an electrician assistant in their area as a result and 123 Academy advertised to students that they would help with or in some cases guarantee career placement, and don't. Then the degree is worthless. But the student is still on the hook for the student loans that funded it. Students of Corinthians College, for example, had worthless degrees.
A degree that comes from a school that doesn't actually provide a full or robust education. Generally they exist solely to soak up GI Bill and student loan money with the promise of career placement and internships. A lot of career school did this and were ultimately closed during the end of the Obama administration leaving their students with loans and not enough education in their career field to get a job in that field.
