Excuse? Nah it's an explanation. Religion has always been a tool to control the masses to do your bidding while justifying it with the ultimate fingerpointing "because god told us so!".
The Russian Orthodox church split in 1920 over Soviet influence leading to the formation of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia with separate leadership. Putin and Russia's senior leadership has worked hard to bring the global Russian Orthodox Church back under Moscow's control and was having quite a bit of success prior to invading Ukraine. The 2014 invasion resulted in the creation of an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church but the Russian Orthodox Church still controlled many important locations in Ukraine and retained many adherents. The 2022 re-invasion has dramatically tipped the balance towards the independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church within Ukraine while eroding Russia's global influence in the religious scene. The Russian Orthodox Church is becoming more and more an isolated religious body strong inside Russia but stripped of power outside of Russia's borders.
