You have no members of congress right now. Until this is settled, there is no Congress. As useless as they seem to me, this idiocy is preventing security briefings from going out when Russia could attack Ukraine again at any moment. Biden could send some stuff, but only take from existing programs, not give things to Ukraine. That’s congress’ job. They are useless, this is in a way funny, but this also has real consequences for people all around the world. Republicans look horrible if you take the time to read about it, but Americans look horrible if you don’t. I’m sure this fiasco has Putin giggling, thank you Kevin McCarthy for that I guess.
Republicans had metal detectors removed. Several of them are probably carrying guns. If a fist fight broke out there's a good chance someone would get shot.

Again, non-American. In my (limited) understanding the Senate can’t raise the debt ceiling, propose legislation, or propose new spending. They can change what they have existing from the House, but can’t do new things? I’m not trying to be an ass, I am probably missing something.
