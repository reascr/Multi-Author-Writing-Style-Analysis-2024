Hate having to explain this again…the Republicans did that shit not Biden. A bill to allow sick days wouldn’t pass the senate thanks to them because THEY blocked it. One of the bills gave all other requests from the workers but sick days and Republican lawmakers refused pass the other. With no other way to get the workers those sick days, Biden had to sign the resolution to avoid a strike that would harm the economy thanks to ONE group. Whose fault is that?
If you’re looking to invade Taiwan and their biggest supporter is the US, you’d do anything you can to learn about how they do things, from command and control of military and nuclear response, especially of those signals that don’t reach space and unable to be picked up by satellite. Measurement of time to scramble, frequency, energy, and direction of early warning radar, to perhaps jam in the even of a first strike. Nukes are on a MAD doctrine, but if you figure out to take out one leg of the triad, then maybe you have a chance of surviving a retaliatory strike.
