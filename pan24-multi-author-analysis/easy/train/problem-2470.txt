In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I hope so. I agree with Democrats on most issues but I really have trouble with my first impression of her. She said that we should get rid of ICE and that ICE didn’t even exist ten years ago. That’s both a bad idea (we absolutely should enforce our border laws), and a lie (just because they changed their name to ICE didn’t mean border enforcement didn’t exist before that). I’ve never not seen her as anything other than a manipulative politician since then. Hopefully she has grown from then.
Absolutely! I don’t track as far left as her, but her campaign finance “speech” was something 99% of Americans would agree with if she wasn’t the one asking the argument.
