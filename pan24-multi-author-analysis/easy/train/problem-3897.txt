Right, but that's kind of the point. They arguably absolutely do have more diverse cuisine. Which means that the US being above France is not really a mistake or insulting. French food is great, but it's also more limited.
Maybe an unpopular opinion, but while I like French food, a lot of it seems so heavy to me. A lot of butters and fats and richness. I tend to think that the US has a lot more diverse cuisine, even excluding all the fusions.
And it's funny that you think of American foods as all fusion, when most cuisines are. You said pizza is one dish that's been Americanized, but Italian pizza is also basically a fusion. They didn't even have tomatoes originally because tomatoes are from the Americas, so many of their dishes never existed as they do now. Can anyone imagine Italian without the tomato? Much of the world's cuisines are like that. How we all eat now is very different than how it was before the great Columbian Exchange. So what exactly is "traditional" in that case? What is real and not real?
Really? I lived there for a short while and found the food was amazing. It was like everything available in Indonesia + fusion Thai/Chinese/Indian food.
