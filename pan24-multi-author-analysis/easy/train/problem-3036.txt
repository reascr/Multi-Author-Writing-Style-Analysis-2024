In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Not really, actually. Lying isn't defined as a characteristic of BPD. From my own experience living with the disorder, it's very difficult for me to lie, especially in the scope and scale what he does. The thought of trying to build an artificial life like this actually terrifies me and not something I could do.

Probably an accurate assumption. The harm they see him to do others is a draw, because they enjoy witnessing that harm and would enact it themselves given the chance. It's like a sociopath pyramid scheme.
It's just been difficult lately seeing BPD gain awareness in general society but so few people actually understand what it is and what the defining features are; notably there has been a huge increase in the number of attributions of negative interactions in personal lives to BPD when the described actions don't seem to have anything to do with the disorder.
She isn't wrong. A Drag Queen felon from Brazil got elected from a Blue District by courting both sides and basically tefloning his lies. If that aint the American Dream I don't know what is.
There are other personality disorders (including some other cluster B) that include some symptoms that would fit his behavior, but it's not productive to do armchair diagnosis from limited information, as that leads to an increase of stigmatization.
