You could very well be right. I had to go back and check whether this was one of Admiralty Shipbuilders' projects. It isn't. But the head of Admiralty shipyard, Alexander Buzakov, died unexpectedly yesterday. Between the upper echelons of the Russian military and military industry falling out of windows and suffering other "mysterious accidents" it's hard to guess what is really happening in Russia, other than things are going badly. Hopefully the carrier is another imaginary threat. There are plenty of real threats still though.
The "drove off all their best theoretical physicists" bit was crucial, but there was another important factor: Germany didn't have a fraction of the industrial and research capabilities available that were required to go from theory to working prototype in the time they had.
Yes. The Russians have been lying about having hypersonic cruise missiles all along. But the Chinese just say "me too!" because that suits their ends while the US military industrial complex doesn't point out the lie because they want the budget increases year after year, of course.
