And Russia is a threat to Switzerland how? There are about 7 countries between them and the Russians. All of with sizeable military forces, and 5 of them are in NATO, and have larger, more powerful allies to call upon if needed. Switzerland itself is armed to the teeth, and Russia themselves are losing to (at the time) the poorest and most corrupt country in Europe. Switzerland has no reason to fear Russia. Even if Russia somehow decides to invade, Switzerland has been preparing for a scenario like this for almost a century. Even without NATO help, it’s hard to believe that Russia can beat Switzerland.
There’s about 4 countries between Russia and Switzerland, all of which, including Switzerland are armed to the teeth, and have much more powerful allies to back them up. Russia is losing to what was (at the time) the poorest and most corrupt country in Europe. Tu can let go of your pearls.
