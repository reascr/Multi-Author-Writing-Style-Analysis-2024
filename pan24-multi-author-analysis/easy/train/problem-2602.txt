I really want to say that the West tends to forget that for about 20 years (90s and 00s), China was actively trying, really hard, to do exactly this. Under Jiang and Hu, China was integrating with incredible speed. Hu himself tried to run the country by consensus rather than the dictatorial style of literally every other Chinese leader. This was the political environment that made the USA so optimistic as to open manufacturing with China. Hu even tried to normalize relations with Taiwan and downplayed military force for reunification. Jiang went so far as to reform local elections to ensure transparency and increase the power of directly elected local officials (yes, China actually tries democracy on a local/municipal level).
Not quite. Switzerland is well known for its close economical connection to China. They very much do rely on eachother, so I don't think Switzerland would have a reaction like that.
Yes, they offer refuge, but they don't offer anything beyond because the Chinese fight any attempt of the refugees on a real life in Switzerland.
Refugees can't even have proper legal jobs because Switzerland doesn't want to get into a fight with China over their embassies blocking those people by withholding papers.
