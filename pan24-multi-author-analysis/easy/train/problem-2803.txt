How long do these people continue to get the benefit of the doubt? Not to be too much of an asshole here, but the GQP has been mask off for the better half of this century. They're literally running on a platform of we can do no wrong, let us overturn democratic elections, and fuck poor people, immigrants and the libs. If you vote for all of that over health care, education, a more fair tax code, and equal human rights, maybe those actually are your interests.
Seriously? “How” is pretty straightforward when Florida is a state where the general population voted to allow those formerly convicted of crime to vote, so long as they served their sentence - but the state legislature said “that’s actually bad for us so fuck y’all. We aren’t gonna do that.” And now people who have served their time are required to pay their “debts” back to the state before they can legally vote again. Naturally the state wont tell these people what the amount is that they owe, but they have to repay the debt or they are committing voting fraud by attempting to vote.
