. The "donations" to Ukraine from the US have been largely mothballed, outdated kit that appears on the balance sheet as its as-new replacement cost. There's a decent chance that the US is saving money on the venture since by sending it to Ukraine they don't have to pay to maintain and decommission it (they did this with aid to Iraq as well, apparently). That's not the case for all aid, of course - it's not all old kit and ammo is an everpresent concern.
Extremely common. The US government is basically just the gatekeeper, if you are a friendly country in their eyes you can buy almost anything in the US arsenal as long as you pony up enough money to the companies which own the IP.
The US government is just the middleman here, but yes American companies making foreign sales and bringing money to the US means more tax revenue for the government and more high paying jobs that produce even more revenue.
Nope. I’d prefer we put as many resources into helping people as we did into blowing shit up. I’d prefer that no one was even building these fucking things. We don’t have to spend billions on advanced weaponry we can just wait for people to starve to death because we apparently can’t afford to feed everyone.
