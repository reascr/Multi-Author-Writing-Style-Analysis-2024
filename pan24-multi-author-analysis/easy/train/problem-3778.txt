If you view the actions of January 6th through the lens of a believer. The election has been stolen by a powerful cabal of Washinon elites. Democracy no longer matters, your vote is not counted. The US government is held hostage by a Fascist regime that cannot be taken down through protest, through media, through voting, or through the actions of the few brave and honest representatives that remain, then she is a patriot. What is left then, but to apply violence in the hopes of saving the nation? Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable, and peaceful revolution has been made impossible.
Yup. They always go back to, the cops let the people in. Like, you know there's video footage of this not happening with 99% of the cops dealing with terrorists beating the shit out of cops, being held back from getting inside. Watch the new vice documentary on HBOMax. It's very good, with multiple different scenes but timestamped happening at the same time. 187 Minutes, I believe it's called.
