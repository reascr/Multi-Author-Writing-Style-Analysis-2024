There has never been such a thing as an "independent" media. Anymore than there currently is, at any rate. Even Walter Cronkite had political opinions (and a network boss, also with their own political opinions). And back in the day, there were literally only a tiny handful of news networks from which to choose compared to today. In other words, there are fewer news gatekeepers now than there used to be, not more. News is getting more democratic, not less. In fact, the news of entire huge global events often gets broken on Twitter first, not a TV channel. Social Media IS the news for many people now.
Russians aren't protesting because of their total disorganization, atomization and apathy. Speaking as a Russian.
If you can't run a country with an independent press and the equivalent of First Amendment protections, then you might as well just straight-up admit that you're incompetent, possibly corrupt, and such a delicate flower that you can't handle the pressure when people call you on your incompetence and corruption.
