The thing is that they started the war with trying dollar store shock and awe. They successfully suppressed air defense network in first three days of invasion but they did not destroy it, without air dominance. Now they seem to do dollar store soviet tactics, they assault specific part of the front at tactical level ( like Bakhamut) instead of assault across entire front lose 9/10 of battles and reinforce 1/10.
No? Why would I ask that? Which outcome depends on what they want? If they want to agitate Russia, then that's their decision, but they'll have to live with the consequences as well. Sucks to have Russia as a neighbour, but if you want to be an asshole, don't expect Russia to turn the other cheeck, why would they, lol.
Who gives a shit about whether or not they are part of Russian territory?!? Russia, rightfully, feels threatened so they will react accordingly, to whats in their best interest. If that means invading every country before it joins NATO then that's what they'll do. How is that so difficult to grasp?
