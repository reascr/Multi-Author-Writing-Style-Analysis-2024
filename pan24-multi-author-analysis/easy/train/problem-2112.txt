Criminalization is not the same thing as execution. Laws that prevent gay people from, for instance, achieving a civil Union in a secular setting are the types of laws the pope is denouncing. While the pope may not agree with the specific instances you are citing from a religious perspective, this statement is clearly implying that religious doctrine should be considered separate from secular governments. “Threatening the very moral fabric of society” is too big of an extrapolation. If that is true, then this statement would never have been made. If we take the church as the “guardian of morality”, then it should be a mandate for it to interfere with secular governments. Again, this statement implies that secular governments should not take marching orders from the church. While this statement does leave open the door for discrimination by individuals, especially if laws protecting lgbtq+ individuals are not enacted (which they should be), it removes one of the pillars on which anti-gay societies and institutions justify their position. “Oh it’s ordained by the church” not really, the pope specifically condemned these laws. It’s definitely not enough, but it is a large step in the right direction.
The Anglican and Presbyterian Churches I really don't know anything about their positions on homosexuality. I'm Catholic, so that's why I know the Catholic Church's position.
