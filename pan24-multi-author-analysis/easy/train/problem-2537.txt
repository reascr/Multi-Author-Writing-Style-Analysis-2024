Wait, what? He said all of the above in recent depositions?! WTF. Edit. It's in the deposition. Egads, his attorneys must be crawling out of their skins.

Trump's own lawyer is arguing - an argument that is difficult to contradict - that if America's enemies realize that Trump's media persona isn't a persona, and that this person is too stupid and emotionally crippled to stop pointlessly lying and self-incriminating while under oath in a federal DOJ investigation, that they will realize America is without a functioning executive and perhaps make moves.
Got stuck in a loop for a long time. "I'll be suing her. But I'll be suing you too. And I'll be suing her. And I'll be suing you. But I'll be suing her. And you too.".
John Dowd, his lawyer when Trump was President, , because Donald Trump was so stupid that if he testified and it was clear he couldn't even lie competently under oath to save himself form jail, if it was revealed to America's enemies how stupid Trump was, it would constitute a national security risk.
Let us be very clear: within the first four minutes of testifying under oath with a first year law student - nevermind a grizzled verteran like Robert Mueller and his team - their questioning would have Trump perjuring himself six different times while inadvertently confessing to a dozen other crimes he cannot understand are crimes. He would be obliterated.
