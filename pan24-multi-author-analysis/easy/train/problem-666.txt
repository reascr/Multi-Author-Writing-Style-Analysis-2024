It will wound. But to actually take down game you generally have to hit the lungs, heart, or brain stem. Bow hunters can go for shoulder blades on a deer. You want a round that can shrug off tumbling prematurely on the way to the intended target when shooting in densely growths, yet still be able to tumble and transfer energy upon initial expansion. You can take down even a bull moose with .308 in a mid range to maintain 2300 ft/lb energy provided that it doesn't encounter any ribs. No one uses a speargun for taking game unless you're a Japanese sailor from that one shitty town that sues anyone who tries to interfere with their barbaric dollar tree Falkland island whaling traditions just to eat disgusting canned blubber tissue.
2. The shoot on sight order has been responsible for the deaths of locals who weren’t poachers but had gone into the park for other reasons. Often times it’s people who have been living there for generations and have always been living on the edge of the park, which is not fenced, making it easy for people to get in by accident. explains it pretty well. While the guards maintain they order people to identify themselves, that’s little comfort to the families of the innocent and there is very little that can be done to hold the guards responsible for wrongful death.
I like this. This is a good way to think of "executing the poachers" and realize how misplaced our concern is:
Especially because. In many places where poaching are common. Poachers are also part of guerrillas and terrorist organizations. As they use poaching as a way to fund themselves.
