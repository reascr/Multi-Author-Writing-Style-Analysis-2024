Not to mention the robot machine gun they used to kill a nuclear scientist a couple years back. They smuggled in parts, put the gun in the back of a truck and controlled it via sat. Wild shit.
I have to wonder if anyone will actually do something about it because back in the mid 2000s the US seriously considered taking military action against North Korea when they were on the verge of getting nukes but wound up calling it off because even without nukes North Korea has a shitload of artillery on the boarder and tens of millions of South Korean citizens within their range and the US decided that the human cost to South Korea wouldn’t be worth it. But last I checked Iran doesn’t really have any seriously western aligned countries right on their border, or at least ones they would be prepared to rain shells on or the US would care enough about to back off. Still though, if anyone would do something about this it would probably be Israel. Man, what a time to be alive.
Seriously. We have killed so many fucking people over fake people in the sky. And or just because they were born somewhere and we were born somewhere else.
