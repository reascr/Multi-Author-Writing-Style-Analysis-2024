Personally, I'm, as Ukrainian, have formed the impression from news and Republican statements that most modern Republicans are either conservative isolationists who do not care about what is happening outside the United States, or outright pawns of the Chinese Communist Party and, to a lesser extent, Putin. Every time the US is in conflict with China or Russia, the Republicans go to great lenhs to sabotage any containment or punishment of those countries. Not directly, but inventing some third-party pretext, unrelated to China or Russia and verbally condemning them at the same time. Like now, when Republicans sabotage the supply of weapons to Ukraine under the pretext of an investigation of potential corrupt activities of the Democratic Party and Biden, while at the same time a majority of them condemn Putin for aggression and verbally support Ukraine.
No. That is a literal insane idea. When you fuck up that badly, you don't just "get over it" or "shove it under the rug and pretend it didn't happen.". You have to learn from your mistakes and that only happens when you face them and accept them as mistakes.
