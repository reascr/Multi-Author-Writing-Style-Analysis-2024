Medved and Pu worked together in Saint Petersburg under Sobchak in 1990. Pu brought with himself from SPb to Moscow a whole bunch of people, putting them into cushy positions—plenty of them are still around him now, basically his most trusted people (that are known to the public). Medved's political output currently is that of a fart in the wind, and he's in the Kremlin only because he's still in this trusted circle—he's deputy chairman of the ‘Security Council’, which is the topmost gang right now, other than the oligarchs, siloviki/army and the whatever private ‘advisors’ Pu has. Medved wouldn't be there if Pu was in any way wary of him.
Seriously. The City exists because of money stolen from the Russian economy. Brexit exists because thr EU was going to regulate the fuck out of all that stolen Russian cash. If you hate Capitalism, but you love Russia, you're just an idiot. Because you clearly super-love all the worst parts of Capitalism, but you're just cosplaying a Communist.
Hahahaha. That's a good one. Sometimes I wonder if these guys come up with these ideas while sitting around smoking opium.
