It's like the boss or assistant manager that blames all the problems of a department or their own failings on the employee who does: all the sales, customer service and orders and has a damn good track record. Yet always blames them for not making them look good or the place's failures are on them. Then when that said employee quits or does get fired over a "made up issue". Then they are left to their own mechanics and then the real manager or board of directors see that they are a complete moron and they really don't know what they are doing. Then they come back with: "But it's not my fault, if they would have let me abuse them more, we wouldn't be in this mess." Board/Manager: "But the loses are all on you, you signed off on it." The assistant manager: "No that wasn't me." Board/Manager: "That's your signature here." Assistant Manager: "... I'm fired aren't I?".
The gutting of the middle class, increased costs of raising a healthy nuclear family (which society heavily pressures people to do), instability in the work place, decline of social support systems (and its replacement with much less healthy elements in social media) and increases in poverty caused by wealth concentration were always going to open the gates to these kinds of issues.
Edit to add — and I’m Black. Racism is everywhere, of course, but this is the one place I haven’t felt it oozing everywhere. Me and my family really like it here.
