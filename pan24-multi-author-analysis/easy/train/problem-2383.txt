2. How do you define oppressive government personnel?2a) And then how do we measure based on your definition, if its not a stat that is already tracked.2b) I can provide numbers for the number of people shot by police in America this year. Its around 1200 people per year.2b1) I'm not sure how many of those would be considered an oppressive, I'm sure some people would argue they were all oppressive, and others would argue none were oppressively.2b2) Also how many are adults vs kids.
