It all comes down to intent. This is why trump’s issues are not the same as Biden. Trump had clear intent to take the documents from the White House, keep the documents in several unsecured location, share the documents with other people, and to not return the documents when they were repeatedly requested. All of this occurred when he was out of office. Biden legally initially possessed the documents while he was serving as president. There is no skiff/skif? at that particular office, so it is highly unlikely that the documents were SCI (which is some of the stuff trump was holding on to).
Exactly! Biden shouldn’t have the records, but the headlines for Biden have been “Biden identifies and turns in discovered classified documents”. The headlines for trump were “FBI discovers classified documents in trump’s possession during search of his property after trump’s team signs an affidavit claiming there were no such documents”. Biden was negligent, trump was malicious. Both should be punish, but not equally.
