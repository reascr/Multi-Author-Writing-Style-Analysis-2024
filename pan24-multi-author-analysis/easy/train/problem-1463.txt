It's the wealthy who decide what gets created and how, and not just art but what you climb into your cars and workstations to do each and every morning, the billions of you out there, all that personal striving to head right toward the end goal of fucking what? Global genocide and ecocide and civilizational collapse. All the Goya's and Rembrandts or whatever have all been part of that same system, that same lineage as us all the tiny labors, trillions of the each day because the absolute end, functional human extinction, is so all encompassing.
