He's demanding a power which seems to violate the separation of powers. But it's Tom Cotton so it's not like we expect him to be acting in good faith.
Given that a special council is supposed to be independent and the members of the committee represent both parties, material related to an ongoing investigation should not be released to the subjects political allies or opponents.
It doesn't really matter if Tom Cotton is a bad faith actor. Congress having oversight into an investigation about what appears to be a systemic issue with the executive branch's handling of classified documents is a reasonable request.
Considering that Biden is the one under investigation and his DOJ chose the special counsel handling the investigation, it seems pretty reasonable for Congress to have oversight over this situation. And given that Democrats control the Senate, there is even less reason to refuse Tom Cotton's request.
