"The treaty, signed in 2002, requires migrants to make an asylum claim in the first country they enter, whether it is the US or Canada.".
If a claimant, under 3, if found not to be a refugee (the majority of cases), it costs the Canadian taxpayers approximately $150,000 to process the entire tribunal and support process per claimant (which Canada is legally bound to undertake as part of being a signatory to the UN Convention of Refugees).
Did I misread? It says NYC is paying for transportation to Quebec. Is NYC sending them through an area without the stations? NYC is sending them through where there is no checkpoint. WTF?
considering how Canada, who shares a border with nobody but the US, , and the nearly 2000 mile long US-Mexico border that is abused by the entire international community regularly -- I have little empathy for the Quebec immigration minister's state of "surprise" and even less desire to renegotiate a treaty to further minimalize immigration through to Canada. pull your weight, fellow member of the G8.
