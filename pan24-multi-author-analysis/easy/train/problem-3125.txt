Also it’s bizarre that you think proximity has any relevance when it comes to capturing cities in modern warfare, when all parties involved have machinery that make any amount of distance trivial.
Are you high?? Yeah Putin has Napoleon's complex but he doesn't even compare to Napoleon's grandma in military genius. Napoleon took on most of Europe and won time and again.. it took multiple coalitios of almost all major European powers to defeat him. Even when he invaded Russia he made mince meat of the Russians and took Moscow before winter proved too much. Even after the defeat in Russia, and with mostly conscripts he trounced the allies in multiple battles, and one of his marshalls who defected told the allies they should retreat when he attacks and take on his commanders until he has no army left.
Which...is kinda crazy. It seems like you'd want to be able to fly and use air defense at the same time, but they don't seem to have that capability.
Sounds like deliberate misinformation. It's not like it's unusual in warfare or anything ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯.
