There was no realistic way to impose Chinese style lockdowns on the whole planet and not all of us were lucky enough to be New Zealand which had a much easier time of controlling the virus given their geography. Certain governments and leaders didn’t help matters sure but there was no scenario where we beat Covid. It was too transmissible and mutated too quickly not to mention re-infection is possible with the virus so vaccination/previous infection doesn’t guarantee that the spread will stop.
I didn’t say that. When my time comes it comes. If you think humans belong here after what we’ve done, or that we are capable of change, your delusional. And it seems….. angry. I didn’t say start culling. I said disease will cull and it inevitable, based on human behavior. Best of luck!
I’m saying one of those countries is an authoritarian regime which regularly commits human rights violations and the other is geographically isolated and economically prosperous. The first is not a way that should be replicated and the second was mostly possible because of geography and having the infrastructure to endure. There was no way that could be replicated globally.
