The lack of sick days for rail workers is just the tip of the iceberg. They want to work these people as close to slaves as legally possible for their own profit. They are not making profits if they're not making more than last year. Walmart is this way. I've seen it first hand. Stores get in trouble if their profits are down from the same dates as last year. If it's consistent there are write-ups and termination if you can't make a profit for them. Why give your profit money away, to give your employees better pay and benefits, when you can just put it all in your own pocket? Railroad companies were one of the Original greedy companies owned and controlled by the Rich here in America before large corporations were started and grew in to the greedy monsters they are today.
Woefully misinformed. The majority of the workers are in the four unions that did not pass the deal. Biden at any point could have included the sick time in his Peb. It's the presidential emergency board. They split it up knowing it wouldn't pass and blocked our strike anyway.
