He surrendered because he was surrounded you goof. He didnt wonder 100 miles to find ukranian help out of the kindness of his heart. The ukrainian military didnt kill him because they arent trash like russians. Ukraine handed him back where he was killed.
Ukraine got a confession from someone whos unit saif theyd kill him anyway. Shame on ukraine, what in the world would make them want to treat russians like that???? I cant think of ANYTHING or ANY reason why Russians arent being treated like our christian neighbors. NOTHING i say!
in 9 months the regression in all aspects of Russian state/army/morals and other areas of life has reached such a level, that trying to migrate (or at the very least try to get permit to live for several months just due to the sheer abhorrence of everyday happenings) to any of CIS countries comparatively seems like a really good idea nowadays.
I dont even know how to unpack this. Ukraine exchanged a prisoner for one of their own alive soldiers. Any sane leader would do that yes.
