Side note: If a race is disproportionately affected by a bad thing... that's generally called institutional racism. The target of those reforms should be the offending institution and the bias within it, not Latinos or Black people! Minorities did not cause racism against themselves, we shouldn't act like they owe us anything if we redress those legacies of harms. You only do that shit because it's the right thing to do. Then, to survive in politics you do need votes, so... You _can_ then turn it around for your own continuity as a politician after you have real results. if an advocacy group cares about it, you message to _the advocacy group and people sympathetic to it_ about the sincere good you did. It's not pandering if you fixed a real problem and make the case why you deserve the vote after doing real stuff and hard work to earn it, and how your opponent isn't going to do that. And you should obviously understand that not every group "in that ethnicity" is going to give a shit. You message to the subset of people who give a damn.
