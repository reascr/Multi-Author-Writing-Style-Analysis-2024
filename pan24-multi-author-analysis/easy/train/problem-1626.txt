That wasn't the case in the 50s. It was basically all visual range combat using more or less the same concepts of A2A/A2G combat. Today you don't just eye ball your bomb launch. In some cases you can't even do that because there needs to be certain requirements met you have to input to the jet regarding your target before it'll even drop. You have to know how to use all these systems and even similar systems like a JDAM vs a guided bomb work very differently. Enough so you actually need training on each. It's not just a CCIP drop and the bomb does the rest. You have to know how to use the FLIR, how to set the laser up correctly for the GBU, how to input GPS coordinates to the JDAM, set launch parameters, understand the HUD symbology and a bunch of other shit which is different from jet to jet.
Yep. Ukraine already has the International Legion, so the framework is there. There are plenty of Western former military pilots who would jump at a chance to fly combat missions in a Western jet, regardless of the risks.
