All my life these people have no sense of urgency about them. They always seem to be saying “oh we wanted to do something, but the rules, they said we can’t”. YOU MAKE THE RULES, THATS LITERALLY YOUR JOB. Twice in recent memory the dems have had full control of the elected branches of government, and they barely ever manage to get anything done, then they complain they lose seats. No shit, you didn’t do anything, you dithered. And before anyone mentions Manchinema, some ruthlessness from party leaders here would be nice, maybe Brandon could take them aside and let them know how it would be real shame if perhaps, something happened to manchins yacht. You know, I can’t really protect you from these crazy protesters if you don’t support the parties agenda. Things of this nature. Maybe if the party leadership changed more than once in the last 30 years, gd.
You’re totally deflecting. This post is about Trump and how he should never hold office again. That’s the topic. You’re essentially saying ‘change the topic’. That’s not what this place is for.
