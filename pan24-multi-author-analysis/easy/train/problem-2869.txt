Dems wouldn't be trusting Reps to keep their word in what I suggested - the opposite would be true - the GOP rep votes a way we discussed, and following that when they are up for re-election, we don't run a candidate against him/her, which is important because if they cooperate with us they become less popular and we could ratfuck and run anyway but Dems aren't like that.
Is Manchin still there? Is Sinema? Then we don't have a majority. We need 52, 2 extra to make up for Manchin and Sinema, and Kamala will still have to be the tiebreaker when those two shills continue to be bought and paid for by GOP money.
Absolutely. One thing I've learned as I've gotten older is that the fight never stops. It will never stop. I'll be dust, and someone else will be fighting a fight like this, I'm sure.
