Unfortunately after a few months I was starting to feel sluggish once more. What the fuck else can I even do? Nicotine, obviously. I tried to sneak a vape at work but I felt that I'd eventually get caught and it wasn't really delivering the results I wanted. After some chemically assisted research I discovered snus. Snus is a predominantly Swedish tobacco product similar to chewing tobacco but you generally don't spit and it comes in a little pouch you tuck in your gums. Hell. Yes. I bought an American brand(Camel) to experiment. It really hit the spot. I enjoyed the tobacco and mint flavor combination quite a bit having once been a mostly menthol smoker. A few weeks later it's time to buy a new tin of snus and I notice the 7-11 has General brand snus, which is a Swedish product. I knew it was higher in nicotine and it was considered a better product so I got some.
