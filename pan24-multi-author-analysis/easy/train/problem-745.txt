I'll take NBC seriously as soon as they stop calling it "moderate" to side with the Republican party on everything from tax cuts to global corporations, to higher taxes on Americans, to blocking a public option and paid maternity leave, to blocking pharma pricing controls, and every other countless popular reform.
Absurd. Dems won every close race in Nevada except the governorship, which was pretty much bound to fail due to Sisalak's bumbling. The thing about the Democratic Party is that it allows for a variety of viewpoints. That's what it means to be liberal. The fact that moderate and more left-leaning Democrats are engaging in a healthy debate is a good thing.

The governorship was doomed, unfortunately. Of all the states affected by COVID, Nevada was the hardest to govern. And Sisolak came up short. He had a tough task, but he came up short in terms of leadership and policy. He shouldn't have run for another term.
