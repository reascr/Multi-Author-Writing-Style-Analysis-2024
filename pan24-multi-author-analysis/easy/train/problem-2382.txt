True but misleading; Kemp was not really popular, its just that people turned out specifically to vote against Abrams. Right wing media has spent the last two years making her into the boogeyman. She was a rising star in the democratic party and was easily portrayed as "the reason the republicans lost the senate" in 2020. That plus the ability to put her picture up on the screen and instantly have most of their base hate her either because she's blue or black made her into an easy national target. They wanted to cut her off at the knees after whispers started about a possible future presidential run.
Exactly. If Republicans had overturned Roe v. Wade but stuck to “Abortion should be allowed in the first trimester but only in emergencies after that,” honestly, they probably would’ve been fine. Their problem was that they immediately went ahead with all the really horrifying shit, like no exceptions for rape victims (even literal 10-year-olds), forcing women to give birth to grotesquely malformed fetuses, and even questioning whether there should be exceptions to save the life of the mother. Even your average pro-life person doesn’t like that shit.
