Because Russia is unconditionally losing and have committed thousands of war crimes in plain view, and the entire international community apart from Iran and NK can choose to continue to embargo Russian goods and services pretty much forever if they don’t.
I guess it depends on who folds first. Can Europe and the west hold together long enough for Russia to collapse? Or will Europe splinter off and start to break down? Only time will tell.
To be clear, I did not encourage the US to stoop to Russias level- political assassinations, subverting governments, committing war crimes overseas such as Syria. But I did believe the US was not heavy handed enough diplomatically and lacked the political resolve to complete conflicts by leaving the heavy lifting for military commanders to try to resolve. I argued for more involvement of the CIA to directly counter the antics of the Russian intelligence agencies and for more integration of the US Armed Forces and intelligence community to achieve countering capability to Russias “hybrid warfare”.
