The Nazarene camp was where I first discovered my love of popular music and fashion of the era (Culture Club, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Prince were all introduced to me by my new, older friends at camp, and there was definitively a New Wave/punk rock aesthetic that can be seen throughout the camp photo that I still have and cherish, which I adapted after I returned home). I learned so much there (almost none of it about religion) and I still keep in touch with some Nazarenes, who are by far the best people I've ever known in my life, even though I'm not myself religious. One of them is my former pastor from when I was a kid, and another is my friend's mom who has been like a second mother to me. They all accept me, knowing that I haven't been part of the church since I was a teen.

Everything else was complete religiously indoctrination. If people saw Muslims having camps like that they would be shut down instantly.
