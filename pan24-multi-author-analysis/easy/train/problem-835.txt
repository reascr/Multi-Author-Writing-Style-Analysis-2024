Oh! I hadn't thought much about it, but have recently seen a few different dead birds on trails I run. Pigeon, blackbird, other sparrow sized. Not something I noticed in previous years.
EDIT2: In response to the above post, apparently people want me to explain in depth how a plant converts something like and the multitudes of different compounds that a decomposing plant, compounds fixed by bacteria & fungi, and other compounds that various trophic levels of herbivore/omnivores because was not thorough enough for an ELI5.
Oh! And all of that is just in the US. In Asia in particular they flood their birds in antibiotics all the time so any illness they get is immune to our drugs. Antibiotics aren't just for killing illness, if you feed chickens antibiotics their whole life they grow larger, and faster. US farms did it until a law was passed against that shit because it creates antibiotic-resistant illness in the people who eat the eggs and birds. So if bathing them in antibiotics would help this outbreak we would see the proof in Asia. Instead their birds are getting it at an alarming rate.
