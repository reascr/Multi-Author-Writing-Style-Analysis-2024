I now weigh 130-ish, thanks to the blind luck of having had an unusually competent psychiatrist who was willing to admit their errors. Plenty of other people didn’t get as lucky with whatever the cause of their own weight problems (oftentimes, poverty is a major component…other times, metabolic disorder or severe psychological trauma).
Hey I get it. I’m also on medication. I wrig about one sixty, so not obese, but yeah, it’s difficult. I’ve managed to keep my gain at a minimum but losing is a grind. Even though I’m in chronic pain I force myself to stay active and walk every day. I cut desserts and sugar. My cholesterol is now completely normal, but I’m still overweight. And I live in Southeast Asia, surrounded by teeny tiny women. It sucks. And sometimes people are just straight up mean about weight. Thank God it’s not that often. When I weighed about 150 a couple of women were making fun of me saying why are all white women so fat in Chinese, which I kinda wish my daughter hadn’t translated. She defended me and at least they looked embarrassed. So I get it. At least state side I feel like I could blend in lol.
