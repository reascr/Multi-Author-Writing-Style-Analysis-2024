This is how Russia has always been for hundreds of years. The October revolution tried to change this but only managed to put a coat of red paint over it. This is why Russia continues to try and support the world's "second largest army" despite having an economy smaller than Italy's, and this is why Russia has been unable to join the "global community" despite thirty years of the world bending over backwards to integrate them. To a Russian fear and respect are entwined. You cannot have respect without fear. They never even considered building their economy like Germany did because they don't consider Germany respectable because nobody fears Germany. This war is happening now because, ultimately, nobody fears Russia anymore either, even the "inferior" countries that Russia has traditionally bullied.
Some shine is good. I've had good and bad shine and not all of it is "extra strenh" a lot of shine sits at the same point as whiskey around 40%-50%. Some will be stronger. Just depends on who is making it.
