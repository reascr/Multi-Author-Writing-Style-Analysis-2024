If a religion allows rape, pillage and murder it is a bad religionâ€¦and if MAGA extremists can exist in a political institution it is a bad political system. Yet where in the US political system does it stipulate that an individual may use threats and extremism to manipulate the masses for evil actions? Will you blame the culprit instead?
And probably, the major reason nobody would approve it, aside from the lack of US ability to enforce the terms ourselves, was the development of the ballistics missile program which would effectively allow them to freely develop the delivery mechanism for the nuclear weapons that they want to scortch Israel with -- which means, given their close-knit ties to Russia, North Korea, and other nuclear powered despotic regimes, that they didn't really need to independently develop nuclear warheads, they just needed to develop the delivery system for them; which is exactly what they spent their time doing (as evident by their anti jew ICBM on display in this article) with their free access to US financial systems due to sunsetting provisions on sanctions as part of the terms of the "deal.".
