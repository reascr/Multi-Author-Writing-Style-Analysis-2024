Familiar with Vancouver’s DTES as well. For many it goes: mental health problem or at least trauma leads to drug abuse leads to inability to earn a living leads to homelessness. And then all these become mutually reinforcing to the point where individuals lose the ability to make better decisions for themselves such as: seek treatment. It doesn’t matter who commissioned or produced this particular report or whether the real figure is $5B or $1B. It doesn’t matter if it’s the same or worse than Seattle. All that matters is more people all the time are falling into this inescapable trap. The numbers keep going up. So, whatever we’re doing, something has to fundamentally change. We need to stop making excuses for how things are or making pointless comparisons with other cities and do something very different.
Hahahahahahahahaaaaa what a fucking idiot. There should be a stigma around these drugs but we want to remove stigma around going to rehab and getting better. Tell me how please? Can't believe the one quote they use exposes this Gunn guy completely- think it through. If there is stigma around said drugs then there is going to be related stigma about rehab from them LMAO. With the safe drug supply and decrimilization that is what the government is trying to do - remove the stigma. Hahhaahahahah dumb fan boys please comment below, what a block head.
Inflation? Nah. A global pandemic? No way. The fact that in the past 25 years averages worker wages have only risen by 12% while CEO wages have risen by over 900%? Fuck no! The reason must be that the poorest among us are just an infection that’s spreading. Ffs.
