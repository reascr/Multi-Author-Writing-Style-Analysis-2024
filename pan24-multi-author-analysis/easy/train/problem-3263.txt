Edit: Maybe tanks are hard to hide anyway though, rendering all that unnecessary. Thinking about it more, it would be hard to sneak them around. But maybe tracking where they’re eventually stored could be valuable information? I guess in war, the smart thing to do would be to avoid taking any captured weapons/equipment to locations that are intended to remain secure or hidden, and to just use up those things first instead.
I wonder if it’s a thing to hide tracking devices deep inside tanks in case of capture, so that if the other side proceeds to use them you have important information (although they could trick you into thinking their army is somewhere else if they found out what you were doing). I feel like it probably is.
Army leadership takes money meant for producing advanced equipment and awards contracts to cheap alternatives while keeping the change, commanders request delivery for the cheap equipment that never gets produced in return for kickbacks, supply officers sell off whatever new kit does get delivered and dig out old junk from storage, armourers strip that junk of anything they can sell, and the common soldiers end up with bullet proof vests made of cardboard.
