Nope. But 5 years from now when the grid hits capacity the EU will have to either approve major nuclear projects by 2030 or accept more Russian gas. There really is no alternative, and the only thing holding it back are German taxpayers and French steelworkers. Both should be able to find agreement. Elsewhere in Europe, Ukraine has already started the process to replace it's Soviet reactors with American Gen 3 designs. Poland too. This is likely to happen since Ukraine benefits massively from using safer forms of nuclear energy, and Europe will lose if they can't articulate a similar works program within Europe's core itself.
No it is not easy. What are you talking about? There not enough parking space so there is no way someone will built enough EV charging points even slow AC. You can not use existing infrastructure like public lighting because it was not build to handle load like this. You have to built whole infrastructure from scratch. Noone was able to solve parking problem in 30 years so there is no way someone would solve charging in 7 years. This is just bad joke.
