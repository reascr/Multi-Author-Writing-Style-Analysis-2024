New Year's Eve is still the biggest celebration day in Ukraine, as far as I've heard. My family celebrates New Year's and both Christmases, and it's one of the best times of the year. It's a great reason to get together and eat, drink, and celebrate life. Might be different for families who don't like each other as much, though. xD.
Relatives and some friends in Vinnytsia, colleagues and their families/surroundings in Lviv/Uzhgorod/Mukacheve (which is most western possible), some friends in Kyiv and my whole life in Kharkiv - that's where my experience coming from. St Nicholas day is indeed used for presents (more on west, but east too) but never heard of Christmas presents in Ukraine at all.
Temporarily. It was later usurped as the main Capitalist holiday, especially in the United States. Here Christmas isn't so much Jesus as it is BUY MORE USELESS CRAP NOW! Oh, and blinkenlights, so many blinkenlights. All set to smarmy music.
Exactly. It was a calculated move to usurp existing winter solstice celebrations as a strategy of spreading Christianity. Basically, a cynical powerplay that worked.
