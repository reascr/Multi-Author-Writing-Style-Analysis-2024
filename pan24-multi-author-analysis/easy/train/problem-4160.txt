A lot of information has come to light because individuals have stepped forward, that’s not something you’d likely uncover with the background check. Santos also went by another name, Anthony Devolder. What a background check is conducted you’re generally asked if you’ve gone by any other names and expected to be honest. Well you don’t expect a politician to change their name so a lot of crazy bullshit would’ve gone unnoticed if you were doing a background check for George Santos. He also has criminal charges pending in Brazil and a background check conducted in the United States probably wouldn’t have uncovered those charges especially if they were under his other name.
You know what? Seems that nobody cares. The laws on longer mean a thing. The X President is the number one example of this and he will it seems not be charged. What does the world think? A country that prided itself on law and order has gone down this far. There Supreme Court has become a platform for the Republican Party. Just like the courts in the old USSR.
