In other words, there is not a legal obligation of the signers to get involved in the event of a war. As late as 2013 the Dept. of State maintains that the memorandum is not legally binding but is rather a political commitment. Personally, I am not aware of any change to that public understanding. It is worth noting that the Ukrainians view it as a legally binding treaty because it meets the criteria for one as specified by the Vienna Convention.
In the end, my read is that in our context today the memorandum provides legal cover for the West’s support for Ukraine. “Look, see, we agreed to provide security assurances. We are not obligated to send our own troops but anything up to that line is certainly possible… and maybe even troops too, if we want, but we are not obligated. We must honor our commitments.” Additionally, it serves as simply another piece of evidence showing that Russian violated international laws, treaties and memorandums and indeed all norms. Even American/NATO/EU/Russian operations over the past 25-30 years have not been naked land grabs like this. It is an entirely distinct animal from what we have seen in Europe/the West and its environs since the end of WWII.
Eratosthenes. Like 200 BC. Hundreds, hundreds of years before Galileo. He used shadows cast by obelisks in different parts of the world to figure out the circumference of the earth. Circumference being a property of a sphere, a round object. He was accurate to within a couple percent.
