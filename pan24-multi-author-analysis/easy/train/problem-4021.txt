Israel attacked Iraq in the early '80s, destroying their nuclear research facilities in an airstrike.
What capability? Iran is being a thorn in Israel's ass through their allies like Hezoballah, which Israel had issues trying to beat during 2006. Not to mention, Iran ranks higher in the Firepower Index.
Realistically no. Israel and Iran will probably settle this. There is 2000KM distance between Israel and the Iranian Nuclear sites. The Iranians also aren't dumb enough to make their vital targets vulnerable for Israeli or even US Airforce. Israel isn't going to fly over Iraq and Syria/Jordan without being picked up on radar and actually physically attack Iran. Both side will end up settling this on a table.
I knew a couple relatives of the Shah when I lived in Los Angeles, one of them, a middle aged man said to me, he was very upset, "do not let them get nuclear technology, they are all insane and will destroy the world" then he opened a safe behind his desk and set stacks of hundred dollar bills on his desk, made two equal piles, do not talk to anyone, I'm flying to Iran tomorrow, to give the "resistance" one of these piles of money, I'll only be gone one day, hold down the fort for me. He was back, a full day later, mission accomplished. Something is wrong with my reddit account, my user name is "SirGlenn" but this "puzzleheadedsand" has been in some of my header lines?
