My husband and I used to go to Florida, Wilton Manors fort Lauderdale Miami every year and spend between 4 and $5,000. Now we take that money to California. Palm springs is absolutely gorgeous and there's no Ron DeSantis. And besides, I am so tired of hearing, a Florida man or a Florida woman. DeSantis you might want to start doing something about crime in Florida and stop worrying about drag queens and what trans people have in their pants. Republicans and sex. All y'all want to do is look in people's pants to see what they have. As you have stated before to verify their gender. You want to marry 14-year-old girl's. You don't care if a 10-year-old gets pregnant. And you don't care how many LGBTQ youth commit suicide because of your lying hateful rhetoric! I refuse to support any state that does that. That's why when we vacation, we stay away from the south now. The people in the south, a lot of them cannot be trusted.
