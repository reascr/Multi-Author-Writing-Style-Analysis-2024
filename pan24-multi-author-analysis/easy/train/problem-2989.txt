He's a liability to any notion of democracy. Military forces interfering with civil police authority is an act of authoritarianism. Separation of powers is required to not have authoritarian rule, concentration of power is what is required for authoritarian rule. If Brazil doesn't want an authoritarian dictatorship, the military must be prevented from usurping the authority of other offices of governance and punished for attempting to usurp those powers.
We can and did. He is right the Global North only gives a fuck when it wants to military coup someone. Why should they get involved in the war? They are thousands of miles away.
What's likely to pose more of a problem is him potentially running away to Italy (where he could get citizenship at), and banking on Italy not extraditing him to Brazil (or at least really dragging their feet on it) because the Italians were pissed at Lula on a personal level, due to him blocking the extradition of Cesare Battisti, a wanted man for murder in Italy and who took refuge in Brazil, back in 2010.
No. Theres no material evidence and the spoken confessions were lies. Not to mention judges literally copying word by word sentences from each other and the bogus trial where prosecutor and judge cooperate.
