Serious answer from someone who lives right next to Russia: Russia respects power. If (and personally I hope it’s only “when”, not “if”) Ukraine wins, Russia will have a modicum of respect towards Ukraine, but only a tiny sliver because mostly they’ll believe that NATO/US basically beat them and they’ll repeat this to their people for the next 300 years.
the icing on the cake? This "left"...does not represent us young adults, AT ALL. We have been needing a different, true left option for YEARS now.
My SO's grandfather was a conscript that had been through a lot of terrifying battles, but he was later captured by American forces before everything truly went to hell for the Italians (so when the food got truly scarce, and the German soldiers started shooting at Italian allies under Nazi orders, my SO's grandfather was safely and isolated in a POW camp). He came out and decided to completely reject what everyone tried telling him (and sadly, a LOT of Italian soldiers did this as well). So my SO's aunts and uncles grew up to become right-wing pro fascists under their father's encouragement.
Anti-imperialist is just code for anti-america/anti-nato. They're completely fine with imperialism as long as it's china or russia doing it.
