Our corporations,government, and military are all " great," but the middle class is slowly being gobbled up, and the poor are growing exponentially. Our country is still doing well, but it's on a path of destruction, as without people working and actually taking pride in that work, we are doomed. Hell, my town can't even keep restaurants open because they can't find hands or at least decent hands. Our grocery stores can't stay stocked with even the most basic items. My pay has risen 35% over the last couple of years because my company is scared to lose people. It's almost impossible to find skilled hands in my profession. We were great because people worked hard, made a good living, and were proud of the life it produced. Americans seem to be proud now because " we are the greatest.".
Nuclear escalation. If air bases were placed in Ukraine, they'd be target number 1 for bombings. The next place that makes sense is in neighboring countries. Any country that does this would make themselves combatants if those hypothetical jets given to Ukraine attack Russian soil.
