Yes. I hope people keep emailing about this. They are running the most IMPORTANT industry (and the most PROFITABLE) like it's a god damn midnight shift at Taco Bell Skeleton crew.
Unfortunately no. This is on biden and the PEB. They decided that Union workers could be better compensated for not having off days by having a 24% raise. After all the good news for missing a chemo session when you have cancer is that you get paid 24% more for it. And hey you could use that money when you're dead. The fault for putting such a bad deal on the table is the biden Administration's. The fault for forcing it through is biden's. The GOP sucks because they decided not to vote for at least giving the workers a week of sick leave, but hey, they weren't the ones trying to force this. The losers here are union workers. Strike and everyone hates you. Don't Strike and your union was just shown to be toothless by congress and you've lost all leverage. What stops the companies from doing this the next time? A strike is coming because it's the only option they have left.

Capitalism has a tendency to monopolization. Yes capitalism at a lower stage their is competition, but with competition comes winner's and losers. The winners continually eat up market share and the politicians to maintain a edge in the market. Since capitalism begining we've seen monopolization, then a need for subsidization and other state assistance. If something is naturally already prone to monopolization, miles be nationalized for direct democratic control.
