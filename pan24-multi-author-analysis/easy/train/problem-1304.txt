Just out of curiosity and trying to understand some things. Why do the American people not want keystone pipeline to go through? Just on a financial perspective I think it would have been better to have it then not. I’m just going to rattle off some dirty numbers to try and figure out why it would make sense. 100$ a barrel we will start with because it’s easier If the US bought it at 100 minus exchange which is roughly 30 cents on the dollar and there was a million barrels go through it a day is roughly 300000 a day for doing nothing other than just letting it go through the line let alone the jobs and everything. Just asking I have no idea about this most of this stuff.
Correlate that against all the info and documents that have recently come out that none of the big oil companies have actually got any interest at all in actually doing anything to mitigate climate change, the fact that China wants to buy a little bit more ME oil, just seems to be one more effort to distract from that actual fuckery going on already.
It's not a bad thing at all. The only reason we cared much about the region is the oil. Absent the oil, it's not really an important part of the world anymore.
