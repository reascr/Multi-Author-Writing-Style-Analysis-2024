The half life of Uranium-235 is 703800000 years, so the -most commonly used- fission material won't even feel the passing of 50 years. (Tritium boosting is not a requirement) Obviously if the fission triggerring mechanism is of the implosion type, then uneven or possibly near complete decay of whatever explosion materials(lenses) are used would absolutely make a warhead fail to go boom, however if it's the gun type trigger, It could be quite reliable for a long time. If the engineers building the warheads made longevity a priority at the cost of slightly lower yields / warhead mass I'm rather confident reaching ridiculously long unmaintained lifespans is in fact possible. I remember reading somewhere, that there are implosion types with great longevity, where the main limiting factor of longevity is actually batteries. I imagine the Russians could manage battery replacement every once in a while (or I don't know a day before launch), even if the outside plating of the warhead is already dangerously radioactive.
There's a completely different alternative explanation. They may have used the nuclear capable platform to test the ability of delivering an actual nuclear warhead to Ukraine.
Overwhelming the missile defense and sneaking a tactical Nuclear rocket through successfully is definitely an option that they may be testing.
