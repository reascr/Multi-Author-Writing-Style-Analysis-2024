In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yawn. It’s only temporary. Anyone with a child’s common sense can tell you CRT is racist. It won’t stand, and there’s going to be a lot of people crying on command here. Get ready, I guess.
If you interpret the term charitably, it’s the belief system that the US government provides equal protection under the law to all citizens regardless of race, sex, gender, sexuality, or ethnicity, so any pandering to minority groups or promotion of minority status to change the status quo should be discouraged. A relatively non-controversial example would be racial quotas for college admissions. America (allegedly) has equality of opportunity, so racial/ethnic/sexual minorities should not get an “unfair advantage” in the college admissions process and should only be evaluated on merit.
How is this okay to bar? “That discrimination is acceptable to achieve diversity” is complete bullshit, because that undermines the very idea of freedom and equality. I get it, America in practice isn’t the most equal. But you don’t fix a housefire by setting fire to their neighbor’s house.
