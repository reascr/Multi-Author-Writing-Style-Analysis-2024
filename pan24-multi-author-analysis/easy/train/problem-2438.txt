Transistria is basically a glorified russian military base, just like Abhasia, Osetia, DNR and LNR. "Wow, suddenly we decided that we want to be separated from the country and become our own thing, while allowing russian soldiers to "keep us secure". The same trick, time and time again.
Nothing like a good war to invigorate Americas economy, and when America's economy is healthy and vigorous the west's economies are as well, would be a painful few months as supply lines adjust and populaces learn to do without some luxurious items from China but we would get into it.
Settle mate- It was a joke. The headline really just states the obvious about how Moldova feels about Russia in general. I spent 2 years there and if there is any country that desperately wants Russia to cease to exist, it is stuck in the run down and broken Soviet era Moldova. Wonderful people, horrible geographical location. Their “bad days” would break 75% of the rest of the world.
You're underestimating Russia's level of influence over Moldova's inhabitants. Many of them are so into Russian propaganda that will never listen any other thing.
