I wouldn’t exactly call student loan debt “voluntary” considering it’s mass accumulation is largely the result of a systemic failure, and to some extent malice. In much of the developed world college is either much much more affordable or outright free, with the US being the exception. This was not always the case, from the 50’s to the 70’s colleges were affordable, and many public universities were even free due to robust state & federal funding. It wasn’t until a concerted effort made by the Nixon Administration and many right-wing governors such as Reagan (when he was governor of California) to remove much of the state funding from these universities to prevent an educated proletariat and to shackle those who did go with crippling debt.
Bro what? He is talking about paying back your loans with 0 or 0.1 % interest. So that when you pay it off you basically just paid off how much you borrowed and not way more due to high interest rates. He’s not talking about paying back 0% of your loan a month lmao.
Finally a reasonable decision…. I as a taxpayer should not have to pay for someone else’s student debt. I should not have to pay for your decisions. Your education has not benefit me in anyway why should I be forced to cover it. Pay for your own shit.
