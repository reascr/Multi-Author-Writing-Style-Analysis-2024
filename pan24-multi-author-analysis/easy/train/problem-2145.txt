A half dozen other plausible candidates (5-10% of the vote) would give Trump pluralities, but 2 or 3 plus a few no-chancers (under 2% each) could give Trump some trouble.
For me, if the Republican field is Trump, DeSantis, Younkin, Haley, Pence, Pompeo and maybe a few others each with less chance than Fiorina, then Pence et al would be lucky collectively to win 10%. The question is how DeSantis, Youngkin and Haley would split the remaining non-Trump vote. If DeSantis either beats Trump early on (dunno about Iowa, because it depends on who shows up to the caucuses; New Hampshire likes being surprising, so I figure DeSantis would have a real shot at beating Trump) or is within 5% of Trump, then by the evening of the South Carolina primary all the other candidates better be willing to drop out and endorse DeSantis.
Yeah. He opposes legal marijuana (we're an island as it's legal in every state we border and Canada.) Despite that he remains popular here. He's not a far right nut job but he does play footsie with them (and I think he recently said he'd support trump should trump win the nomination, much like the other so called sane Republican Larry Hogan.).
Republicans cannot cooperate in a community action problem. To be a Republican is to think you're the main character, and everyone else is here for you. The GOP primary is "crabs in a bucket".
