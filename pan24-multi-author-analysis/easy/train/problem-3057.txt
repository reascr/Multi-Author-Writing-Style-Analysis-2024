To put that in perspective, I trained with LAV's, and the basic course at Combat School was three months. That course is the first of three, though training never really ends. There's training to use the vehicle. Training to use it in a unit of others. Training to use it in combined arms with Infantry and Artillary...the list goes on. Basically, the Ukrainians are cramming all that into one course and then going to war.
Right now, soldiers are being moved between Ukraine and Europe for training. That training is ranging between 7-11 weeks depending on what they are training on.
Exactly. It seems cold to us peons, but it's a legitimate consideration in what one of my favorite commentators calls "the big international poker table where everyone is cheating.".
Their logistics are completely fucked, their command structure is antiquated and they clearly have no plan other than resorting to terrorism by randomly bombing civillian infrastructure.
I really hope so. If a Republican takes the White House in 2024 or they have a majority in Congress, the US might not be helping out for very much longer.
