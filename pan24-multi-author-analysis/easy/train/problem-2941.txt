But of course the owning class can't just take the L that comes with scoring an own goal, the workers still have to be the ones loosing out, therefor inflation as a method of nullifying necessary wage increases is the preferred method of dealing with the situation, and private for-profit media pushes this as a narrative to justify the fed raising rates and causing a depression.
Thanks for the reminder to cancel my NYT sub. You have to contact them to do so, either by phone or by chat, which is aggressive of them. (It allows them to try and Save The Sale).
It's more because the only acceptable cure to inflation in a free-market austerity framework is for the fed to raise rates, which makes lending money more expensive, which means less investment and will thereby depress wages - which is the kind of thing you need when you are part of the owning class and you just lost a couple of millions of workers to god awful management of a pandemic and taught hundreds of millions of others that you, in fact, do not care whatsoever if they live or die.
This is hardly new either. Trump got elected because of this same stuff. We'd have Democratic majorities if the networks didn't play the bothsideism game.
