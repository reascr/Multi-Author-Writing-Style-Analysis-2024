This is so unnecessary The charity currently helping her has calculated that she will need 70k/year to provide for herself and her children. My husband and I have yet to make that amount per year as a couple, I don’t know how she’s about to do it as a single mother Especially when considering the accommodations she will need from a workplace so she can drop off and pick up her kids. She’s already had to turn down what could’ve been a good job for this specific reason. It’s completely unrealistic and unreasonable to expect any person to be able to do this without some kind of assistance in todays work landscape. If these states want to force people to have babies they need to offer assistance for those that will have difficulty providing for said baby. But that’s too much like right…I feel for this woman and hope that she can find a job where they are understanding of the demands of a single mom.
