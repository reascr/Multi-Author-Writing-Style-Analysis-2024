Caring about yourself and caring about things that affect you aren’t the same thing. Preventing others from doings things that conservatives don’t agree with is more accurate. “I don’t like gays so you can’t be gay, I don’t like abortions so you can’t do it, I don’t like that book so you can’t read it, etc etc etc.” They are the party of control because it helps them split the other side. It’s politically advantageous of them to find an issue like trans rights to be against because they can split leftist voters between terfs and progressives. It’s the only way they can win.
You mean they regard themselves as individuals, not a generalization based on people living in their own bubble assuming that the Hispanics that live in their bubble are the same as the ones that live in that bubble just because they are both identified in the census as Hispanic?
I wish. Let texans see what it is like to need a passport to visit the US. Let them see what it is like having to deal with Washinon on international trade policy. They will starve and die without the money from the federal government. Look at their power grid, it is completely fucked and one storm away from a disaster again. Fuck texas!
