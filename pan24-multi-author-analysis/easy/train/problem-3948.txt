This reminds me of one of the areas where I will argue heavily against the "both parties are the same" people. There are many issues that exist across the aisle, but at the end of the day, we cannot expect Republicans to root out, call out, or even pretend to care about corruption in their own party. Here in NYS, our governor was forced to resign after his own AG investigated him and found he had a long history of sexual harassment. The Democrats had a supermajority in the legislature and made it clear they would impeach and remove him if he didn't resign. Meanwhile we have people like the above in DeSantis' admin, the Texas AG is putting off charges for his own crime. The (South Dakota I think) AG is doing the same. It's wild how they do this openly and completely lack accountability.
But seriously. Serial killer fiction code names, like calling Mike Pence "Norman Bates". These people are fully aware of being scumbags.
