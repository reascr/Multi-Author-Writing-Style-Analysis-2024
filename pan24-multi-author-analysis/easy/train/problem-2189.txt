The interesting thing here is that endorsed resolution includes Russia pulling back to "internationally agreed borders", which indicates that the US and its allies will also support pushing Russia out of the annexed regions rather than just stopping fighting in region.
Is it? You know what influences things? Politics. The fact that there is no direct impact of this is not relevant. Just simple mind would expect something like that from this.
The measure also "reiterates its demand that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, and calls for a cessation of hostilities.".
That’s not surprising really, while the initial annexation of Crimea was something western states were willing to begrudgingly accept, there’s a clear fear that letting Russia keep anything past the 1991 border sets the precedent that a country can invade another and then still keep what it manages to hold onto come peace negotiations. For a group of countries so focused on conserving the relative peace of the last few decades that’s not acceptable, so I wouldn’t be shocked if NATO holds firm that Russia not gain anything.
