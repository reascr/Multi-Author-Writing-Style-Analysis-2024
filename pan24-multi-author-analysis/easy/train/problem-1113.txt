For a lot of people, some of these rules would really help them out even more than the free 10K-20K and would stop the money bleed that has been happening exponentially to students. I remember marching at UCLA because our registrations went from 1K to 2K a quarter in the 90s. My niece is going to college and it costs her 15K a quarter. This predatory lending to young people is not right. It might not be the perfect solution or "fair" to people who worked hard to pay their debt off or chose careers that were in demand instead of following their passion or chose to go to community college or chose a college in-state, made other sacrifices, but something needs to be done and at least this helps the working and middle class instead of all the money that goes to the rich like PPP loans and tax cuts for the rich.
Dude. I start at a new job on Wednesday. Iâ€™ve been out of work for a few years. Now when I start working, my student loan payments will start up again at around $700 per month. Between that and the cost of health insurance, there goes pretty much my entire pay.
