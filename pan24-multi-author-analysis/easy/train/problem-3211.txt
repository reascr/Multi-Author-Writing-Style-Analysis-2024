Formerly known as Richard DeStaard, a mechanical engineer and racer who dared to think outside of the box, devising unconventional propulsion methods that were deemed “unsafe” and “in violation of multiple international treaties” by small-minded bureaucrats and sycophants.
Yup. Exactly. As an American I have been the “enemy” and the “threat” to hundreds of millions of people who never even entered my mind as friends or enemies. Castro in Cuba, the Kim dynasty in N Korea, the old Soviet Union, Maduro in Venezuela, Saddam in Iraq, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the theocracy in Iran, etc. All these governments use the USA’s “impending threat” to keep their people in line. The US has in fact gotten involved militarily overseas, but these actions were not simple matters of territorial expansion. The Russians are convinced that we crave their boundless mineral wealth, but this is a myth. The US produces far more oil than Russia and their southern neighbors in the Middle East could simply open the tap a little more and drown everyone in petroleum. Gold, diamonds, rare earth metals, all can be found all over the world - and we haven’t really started looking in many area. Russians are intensely proud of the sheer size of their country and assume that’s what “The West” is hungry for. Just not true. But I always say it is easier and more satisfying to believe a simple tale that makes you happy than deal with the truth. I call it the Walt Disney effect.
Authoritarianism relies on violent coercion and blind slavish loyalty, instead of co-operation and trust between actors.
