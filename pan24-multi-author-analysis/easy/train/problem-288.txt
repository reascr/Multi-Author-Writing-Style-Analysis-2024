I’m not sure about where you’re at, but in the Detroit area Meijer/Kroger employees who are UFCW make way more than Walmart employees. They also receive better healthcare, benefits, and a retirement. I mean in your area at what costs do they pay workers more? You can make double but have shitty healthcare, no benefits, and no retirement. They also have no voice in their workplace and can be fired at anytime for no reason. I mean is that starting wages? I know when I became an IBEW Union Electrician I left a Non union Electrical Contractor to join the IBEW and I was actually making less in my hourly rate. Now I make $50+/hour in my hourly rate and Non union Journeyman electricians top around $38/hour. I also have health, dental, and vision at now cost to me. I have a traditional pension plan and a 401k with a great match. I had none of that stuff working Non union Electrical. I cleared $132k this year my buddy a non union journeyman cleared $82k and we nearly worked the same amount of hours. So it’s a trade off you may be getting paid more upfront but are you really?
Republicans rarely actually boycott anything. They got mad at Starbucks and the profits didn't sour. They got all pissy about the NFL but the Super Bowl is the most watched TV show year after year.
