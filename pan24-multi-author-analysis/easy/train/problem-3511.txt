It's to twist Biden's arm to approve the Predator drone UAV sale as proposed by General Atomics. Which is fully justified as most of Congress supports military aviation for Ukraine, the only thing stopping it is Biden. If Biden refuses, Ukraine can then solicit planes from France or Germany which would be a much bigger boost to their aviation industries, compared to the US. The recent approval of long-range missiles matter, as if Ukraine proves they can handle such weapons maturely and in a non-escalatory manner the US will approve manned strike aircraft capable of far more aggressive operations.
By "maturely" I mean using such weapons exclusively against Russian military targets within occupied regions, munitions depots, and not bombing Putin's palace in Sochi or rail infrastructure within Russia.
He's corrupt. He's also doing the job badly and carelessly since obviously he's focusing on stealing rather than effectively negotiating for the benefit of the people he is supposed to be helping.
Haven’t heard that before. Like a lot of famous gaffes it’s usually the perception and other contexts at the time that end up carrying it. IIRC Bush was in a flight suit too, a lot of pageantry.
