I’ll believe there’s hope he’ll face consequences when I watch the clipped news footage from DTJs verdict being read. Not a second before, because he’s already slipped away too many times. He’s bankrupted several failed business ventures, got the school he opened shutdown for fraud, campaign finance violations, nepotism in his administration, corruption, more fraud, inviting a foreign power to influence elections, blackmailing a foreign power to attack political opponents, intentionally bungling the federal response to a global pandemic to punish political opponents, inciting violence and sedition. He’s fucking untouchable. Literally any one of these crimes would have landed me in a federal supermax, but he walked through all of it and came up smelling like roses. Became he’s rich and white. and that hasn’t changed, so why should this one be any different?
Exactly. The GOP and the libertarian billionaires don’t like that Trump wants to swoop in at the last minute and benefit from all of their hard work.
Interesting strategy. Turn on trump to play the "see we're unbiased" card, while at the same time giving ammo to take down the biggest threat to conservatives 2024. Transparent, but clever in a nation of morons.
