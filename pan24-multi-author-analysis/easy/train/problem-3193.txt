I think it begins with accepting death is final and no one escapes it. It's simple on paper but it gets harder to wrap a human brain around it as one ages. Maybe at some point it gets easier, I dunno how it could though. I think religion's primary purpose is to address fear of death, and an otherwise benign message was co-opted by people who saw opportunities to exploit people for personal gain (for thousands of years).
I get why they are. It's easy to put the blame on something other than ourselves. We have great capabilities for good and evil, but we, humanity, are to blame for both; not some religion.
My core point, which I believe I may have strayed from (and I apologize for that), is that people have a great capability for good or evil and religion is simply a tool for either. To blame religion for evil in the world is like blaming cars for car accidents. Religion is a tool to explain the unknown, give purpose, and connect people. Unfortunately, that can be used in very negative ways too.
