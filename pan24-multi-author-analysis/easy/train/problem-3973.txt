Trying to find an excuse to ease the extremely unpopular and strict Covid measures in China without admitting the CCP was ever in the wrong. As in “well these measures were necessary for the original Covid but it’s mutated so now these measures aren’t needed for this new one”.
Really ? Isnt it obvious ? Rename the virus, claim zero covid was succesful, vacinate campaign for the new virus, stop zero covid, ???, LOTS AND LOTS of profit.
It's actually interesting how bad their communication has been with this, anti-vaccine memes are apparently pretty common on their social media, and considering how much they attempt to curate what views are acceptable in their population, and what views are allowed online, it's weird they haven't cracked down on it more.
No, it is not. Current COVID strains are about as lethal as COVID has ever been, if not more so. The difference now is that people have vaccine protection, natural protection from catching it before, doctors have more/better knowledge on how to handle it, etc.
