I agree. I doubt Biden would sign any right-wing legislation that comes out of the house anyway, much less any of it getting past the Democratic Senate. MGT will only be powerful in the GOP and have no power to pass laws. And when she starts her endless conspiracy-laden pointless investigation of Hunter Biden and the Biden administration, the Dems should take a page out of her party's playbook and ignore any congressional subpoena. I doubt Merrick Garland will prosecute contempt of Congress charges against Biden Cabinet secretaries or staff when he barely held any Republicans who ignored Congressional subpoenas legally accountable.
Why why why?? Why HER? What is she bringing to the table that is so special? Is it just if shes on McCarthy's side he feels he still has the trump base on his side? Cause a bunch of them like Gaetz hate him.
