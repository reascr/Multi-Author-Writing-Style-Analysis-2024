In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
That's interesting. And if it is actually the case at hand and not a hypothetical, that would make sense. If a Trans woman were diagnosed with prostate cancer they should know. For all the wishes in the world, if your life is on the line you should swallow your pride and face some objective biological facts so you have the best fighting chance possible.
Mexico isn't interested. Abbott showed his cards and Mexico called his bluff. For every moronic move the limp leadership of Texas has made, Mexico has countered at Texas' expense. The billion dollar grifter wall that's less than a couple years old is collapsing (tax payer money went to the contractors instead of building/maintaining it), the shipping routes where DPS was instructed to harass truckers has been moved to New Mexico, costing hundreds of millions in lost taxes and increased product costs to Texans, and so on and so forth. Texans must love being shit on, though... they voted him right back in.
