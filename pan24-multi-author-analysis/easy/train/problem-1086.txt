Real world corporations are a legal framework to create jobs and a living. Anyone that compares that to the government and their mafias building buildings illegally that get people killed are just not being realistic. The companies that get away with it are linked to Erdogan's government, they aren't a regular construction company taking pride in their work as builders. If you go talk with a large swathe of builders you'll realize that most of them want to be proud of their work, and most are organized in corporations. They want good marketing, good reviews, and safety is part of that. Erdogan's party's mindset is to loot as much as possible from anyone that doesn't support their view of the world. These guys work hand in hand with ISIS and other jihadist groups. They're murderous savages looking to genocide Kurds and Armenians, and kill anyone who isn't Muslim enough. Don't compare small business with that. Big corporate greed like Dole and their coups are bad but never caused this much damage over this amount of time. Hundreds of deaths for greed vs thousands, millions for government cronyism and ideology.
Exactly! A major catastrophe happened, and if the politicians of the last 30 years had done their jobs, tens of thousands of lives could've been saved.
Fascinating. The Americans do something similar as well with their lobbying system, essentially allowing an avenue of legalised bribery. So, what youâ€™re saying is that the Chinese system works by functioning above the table rather than under it, with corruption kept on check by officials looking to cover their asses by refusing the potentially career-ending requests.
