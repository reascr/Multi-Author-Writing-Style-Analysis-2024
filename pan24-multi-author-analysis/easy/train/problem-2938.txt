I can assure you Turkey will know what the purpose is and it is ousting them without ousting them which was your entire point. You even say “they won’t be getting a damn thing.”.
These indivduals are not ”Special” they simply have certain rights in Finland and Sweden, rights which protect stuff like free speech, dignity and the rule of law, many of these accused terrorists are just Erdogans political opponents or journalists, if anyone of them has commited real terrorism they should of course be punished, but how many of them have actualy been involved in that? Probably a very few amount if any. So it makes sense that they would not just extradite these people. Imagine if the US demanded Turkey to send a bunch of journalists and polticians to america so they could be punished in american prisons for being critical of the US current administration, it would be madness.
Where are you getting this from? Turkey has had to deal with plenty of Russian hostility in the past, why wouldn’t they want more allies against them?
