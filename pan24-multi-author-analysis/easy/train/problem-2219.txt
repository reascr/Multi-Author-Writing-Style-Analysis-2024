For that matter Cruz's middle name is Edward and "Ted" is a common nickname for that. He's being going by Ted since he was a kid because Rafael is also his father's name. I can imagine being a kid in pre ninja turtle times would also mean a boy with a name like "Rafael" would probably get the shit kicked out of him in America. In any event I don't think either one of them were playing the long con as kids somehow knowing they were going to get into right wing politics.
They both have been going by their middle names since they were kids, I don't think they were playing the long con knowing they would eventually enter right wing politics. Ted's father was already Rafael and having a name like that pre Ninja turtles would likely lead to getting the shit kicked out of you in elementary school. So he went by a nickname of his middle name Edward. It's not like he changed his last name to "Cruise".
Exactly. And also let's not forget that Trump told a group of American Jews that "Netanyahu is your Prime Minister", like wtf?
