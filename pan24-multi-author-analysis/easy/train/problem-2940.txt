It depends, Ukraine needs their engineers working on their equipment during the war so they won't have many to send to other countries where they might need to stay for a couple of years learning a jet, I say couple of years because these jets are extremely complex and Ukraine have no experience with that line of jets, this also includes sending pilots to train on the systems as well.
That just sounds dumb. By your own definition. You just stated there's no scandal, period. And you accuse me of not "reading up on it", without providing sources to read up on. And then follow up with an insult. Typical for people who have no constructive argumentation, just bias, emotions and complete ignorance of the subject being discussed . Hey, why don't YOU read up on it! lol.
The issue with f-16 isn't just training pilots (thought that is another issue) but maintaince and repair for the jets, it isn't something that can be learned within a few months and could take a few years with working experience on them before you could effectively work on them especially in a war zone where getting the parts you need could be hard due to logistics.
Guess what chief? Ukrainians are fighting for their land regardless. Providing them with the means to defend their land is not only just, it is logical. Without it, Russia would steamroll through Ukraine. But it hasn't.
