Imagine getting a cancer diagnosis (and who knows what else he has) and instead of wanting to spend more time with family and/or enjoying your last months, weeks or years but choosing to use your remaining time to cause more pain and destruction. If there is a hell Putin is definitely on the VIP list.
Kim was actually interesting. She was well-spoken and personable. Kanye, on the other hand, was very cringey and hard to watch.
I'm not ok with how the system is now, it is totally unfair and very talented and smart people get lost due to many detrimental factors, education is hard to access, you need money for it and nobody gives you a place to stay and money to survive unless you have rich parents, and if you educate yourself via the internet it is not enough cause you still need papers obtained only in the places where you give money. So overall a very unfair disadvantage to people with low income, it's how the system is done in order to keep a steady income of slaves. There is a far longer road for those without money and it's not fair, it puts limits on people. No matter how fast you run, you will still have a longer distance to run then someone with money, if you both run just as fast you will still be miles behind. It's how it is it's how the world works, there are no stupid people unless they have a genetical disease, only poorly trained, brainwashed and overall unlucky.
Zelensky clearly believes otherwise. He's pretty well informed. Many analysts assume the successor would either cynically embrace defeat and blame Putin for everything, or even be a left wing revolutionary.
