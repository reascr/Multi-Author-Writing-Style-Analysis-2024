You can definitely apply that logic nationwide and look at the Senate. Even though the Senate is basically split down the middle, GOP power is over represented considering states like Wyoming have a total of 500,000 people and a city like New York has 8 million people. The NYC area that's probably a couple hundred square miles has 14-15x more population than Wyoming and that's just one city. That's not even the entire state. Yet, those two votes from a giant landmass, but empty state like Wyoming can muck up the entire Federal government with filibuster nonsense if it wanted to. Or it can give its overrepresented voting power to jam in three absolutely horrendous choices for the supreme court that can go ahead and start paving the way to make conservative culture war stuff a reality.
Exactly. That's exactly the type of thing the article was meant to address. Especially when a minimum wage ballot initiative won in 2020, somehow Biden lost the state by a bunch.
Absolutely. I've always said Beto would make a great Democratic candidate in another state, but in Texas, he's too progressive. Even if I think it's correct that gun control should be in place, considering even Uvalde county with everything that's happened ultimately voted majority for Greg Abbott, you can see how being on the wrong side of the gun issue is why Beto lost.
