Iâ€™m entirely unmotivated to engage with anyone who refuses to engage honestly with the topic at hand. Yeah, sure, the headline is sensationalized. Big deal.
The smear campaign was conducted by a conservative "dark money" group called the American Accountability Foundation and is an offshoot of the Conservative Partnership Institute which was founded by Jim DeMint, a former Republican politician, former president of the Heritage Foundation, and a leading figure of the Tea Party movement.
It's kind of a click-baity head line. it seems like the story here had more to do with who benifits from the smear campaign rather than the actual smears. But calling her out for working for an organization that recognizes people who advocate for equitable access to internet services and net-neutrality kinda tips their hand. The fact that this person happens to be a dominatrix just gives some folks an excuse to clutch their pearls.
