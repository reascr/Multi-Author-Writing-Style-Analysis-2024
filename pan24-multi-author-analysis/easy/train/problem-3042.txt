Let’s see who will be right in some years. I don't believe mass media, especially in war times. Did you saw those chambers? The people operating in them? You don‘t think they wouldn't take their torture devices with them, no? Also, why does Ukraine not let Amnesty International investigate nowadays? At the beginning of the war, yes. Now, not so. Maybe because they won't fit their narrative. Won't find what those professional Ukrainians finding there solely for Propaganda. You think the Russians are the only ones responsible for Propaganda? Like I said, it‘s war, don’t expect no one to be civil. There’s no humane war.
Demographically speaking you are correct but the age disproportion very likely causes economic problems; not enough young people working for the number of elders needing pensions, medical attention and overall services.
Wow. Medical? Can I surrender to Ukraine? I know that Russians will be trying to blow me and utilities will be off a lot, but that's fine, it'd be worth the medical.
