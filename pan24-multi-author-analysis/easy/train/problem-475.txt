I would love to see states do just the opposite in that a person cannot run for one office when they have not yet finished the term in the office that they currently hold. This would force them to either hold off running for a new office or they would have to resign their current office to run for the next. But I know that hell will freeze over before this would happen since politicians are self-serving at their core.

Seriously congress... election reform. And a comprehensive congressional/court ethics package (to include term limits). Gun reform. Bank/wall street reform. Corporate reform. Education department COMPLETE overhaul.
And can at times kinda create more problems than it's worth. Then you get an appointee in a position that isn't a person the voters choose.
Not that there's ever perfect answers I've way or the other but i generally dislike having an unelected person in an electable office.
