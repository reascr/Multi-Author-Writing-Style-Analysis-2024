Casual searching a company still in existence today that has been continuously operating since 578 CE. It is not beyond question that it wasn't the first ever in the world and others existed and we're dissolved in the centuries before. (Human civilization - meaning evidence of order like laws, religious rituals, or structures for common good - has existed since about 10000 BCE - over 12000 years ago. The record is a bit light on how they handled ownership and resources for most of it.).

Exactly. This is a very unsympathetic defendant, but this is a rather benign legal argument about state court jurisdiction.
Significantly so. Turns out, bribery works quite well when you aren't limited to how much you can donate to a political campaign. Adding a simple 0 or two to an offer can sway a lot of minds.
Jurisdiction is super important. I don't care about the wrong you are addressing or how sympathetic I am to your claims, if the court can't grant the relief you seek, the case must be dismissed.
