Look up cartel executions in mexico using dogs to eat the victim alive or village executions in some parts of sub-saharan africa where victims are partially dismembered and set on fire.
Yes. To other people. But traditionally the type of person who signs up to be a warfighter-for-money is also the type of person that prioritizes self-preservation above all else. And hammer executions for innocuous interviews can be discouraging to that sort of self-preservation impulse.
Agreed. It's mostly cartel shit, although I'm not too sure what the story was behind this. But they definitely were experienced.
They donâ€™t. And when it does rarely happen, there are significant consequences, although there have been disappointing outcomes of some high-profile court martial trials. But to compare this to say, Russia, which has no semblance of recourse for these sort of things is ridiculous. And OP was right, in many paramilitary conflicts around the world there is no concept of human rights or rules of engagement and no oversight.
