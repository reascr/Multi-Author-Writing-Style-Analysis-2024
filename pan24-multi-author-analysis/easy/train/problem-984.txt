I don't disagree with DeSantis on this one, though this specific issue is a SCOTUS issue which is supposed to be apolitical. Something obviously has to be done to add repercussions to prevent blatant repeated abuses of the media, tabloids, and fringe journalism. The burden being on the victim vs. the companies' long-term track record is probably part of the problem. The long-term societal damage from "entertainment news" passing themselves off as factual journalism should be quite blatant, especially when there's no requirement or easy ability for a user to 'audit' the long-running accuracy of a publication.
Man I love this guys ideas! We should also round up all the Jewish people and collect them in one place, concentrating them. Then we can put gay people and trans individuals in another concentrated area. Thereâ€™s a few other undesirable folks we could gather up just in case./s.
