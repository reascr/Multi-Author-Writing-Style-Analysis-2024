Hard to hit 20% EV rate in Canada if there are no EVs to buy in Canada. My parents tried to buy a PHEV Toyota Rav4 and were told there was a six year waiting list. Yes, six YEARS. They settled for a PHEV Hyundai Tuscon, and they were told it would be maybe a year and a half.
vancouver island? so you have driven past nanaimo how many times since you moved there? 0 times i bet. Just because you don't go anywhere does not mean no one wants to.
Internal combustion engines are a mature, reliable technology. I have already stated how IC cars can be made significantly more efficient. What exactly is the point of disrupting our current model for a solution that has at least as many drawbacks? I mentioned weight and the toxicity of the batteries, but there is also the charging time and the decrease in capacity of the batteries with use. It makes zero sense to me.
Cool now mandate a countrywide mass restructuring of everything we know about the automobile industry, build electric vehicle charging stations, strips on the highway that either charge or negate some of the battery usage..Tesla got a decent battery but that company is going down the drain, so maybe license it from Musk or just take it from him.. just basically flip the whole motherfucker on its head.. yeah sure 2026 seems plausible, I don't know it's almost like you need the infrastructure to make the EVs feasible to drive...I'm just not seeing this till at least 2030.
What's a GV? I'm pointing out that the CO2 from electrical power generation is going to go up with the rise in electric car use. Probably quite significantly as we exhaust all the possible dam sites.
