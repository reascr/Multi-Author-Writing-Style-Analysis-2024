So in summary, authorities made sure there were enough loopholes to allow the bankers and the government to make money with Russia. All while thousands of Ukrainians die in part due to this blood money. Wow.
Back to your point about neutrality being neither good or bad (which isn't really isn't supported by this paper), I think it can be widely understood that supporting an invading country, whether through broad economic means or more direct means (such as transporting munitions, resources of war) would be a "bad" thing. All parties want the war to end. The conditions of ending the war is that Russia stops doing what it's doing, and a large part of that relies on them running out of resources (since they're the aggressors). Since economic sanctions are so important to this strategy, being "neutral" is clearly antithetical to peace since it supplies the Russian war machine, and "bad" for the world community.
Art. 8. A neutral Power is not called upon to forbid or restrict the use on behalf of the belligerents of telegraph or telephone cables or of wireless telegraphy apparatus belonging to it or to companies or private individuals.
