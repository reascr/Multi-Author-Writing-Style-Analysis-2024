Why would anybody with a permanent seat ever support that? Hate how it works as much as you’d want, but the UN’s primary purpose is to provide a neutral space to engage in diplomacy, and more importantly try to get major powers to play along with it. If major powers can have their special status revoked by the UN simply starting a new UN Security Council, then major powers will simply leave altogether.
Probably. But China also knows this and can therefor use it as leverage against both the west and Russia to extract concessions. As ultimately, China will decide whether Russia remains part of the security council, not Russia.
E. Destabilization. Russia has been spreading chaos everywhere they go, and more importantly allowing this conflict to happen is immensely destabilizing. It would mean we would return to the 1800s/early 1900s where every country can take what they want with zero repercussions. Mass war. Additionally Russia has openly stated they want everything from Lisbon to Northern California. They won’t stop.
