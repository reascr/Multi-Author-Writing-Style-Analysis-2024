Genuinely, I pride myself as having a pretty iron stomach and like traveling to more remote tiny areas, and had some crazy street food in places like Vietnam, Philippines- but my god I've never been taken out until I went to India.
2. The Indian nation supports this community, through state-run market places, that buy agricultural products are government set prices. (The government often takes losses within this market, but the price floors and the government's promise to buy surpluses means the government has to dump surpluses overseas at a loss.).
Why should developed countries get to enjoy the benefits of unfettered industrial development, but India and developing countries shouldn't?
1. India has a HUGE population of small-holding farmers, who are also heavily indebted and who live in a perpetual cycle of poverty.
No? Great, then they can and should continue as the please. The nation has a right to progress through the stages of economic development just as every developed nation before it.
Are you going to fork over the trillions of dollars needed for the country to bypass the industrial stage of development entirely? Are you going to fund them to replace their factories with clean ones, at your own cost?
