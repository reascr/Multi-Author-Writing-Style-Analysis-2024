It's also entirely possible that Elon is pro-putin because he is a fascist bigot. Constantly tweeting /pol/ memes, which is 4chan's fascist image board. Dude is constantly manifesting hate against trans people. Probably wants to fire up the ovens in the US.
Maybe ironically using Elons's own system of announcements, 12 days of tweets, each day a new country official, starting from small to big tweeting "X government is considering amending or revoking starlink communication licence over Ukraine service decisions, we cannot allow communication infrastructure to be waved around with decisions by a single person".
No, not at all. Please read the article. Starlink is critical to Ukrainian communications and the ONLY objection has been "please don't use our satellites for long-range drone attacks.".
Terminals generally don't fall under the USML/ITAR unless they are actually integrated with a military system. This is like saying that a GPS receiver or a cell phone could be ITAR if someone uses it in a war zone. That's not really how it works. There is no risk here of this being deemed ITAR. Musk is just being a piss baby, like usual.
