NPD is a mental health condition, being a narcissist isn't. We only diagnose something as a mental health disorder when it inherently causes distress to the individual. If someone's narcissistic behaviour is working out for them, or their perception is still so fucked that they cant tell that their narcissism isn't working out for them, than it doesn't meet the criteria to be a mental health disorder. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a classification specifically for the people who realize they have a problem but are experiencing distress from struggling to adjust their behaviour. This gets fuzzy when people mis self-diagnose their narcissistic collapse as depression and seek treatment for depression. But generally a narcissist who is still endorsing their grandiosity is not considered mentally ill on the grounds of narcissism.
