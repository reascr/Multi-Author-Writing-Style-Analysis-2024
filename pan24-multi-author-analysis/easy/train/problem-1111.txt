There's no way the western equipment ends the war. It might lead to a scenario where they can starve southern Ukraine and Crimea of resources if they can cut a swath to the sea and bomb the bridge connecting Crimea and Russia (say with F-16s), but the Donbas is going to continue to be a massive slog for both sides.
Yes. We invaded Mexico after Americans crossed the us-Mexico border illegally, fomented a revolt in a Mexican border state, declared independence and then when the Mexican army came to put down the revolt, the white revolutionaries called on the us to invade Mexico to protect them which the us then did. Sound familiar?
OH NO Would you look at that Russia started a war special military operation with Ukraine a year ago, has been asking Belarus to help, then a year in when the Russians aren't doing well the "Ukrainians" wisely mount an unprovoked attack on Belarus for what I'm sure are good and believable reasons thus causing Belarus to have to enter the war special military operation aiding Russia!
5. An excuse to justify Russian troops in Belarus AND to keep Ukrainian forces where they are to pull defenses from where Russia wants to conduct offensives.
