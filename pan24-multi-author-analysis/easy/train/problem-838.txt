My electronic devices died by 19-30 and so I decided my only option at this point is to go to sleep as there's not much I can do in the dark. Woke up half-an-hour ago. Still no electricity, no idea what time it is. Used gas stove to make some tea. And as I sat at my kitchen table and unpacked pakhlava that I bought on my way home, electricity got back online. I thought it was 3 or 4 am, but apparently it is not even midnight! I haven't been so time-lost in like forever lol. Btw, home internet is still not back, but at least mobile hotspot works well.
Obviously offensive supplies. I know that this subject will lead to absolutely nothing, at least at this point. And it will be criticised in the face of “fear of escalation”.
Most electronic watches will last a year or two on battery, but if you want full self sufficience you can look for a solar powered one (Casio will have a variety), or if you wanna go fancy there's the option of a Garmin solar smartwatch(your friends in the army tend to use those), like the Instinct or Fenix(the former is simpler but has advertised unlimited time without charging if in power saving mode and exposed to the sun regularly).
