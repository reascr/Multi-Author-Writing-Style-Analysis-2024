22 months ago, DOJ should have simply arrested him and charged him under 18 U.S. Code § 1703 says: (a) Whoever, being a Postal Service officer or employee, unlawfully secretes, destroys, detains, delays,….the delivery of mail. Everything he did to destroy the USPS fits nicely into this FELONY. What was so hard about doing that?
My FedEx and UPS deliveries are always on time, and sometimes early, but I hate using FedEx and UPS because FedEx is dog shit at making sure my packages are in one piece, or even delivered to my house and not my next door neighbors, and UPS only delivers residentially late in the afternoon here, and I work nights. My area isn’t known for porch pirates, it’s usually pretty quiet, but a 30 minute walk takes you to “the bad part of town” where meth heads and gang bangers tend to hang around, and every now and then, I see a meth zombie walking or riding an obviously stolen bike down my street at night when I get home. I don’t trust for a second they won’t take my shit if my car isn’t parked out front.
