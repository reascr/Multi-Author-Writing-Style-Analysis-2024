Even if you somehow passed laws that 100% eliminated mass shootings (ignoring that that is impossible) you will have only stopped a small portion of gun crimes. If we insight that any gun law not disproportionately affect minorities, we wonâ€™t pass any. The unfortunate reality is that while most mass shootings (and suicides) are committed by whites, other gun crimes are disproportionately committed by minorities, largely due to poverty levels.
I live in Ohio. I sold one of my two guns yesterday (didn't sell the other because I simply wouldn't have got enough for what the utility of it is worth to me in terms of the possibility of ever hunting or target shooting with family) because I just don't see a need to own one anymore. Used to think the militia types around here were dangerous, but after seeing them do jack shit to any of the bigwigs in that train company, Dewine and his corrupt ilk, or even Trump earlier this week, I now know for sure that they're absolute chickenshits who will never rise up to the occasion. I had nothing to be afraid of from the very beginning, they're all bluster. It was a good lesson learned and the shop gave me exactly what I was looking for price-wise.
