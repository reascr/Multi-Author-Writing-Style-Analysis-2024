Yes, Putins regime throws a little money at corrupt western politicians, he then claims to have influenced any outcome that destabilised the west. He doesn’t mention the failures.
Well the glorious Tory politicians the UK had seemingly burned or attempted to burn every possible bridge with the EU, the probable future Labour government is wanting the Tory vote so they’re pretending to be anti-Brexit so that’s a nope (but at the very least they’ll be easier to deal with) and I’m not knowledgable on how far we’ve drifted from the EU (I’m sure it’s not by a lot as we specifically have clauses in the TCA that prevents it, kind of) but working on realigning (and possibly signing up to new laws as a full EU member) with the EU will take time.
This is a bad take. If it shows anything it’s the fact that education needs to be kept higher and also taxation needs to be adjusted since the income gap in the uk (much like most western countries) us ever increasing and people without education and/or harsh living conditions tend to be an easy pick for any extreme kind of populism.
Would it happen any time soon? Not at all. The best the UK can hope for (and honestly should strive for) in the immediate future is closer cooperation with the EU and working on resolving all current issues. Next is to build trust between the two and hopefully a more beneficial deal to UK-EU can be discussed.
In any case, would the UK be possibly accepted back in the EU? Probably, a united Europe is beneficial to everyone.
Delusional. If there were 17m white supremacists in the country, the UK would have a very strong representation in Westminster but we don't. The reason being the vast majority of the people in the UK are firmly against any such movements and see them as the vermin they are. The BNP and NF have a total of 0 seats in Westminster. They're about as popular as turds on a dinner plate. Compare this to other countries in the EU which have much stronger far right support.
