Don't get me wrong, it's a very new concept in the west, the remnants of hierarchial colonial powers still remain, but enforcing any sort of social hierarchies in 2022 is deeply unpopular, even illegal, in most of Europe and North America.
Dude. I'm not starting an argument. I'm not saying that The West is worse. Obviously we have the largest and best extension of human rights comparatively. I'm just acknowledging the fact that having the full extension of human rights is a privileged position to be in, even in the West. There are still populations of people (in the West) that live without some or all basic rights extended to others. That is a bottom line fact.
the application of what it means for a society to be completely rid of social hierarchies varies wildly depending on your political alignment, but it's still there in varying degrees in pretty much every major political discussion in the west.
But why? Why did I give those people my time. My ears. I led them into thinking what they were saying was reasonable. It wasn't. Fuck them.
