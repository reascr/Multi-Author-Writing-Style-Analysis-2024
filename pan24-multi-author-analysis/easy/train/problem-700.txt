The world stopped using gold as its reserve currency back during the Nixon Administration, so now all world currencies are backed by the US dollar. Since the US dollar is the only dollar you can buy oil in, and our current capitalist economy basically runs on oil, the US dollar, and therefore all world currencies, are technically backed by the ability to purchase oil.
Oh sweet summer child. The Monroe Doctrine is international legal doctrine laid down over 200 years ago. International consensus agreements can last for centuries. PAX Americana is at its apex. We are living at the Hieghts of the American lead world liberal capitalist order. We are 100% still abiding by every aspect of the post WW2 order.
This is actually a common misconception and conspiracy theory. You see it's not only oil that gets spot on sold for dollars. It's tuna, it's copper, it's liquified natural gas, it's cars. Oil makes a small percentage of this, no one cares if a small percentage of a small percentage doesn't use dollars anymore.
