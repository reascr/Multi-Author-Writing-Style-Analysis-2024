While this was going on, voters had the option to either go to another precinct to vote, or they could place their ballots into a secured bin where a much beefier reader back at a central location would then tabulate the ballots.
There's an allegation by the GOP that in at least two instances, ballots in these secured holding bins were "co-mingled" with already electronically tabulated ballots. Maricopa County seems to acknowledge that this happened, but states that they have a procedure for un-mingling these ballots accurately.
Maricopa County, like most places, uses "mark-sense" ballots. These are the "fill in the bubble" ballots, sometimes referred to by the trademarked name "Scantron." (Ironically, Scantron doesn't produce any election equipment that I'm aware of. They produce a similar type of mark-sense equipment that tabulates things like educational standardized testing.).
Canada has conservative which is our Conservative Party and then centrist party which is the liberals and then left leaning party which is the NDP and potentially the Green Party but itâ€™s not really widespread enough to be considered THE left leaning party.
