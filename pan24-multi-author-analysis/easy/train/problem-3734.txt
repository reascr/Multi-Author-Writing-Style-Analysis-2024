Of these regions, only two have borders with a country outside of Russia: Tuva (Mongolia) and Dagestan (Azerbaijan). Tuvans are ethnically related to Mongols, but Tuvans are also surprisingly patriotic, possibly because the area is one of the poorest regions on earth, and the army is almost the sole source of income for Tuvan people (also, Shoigu is Tuvan so they feel like they "have their guy" in power). Realistically, even if Mongolia was in a position to help such an impoverished, undeveloped mess of a region (they aren't), Tuvans don't seem at all interested in going. As for Dagestan, the region is mostly made up of Sunni people of a North Caucasian ethnolinguistic group (Avars, Chechens, etc.), whose languages are as different from the Turkic Azerbaijani as Chinese is from English. Also Azerbaijan is largely Shia, so there seems little incentive to help Dagestan out. And that's not even getting into the extent that Russia will be fighting to keep these regions in orbit, and whether other countries will risk openly supporting revolts and successions.
Interesting. Tell us more. Does Siberia have the means to establish a self sustaining nation? Can they avoid becoming a mini Russia run by oligarchs? If they can form a country will fossil fuels be the primary export or do they have wood, rare earth minerals and/or other valuable resources?
