And that's before even considering the damage another Republican administration would cause in the interim, with the potential to appoint multiple Supreme Court justices (Thomas, Alito, and Roberts are the three oldest ones, and any of them might die or choose to strategically retire during a Republican administration to ensure being replaced by a like-minded hack), countless trial and appellate judges, policies, executive actions, etc, to entrench Republicans and make it that much harder to elect Democrats in future elections. Four years of adverse judicial decisions, four years of adverse executive actions and executive orders, four years of adverse legislation. The best possible outcome at that point will be four years of the status quo, legislatively, due to either a divided or opposition Congress. And we already just saw in 2019-2020 how much damage a Republican President who can't even legislate can cause.
