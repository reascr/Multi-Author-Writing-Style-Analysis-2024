But ok. Leopard tanks are desirable because they are notoriously reliable, easy to maintain (though easy in the context of tanks is obviously a term we have to be careful with) and parts are commonplace. Poland also uses Leopards so theoretically specific maintenance training could be an cross-the-border type deal. Of course, that risks escalation, which is likely the main argument against the whole idea (at least from Germany’s point of view).
That's disinformation. Habeck (who has no authority on the matter) stated the opinion that Germany "should" approve transfers. That's not in any way a confirmation, and the disingenuous way it's presented is hurting both the reputation of Germany and the war effort. The only facts we have on the matter paint the picture that Germany is denying requests.
Obviously diplomatic communication happens through back-channels too. Noone will make such request openly if they know the answer to be ’no’ because of unnecessarily losing face. So obviously no official requests so far because of foot-dragging of Germany.
