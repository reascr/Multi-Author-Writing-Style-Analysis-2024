I recall reading somewhere recently that for Ukraine to effectively take the initiative and go on the offensive in the spring they’d need another 2 armoured divisions minimum. Seeing all the news about any armour from modernized T55s, to Bradley’s, to French light tanks headed their way it seems like they’re trying to scrape together everything with tracks and a cannon to get the fight going.
Survivability. The Abrams has stronger armor than the Bradley, but the Brad can make up with this by using its dismounts to clear IV lines and protect it from enemy AT ambushes. The Abrams should be paired with mechanized infantry to perform this task, but that’s not always the case. With the Bradley your dismounts are organic to you, and work in a mutually supportive role. The Stryker is a very lightly armored platform. It’s not meant to get in a fight, it’s an Infantry Carrier Vehicle, vs an Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The ATGM and MGS vehicles have the guns to go up against enemy Armor, without any increased protection.
