"Officials have done a public health risk assessment, including working through scenarios of potential case numbers among travellers from China. This confirmed these visitors won't contribute significantly to our Covid case numbers meaning entry restrictions aren't required or justified,".
Sure. They follow science rather than politics. It made sense for New Zealand to prevent people from entering the country before they had covid inside and before people were vaccinated. Why would they prevent people with covid from entering the country now when the virus is already everywhere there and people are already vaccinated?
Either that or she (or her team) understands that as the whole world has covid now and most people are vaccinated. Preventing people from one single country to get in when you already have covid everywhere doesn't really make any sense, and even less when the most contagious variant of covid right now and for which vaccines don't seem to work very well (XBB) is not even in China at the moment, but mostly in the US.
Wait. The country most concerned with covid isn't going to have restrictions from a country that knowingly is allowing travelers to exit the country without testing.
