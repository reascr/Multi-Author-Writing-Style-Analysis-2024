As someone who has had little to no self esteem their entire life. When I was younger (teens - twenties) I was a compulsive liar. I felt like something was severely wrong with who I was so I would make up things about myself that I thought would get people to like me, because at my core I felt I was wholly unlikable. Iâ€™m in my mid forties now and stopped doing this a long time ago, but I still struggle with self esteem daily. I can not tell you how important it is in your day to day life to at least believe you are not a complete piece of shit. I feel shame to this day about the people I lied to. But also I hated everything about myself.

Being a convincing liar who can maintain complex webs of lies is crucial for doing counter-intelligence, espionage, HUMINT gathering , influence operations, counter-terrorism interrogations, and many other clandestine tradecrafts.
