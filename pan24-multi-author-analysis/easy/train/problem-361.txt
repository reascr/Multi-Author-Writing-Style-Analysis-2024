It's hard to say. Yes Mao said women hold up half the sky. But it wasn't until Corporate China did women really start to get work and rights. Though, there are many who say had Mao not said that to begin with, this wouldn't have moved forward the way it did. So really, who knows.
"We may be known throughout the world to be lacking human empathy and tried to cover up the news about the fetuses left in the streets during our no first born females policy and mi mate at side of me just killed a bunch of women and executed those who didn't like it but come on guys chill out a bit wit lasses".
Edit 2. India is better described as a corrupt democracy. They do not do everything for profits. They do things in a power grab, lying to the people to get votes. They're the dark side of democracy. It's all about self promotion and power. China, while having its own corruption issues does things purely for profit of the country. They see the whole country as one company so they are very interested in improving the lives of their people so their people are more productive. They understand if the country is profitable, they'll be richer as well.
