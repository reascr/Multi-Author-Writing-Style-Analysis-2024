Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger who won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for groundbreaking experiments with entanglement in 2022 disagree. Their groundbreaking work finally put to bed the question if reality is casually real and deterministic and the answer is no, it isn't. That means on a fundamental level of the universe not every outcome can be known. God does indeed play dice and Einstein was wrong in his assumptions. However, what I think you are getting at is that if there are situations with unknown outcomes then that calls into question God's omniscience. That only makes sense from a very temporally locked, all or nothing view of the universe (or indeed multiverse) where all potential outcomes don't play out simultaneously. The concept of omniscience is then maintained if the role of an omniscient God exists not in just one version of reality, but all versions of reality, all at once. It's like the superstate of positions when we view quanta that don't take on definite values until observed.
