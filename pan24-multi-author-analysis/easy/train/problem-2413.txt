If the Russian oil supply was actually cut off oil prices would rise immensely. If specifically Russian oil prices are pressured to be lower than everyone else's, but the supply otherwise remains untouched, countries like China get cheap oil, while countries that don't like Russia get to hurt Russia without raising oil prices for themselves, since supply technically remains the same.
No, that's only part of it. The plan was for the CIA op to reduce tensions and use the relative prosperity and oil sales as a dark money fund for the CIA, but then the FSB discovered this, assassinated the CIA op, and then installed one of Putin's body doubles back into power as a puppet. However, that double had nefarious aspirations of his own, and immediately began gearing up for the invasion after purging his FSB handlers.
The FSB then, in a plot to ruin this double's plan, gave him false information about the outlook of an invasion, lulling him into a false sense that the war could be won in 3 days so that he would be disastrously defeated and lose enough influence that the FSB could install someone else into power.
