Lindsay asks "Did it ever work for these people?" to which Tobias answers "No. It never does. I mean these people somehow delude themselves into thinking it might. But......it might work for us.".
China's navy remains fundamentally untested. And 2nd in the world doesn't mean much when compared to the United States military, which has been tested. People should remember that before the First Gulf War, Iraq had the 4th largest military in the world, and that conflict was utterly one-sided.
Probably? The "Don't go to war" approach is working out for everyone in general anyways, and that's also why I'm doubtful that big CCP will press the go button anytime soon, but that's like, a personal opinion, I guess.
Interesting. I guess that's another reason for China to be interested in the Ukrainian conflict. I always assumed they were mostly interested in it as a barometer.
In regards to the amphibious capabilties, talk about that usually acknowledges that the PLAN doesn't have the amphib capability to take Taiwan, but they could possibly use civillian RoRos (and have trained with those) to bolster the landing fleet, but also missiles and other boats exist, yadda yadda yadda, some people say that China will use long range fires and blockade the major ports of Taiwan (which all face China from the strait, since the other part of Taiwan is mountainous and shitty for logistics and whatnot), which then elicits the response of "the USN will blockade/sink/whatever the PLAN", and back and forth happens, which may lead to nuclear war being hypothesized again. Personally, I hardly think that Ian Easton should be quoted so much, because there's obviously more than a few ways a conflict could go kinetic here.
