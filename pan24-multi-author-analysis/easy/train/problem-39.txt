Given that Russia might be running out of tanks to generously abandon in Ukraine, since they've been reaching into museums to refurbish T62s, I think I can comfortably say "bout time!".
The Spain offer was in the end withdrawn, because the tanks itself are not in good condition: "Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles said the review found the Leopard tanks “close to useless” after being warehoused at the Casetas military base for several years.".
Honestly never. Maybe you may see some desperate use of monument tanks (like we have already seen) but they will never get to that point. Mostly because they don't actually have strategic supplies of the tanks, using them only for ceremonial reasons and also because the situation will never be that desperate (think 1945 Germany levels of desperation). I wouldn't rule out seeing T-54/55s though bought back from various countries should they not come up with a simplified tank they can produce 100% domestically (it generally takes 2 years to design and start production of a tank when you're highly motivated).
Good God. One of these countries just needs to take the lead and stop playing these weird games. Seriously, what's these back and forth signalling between Poland and Germany? Happened previously with the Patriot Systems.
