They're doing the same in Mariupol right now. New housing going up left and right. Mainly apartments, but that's what was there before. The Russians have some prefabricated concrete panel system that's very rapid. Not massive places but all centrally heated, double glazed. A better standard than social housing in the UK that's for certain.
This happens because there isn't an actual higher power that can force them to abide (other than a stronger country which can invade them and force them) it's not the same thing as law as we commonly understand it because in that case there is an actual enforcement mechanism (So for example if a person steals something they are arrested and go to trial, but if a country violates the UN charter the only consequence is whatever the other countries decide to do because the UN itself can't enforce anything).
Cool cool cool. Just how do we actually enforce the payments? Honestly I’m curious. I think they absolutely should fix what they broke, but I won’t hold my breath.
