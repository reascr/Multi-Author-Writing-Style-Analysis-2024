They won’t do a thing. My 14 y/o stepson lives in TX with his mother. He posted videos of himself playing with his stepdad’s assault rifle - after being hospitalized a few weeks for being suicidal. DFACS was eventually made aware of issues another parent noticed. They interviewed him at school and the worker gave him her business card. He then proceeded to text his case worker demanding she tell him who reported him and what exactly they said. She explained that she would be meeting with his mom the next day and would explain everything to her. He continued to rudely demand she answer his questions until she finally stopped responding. I would think a 14 year old treating an adult whose job it is to ensure his safety that way would immediately be recognized as being a red flag. Nope. They have money and live in a big house, kid said all of the inappropriate posts online were “his sense of humor”, so case closed - nothing to see here folks!

Privacy? Sounds like something a groomer would say. Cruz is a public figure, therefore we need to know more. What's on the laptops in that home? Does he have a basement? A pizza oven? A basement AND pizza? Sounds like we need an investigation.
