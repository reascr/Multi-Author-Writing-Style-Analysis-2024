This assessment makes a lot of sense - duds, range of artillery, counterbattery fire, civilian shelters, exposed logistics corridors and DPRK's long border... it would be a shitshow no doubt, but DPRK's only real trump card is nuclear weapons, of which they have few and unreliable delivery systems. The reality is that this constant threatening dance is akin to a scared dog baring teeth. It's all show because they know they'll get their shit kicked in.
My not so serious but not entirely impossible solution to the Korean unification: Make the il-family a constitutional monarchy (except of course don't call it that, they want to be called communists of course), remove their power, call them "symbols of Korean unification" and let them have the glory, but let the South have the democratic power and run the place. The Il-family are vain and freaked out about upholding their family name and glory. In a generation or two they'd be as harmless as any European monarch while the entirety of Korea would be better off. And no deaths.
