My town's only grocery store burned down in 2005 and we have to drive 20 miles to get groceries now. And at the site of the roasted IGA? Dollar General.
Why dont u just jump in the ground. We will help bury u. Anyone that negative is of no used to anyone. You still have life. You are not in a desth camp waiting selection. You are on reddit so you have internet and/or electricity. Yes you have fallen short of seeing your docialist utopia thst may not ever come but you damn sure dont want an authotarian dystopia where we wouldnt be on reddit with you whining(and yes you are whining) and there would be no election. When America is done where do we go for assylum?
Seriously. These people are doing more harm than good. It's the same mentality and tactics as the Hillary supporters had back in '16 that lost them a lot of support from Sanders voters.
Seriously. Just because your pet issue wasn't fully accomplished doesn't mean you should stay home. Stop expecting instant results for everything and vote consistently.
