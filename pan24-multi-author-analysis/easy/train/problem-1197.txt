Totally understand, and I get being upset with 'powers that be' and im also guilty for being crude and critical of it and 'them'. Listen, keep doing what youre doing, i know its easy to get down on the big picture but there is a ton of local and regional good going on for sustainability all over the world, you know that. Dont let the 24 hr cycle of news think people aren't out here doing their part or that its not happening currently. Its Funny, me and you yelled at eachother for a week, and now no matter how different, we want the same thing. lol!
There are building standards that reduce need for heating/cooling, more efficient use of water in production/farming, individual solar energy is still growing, looking forward to life-long lasting batteries made from nuclear waste (obviously may not happen but we still can research that area), and other things i can't remember at the moment.
No. We are only fighting wars over oil. We have plenty of food if obesity is still negatively correlated with wealth.
