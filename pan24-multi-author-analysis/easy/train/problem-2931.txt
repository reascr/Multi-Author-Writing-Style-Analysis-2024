In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Cool story. Nearly everyone trusted the GOP and what they were saying at the time. Back then, it was anticipated that they'd come to the table in good faith and wouldn't lead the nation into murdering innocent people. They said over and over that Iraq had WMDs and that they were working with the Taliban.
exactly. and just think of what would happen if they all targeted him to get him out of the way. he is the frontrunner right now......or so it seems.
Remember when indefinite detention for Americans was codified ? It happened under Obama’s term, and while I wasn’t that concerned about it being used against Americans (shouldn’t even matter) under Obama, it was only a matter of time. So, no charges, no trial or conviction. A Guantanamo detainee was released recently, after some 20+ years, still with no charge. Idk the details, but everyone deserves fair representation in court. Of course this all stems back to the Patriot Act.
