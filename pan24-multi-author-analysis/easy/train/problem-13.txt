Remember that this is a 2 party system and there will always be an independent promising things you want to hear to take your vote away from one of the candidates. This historically has led to the party whos vote was not split winning. If your state has posted polls showing a close call between D and R a vote for independent would effectively be a lost vote. Please vote for the party in your state that has the GREATEST CHANCE OF DEFEATING REPUBLICANS. Check your polls.
Just like Biden in office and we see how that's turned out with tricle down economics with record inflation, out of control crime, huge losses from my stock market portfolio, cost of gas, food and everything else keeps going up, not to mention all the unlimited spending and Ukraine BS, not to mention things like the Covid restrictions where business owners were threatened with fines of $7000 per day. NO THANKS! You don't have to agree and keep your stance, but I know who's really standing up for me and my family. Observations noted from both sides in the last several elections. I know I'm not the only one who sees things for what they are, and not what we want them to be. No response required or desired.
