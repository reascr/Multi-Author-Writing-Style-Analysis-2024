2. India politics has been heavily polarized for a while - I want to say since the 1980s. The 1980s in India were (culturally) similar to the 1960s Civil Rights era in the States. Just like the Democrats/LBJ made an effort to affirmatively give rights to minorities back in the 60s, VP Singh did the same thing in 1989 to caste Indians. In the states, the backlash led to the Southern Strategy and most white Americans, till date, identifying with the R party. VP Singh's actions pushed upper caste Hindus towards the Hindutva (Hindu fundie) parties because back in the 90s, the Hindutva parties spoke out against affirmative action (AA) for people on the basis of their caste - they wanted an economic basis for AA - but now they too have embraced caste based AA as a means to power.
