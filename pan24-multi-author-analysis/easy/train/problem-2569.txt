Their fascist takeover didn’t work. But I can’t imagine the MAGA Republicans going back to a party that focuses on governing, not “ owning the Libs”, in order to get support and gain complete power. I’ve already been hearing about their plans to suppress the vote: doing away with choice ranked voting in Alaska; raising the voting age; making it difficult in Ohio for voters to pass an amendment that will create an independent commission to draw up a fair election map that isn’t gerrymandered to favor Republicans, etc., etc.!
As a moderate liberal, I'll say he has done a decent job as the governor of NH, and while I don't agree with all of his policies and am occasionally disappointed in him, I'm totally happy to say he's the governor and trust that he will make reasonable decisions in general.
Now here’s a thing. Him & Baker are 2 Republicans i respect THEY ARE THE GOOD GOP. They support equality and abortion and condone crazies on their party.
