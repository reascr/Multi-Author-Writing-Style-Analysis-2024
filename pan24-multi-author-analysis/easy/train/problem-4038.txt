Oh, I feel glad the first inquiry to my comment is simple for me to answer: Deprivatizing companies doesn't mean people stop working and goods stop being sold (capitalism). Much like with capitalism, there are shortfalls, however. Socialism detaches people from the pride they take in their work, and can cause a slow-to-develop economic state, and capitalism encourages independence, which is great in moderation. Unfortunately, hyper-independence is a problem in the U.S. and other parts of the world. We are more self-serving in our endeavors to achieve financial freedom. Both systems are corruptible in their own rights, as well (socialism being quite vulnerable). That said, there are no reasons government couldn't regulate the food industry to stop manufacturers from literally poisoning the population or regulate plastic use. These would be considered an overstep in a capitalist economy (because freedom), which is truly unfortunate.
Seriously. Where's the united Democratic front on this and other issues? I feel like they're asleep at the wheel while these goose-stepping a-holes tear down our society.
