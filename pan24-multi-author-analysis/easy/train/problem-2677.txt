India and China are on Russian side, Pakistan is allied with USA. It has been this way for 50+ years. Pakistan has 1000s of US artillery system and armored weapons, except tanks. No Abrams were given to Pakistan so they use Soviet tanks. But Apache helicopters and nearly 100 F-16s are also given to Pakistan. US doesn't care that Pakistan military and its government assisted Taliban as they just overthrew Imran Khan, a non-corrupted honest, but Pro-Chinese leader for a Pro-US corrupted political family that helped Taliban blow 20,000 arms and legs of US soldiers while putting 2,500 in the box.
Wrong facts. India doesn’t support Ukraine or Russia is because India follows the policy of NAM (Non Aligned Movement). India also doesn’t have any allies because of this policy. This policy means that India always takes a neutral stance in case of wars. India’s no support to Ukraine doesn’t mean they support Russia. India buys oil from Russia because it’s the cheapest. Western countries blames India for supporting Russia. Why don’t these countries blame Europe for importing 6 times more oil as compare to India from Russia? Zelensky also thanked India for giving them humanitarian aid. [IF YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING, THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO PRESENT WRONG FACTS].
