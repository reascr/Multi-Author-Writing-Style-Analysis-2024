Pakistan has been Allies with Ukraine since the 90s, the Soviet Union supported India during the Cold War and Pakistan was allied with the US , it still is a major non nato US ally , Pakistan was quietly supplying Ukraine with ammunition and stuff through British ships as Pakistan usually buys their oil from the gulf countries but due to the war , all the oil was snagged by European countries and its price become expensive , moreover Pakistan had massive floods which destroyed 1/3 of the countryâ€™s infrastructure , is a developing country , and on the brink of default along with a coup staged by the army to remove a populist leader with the old stooges from political dynasties and with a shortage of oil and natural gas and these various factors , they were trying for a deal with Russia for discounted oil and natural gas to feed their population and keep their industries going , news got out that Pakistan was helping Ukraine due to soldiers posting videos of the shells and Russia rejected the discounted oil , so currently going through a great crisis and negotiations with Russia for oil Pakistan abstained from voting on the war issue as it has pressing issues of its own to deal with , Pakistan is regardless still supplying Ukraine with artillery ammunition silently.
