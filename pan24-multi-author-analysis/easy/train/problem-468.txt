What's happening is not mysterious at all: energy capacity that's only needed for peak annual demand sits idle most of the time. Profit-driven enterprises will skimp on such a wasteful allocation of resources and then make outsize profits when floating prices result in huge swings during high demand periods. Other companies have to purchase on the open market but charge a fixed-ish rate to consumers, so they're incentivized to turn off power during these periods and the consumers are not incentivized to ration usage. Other companies pass through market costs to consumers, and they rack up astronomical bills before they realize anything has happened. In effect many actors in the system are being rewarded for not providing a reliable service. In theory, all the actors would have perfect information and pay more to have more reliable energy and ration as perfectly-floating prices moved up. But theory is no way to run an energy grid. State lawmakers and regulators are too blinded by dogma and too ignorant of what markets are capable of in practice to create a system that works for people rather than corporations. Just guessing, but ample campaign contributions may also play a part.
Texas is already polluted beyond uninhabitability. It's the reason for so many genetic disorders in the state and all the conservative voters. It's been long shown there is a link between pollution, low IQ, and conservatism.
