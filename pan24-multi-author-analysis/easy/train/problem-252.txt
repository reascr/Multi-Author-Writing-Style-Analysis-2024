Ketsug≈ç remained the plan for the Japanese right up to Nagasaki; they didn't change it after Hiroshima. So why did the second bomb make them change their minds? Well the Japanese had a nuclear program of their own, though it made even less progress than Germany's. The main problem was that the Japanese and the Germans had estimated that the amount of fissile material you'd need for a bomb was quite high; ten times what the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs actually used. Given the extreme difficulty of producing that much enriched uranium or plutonium, both Japan and Germany more or less abandoned their own atomic programs during the war. But it did mean that when Hiroshima happened, Japanese high command knew very quickly that it was an atomic weapon. It was just that from their perspective, one atomic bomb didn't really change the strategic situation. Given how hard the Japanese figured these bombs were to create, the United States wouldn't be able to produce them in large quantities.
Certainly and entertaining fantasy movie. If you want to look at it as a fantasy film or a parody of history, sure. Something remotely true? Nope. Wallace won a battle and lost the next one, then lived in exile for five years before he was caught. No Scottish king died without no heirs during that time, and when they did (long after these imagined events) Edward didn't even want Scotland and handed the kingdom to someone the Scottish lords mostly voted in. Was no love interest or right of the first night, shanks lived a long while, and ultimately Wallace wouldn't be remembered today if not for a poet ripping off the poem 'the Bruce' to write 'the Wallace', something of a parody in its own time.
