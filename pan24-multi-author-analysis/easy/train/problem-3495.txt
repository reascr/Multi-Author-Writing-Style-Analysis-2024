Funny enough I spoke to someone in facebook who leads a department created to deal with the fallout from the CA scandal... and she had never heard of Emerdata. Lol.
I've been getting insane far-right propaganda in the "suggested for you" or whatever it's called lately, to the point that I'm deleting my account FINALLY, taking a hit in lost business given how much I've used it as a musician to make contacts. I am a very left leaning queer person and I was getting fed non-stop far-right queerphobic content. Like... far more "suggested for you" posts than actual things from friends and contacts. Absolutely insane.
To do wrong in ignorance once is a mistake. To do wrong in ignorance over and over is unforgivable. The point is: by now he knows exactly what he’s doing and the damages he’s caused.
I stopped using Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2014 - which was so long ago, and much corporate name changes ago, so Ill repeat the gist of it, Facebook was selling the pyschological profile of millions of Americans to a shady corporate project that helped right wing, fascist and racist corporate allied political groups micro-target ads to effectively brainwash (they called it advertising) the moron millions into supporting insurrection. Fack facebook, fack meta, fack Zuckerberg and my life was better after I stopped using facebook anyways.
