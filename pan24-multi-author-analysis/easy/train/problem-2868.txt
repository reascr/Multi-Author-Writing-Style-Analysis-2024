My comment was directed more to your remark about how you Russians are 'despised' following the invasion. I'm of course not saying you should pick a side, that's up to you, but it is difficult to be an "enlighted centrist" in a highly internationally condemned invasion. And no, there are no "winners" here, but one part loses the most, and another the least. Shades of grey, as you say.
The main reason why the US was so keen on cooperating with post-Soviet Russia on human spaceflight (especially in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the USSR), was to keep the engineers previously employed by the Soviet space program gainfully employed and occupied.
Yep. They have two fairly sizable pressurized modules and an unpressurized external experiment platform, plus the JEM has the stationâ€™s main experiment airlock.
I kinda worded that wrong. If I'm not wrong the iss is set to be retired soon. But for our next space station or possibly a lunar base, would we partner with another country to build it.
And I could be wrong, but japan part in the iss is just sending their own astronauts to the station.
