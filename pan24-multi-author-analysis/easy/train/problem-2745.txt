in order: doable and good, doable and bad, not doable without a Constitutional amendment which is a disaster in the making given who's on the right, doable and good if you can get people to understand it, same as the first one, and counterintuitively term limits increase corporate/lobbyist influence in politics. Being a politician is a skill and a profession like any other, and if you artificially limit how long you can be in that profession, two things happen: you cede power to the people (lobbyists) who aren't bound by that law and then end up being the repository of institutional knowledge, and you essentially say to politicians "you now have many fewer years to make your mark and secure a cushy retirement." The second can be dealt with via taking money out of campaigning and banning congress/K street revolving doors. But the first is a bit of a pickle to solve without a robust and robustly non-partisan bureaucracy running everything below the executive level. And Americans have been led to believe they hate that.
