And one of the biggest ones. Did you know the proposed sales tax excludes what it calls "intangible property?" That is defined in the bill to include copyrights, trademarks, patents, goodwill, , securities, commercial paper, debts, notes and bonds, and other property deemed intangible at common law. So they are basically getting rid of the capital gains taxes too.
Hi, I'm read your other comment on another subject in r/Games, about a game called Battletanx, in that comment section you said you interacted with one of the devs of said game on Facebook, I would like to know which one and his account, I want to help make the 3rd game or atleast a game like it and the original devs know more about the game than anyone, if it's OK can you please tell me what his account is?
That's right. For all intents and purposes it enshrines a permanent wealth class with most of the wealth being completely shielded from taxation. Yup. If you buy a cup of coffee from a vending machine, you will be taxed. But when a CEO gets a billion dollar compensation package, that won't be taxed one single cent.
