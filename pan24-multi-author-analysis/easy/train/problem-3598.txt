I remember writing a paper in college about the world population hitting 6 billion back in October 1999. Just 23 years later and we increased by 33%. Wow.
Not really a drastic collapse of population like south korea is also not manageable because it becomes almost impossible to support the elder population (we see it pretty clearly in east asia and it's only going to get worse there ) the only reason the west doesn't suffer from it is because the west "import" a huge work force in the form of immigrants but this resource is also finite because eventually those african and asian countries would get below replacement rate and then they would be short of people too. That can be fixed if people would "just" work until the day they die and won't ever retire but no one wants to do that.
Not significantly. Abortions have never been a massive source of birth control. Education and birth control are the two big factors that lead to having less kids. Abortion is first and foremost an issue of bodily autonomy.
