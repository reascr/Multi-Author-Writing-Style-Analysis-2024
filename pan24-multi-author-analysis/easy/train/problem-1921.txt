To be fair, I think you have more empathy than the average human, in general. You’re able to reconstruct an abstract idea of pain into something compatible with your experiences. Most people, men and women alike, don’t do that. My assumptions that men usually don’t understand, is because it takes more effort than a woman, because she doesn’t need to think about period pain in an abstract way to understand another woman’s pain. It’s just degrees of empathy, and translating it is an extra step that most people don’t automatically or naturally do. But people like you are the reasons I have hope for the human race. You give a shit.
We currently don't have a relevant far left (advocating for a centrally planned economy, aggressively anti-capitalist, etc).
Where did I say that? They should get the same base pay but those employees that don't use up as many leaves get a cash bonus... That's all. If you have a disability, you can instead avail your leaves. That's still a benefit. A compensation.
