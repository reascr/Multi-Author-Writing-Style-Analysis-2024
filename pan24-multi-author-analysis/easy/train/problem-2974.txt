The true problem with a surveillance state, it makes it very easy to harass people. One minute apple and Google are leaving backdoors in their OS so the NSA can make sure you don't nuke NYC, the next minute some company in Israel is selling stingrays to police departments and selling software for them to image your phone. Maybe the CIA is sort of professional, only interested in bad guys, but then even if that is somehow possible, your local police officer who didn't finish high school uses one of the 15 billion laws and a loophole to get a warrant to harass people they don't like.
More like every day. NSA been doing this for ages now and American can't even elect ones who are against it. If anything it's unpatriotic. Going by the same thinking, Putin probably doing the right thing :facepalm:
To me, I hate mass surveillance of course, but I could almost stomach it if, it was exclusively within the domain of the military, with no jurisdiction over citizens, except for maybe a phone call when someone is hurting a child or kidnapped someone or something, not used for political reasons, which is almost impossible to imagine governments doing, as it's very easy to interpret things however you want and call someone a prototerrorist, and stalk and harass people until you catch them doing a crime.
