It's really just home grow, though, that's all I mean. There always going to be a shitheel or twelve who sticks his nose out and makes a dumb rule just to cause a stink and get attention, happens every time we do liquor reform too. I genuinely believe most of the legislature made a good faith attempt to fulfill the responsibility of enacting the referendum. I use the medical system sometimes and it's great for what it is, they really did try and make it good. the reason the referendum follow up legislation was first thrown out was the state can't deal directly in cannabis like DABC can for liquor, they can only do licensing because it's still illegal federally to do much more than that. so of course everything is about licensing and bonding and all that, other states also suffer from this.
Exactly. I was furious when I saw the map. There is some about redistricting going around though. Hopefully the SC doesn't rule in favor of the independent state legislature theory or the maps will stay that way for good.
