Or the fact that the Florida governor, GWBs brother, was coordinating with the Bush campaign and that, combined with Roger Stone starting the Brook Brother's Riot, allowed for a delaying of the recount and eventual supreme court challenge and a preempted decision in the election.
I’m with you 100%. It’s a lot harder to get 220+ people in lockstep when there’s a lot of folks there who could legit lose their seat next election if they don’t do anything. I mean they already saw this election didn’t go as planned. And what happens when the republicans don’t get enough votes on one of their stupid motions about Hunter Biden or whatever? They’re gonna look stupid as hell and not even get whatever leverage they’re hoping for. It’s a losing battle and I’m honestly shocked they’re pushing this bullshit so hard with that thin majority, and I’m someone who has absolutely zero faith in anyone with an R next to their name. I try to predict their next move as “what would the most evil and power hungry person (or a mob) do in this situation?” and pursuing this BS with a thin majority after a poor election is just a risky and bad call on their part IMO. Extremely high risk and very little reward.
Exactly. Maybe it's their official party position, but nobody is doing that great a job at messaging.
