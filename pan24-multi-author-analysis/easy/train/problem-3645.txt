Only after he does as much as he can to burn the GOP to the ground. I'd much rather see a harsh primary and RNC electorate count with him pushing election lies about their primary and then have him narrowly not get the ticket and then have him start a MAGA party with some down ballot MAGA people who he picked who also lost their GOP primaries who get like 10% to 20% of the vote leading to the GOP losing states that are normally lighter red like NC, TX, great lakes states, etc...
I hate the idea. He almost won in 2020 and all the conservatives will fall in line and vote for him again in 2024 regardless of anything they say -- I would expect him to get even more votes in 2024 than he got in 2020. It's too dangerous for him to get anywhere near the presidency again. I think he will lose, but I don't want him to have the chance.

Funny how Biden's Attorney General doing fck-all to actually indict and prosecute the murdering traitorous seditionist conspirators in Congress and Trump's Administration is just emboldening them to keep it up.
