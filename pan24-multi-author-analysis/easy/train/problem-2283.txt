Brings back memories of Hurricane Dorian that hit the Bahamas a few years back. The eye plowed right over a couple of shantytowns of undocumented Haitian immigrants. Hundreds of people vanished without a trace, whole families drowned and washed away with nobody left to report the losses. The official death toll is 74 but doctors reported seeing hundreds of uncounted bodies in the wreckage of the shantytowns, and some estimates put the death toll at over a thousand. Corpses were never recovered. A lot are thought to have washed out to sea but also the island of Great Abaco literally stank for months, with the smell presumed to be from unrecovered human bodies quietly rotting away under all the debris. Just horrific.
Especially if these sketchy developers and constructions companies were big-time supporters of Erdogan and contributors to his political party. Isn't he considered to be pretty far right on the political spectrum? I know that he was pushing for Turkey to become more 'Islamic' and less secular. So could he be seen as a kind of Turkish 'Trump', 'Bolsonaro', or 'Orban'?
