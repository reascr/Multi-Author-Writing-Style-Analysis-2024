Deluded Americans think their grandeur is a military that can fight everyone all at once and that fast food makes them the envy of the world, similarly deluded Americans deny just how big of a stick America wields and just how much of global civilization is americanized in ways their brains blindspot as some abstract development that happens to speak English and share a common development index.
No. There is no legitimate security concern in regards to NATO. That's what Russia says, yes, but its propaganda that silly people buy in to and I guess you have as well. Once again what security concern does Russia have from NATO? Is NATO ever going to invade Russia when it's purely a defensive pact? No. Russia literally has nothing to fear from NATO except that it stops them from attacking neighbors. Russia has had NATO countries bordering them for decades and NATO never once attacked them, now all the sudden when Ukraine is getting closer to NATO it's a problem? It's all bullshit because they wanted to steal land from Ukraine and they can't do that if they're in NATO.
