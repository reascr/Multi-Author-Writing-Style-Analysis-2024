It’s this nice culture you’re talking about which is why we keep getting stuck with terrible leaders. And the reason we have the nice culture is the corporate media doesn’t want to piss anyone off, because their business depends on keeping people watching their channel. So unless they can be 110% sure someone is lying, they’re not going to call them a liar. As long as someone says they’re doing something for some noble reason, like “saving the country”, the most they will say is, this person is “controversial”. And it’s a huge problem! I honestly think we have to eliminate the for profit news media. Or bring back some heavy handed regulations to keep them on check or something. I don’t know. But you hit the nail on the head.
Denying itself undermines the integrity of Democracy, and is devoid of decency particularly as every single fucking recount, investigation, etc confirmed the validity of the results. To make it even more rich, nearly every instance of actual fraud has been republican voters and officials. It’s not even close.
