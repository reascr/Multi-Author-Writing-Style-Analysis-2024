I know . we still have some time to change our behaviors, give Mother Nature space and let her do her thing to restore balance, but we need to do it immediately. Plankton is also responsible for half of the oxygen we breath and is literally the base of all life in the ocean. If plankton disappear then the oceans become lifeless and the rest of life on Earth is screwed. Some very scary things are already happening to plankton. We need to reverse course immediately or…ugh. I don’t even want to think about what that would be like.
Mankind has only prospered during a particularly stable climatic period in Earth's history. Here's one simple example: the global average sea level hasn't changed much during the last 6,000 years, however, if it had rapidly changed, then all countries' coastal infrastructure would be lost / rendered ineffective and would have to be replaced. Just that one fact alone, means mankind has been vastly more prosperous than compared to if sea levels had changed significantly.
