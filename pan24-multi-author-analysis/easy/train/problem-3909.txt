Fighting between Israel and Arab states, namely Egypt, throughout the 1950s to 1970s continually threatened the safety of commerce through the Suez Canal. The front line between Egyptian and Israeli forces was literally the canal itself from 1967-1979. In order to remove this threat to global trade, the United States began to provide massive amounts of aid to Israel AND Egypt (Jordan was roped in later), in what essentially amounts to a bribe to all involved countries to not fight each other. There is nothing strange or out of place about this in the geopolitical and historical context. If we cut aid to Israel, we also have to cut aid to Egypt and Jordan, or else the scales of power in the region would be unbalanced on a fundamental level, and war could erupt again. Love it or hate it, but this is how international relations is done. Either advocate for all three nations to receive no US aid, and then watch the region devolve into warfare again... or just, don't do that.
