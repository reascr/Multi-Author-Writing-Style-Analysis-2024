These people are Russians in every other way. They may attend the Estonian Lutheran church sometimes or maybe attended an Estonian concert in the past, but in name and education and probably quite often in their convictions, they’re Russian. It’s been reported here that after Estonian restricted access to Russian citizens, people like these in St P are much more interested in getting citizenship. My guess is, they’re not wanting it for now suddenly discovering love for Estonia but only because it offers them benefits of being an EU citizen. My guess is that it’s the same with Karelia - there is nothing or at least, not much, left of Finland there - just some run-down areas, ruins, cemeteries and now-Russified cities. Even the people are mostly Russian now - they may have some Karelian roots but my guess would be that everybody that wanted to get out, got out in the 90s because Finland also had a policy for calling back ethnic Karelians and ingerians.
Slim to none. However, if Putin is forcefully replaced, it's likely because he made a fatal mistake. Any successor will likely swing Russia the opposite direction to avoid the same fate. So if bogging down in Ukraine ultimately seals Putin's fate (which is unlikely), the next despot will probably pull back and blame Putin's mistake for the problems that precipitated the coup. At least that's the hope.
