The Justice Department has issued a legal opinion that the U.S. Postal Service may deliver abortion pills to people in states that have banned using the medication to terminate a pregnancy, saying that the sender cannot know whether the recipient would use the pills illegally.
From reporter Perry Stein: Legal opinion says existing federal law allows mail delivery because the sender cannot know if the recipient will use the medications illegally.
While the 21-page opinion, posted online late Tuesday, does not change any state or federal laws, it clearly tells federal government agencies how the Justice Department interprets existing law at a time when many states are attempting to restrict access to abortion pills and crack down on providers who send them by mail.
What else do they have to offer? Aside from tax cuts accumulating in stock buybacks for investors, all their policies have actively harmed the public.
