They also don't have the Fox News crew telling them every night that the evidence is fake since they don't know about it. When you have these types forced to form an opinion on their own instead of gobbling up Tucker/Hanity bullshit they don't know how to justify the evidence. Its like when a breaking news story drops and /r/conservative has actual level headed views and admit that things look bad, but then 2 days later after the talking points have been repeated enough times they just fall in line and stop thinking critically.
Absolutely 💯. I got banned for 7 days for saying this a few months ago. I see it on different social media platforms. The same exact talking points repeated verbatim by different users. They don't deviate from the talking points. What a cult!
“Trump lost his best tools for staving off prosecutors when he left the White House, including his ability to appoint the Attorney General, and the protection of an internal Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot be federally indicted.”.
