This is absolute nonsense. Even in France, which has by far the most restrictive and problematic rules in Europe when it comes to Islamic and religious dresscodes, the hijab is absolutely permitted in stadiums and essentially everywhere except schools.
I guess I'm thinking about risk vs reward. This is a whole other culture and I don't think trying to educate them and make them see things differently is worth risking your life. I also believe in gender equality but I'm not about to go there in skimpy clothes and try to change them. This is their country and not abiding by their rules can get you killed or incarcerated. Not worth it if you ask me.
So we willingly participate in an event that got more than 6000 killed and countless more into forced labor and subhuman conditions, in a country we know doesn't value all people equally and actively discriminate, kill and enslave others.
Lol we wish. FIFA is getting away with it all things considered, and KSA will 100% bid to host. And they have plenty of bribing money too. FIFA be like: who else has deep pockets? China, do you wanna bid?
