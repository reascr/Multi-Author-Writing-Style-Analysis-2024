I’m an affordable housing developer and think this is… the right target but you’re shooting from the wrong angle… they’ve kinda tried something in California (tax increases limited unless property is sold… creates incentive to rent with lower tax base and therefore net operating income). What should happen is 1) local assessors should tax the fuck out of renovations…. For last 10 years or so multi family developers have found they can buy older apartments and spend like 6-8k a unit (knock down wall, stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops, new cabinets)and boost rent by like $400 a month. In many places in America, the tax assessment does not go up after renovation or may take 5 years to phase in… this is awful for housing supply because “naturally occurring” affordable housing stock is removed form market and increases costs of making new housing by deepening the demand for labor/materials. 2) local tax assessors should encourage the creation of new housing.
Totally. Housing programs need to be backed up with other social programs so people can integrate into communities and have incentives to not be antisocial. Housing is only the first step.
