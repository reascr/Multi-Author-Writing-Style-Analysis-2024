The Russians have had their best troops and best equipment in this fight since day one, everything from S-400M and T-90M to the 1st Guards Tank Army and the VDV, and at this point they’re so desperate for kit they’ve begun deploying stock T-62s and seizing T-90s intended as export to India to try and replace their losses. Not to mention their best wasn’t that good to begin with, you only have to look at videos from the Russian Air Force to see the Garmin GPS units that you can get for like a hundred bucks clipped to their instrument panel to get an idea of what the Russian military is like.
Throwing your life away? If you pick a rating or a MOS(specialty) that provides a good skill, you can translate that out to the civilian world. Imagine being taught all about computers for free and then get out after 5 years right into a $70k+ job. The military is not just combat arms, there’s a hundred or more jobs available depending on the branch you go into. Plus the veteran status to obtain federal jobs. Not to mention the GI Bill and VA benefits. My wife served 20 years in the national guard, got her degrees including a masters for free and obtained a GS11 job with the Feds her first time applying. She was HR and only deployed once to Kuwait.
