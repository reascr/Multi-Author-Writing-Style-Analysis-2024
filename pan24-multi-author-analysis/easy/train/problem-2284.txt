You'd be better off comparing to the American Civil War, for general stability/war support after the first six months. But even then, different world back then.
Going up against highly motivated Ukrainians defending their homeland with middle-tech (US keeps the best stuff for themselves still) military hardware coupled to top-tier satellite and guidance information that can identify key targets, send target and guidance data to artillery 10 miles away, and have that artillery hit that target to a precision within a few feet, with an end-to-end round trip time measured in _minutes_.
And by that you mean DENSER. This type of shit is wild yo! 1 million men even getting to Poland is a huge fucking deal.
Poor comparison. The US was basically a tiger that just got bit in the ass by an angry warthog. Not many people were against the war back then and it took only a small amount of casualties to flip the narrative fairly early on. They were calling to get out around 2006-2007. Russia didn't have an inciting incident. They had a IED in a garbage can in a public park that was blocked off before it was even found.
