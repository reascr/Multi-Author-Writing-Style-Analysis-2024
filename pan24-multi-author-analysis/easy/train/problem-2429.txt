During the troubles in Northern Ireland they were political parties on both sides of the war who would decry the other side in public as terrorists and thugs while arguing that any violence on their side was simply the work of a few unstable individuals who no doubt perceived that they're very existence was under threat due to the terrible actions of the other side. In the evening they would drink a toast to the boys fighting for the cause.
Unfortunately no. They’ll just claim it’s the opposite, the politically motivated attack is actually us accusing them of a politically motivated attack.
I have a 10-year old daughter. I cannot imagine her screaming as bullets fly into her bedroom. These are terrorists.

A republican using violence against his political opponents? I'm shocked and appalled. Okay... maybe not shocked. But I am especially appalled at this:
Likewise in Israel you will see many conservative politicians who say they support the idea of peace as long as the security of Israel can be protected, then somewhere slightly less public view will support and protect the settlers who antagonize the Palestinians and claim that any efforts to get them to back down or move violate their rights and are discrimination against the religious.
