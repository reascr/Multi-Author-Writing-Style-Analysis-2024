I would say that without direct NATO involvement, only Poland was (and is) clearly stronger than Ukraine out of all Eastern European countries (with regards to military capabilities). Say, the Baltics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) can be even more militarised per capita than Ukraine, but when it comes to the absolute firepower we're hopeless in a war against Russia.
Kinda interesting. I think Rosgvardiya is one of Putins best defenses against a guy like Prigozhin being able to move on him, so unfortunately taking out Rosgvardiya (or zolotov, putins buddy who controls it) might just make it easier for Prigozhin and a new Wagner paramilitary turning Russia into an even worse place. Still, if they can hit Zolotov, they can probably hit Prigozhin too.
Russian energy resources obviously had became undesirable in Western World (EU/NATO/Australia etc.), but some developing countries, for example, Pakistan, India and the similar ones do not care about tensions in Europe and see no problem in buying stuff from Russia. So Russia would be able to partially compensate losses from Europe, although it's unclear to what extent.
