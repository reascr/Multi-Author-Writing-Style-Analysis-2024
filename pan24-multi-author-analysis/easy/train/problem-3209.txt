High punishments have never worked to deter crime and violence, the solution is and always has been to solve systemic problems like poverty and hunger, death penalties are just another form of excuse to neglect these issues.
True. So kill everyone and then we don’t have to worry about crime any more. I get the conservative climate policy now. They want every one dead to stop all crime. Brilliant! /s.
Maybe if we considered lying (without correcting at the first available opportunity) to parliament and corruption in government treasonable offenses punishable by death we would get a working government (or at least decimate the current conservative party)?
This is a strawman. The choice isn’t between “execute the convicted murderer vs turn them loose on the populace”.
If convicted of a crime that you feel is worth the death penalty, the choice would be between life imprisonment vs death.
So the question becomes, how many innocent lives are you willing to spend to “upgrade” a murderer from lifetime incarceration to the death penalty?
