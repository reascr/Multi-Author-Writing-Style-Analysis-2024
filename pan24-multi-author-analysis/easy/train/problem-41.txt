Republicans are painfully aware of this fact hence their endless meritless lawsuits, intentional mis-readings of the Constitution to gain unfair advantages, e.g., their Independent State Legislature wannabe theory, also the Red states many hundreds of voter suppression crimes passed off as "laws", their corrupt extreme partisan gerrymandering, etc., etc., etc., - all to deny Dem-likely voters the right to vote or have their vote counted.
Good cop joins force. Good cop notices corruption. Good cop reports corruption. Good cop is fired or relegated to a desk job for insubordination. No more mister good cop.
The party is increasingly turning anti-democratic: disenfranchising voters, gerrymandering, altering laws to give itself wideranging powers over elections, denouncing any result they don't like as fraudulent, and legal challenges like this.
Not at all. And it would naive to think that both parties donâ€™t participate in dirty tricks to get ahead. I mean finding no common ground for years will only lead to ruin for everyone.
