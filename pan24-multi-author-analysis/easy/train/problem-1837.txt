"When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, it promised to “return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” In virtually every instance in which it’s been returned to the people, which has mostly happened by ballot initiative and referendum, the people have acted to protect reproductive rights. Perhaps that explains why less than a year after the fall of Roe, conservative activists are trying to put the issue of abortion access into the hands of a single man for whom no one ever voted.".
The argument itself is bullshit, as removing the approval for "safety" reasons, would logically also need to extend to Tylenol, Viagra, and penicillin, as all of those have higher rates of fatalities due to complications/side effects than the two medications used to induce abortion.
No. It's not a good idea to stock medications. What is a good idea is to work for this ban not to happen, even if that is way more demanding then stocking pills.
