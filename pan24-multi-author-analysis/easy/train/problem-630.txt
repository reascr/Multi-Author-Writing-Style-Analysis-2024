Second, there is something to be said for experience, and that's usually my answer to those seeking term limits as well. It's like any other job, really. Yes, you can learn how to do it quickly, but to really be good at it, to know the nuances, the ways to be best at it, takes time. What if every eletrician service or plumbing service forced people to retire after 12 years? You would have no plumbers who have any real depth of knowledge and the newbies would not have any seasoned pros to learn from. And further, you then have a situation whereby people who are just starting to have a strong grasp on the job, who have really become great after 12 years... are forced out.

No insitutional knowledge retained by senior legislators. If congress members only get two terms, eg, they don't have the time to truly learn how to legislate. The lobbyists who have been around for decades will be the support they will have to lean on to get things done.
