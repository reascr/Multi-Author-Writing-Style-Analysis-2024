You go down the list until you get to the first person who is able to hold the office. Whether the people above them are unable because they have holes in their heads, or have been turned into radioactive ash, or are perfectly healthy but can't hold the Presidency because they're Constitutionally ineligible, it doesn't matter for purposes of succession.
I really like Lieu. He's not a feckless weakling like many of the Dem leaders. He's the one that got Mueller to admit that Trump would have been indicted if he wasn't president.
He's the one that got Mueller to admit Trump would have been indicted if he weren't president. Too bad the Dems just kinda did nothing with that and let Mueller walk it back.
And instead of seizing the moment, the Dem leadership just sort of did nothing and let Mueller walk it back. They should have immediate paused the proceedings right then and there -- emergency recess -- to discuss that blockbuster statement and let it resonate.
