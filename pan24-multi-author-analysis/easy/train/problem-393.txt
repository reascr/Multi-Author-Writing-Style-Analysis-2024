Eh, political alignment is a circle, go far enough right, eventually you're on the left, and vice versa.
Most people imagine the political spectrum as a line, and if you go too far to one side it's common to say you've 'fallen off the left/right'. Now, instead of falling off, just combine the line together and that's my observation. You haven't fallen off, you've just gone to the other side; it's a circle.
