it’s honestly insanely funny that pete buttigieg specifically asked to be transportation secretary bc he thought it would be an easy boost for future presidential ambitions and has just completely fucked every high profile chance he’s has to prove himself.I feel like usually you barely hear about the head of DOT but it’s like he’s gone out of his way to be publicly terrible at his job. He’s not powerless. He’s not being blocked by congress. He’s just a neoliberal ghoul putting corporate interests above us and is hiding it terribly. And for partisans debating which presidential administration is to blame for the Ohio train not having better brakes — the correct answer is that it’s actually three of them: Obama, Trump and now Biden.
Absolutely. If they vote for a person because they want that person in political power to hurt people they don’t like, then they deserve to get that same energy back at them. You get back what you put in.
