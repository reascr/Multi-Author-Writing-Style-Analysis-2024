and I just want to make the Most Incredible Announcement, you've all been waiting for it, you know what I'm talking about, and we're gonna be doing it again, and even the Fake News is lining up can you believe it, all I had to do was say I'm running and all of a sudden, "please, Mr. President, Sir, please can we Interview you?" and I said we'll see what happens. and now you have so many problems that have been happening, Sleepy Joe, the Radical Left, Gas Prices, and it keeps going, it never ends, you know we had everything Perfect when I was in charge, no Sickness, no Death, but then the Democrats came along and they decided that they didn't like it, they didn't kill enough Republicans. it's a real shame, here I am doing so so much for America, and Nancy Pelosi wants to take your Home, take your Social Security, it's unbelievable. I gave you 4 Years of Perfection and now, now we may as well be living in Africa, that's how bad it is. ok, have a good time.

Gen Z just got a taste for smacking down Republican losers, let them absolutely destroy him in 2024.
