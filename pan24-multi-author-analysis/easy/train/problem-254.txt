Totalitarianism and aggression has not been there for 20+ years. He seized opportunity as a fresh face who had tremendous confidence and who could bring Russia out of the depths of a stale economy and languishing global trade and made good on the promise to restore the Orthodox church to the people. He was viewed (understandably) as a hero. His first two administrations were not seen as Totalitarian nor aggressive. He slowly tighened his grip on the nation while earning their love and respect. Once he started stealing land (that most Russians think is theirs anyway) he did it non-militarily. Only in the last 8-10 years has be become more transparent and shown not only the world, but other Russians what he really is. But after 12+ years of brainwashing, how can one logically expect people to see the truth when they live inside it? Lastly, and to your most unsympathetic point, how easily do you expect people to uproot their entire lives, careers and families just because their aging ruler is a bully? And where would they go? Soon-to-be-bombed Ukraine where they were already universally disliked? Latvia, Estonia or Lithuania where Russian is spoken? Those are EU countries. There was no precedent in Russia to claim assylum. Some random country that doesn't speak Russian? Compassion and context aren't the only missing ingredients to your comment. Logic is important too.

No. It's an old political lesson that if you leave the country - you lose your political points inside of it. Sure, western countries would listen to you for some time but it'll soon be drowned with Kremlin paid lobbyists and propaganda in Europe.
