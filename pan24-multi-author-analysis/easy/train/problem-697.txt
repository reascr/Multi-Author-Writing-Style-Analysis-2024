They should just do a vaccine mandate for the entire population and then actually protect their elderly folks from dying from Covid en masse. And then pretend that their vaccines are super effective and that there are no longer any Covid cases. Just mild flu and cold cases, just like in the West.
The totalitarian regime in China are finally beginning to get their "just desserts" in response, and fully deserve any form of civil unrest, civil protest, civil disobedience, destruction of civil infrastructure, and destruction to their national economy, that they may collectively end up receiving.
I honestly have no idea what they are doing at this point. Covid has evolved into one of the 5 most transmissible diseases with the current variants and there are several vaccines China could buy if they don't like theirs. If vaccine hesitancy is a problem, they are a totalitarian government. They can send their vaunted PLA door to door to force vaccinate and as terrible and demeaning that action would be, it has to be less triggering to the population than locking them down for years with no end point in sight.
