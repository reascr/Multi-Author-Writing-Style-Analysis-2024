But the council said exactly the opposite. They would not make any website for a gay couple. Sotomayor had them walk through a hypothetical situation where there is no text or anything endorsing the wedding in the site, such as "God bless this marriage" or anything of that sort. She then used the example a wedding for "Mike and Pat" for a straight but couple, where Pat is short for Patricia. They council said no problem. However, if Pat was short for Patrick, and nothing else changed on the entire website, they would refuse. When Sotomayor tried to probe as to why, since no speech was being compelled, it was the same product, and how this is not blatant discrimination, the response was simply that the creation of the very website is an inherent endorsement. When the court asked how providing other services for a gay wedding, or literally any other services such as catering, isn't an endorsement of some sort of "message", 303s response was because this was literal text and therefore speech compared to other services. They judges then walked them through a handful of other situations whwre the product was speech, and that ruling in 303s favor would enable any sort of discrimination, the counsel simply said "you should not have do anything against your beliefs" no matter the beliefs, which is simply incorrect.
Yes. We need to look at laws requiring people to provide a service to another based on “protections”.
