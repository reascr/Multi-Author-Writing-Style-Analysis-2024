I'm not sure you understand gerrymandering. In order to maximize seats, there will be a bunch of barely safe (+3-5) districts, with the other side crammed into only a few highly uncompetitive districts (+15 or more). This redistricting, is based upon voting data which is historically a low turn out. Thus, when more people vote, there is greater chance for the gerrymanderer that their efforts backfire because they've created a scenario that relies on apathy in the opposition and other causes for low turnout to succeed. This is why, in addition to gerrymandering, Republicans also seek to make it harder to vote for anyone other than those who traditionally vote for them: the retired, and the self employed, wealthy enough they can take a day off without a care.
No thanks. If the government starts picking and choosing what we can think and talk about, it should be destroyed. Twitter is a social media company that can ban you. It's optional to even participate. The government uses violence and threats of violence to enforce law on everybody they can reach. Not even close to the same thing.
Allow republicans to be republicans. If they want to shoot each other and come home to their child having blown their brains out from an unsecured weapon, thatâ€™s their choice.
