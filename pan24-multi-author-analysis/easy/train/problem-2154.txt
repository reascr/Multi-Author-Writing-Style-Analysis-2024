So yes, the war will likely drag on, especially with how Russia is attempting to “dig in” to solidify their current gains. There is economic damage being done, and that will be worse with more recent drops in energy prices, but by and large their population seems willing to accept the necessary privations to continue the struggle. How long they can ultimately continue is likely to be dependent on how quickly they deplete their existing stockpiles and how much of their manufacturing capacity can be diverted to wartime material production.
Already did, thanks. Mostly when it was 120 to $, then it fall back to 51 per $, now it's comfy at 70ish before the holidays, it always tend to drop a bit before the tax period in January, come back to this thread in about Jan20-Feb10 , and see how it is. Probably will be back at 60 per buck which is superfine.
Sanctions were crucial in degrading Russia’s combat and industrial manufacturing power, diminishing their ability to operate their war machine at “full tilt”, but the depth of their cold-war stockpiles and the necessity of continuing imports of gas/oil for Europe gave them flexibility in that and a ton of financial ammo to prop up their currency and pivot their economy away from international markets.
