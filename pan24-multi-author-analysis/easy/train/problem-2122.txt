At least that’s my opinion behind the US not sending Abrams. 1) They would have to cross an ocean to get to a port then take a rail to Ukraine. 2) The use jet fuel instead of diesel and require a totally different set of maintenance knowledge and skills. 3) European NATO members already have Battle Tanks that are more than up to the task of handling Russian tanks, including T-90s and would be much quicker to reach the battlefield than the US could manage. 4) If NATO really gets fully pulled in and the war somehow doesn’t turn nuclear, the European NATO members will certainly need American Air Superiority and Naval Superiority. They have their own small fleets and air assets but comparative with what the US can field they don’t even come close.
Exactly. It's in the West's best interest to not completely demolish Russian forces and allow Russia propaganda to paint a more desperate picture which benefits Putin. The best way is attrition, erode Russians trust in Putin and financially / politically bring Russia to its knees.
