Legitimate question here, so please don't give me partisan rhetoric: can anyone help me understand what the deal with the troop withdrawal was and why are conservatives so mad about it? I've had discussions about it with someone I knew who was conservative, and they just seemed to keep pulling out random points I'd never heard that didn't really seem to be related to the subject. When I first heard about the withdrawal, my thought was "oh, finally...no more troops will be dead and we're finally out of the middle east after decades over there", but conservatives still seemed mad about it. From what I gathered, the extraction was a bit bungled somehow and we left machinery over there, but it feels like extraction was always going to be a bit of a shit show no matter who was in charge while it happened because when you supplant an entire system of government in a foreign nation and then suddenly pull out in a short amount of time, there will inherently be a power vacuum. But that's about all I understand from it. If I'm missing anything, I'm open to listening, just please no conspiracies or unrelated rhetoric.
