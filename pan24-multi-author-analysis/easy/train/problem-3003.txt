Or Russia could just bugger off and leave Ukraine. That would actually work out better. The vast majority of the world is against them. Sweden broke decades of neutrality to join NATO. Finland joined NATO. Their army is in tatters and being chewed up by weapon systems given to Ukraine that are proving markedly superior to the supposedly “decades ahead of the West” Russian systems. Their commanders in the field are bungling operations left and right. Some of their own troops are deliberately injuring themselves or being taken prisoner rather than continue to fight. Scores of their own citizens have fled the country rather than be drafted. Putin and his top people all need to go. And I don’t mean “go” in a nice way.
After Russia is pushed out of Crimea, Melitopol, and ultimately the Donbas, Zelensky should sign whatever idiotic peace demands Russia require such as staying out of Nato indefinitely. As soon as the ink is dry Zelensky should apply for emergency European Union membership and ultimately join Nato at the earliest possibility.
