Found out the parish priest at my primary school was arrested about a decade after I left, after it turned out he abused a bunch of kids in a child's hospital, and was then moved around the country by the church and it was all covered up, and they placed him as the parish priest of a church on a catholic primary schools grounds of all places... until some kids(turned adults) came out and hunted him down and brought it all back up again.
Count yourself lucky. You get to judge them from afar, and pretend you don't have anything in common with them. I have to live with them.
The church's position on homosexuality as a sin means that there is a significant chance that an adolescent with homosexual desires is going to try to eliminate that potential "sin" by going in the other direction because the celibacy of the priesthood can be seen as a safe harbor from their desires.
2.) a basketball coach and substitute teacher in my local (public, secular) high school. Was very well liked by all kinds of staff, kids, parents, etc. Rumors started circulating about him. There was immediate reactionary skepticism. “But he’s such a nice guy” and “well I never saw anything like that from him. This could be slander”.
A bunch of people from the same organisation, committing similar crimes, covered up by high ranking members of that organisation all the way to the top(And this case being an example of a high ranking bishop covering up more than one case of abuse) and then providing an environment for the abusers to repeat their actions knowingly.
Yeah, they shouldn't act like that, blah, blah, blah. But they do. And your religion inspires and enables it.
There's a reason they choose religion. The faith-based nature of the hierarchy means that once you get power, it's harder and harder for it to be taken away. The Pope literally speaks for God on Earth, according to the Catholics. The local Baptist preacher in a tiny Texas town holds the same kind of power on a smaller scale.
