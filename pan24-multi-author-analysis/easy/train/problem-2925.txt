Itâ€™s insulting to the point of absurdity when you compare the easy audacity of a writer hiding behind a keyboard, shielding themselves from productivity with visions of progressive utopia with the hard, relentless, messy, and often unsatisfying struggle of actually accomplishing incremental but significant progress in a barely functional democracy.
I quite civilly agree with you indeed. Even assuming the premise that she merely held the chair and consumed oxygen (which is remarkably inaccurate), the author seems to have missed that, in our system, a politician can only accomplish what their opposition is willing to capitulate. You've succinctly and well-expressed the point.
just because something that exists in the real world (the fact that an open market/republican brain child that was nationalized by the dems helps millions of people) does not fit with your ideology does not mean you should dismiss it if it actually helps people in great numbers, just because the ACA started with Romney doesn't mean that it is not a solid option that was a good idea to build on, fix, and change for the better - stop being a slave to ideological thinking, it's theoretical for a fucking reason - most successful public policy is a mix of both public and private. Jesus people struggle with fucking nuance.
