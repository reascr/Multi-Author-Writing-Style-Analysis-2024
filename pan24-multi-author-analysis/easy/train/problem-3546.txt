Japan's prime minister isn't even pro-LGBT. He was on record of saying Japan needs to be "cautious" about legalizing gay marriage (still illegal there) because of supposed negative effects on the family. Anti-LGBT literature was also privately circulated among politicians of his political party last year, though Abe died shortly after that scandal occurred.
Wow. Nope.Not my intent at all. If I may, your.comment is a little wrapped up in itself. This is how I'd like to unwrap it.
Excellent question. Other cultures who have committed mass murder and genocide such as the United States and UK start by acknowledging that these events occurred and children learn about them in school. That's a good start, and that history is not taught in Japan (ask me about watching a group of exchange students sit through a lecture on the Rape of Nanking). The closest ally of Japan in WW2, Germany, does the same, and takes it further with official apologies to the victim nations and people and a restructuring of their culture. That would be ideal for any nation that has committed such atrocities.
wanna increase population? simple, let the homo couple be, they'll adopt, either domestically or foreign, which boosts population number.
