No fake hypermasculinity. No more unabashed lies. Just shitting yourself and squirming on camera, you and your followers being reminded every day that you are a flawed heap of meat. Just like the rest of us.
Strongmen who favor dictatorial power that fuses the state with Christian religion, devaluing and undermining democracy every chance they get including demonizing the press and isolating and attacking minorities and immigrants. Rich, elite charlatans obsessed with fighting domestic and international battles waged and lost decades ago to bring back greatness that never was. Nepotistic kleptocrats who bilk their supporters while claiming to defend and stand for them. Hypocrite, compulsive liars who believe they can do no wrong, high on their own power and intent on burning down the world around them rather than compromising a single inch. Self-serving sowers of misinformation aimed at muddying the truth and dividing people, convincing them to attack each other so they don’t notice they’re being duped.
