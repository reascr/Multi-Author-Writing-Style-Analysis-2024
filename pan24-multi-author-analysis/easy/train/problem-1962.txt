My brother watches TikTok videos for fun but posts nothing. Retired school teacher who likely has no data to collect of any value. I imagine most of America have nothing of use to a foreign power. Now the insidious part of all of them is how do they systematically polarize us and demonize other this dividing our society? I'd bet this site has some sketchy algorithms and questionable motives. It has allowed Russian supporters to spew nonsense and banned those who confronted them. So is anyplace safe or beneficial?
But Tik-tok's owner, ByteDance is 1% owned in part by the Chinese government (minority shares), which forces it to have a Chinese Communist Party representative on its board of directors, and forcing it to sign a pledge of allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party. Chinese law states that all Chinese tech companies have to surrender all information they have access to upon the Chinese gov'ts request. There's concern that should they have access to the info on your phone, that aggregately (meaning if they get this info on millions and millions of foreigners), it can be used as a Chinese strategic advantage against the foreign country (in terms of having mass information on assembly, association, activity, and private details of millions of foreign citizens in other countries).
