There are actually some pretty good news concerning energy situation in our country. There were no blackouts pretty much anywhere in the country in about a week now, and the reason for that is that we have no energy deficit anymore, itâ€™s actually the opposite, as apparently, we have enough of it now that we can start exporting electricity again. This is seriously just astounding, Russians fired hundreds of missiles at our energy infrastructure in order to cause blackouts, but they completely failed as we can see it now. Of course, a lot of our infrastructure still needs to be repaired after the strikes and it will take months to do it, but the fact we have no blackouts right now is a pretty unbelievable achievement in itself, especially considering just how much of a beating our energy infrastructure took.
I agree. They've been losing 750 troops a day on the peripherary of Ukraine, and their best equipment is destroyed, with little production capacity to build new ones.
But seriously. To really deal with it they need an offensive in the south from Zaporizhia down to Melitopol where Kerch would be in constant range of HIMARS and could be hit like the bridge at Kherson.
