The Kremlin creates assets either with bribery, or Kompromat. They need leverage. Elon doesn't much need liquid, and I doubt Russia could give him enough if he did. And as for Kompromat, the man has zero shame. After several sexual misconduct accusations and a story about literally impregnating a subordinate, he's still doing just fine. I don't think something like a pee-pee tape would bring him down.
So, knowing Russia uses hyper-targeted propaganda campaigns to sabotage Democratic elections via flooding social media with disino: his posting of the widely debunked "Pelosi Husband" conspiracy theory serves Putin and the Far Right's interests immediately, giving credibility to an absurd theory that has served to justify violence against the Right's political opponents.. just a week from a election.
So? You guys play the same fucking game Republicans do, like you think I give a shit about Biden's son Hunter? No, he's not running. It's the same with this, Elon also despises his dad he's made this known.
