What? You're not making sense. You're supposing that to be a "democrat" means to identify solely as a democrat. Most "democrats" I know are extremely disillusioned with the democratic party, and their identification with it is a very incomplete and approximate thing. But they still think of themselves as democrats.
More like half the democrats I know. Probably half a dozen at least are full-blown socialist and several dozen are seriously anticapitalist and lean toward socialism but don't explicitly identify with that group full-stop.

Really? I've seen mention of nationalizing industries. Did you read the green new deal proposal? That's one of its core ideas. Have you seen the serious push to mandate significant employee ownership of companies? I was driving behind a car yesterday for a while with a bumper sticker saying "private property is theft." Did you miss the wealth tax debate?
