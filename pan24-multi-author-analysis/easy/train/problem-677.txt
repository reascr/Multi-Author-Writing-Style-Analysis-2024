You completely miss the point. It's not about these people putting in the work or not, it's the shit they peddle and sell to unsuspecting beginners, making them think they can achieve a physique like that naturally when they really cant. "Just take my 30 supplements and eat some raw liver and you'll look like me." No you wont.
It's weird because I agree with you as far as the base morality goes, but to sort of devil's advocate salesmen like that: if you eat better, workout a lot, and chase that look, you'll probably end up healthier than you were prior if you were less active beforehand and 90% of people who even were naive enough to assume he wasn't on steroids or that they could look like that without them will still find remarkable satisfaction in their change in lifestyle.
Lol. My point is that you dont need 15k of gear to get ripped, and that you pointing that out as why they aren't, is wrong. So you're wrong in what your intent was, but also right that most people don't do that much at the local gym. So if I just said "You're wrong." that wouldn't have been the complete truth now would it?
Its true, but misleading. You will gain more muscle on roids sitting on your couch all vs not doing roids and sitting on your couch all day. Yet you will still be majorly unhealthy and overweight. You'll just have a higher baselevel of muscle than before depending on how you respond.
Your default muscle baseline goes up. It's like when people aren't sick anymore so they go back up to there normal baseline.
