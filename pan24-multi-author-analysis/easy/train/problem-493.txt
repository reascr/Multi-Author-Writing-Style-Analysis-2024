At least the hilarious part is the fucker convoy types are now seeing what an actual tyrant looks like but to all our detriment. Fat fuck Ford needs to fuck right off. Fuck the conservatives. Fuck the right-wing. Fuck 'em all.
Liberals aren't lefties, they're usuallty "pro-business" "relaxed about wealth" neoliberals who emphasize the moral side of liberalism to look pro-people whilst avoiding like the plague any measures to reduce the biguest inequality of treatment and opportunities there is: that connected to wealth.
It sadly is. There is a catch-all in the Canadian Charter of Rights (effectively the written constitution) that a provincial government can pass a law with a 'Not Withstanding' clause added. If they do, the law is not bound by the constitution.
If you want to find the real lefties, look not at the ones ranting about how not enough highly priviledged high middle class women are getting to CEO positions because of a "glass ceiling", but instead at the ones who think CEOs making 350x what the average worker in their company does is far too much or that the money that shareholders make from merelly owning money should be taxed more than the income from work, not the other way around.
It would. The headline is very misleading. The federal government is Liberal (left wing) under Trudeau, the Ontario provincial government is conservative (right wing) under Doug Ford. The title suggests it is a left wing government initiative while in actuality it is a right wing one.
