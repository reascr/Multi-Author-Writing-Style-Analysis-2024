A rise in the occurrence of autism is in and of itself a neutral phenomenon, given that autism itself is neither a good nor bad thing. It becomes less forgivable, however, when the new generations of autistic people are not accommodated or accepted by a society that continues to go out of its way to ensure more of us are born.
I hate guns. I hate them. I hate that children can get ahold of them and use them on each other. I hate that gun ownership is so normalized that children can pose with them on Christmas cards and people cheer. I hate that toddlers can find them lying around the house and do harm to themselves or others. I hate that a father can hear his son killed half a dozen people, and his only thought is relief that his son isn't gay. I hate that this man, who groomed his child to be a hate-filled murderer, was not held accountable for his actions. I hate people who collect these weapons like toys. People who would rather see children die daily than lose their "god given right" to show off their tools of murder.
