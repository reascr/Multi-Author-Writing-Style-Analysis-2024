I think you are gonna have a hard time convincing Ukraine to use diplomacy when a 1/4 of the country is still occupied by Russia and there infrastructure has been destroyed.
Exactly. The US has picked the winning horse. Time to step back and let that horse do the running. Ukraine will determine its own fate, and we need to stand by them with equipment support. They need to know that we do not abandon our friends.
Exactly! People only mention when Ukraine broke them but never Russia. Every debate with any pro Kremlin rat will do that. Never mention how Russia would respect Ukraine sovereignty if it gave up nukes, Russia does what it does, when it does. Their government got no morals and you gotta treat them like animals cause they behave like it.
Diplomacy? Why now. They are winning why negotiate with Russia and end up giving away land when they have momentum right now and can take back what's rightfully theirs. Do you think the people under Russian control want Ukraine to just give up, they will be forever living under the Russian banner if that's the case.
