They've been pushing the narrative that it's really NATO and the US that's driving the war, not the people of Ukraine. This is a 'gotcha' moment in their eyes, even though no one is denying our involvement.
Potentially, yes. It may have also helped prevent as much public support. "We are taking out the military, don't interfere and you'll be left alone" is a pretty strong message. It would also make the "de nazification" angle more realistic. 'we are here for them, not you'.
Clarification before my comment. I am an ex US Army enlisted and officer. I spent my career in logistics. I tend to see war in supply chains.
Well RT and other russian media have basically been going on about Ukrainian neo nazis since 2014 with little traction in western media, statistically compared to other european countries Ukraine doesn't really have a far right problem if you look at hate crime statistics, safety for various minority groups, no systematic oppression, and lack of any kind of nationalistic political presence.
Japan is a good contrast to this. They also had huge support from the locals but because that support was concentrated in cities next to a factory, it was an easy and horrific target to hit. But by the time strategic bombing hit Japan, the war was clearly over. Sure Doolittle shattered the Invincible State but there were years between then and the first bombs from a B-29. The average citizen of Japan would have felt the world closing in as the conditions at home just got worse and worse while the manpower was slowly being depleted.
