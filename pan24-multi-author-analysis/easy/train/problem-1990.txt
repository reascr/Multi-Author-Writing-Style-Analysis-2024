Fast forward, Trump is now President, and he puts forth this guy, a real Chad of a person. And not just because he was a Republican. Oh no, it’s because he was a privileged rich kid who drank and partied and had wild sexual encounters, and kept very concise notes about in the form of calendars. The Democrats found said calendars and tried to use them the disqualify him. But he lied under oath as to what some of the entries met, was stand-of fish with questions, and was ultimately confirmed despite having obviously lied. He basically knew the republicans had the numbers to confirm him, so it really didn’t matter what he said or did, he had the job.
Seriously. Their opinion in Dobbs was such an embarrassingly, ridiculously appalling travesty of a decision. They very obviously began with the conclusion Alito et al wanted to reach, and worked backwards from there, applying whatever flimsy, tortured reasoning they could come up with to support it. Alito's majority opinion literally cited a fucking 12th century commonlaw rule to make a point. Originalist lol. More like fucking medieval.
