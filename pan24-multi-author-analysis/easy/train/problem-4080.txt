I forced myself to read through some comments on conservative news sites. They are acknowledging that Santos is a liar, but they are saying that "Biden and Warren also lied on their resumes, so they would have to resign too." I'm not sure what they are referencing, but the gist is that Santos is going to get sworn in, and Republicans will just consider it a tit for that situation. It's infuriating.
I lied on my resume just once. I got this job and then the first thing the boss asked me to do was the thing I lied about. Holy hell did I turn red haha.
No, we have an ethics committee, but their only power is up to fining someone, usually their punishment is literally a red mark which historically would have been seen by voters as a big deal and the politician would lose their next election, but Republican voters have been convinced by decades of propaganda that unethical politicians are good because they'll defend them from the evil libs.
Do we? Really? Most of us do not lie about our education, job experiences, religion, parentage and grandparents, holdings, income, sexual experience, and many more things in a very public way where anyone can fact check. It is not embellishing, it is out and out being a lying sack of crap.
