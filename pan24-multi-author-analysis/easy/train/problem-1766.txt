And it’s not just black cemeteries. It’s any minority group. The Shakers were based out of Albany, NY. Their leader was Mother Anne Lee. She and many of her acolytes were buried amidst a grove of apple trees. Those trees and graves were there since the 1700’s. Right up until they clear cut the trees and moved the markers (but not the bodies) to build a minor league baseball stadium that few wanted and few attend. There was plenty of other land available, but this was apparently a little cheaper and closer to the airport. They desecrated the grave of an all too rare female religious leader for a second rate stadium. Disgusting.
It's a good idea to take note of what is growing in an area. Old home sites can have wells that can be dangerous, and plants act as history. The article states that the graves were in a cluster of yucca and cedar. Yucca clusters can indicate an old homesite or cultivation, and cedar trees are purposely planted in cemeteries. The surrounding area has been planted in pine, probably more than once. People knew it was there, or they would have cut the area to replant.
