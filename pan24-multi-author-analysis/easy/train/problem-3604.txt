He played the heart strings of his district. He claimed Jewish heritage and family that escaped the holocaust in a place with a large Jewish population. He claimed his mother died (like 3 times now?) in 9/11, the district is in New York. He claimed he’s gay (gay points for a Republican to claim they aren’t all bigots!). He hit every thing to grasp that demographic and won before all the lies came falling out and apart. That’s how.
I doubt he is in that much actual "limbo" with the Brazil charges since we don't have really much of a track record of extraditing really anybody to other countries to my knowledge, especially U.S. citizens. These charges started to resurface right around the time their fascist ex-President/wannabe dictator was seen hanging out in Florida (not that the two are really related) which I think kind of shows that we are not going to be quick to act to remove/blick or prosecute/extradite folks that other countries may currently not like since various nations could move to do the same against pretty much any American for so many reasons in retaliation.
