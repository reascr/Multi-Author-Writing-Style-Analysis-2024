After only a day or two it wasn't even about Hunter Biden's laptop it was about that Facebook and Twitter wouldn't let them talk about Hunter Biden's laptop and how dare they. It's substantially contributed to the a belief that conservatives are discriminated against on social media and would have won if only the Democrats hadn't conspired with social media companies to hide the truth.
Nail on the head here. The fact that the average Republican sycophant is willing to lean into this obviously contrived and stupid subject matter while ignoring their God Emperor wanting to "terminate" the Constitution is very telling about where the Republican party is at right now. They will take any subject and run with it to obfuscate the truth- they have no viable platform the population can get behind. Tax cuts for the Uber wealthy, rolling back civil rights a hundred years or more, taking key positions of power and installing electoral stooges who will further erode the power of the voter; doing away with social security and Medicare, etc. None of.
