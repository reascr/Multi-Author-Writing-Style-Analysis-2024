That's entirely on Russia. If they withdrew peacefully then we'd likely see them trying to sell more arms to ukraine especially since they have a valid reason for buying them. If Russia escalated to nukes them all bets off for the response. Nukes are the troubling part of course. However I'm just saying that this is the rare time that dems are doing the right thing in sending arms, not us troops, and it happens to favor the military industrial complex to the point that it's now the corruption that probably pushing the Republicans onto the correct path of support ukraine.

"Stop trying to make this POLITICAL Both sides need to stop fighting and negotiate Why are you taking The Ukraine's side?
"That's in the past, why are you trying to talk about the past Ukraine just needs to stop fighting Russia and Russia will stop fighting Ukraine".
