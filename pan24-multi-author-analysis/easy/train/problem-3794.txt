Even if the Republicans regain the US House majority, the margin will be so slim that the Democrats will very easily gain it back if they retain the White House in 2025.
Anyway, my point is that if the Democrats retain the White House, it's all but guaranteed the Democrats will have the US House in 2025. If the Republicans are just doing nonsense and obstruction in the US House, they'll be blamed for that. The electorate wants progressive things to pass. It's not like during before when there wasn't as much difference between the Democratic and Republican parties given Texas Governor George Walker Bush ran on "compassionate conservatism" and he was a relatively popular Governor and was relatively popular with Latinos and spoke perfect Spanish, wanted immigration reform, etc.
Opera is Chrome under the hood. They add some personalizations, and that's one of them, but the rendering engine is all Chrome. If tht's something you think you'd use, it won't change much to switch. Opera has a good ad-blocker, as well.
