Title confused me. Had to read the description. At first I thought "menstrual leaves" was referring to some kind of new biodegradable pad made of leaves.
Seriously? Why don’t you let the women experiencing pain rate it. Also, read my link and the hundreds more peer reviewed scientific research articles finding that women experiencing pain and other symptoms that interrupt normal symptoms everyday functioning is more than a “super minority”.
Here is just one study confirming that 1 in 4 women experience period pain distressing enough for medication and disruption of everyday activities. There are loads more. I can send you plenty if interested. I’m guessing there would have to be if countries (spain) and universities are considering monthly menstrual days. Are you a male? If so please include a bit more research before assuming your opinion on the bodily functions and experience of women has any merit. And if you are female? You’re lucky.
And by the way, you keep saying things along the lines of “who am I to say” “let women decide” yada yada yada, I’m not arguing my opinion on menstrual cramps, I don’t give a damn about anecdotal evidence, I’m using data from an intergovernmental organization which specializes in health, medicine and biology, you’re not telling me I’m wrong, you’re telling me the fucking World Health a organization is wrong and to me that’s an absolutely outlandish claim you’re making.
If you had pain at rating Of 5.5 I bet you would want to stay home too. Who are you to judge how painful pain should be to stay home? Give me a break dude. I’ll link more of you need me too. Or better yet? Why don’t you ask some real live women about how productive their work days are when having cramps. Regardless of whether they are “severe”.
