Wow, just wow! This woman is one of the worse human beings that ever walked the Earth. The hypocrisy is off the charts. She cheated on her husband multiple times and has made her reputation by lying and spewing conspiracy theories, yet according to her, Democrats have "turned their backs on God"? smh.

She’s literally repulsive. Disgusting. And a really bad example of someone who’s definitely turned their back on God, multiple times. She needs to have several seats, in the very back, away from everyone else.
Religions are primarily about subjugation. Someone speaks for the god, demands money, goods, or services in exchange for a premium afterlife. Those who don't pay get cursed as heathens and eternally damned for not believing or paying up. Turning your back on religion is turning your back on subjugation. A person can do so much better than getting involved with organized religions.
