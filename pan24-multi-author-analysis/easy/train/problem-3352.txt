Good question: Genocide is a broad term used to refer to a series of actions or general intent to destroy a population.
So while it isn't inherently considered a genocide by itself, it is a frequent component of one. But the word also changed a lot and can be conflated with genocide anyway if you want(full circle, hope you don't feel you wasted your time reading this shit), making the original commenter technically also correct. Idk. I probably could have left it alone and the point wouldn't have changed. Lol.
That said though it doesn't justify them carving up Poland and repressing it's population, in particular regards to the Katyn Massacre, along with invading The Baltic states and Finland, two former Russian Empire territories, to bring them into the USSR. It's definitely terrible and wrong in many ways. I just think it's better to try and analyze the situation to get the big picture as opposed to omitting and blatantly ignoring facts about something in order to justify a narrow minded and extremely personal view of something.
