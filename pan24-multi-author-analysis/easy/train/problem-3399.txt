I'm sure the families and friends of the people being arrested are then seeing the error of their ways and not taking up arms themselves. Lol. The Brookings institute found that targeting killings of Palestinian terrorists by Israel did actually radicalize the people that Israel referred to as collateral damage. Or just be lazy and demand someone else do the work while screaming about how the shabak does the research. All this fighting over fucking fairy tales. Such a joke.
Unless the US government suddenly decides to grow a conscience on the matter and stops unconditionally protecting Israel against international sanctions, the inevitable conclusion to the Israel/Palestine situation is the end of Palestine.
Someone on my block does a crime. Another person on my block praises them for it. OK now to target the whole block and everyone on it?
Israel doesn’t actually belong to the international community of western countries and allies. Notice their regular extrajudicial killings, invasion of sovereign nations, and clandestine military operations that are never confirmed nor denied. Shameful is the fact that they’ve taken the United States lead in this area of unilateral action and “defense.”.
