"Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements â€“ extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics".
1. These convoy idiots spoke and represented almost no one and were an extremely minute portion of the population. Certainly not "truckers" of whom the vaccination rate is in the 90's percent range and which originally was held out as the reason for the protest. It is certainly both a fair and true statement to say that an overwhelming majority of Canadians absolutely reviled the Convoy of Stupidity participants.
2. Tow trucks refused to tow unless forced, so they could tell truckers their hand was forced (i.e. not lose business). In short, don't fuck with the money.
Typical right-wing conspiracy theorists, then. I have naively believed that the protests originated from actually concerned truckers and derailed later on.
