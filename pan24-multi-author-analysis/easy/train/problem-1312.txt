Social media market share was already extremely high amongst teenagers in even 2009 (and in the 90's). So I think it's fair to say that during the early era of social media there was potentially a beneficial correlation in the drop in suicide rate. Back in my teens, I remember the communities being filled with a lot of people were treated fairly poorly and used it as an escape to hostile home or school situations, with interactions being a lot more organic, friendly, and users lives not being consumed with day-to-day media rage/template harassment. These days, those abused individuals can't really outrun their abusers, provided template harassment is pushed by 'role models', and it's very hard to use such an escape without constant exposure to it (either via ads, recommendation algorithms, or astroturfed & organic targeted harassment for their viewpoints).
Not even on a bad day. I personally believe we are more prone to maximum levels of violence than other countries but who knows.
