CCP Gray did a good video on why though. With more resources you can essentially bypass the will of the people because you can afford to be an authoritarian shithead but still have your wealth, power, and influence secured (short of them pulling a violent revolution which can happen). In different countries usually the people are responsible for generating some if not most of the wealth so those in power have to at least somewhat invest in the population to benefit their own wealth in the end.
Exactly. Countries which rely on human capital and market competition tend to be better at generating sustainable growth, and that's in part because such a system basically requires liberal democracy, which itself tends to promote stability. It's a feedback loop.
Politically probably nothing. The best you can hope for is Ukraine winning, joining NATO and then go ham on the soldiers responsible Mossad style. As a German I can only suggest to make the documented horrors of this war as public as possible so no one can look away and deny it, just like we did with the Holocaust. No matter what, Russia already sowed the seeds of hate growing and festering in the scars of all of Ukraine ready to be reaped for the next century.
