From a relatively early date (1543) the rules were to have witch trials in religious courts, but city and estate courts repeatedly and unlawfully claimed jurisdiction in virtually all the cases that resulted in executions. Then, before the craze really kicked off (1672) the death penalty was banned without express consent by the High Court, but those local civil courts just did what they wanted anyways. The High Court actually sent out agents to interrupt witch trials, most notably in Łęczyca 1702 and Przemyśl 1756. Despite that, it doesn't appear that local courts got the message. The Sjem banned trials for witchcraft outright in 1776, but the witch trials survived the end of the Commonwealth and continued into the 1830s despite similar bans from German, Austrian, and Russian authorities.
Okay. Don't want to get all r/atheism on it or anything, I have no personal issue with religion or religious people in general but historically the 'church' worked as a means of control and centralization of power and as a source of fuedal legitimacy.
