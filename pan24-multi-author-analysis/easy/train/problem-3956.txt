Yep, I never blamed people for initially wanting Trump. I got it. The political establishment sucks, so saying yeah let's have someone blow it all up was an understandable position. I even remember thinking wouldn't it be nuts if he actually fixed something. Then he moved the embassy to Israel and I thought "holy crap they've been promising that for years, wow." But to still believe he's doing anything other than blindly stabbing and barely getting one or two things right at this point (more like 5 years ago) is pretty sad. He's proved he's not working for anyone other than himself a hundred times a week since 2016.

Weisselberg's testimony has not implicated Trump was part of the tax scheme criminal conspiracy, so unless the civil suit against the Trumg Org uncovers new info that Trump was part of the scheme to defraud banks by elevating the value of assets, it is unlikely he will be charged criminally as an individual in NY.
