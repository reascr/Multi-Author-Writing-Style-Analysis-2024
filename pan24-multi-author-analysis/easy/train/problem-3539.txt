Turkey allying with Russia would be very bad for Turkey. Russia is a fading power, the losing side. There is zero chance that Turkey would ally with Russia. Most of Turkey's military equipment is of American or European origin, and it would be a disaster for them if they lost access to spare parts and upgrades, not to mention western intelligence and the NATO nuclear umbrella. Turkey has a long, as well as recent, history of military coups (4 times since 1960, and an attempt as recently as 2016). There is no chance that Turkey's military would tolerate Erdogan fucking up relations with the West so badly as to put Turkey's national security at risk. Especially not because of some provocation over the Quran.
Exactly. "just" create an arctic security alliance consisting of the Canada, US, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Denmark with you basic mutual defense pacts and the problem is solved. Make it 99% the same as NATO with some different logo on their patches. Make sure to get some cross agency training with NATO and call it a day.
