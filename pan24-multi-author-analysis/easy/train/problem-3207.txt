Not just that. Russia single-handedly obliterated every notion of “calm” in the countries that border Russia/Belarus/Ukraine. I mean…. People didn’t sleep here for the first month, I think. Everybody reported about having the state news channel open during their days as the state news channel had four Ukraine focused time slots every day for the first few weeks. There were reports of elderly women especially needing psychiatric care because they started to fear that Russia would invade us or started to relive nightmares of WWII and soviet soldiers looting and raping women.
Nah. Germany thought they were tying Russia to them just as much as Russia were tying Germany to Russia. It wasn't lack of a capacity for long term thought, it was just long term thought based on an incorrect premise. They've been disabused of that notion now.
The successful rehabilitation of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan involved public trials and executions for many of their leading officials, occupations of their territory, and restructuring of their political systems. The war itself involved the deaths of millions of Imperial Japanese and Nazi German citizens. This wasn’t part of the reconstruction, but it was a necessary precondition for them.
Yeah, definitely. In the new cars market EVs in Germany already had a share of 33%. Admittedly a lot of that was subsidy related, but even without that, the yearly average was 20% or so. That's an important message. It's not a niche product anymore. So companies will need to invest to catch up, which will make it easier for the users who adopt later or want to buy used cheap in 2-3 years.
