I’m not saying he isn’t a piece of shit. He’s supported the overturning of Roe v Wade, he co-sponsored the Graham-Cassidy amendment to the Affordable Care Act in 2017 (an amendment that would fail the Jimmy Kimmel Test; after stating any legislation he would support must meet the Jimmy Kimmel Test… on Jimmy Kimmel’s show.), and much more shitty things.

The fucker absolutely should know that this behavior is absolutely representative of the Republican Party, especially the Louisiana Republican Party.
Odd. He was the literal poster boy for your greedy racist sexist homophobic burn it all down party of tantrum throwing toddlers for the last 6 years. Methinks backpedaling out of this one will be tough, but you'll give it your best shot; you'll cry on the stand and say "I don't remember" or "I can't recall." Just remember your GOP training. Deny. Deflect. Pretend like you believe in God.
