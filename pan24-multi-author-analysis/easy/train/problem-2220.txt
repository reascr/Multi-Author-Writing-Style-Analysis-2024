Although i call bullshit on the running the country part. It aint hard to find petty dictators willing to try no matter how fucked up the country is. I'd argue no one person in the military has enough support to run the country or even take control of it, but that the military is united in the idea that Ukraine is not their war, and they probably have a healthy fear of Russian and not Ukraine to go along with it.
Oh I gotcha! Thanks for correcting me. Sorry. Hey what does (/s) mean. For some reason a bunch of ppl have been using this out of nowhere and I have no idea what it means. Lol.
Russia does not have the resources and capabilities to even support offensives on all of the fronts they're operating on right now, Bakhmut and Donetsk region being the only place where they've been able to mount offensives, with very little success. Adding a whole new front from Belarus to go to Kyiv, when Ukraine has been fortifying those positions for months now would be ridiculous. They wont do it because they cant.
With the sheer amount of Russians being sent to slaughter, and the world wide coverage showing the revolts against oppressive regimes in Iran and China you would thing that the Russian population would clue in their just being used as cannon fodder for Putins ego and turn their anger on him until heâ€™s out or dead. Wake up Russia.
