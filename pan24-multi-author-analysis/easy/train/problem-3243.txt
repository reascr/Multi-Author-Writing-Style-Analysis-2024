All gun regulation has come from SC rulings, and frankly it's a never ending mess with the limits being pushed all the time. And the "shall not be infringed" crowd has a big up in that pesky "shall not be infringed" part. It's as if instead of specifying the right of a jury of peers, no cruel and unusual punishment, etc. they just said "the rights of anyone accused of a crime shall not be infringed" and called it good. A mess.
The past nearly thirty years since Kleck's survey was originally published should have provided overwhelming empirical evidence in support of his conclusions if they were accurate. Even without more aggressive research into defensive gun use, police reports alone should provide at least some support of his claims, even if only at a broad level. They don't.
It'll be death by 1000 cuts, like with abortion, where they can claim it's still legal and you have the right, but there's only one clinic in the whole state with a 30 day wait on appointments and the doctors have to be credentialed with the nearest hospital, and there's a 3 week waiting period before you can schedule an appt, and you can't get an abortion after 6 weeks gestation, and you need an invasive ultrasound and a 3 hour lecture on how you're killing a baby.
