Laxalts lead in Nevada has shrunk under 800 votes and all the projections now have Nevada going to the Democrats. That will make the runoff in Georgia somewhat moot for control of the Senate. More than likely that will depress the Republicans turn out in Georgia. How this could even be a close race is a disgrace. A man who could barely break 90 on an IQ test who every time he opens his mouth shows his ignorance with sending good air to China and getting back bad air and with every other thing that he says that is just absolutely incredibly stupid. Who has lied, cheated and stole. Whose claim to fame about being a businessman is really about using convict labor that he pays them nothing and threatens them if they don't work overtime and produce in his chicken processing plant he'll send them back to prison. He talks about Black men not stepping up in their families and has run away from all his children. Whose son talked about being homeless and not having a father. Two ex-girlfriends reporting that he forced them to have abortions paid for them and now is against abortions for other people. You couldn't pick a worse candidate but then again he's a Donald Trump wanna be and one would think we'd have learned what happens when you choose somebody who is a grifter a narcissist and a psychopath.
