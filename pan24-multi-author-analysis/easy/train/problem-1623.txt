Lauren Opal Roberts born: 12/19/86. Her mother Shawn(a) Roberts Bentz was 18, unmarried when Lauren was born. on her 1986 Florida birth certificate, nor in the local newspaper's birth announcement. Stan was 33 when Lauren was born, and he was about 15 years older than her mother. The paternity dispute story linked above has so many twists and turns that you could not make this up if you tried. Shawna was 17 when Lauren was conceived, and Stan likely thought he would get in trouble with the law for impregnating someone so young. He did not provide child support.
