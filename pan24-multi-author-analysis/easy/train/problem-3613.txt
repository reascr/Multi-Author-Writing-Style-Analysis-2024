My mother-in-law is my bellwether for how the right is feeling because she's basically a parrot of Fox News. She said "He needs to go away! People are sick of him." Mind you, she didn't come to this conclusion because of his disastrous performance as president, his embarrasing behavior as a statesman, his criminal handling of COVID resulting in hundreds of thousands of excess deaths, his endless corruption, his thousands of obvious lies, his election denial, his refusal to peacefully transfer power, or his planned coup. No, she said this because he's now costing them elections. They're coming to the right conclusion, but for all of the wrong reasons.
The vast majority of them enthusiastically supported him, intentionally twisted facts, lying and compromising their stated beliefs/oaths in the process. Now they think they can pin it on him. They are just as corrupt now as they were when they pushed the election lie, ran interference for the seditious attack on the capital, backed him as he was caught most likely selling secrets to our enemies.
