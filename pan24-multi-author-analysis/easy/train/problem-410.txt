Another possible location is a tomb that Cleopatra herself built in the city, but an earthquake caused it to fall into the sea. Maybe this guy was trying to find an entrance?
The British museum took historical artefacts to preserve them from the robbers and looters who were otherwise either going to melt them down or sell them to the next highest bidder, and whose only claim to the items was that theyâ€™d killed the people who previously lived in the area where they were buried.
Would be cool? Mmmmmm....aybe? Problem with Alexander is his body was kidnapped by his general in Egypt who took it to claim his rightful ownership of Alexander's empire. And then the story goes that he moved his body from the coffin to some other shitty coffin. Point is, while that'd be awesome to find Alexander, at the same time it'd be a let down because all you're going to find is his mummy (if it's still in good condition) inside a shitty old box (if it's still in good condition). You're not going to find any of his treasure or prized sword or any special relics because ANYTHING of value besides his corpse would have been probably stolen by Ptolemy when he stole the body and put it in a different coffin. It's likely anything stolen could have been melted down by a later generation. After Ptolemy, Christians moved in and tore down anything worshipping Alexander or Ptolemy because it's not a Christian idol. Then the muslims ransacked the place and destroyed everything the Christians built (they had turned the temple of Alexander into a church). So, yeah, if anyone finds Alexander, it'd be cool, but it'd also be boring because there won't be anything of any value. There will not be gold, relics, or scrolls. MAYBE wall painting, but I doubt it because Ptolemy seemed like a jackass or at least his son/grandson was because they replaced the worship of Alexander with themselves.
