You might think it's BS but I work in the energy field and (valid) complaints to the state public utility commissions absolutely create (uncomfortable) pressure that management at utilities feel and try to address (within practical reason).
Doesn’t last as long??? I want to see data. I want to see data that includes the cost of upkeep and repair. That factors in the trucks and manpower. That shows why, literally every new subdivision has underground lines. It’s 100% cost and DTE profitability. I’m in metro Detroit and have an 80+ year old bent power line in my backyard that blocks a beautiful view and has gone down several times, but they don’t replace it. I have lost power dozens of times over the past 8 years and submitted many complaints. They do nothing and don’t have to. They provide $20 vouchers for hundreds of dollars of lost groceries. It’s a real pity. I can actually afford to take the hit, I cannot imagine a family on a budget losing grocers because our power company is too cheap to make infrastructure investments. It’s a complete disgrace.
