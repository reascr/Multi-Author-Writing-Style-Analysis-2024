The UN exists as a way to provide other member nations to diplomatically resolve their grievances in a public stage and act as a buffer between the major world powers to prevent another world war between them, by only acting on measures all 5 Permanent Security Council Members consent to.
Pssh. Fuck Russia and fuck anyone who thinks Russia is the good guys. Even Russians hate living in Russia.
Mindful of the failures of the League of Nations in the 1920s, where powerful member states would walk away from the coalition whenever it limited their ability to act on the world stage, the UN Security Council with it 5 permanent members was created not to promote peace but to solidify the power structure of the world to align with the Victors of WWII; who provide the lion's share of support to maintain the institution.
I completely agree. They still have a large nuclear arsenal and while their military has left much to be desired in Ukraine, can still affect the world. If the goal is to prevent another world war, we need Russia on the council.
