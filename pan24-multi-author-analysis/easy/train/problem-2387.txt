Biden hid the document scandal from the American people by not contacting NARA as soon as he knew the documents had been removed from their proper location, by refusing to return the documents for months after NARA came looking for them, by refusing to negotiate with DOJ after they became involved, by ignoring a subpoena for the documents’ return, and by falsely certifying that a thorough search had been conducted and a single folder of documents was all that was found. Furthermore, he made various contradictory excuses like “The FBI planted the documents,” “I declassified all the documents by thinking about it,” and just recently “I only took empty folders marked ‘CLASSIFIED’ as souvenirs.” On top of it all, he filed a nonsense lawsuit in front of a toadie judge which stalled the DOJ investigation of his actions for months.
