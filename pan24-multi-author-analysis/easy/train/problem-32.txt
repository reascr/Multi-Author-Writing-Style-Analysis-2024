SCOTCH PLAINS – Governor Phil Murphy today signed A4769/S3214, delivering on the promise he made in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Bruen decision when he unveiled a comprehensive legislative proposal to maintain New Jersey’s status as a model for gun safety by strenhening restrictions for who is eligible for a public carry permit, and establishing a list of places where people with carry permits cannot bring their firearms.
Absolutely false. Restrictions & taxes on the sale of alcohol & tobacco significantly reduced usage & deaths from both. No reason the same wouldn't hold true for guns. And most people refrain from committing crimes because they're afraid of the consequences. Where are you getting your info from?! Lol.
In addition to these three categories, this bill sets a default rule that firearms cannot be carried on private property, including homes, businesses, stores, and houses of worship, unless the property owner expressly communicates permission through express consent or specific signage. The only exceptions to these rules are for law enforcement officers or private security guards.
