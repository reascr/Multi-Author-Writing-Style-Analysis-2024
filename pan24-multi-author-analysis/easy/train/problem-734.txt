DeSantis is actually worse on most of the culture war stuff that independent and moderate voters, and more importantly younger voters generally, are angered by and opposed to. He isn’t as repugnant as Trump, but he is further to the right and has no real chance of running in the middle because the Trumpy base (if not Trump himself) won’t let him. I think we will see that primary Ron DeSantis and General Election Ron DeSantis are pretty much the same guy, but a national election for President is a lot harder to win than a “landslide” in a state so heavily gerrymandered in Republicans’ favor that DeSantis could be in a coma and he would still win gubernatorial elections until the day he died if the party nominated him.
he still had an adoring base. Ive seen Maga people posting that this was a big win for them because they have control of the house and senate. (And ues I know its still being called but this is what they think) he has a core of delusional followers that will not abandon him.
