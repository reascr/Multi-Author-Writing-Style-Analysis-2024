I play an early release of a game by Ukrainian developers. Their whole Steam feed is shiposting about Russia then casually mentioning a update about the game. In a dark way, it's hilarious.
Media in Europe and America, particularly because of the Kosovo conflict, has massively oversimplified the Yugoslav wars and the narrative that emerged seems to have put most of the blame on Serbs as a whole, underestimating the guilt of other groups (it is hard for people to understand a conflict where basically everyone is the bad guy, if i may be simplistic) and also not understanding the complex political differences between for example Serbian people, the government in what is now Serbia, and the Serb paramilitary groups who committed the worst atrocities. They are connected, but not the same. Serbs are resentful of this. This makes the internal politics of questions like who to align with very difficult.
Exactly. If they side with unilateral breakaway states and support separating territory by force, it invalidates their own position in regards to Kosovo.
I agree. That's why both Serbian and Albanian war criminals need to be prosecuted. Same goes for NATO that killed both Serbian and Albanian civilians.
It's complicated. NATO bombed the shit out of Serbia with methods most people in NATO countries would call barbaric in any other circumstances, and before that the countries that you mentioned were nothing but happy to endorse the dissolution of Yugoslavia without any consideration of the consequences, because commies bad and freedom good.
