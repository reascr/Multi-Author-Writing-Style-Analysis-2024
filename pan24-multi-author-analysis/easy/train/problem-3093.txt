>Butler is at her best when exposing and seamlessly weaving together the long arc of racist evangelical practices from the days of slavery to our own generation. (About half of the book covers national politics in the post-1970s era.) She offers a refreshing corrective to common popular misconceptions about 19th-century evangelicals and race, such as the notion that evangelical theology “required” believers to be abolitionists and that only Southern evangelicals were racists. She unflinchingly confronts evangelicals’ complicity in America’s lynchings (over 4,000, according to NAACP records), their support for Lost Cause ideology, their history of opposition to interracial marriage, and their contemporary insistence on a colorblind approach to race.
Indeed. You can justifiably rant about this should the Dems eliminate the Legislative filibuster or somehow wind up with 60+ Senators, but when voters keep making sure that there's 40+ GOP senators we can't get meaningful answers helpful Democratic Party goals through the Senate. Not in the face of the current GOP.
