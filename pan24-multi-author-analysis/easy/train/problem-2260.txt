Florida is more white passing then white, and more metropolitan than Rural- I’d argue most of Florida- basically all of Florida south of the panhandle is just a slightly different demographic from the “baptist blob” that forms the south & the southern parts of the midwest( I call it the baptist blob because when you look at a map of dominant religion per county in the USA- it just looks like a giant blob)- basically anywhere where slaves were owned & confederate soldiers fought- whereas Florida south of the panhandle wasn’t settled until the 1920s due to the invention of AC & refrigeration- they all came from other parts of the country but not the south itself. I live just south of the blob in a blue county surrounded by Red, where I live it feels like democratic America- but a 15 kilometer drive in any direction is trump country. Guess this is the benefit of living in a college town- don’t have to deal with maga idiots despite living in a dark red state.
Exactly. In the primaries last time, trump was only getting 20-30% of the vote, but there were so many establishment candidates splitting the remaining vote that trump still came out on top. If there are too many egos in the clown car again, trump will win again.
