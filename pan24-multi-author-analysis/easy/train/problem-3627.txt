They’ll edit the shit out of it, provide a sweet little narrative, and create a further division that will allow Republican politicians to do and say whatever they want so long as the enemy (Dems) get put in the “place”. It’s already bad. They already put out messages that divide in ways I thought I’d never see, but I feel like giving a large Fox News audience a controlled message that will be supported by cherry picked clips will have terrible power over the perceptions of what our democracy should be. It’ll influence too many people that the events on Jan 6 were warranted and appropriate. There will be a consistent narrative from all right wing media and politicians that has the potential to create the gap too far to ever bridge. Republicans’ view pf democratic as enemies will become more solid and provide the sort of hate that propels similar, if not worse, events like Jan 6.
