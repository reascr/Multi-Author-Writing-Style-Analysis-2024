But it's wasn't even the ambulance that was stuck, an ambulance was at the place of the crash (cyclist run over by a truck) the car that was blocked by the trafficjam was only there to bring special equipment to free the victim from the truck, as stated above it wouldn't even have helped the victim survive, if it had been there in time.
Those protests will result in nothing. They won't change anything, but make people mad about enviromentalists. And that's what these people don't get. They think they are making a statement, that the more extreme their action get, the more successfull they will be. But the truth is that they are fighting against windmills.
Possibly. Still, the headline of the article is disingenuous and deserves to be called out as such. If there is a road block because of construction, you wouldn't read a "department that initiated road construction blocks emergency services from helping". Why not mention that the cars on the road equally blocked the emergency service's access to the crash?
