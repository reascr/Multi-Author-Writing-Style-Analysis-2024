It a sort of willful ignorance, considering how it was basically known that large swaths of the American backed Afghani government was maintained by the influence of warlords the US bribed into compliance. The Afghani army was entirely dependent on US supplies (gotta create your customer base I suppose) and on the presence of US personnel to fight their battles. Above all else, the US and the previous Afghani government failed to convince a significant enough portion of the country that they should be considered a preferred choice over the Taliban. Considering the influence of the previously mentioned warlords and how the US enabled them, including punishing US soldiers who reported warlords' "use" of child slaves, it's not hard to see that the government itself reflected that corruption and dependence.
Not really. The Taliban resumed their offensive right after Trump's deadline passed, so Biden was up against a ticking bomb. No idea how people are blaming Biden when Trump did nothing to make sure the deadline could be met.
