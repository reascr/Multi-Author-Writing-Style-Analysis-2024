I think you fell into the "fake news" problem. Originally a lot of outlets reported that people had spotted T-62s. But what they actually saw were T-62M and T-62MV. We know that that's what they are.... because Ukraine ended up capturing all of those tanks. They were the most advanced tanks in Ukraine's inventory along with the T-90A, T-90M, and T-90S that were also captured.
Russia has almost 4x as many tanks sitting in storage as it has deployed... and almost 10x as many armored vehicles.
Russia has a little under 40,000 infantry fighting vehicles sitting in storage. If we're calling tanks and IFVs the same thing, that would put Russia at 50,000 "tanks" to America's 14,000. 50,000 sounds like way more than 14,000 to me.
Wishful thinking on irans part, russia needs every plane they make right now and is not going to be sending them to Iran on due date or anytime after that Iran will learn the lessons everyone else has learnt that russia will tear up any agreement if it suits them, and they have received what they wanted from Iran, what are they going to do if putin or the next leader just says no your weapons did not help us win the war so no fighter jets for you.
