But Bernie has awoken more class consciousness in recent years than any other public figure, after decades of organized suppression and attacks by capital interests. There's still a very long way to go, but it's incredible what he's accomplished as a single person in a deteriorating system designed to mute and vilify people like him.

$400? God damn you’re lucky! I pay over $900/month for my medicine not to be covered, and to have to pay for every single visit out of pocket because I haven’t hit my deductible (which is over $7000 dollars)… and I’m a public school teacher, so fuck me.
2. He lost South Carolina on account of the fact that he refuses to reach out to other politicians for their endorsements while Biden is happy to do it.
