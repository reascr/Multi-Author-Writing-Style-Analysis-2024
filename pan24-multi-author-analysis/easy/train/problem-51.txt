You gotta do some more research on Nixon. To call one of the major people behind the “War on Drugs” “less corrupt” is wild. Dude started a war on substances (minorities and leftists) after already seeing prohibition failed… just to jail minorities and leftists. Creating a boogie man so that you can bust into your enemies meetings and jail them is far from not corrupt. Nixon also went behind the scenes to negotiate with Vietnam to keep the war going so he could win an election. Nixon is scum just like Trump and trying to separate them only downplays the disgusting politics that led to Trump being able to openly commit crimes and be corrupt with no consequences. A majority of Americans is absolutely indifferent about Trumps crimes and that’s because of the environment created by guy’s like Nixon. Roger Stone is a common denominator between the two… do I need to say anything else?
