Duterte is a weak and dumb fool. He kissed the CCP's ass and they repaid his asskissing by sending navy fleets disgused as "fishing fleets" to overfish all the seafood in PH's EEZ. Then he said stupid shit like "We can't do anything, the CCP will kick our ass if we defend our sovereignity" instead of "PH will not hesitate to send our coast guards to chase off those illegal fishermen". What a joke of a leader.

Excellent. The US and Philippines just recently agreed upon at least 9 bases at last since fter around 3 decades. A formal alliance of hopefully finally JP, PH, US, AUS, and SK should be made.
