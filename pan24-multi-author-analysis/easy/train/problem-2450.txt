There has never been a single person in Canada killed with a legally owned AR-15, yet Trudeau decided every law-abiding owner of an AR-15 in Canada, who had to undergo a thorough background check to get their license and has an automatic background check run on them every day, had to have their property confiscated. At the cost of billions of dollars. To save zero lives.
Beyond these senseless attacks on millions of the most thoroughly vetted, heavily regulated and law abiding Canadians while ignoring the true causes of gun violence, all of this government's gun control announcements seem to be suspiciously timed to distract from whatever negative press they're receiving at that given moment. Many of theses laws bypass the legal, democratic processes that are the foundation of our country's system of government. Additionally, this government has thus far been unwilling to provide evidence that any of these measures will do what they say they will, despite this evidence being requested by media outlets and witnesses in the ongoing hearings.
