In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

It's a self-perpetuating cycle. People typically start drinking "diet" sodas to lose weight. But aspartame, the sweetener in traditional diet sodas, has a tendency to cause eye drinker to feel less full, causing them to eat more than they would otherwise.

Not realizing the soda is part of the problem, they continue drinking diet sodas, possibly telling themselves they can't go back to regular until they lose weight.
