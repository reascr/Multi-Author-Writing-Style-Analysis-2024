Of course they found everything. Of course they slammed our heads onto the hood of the car while cuffing us a couple of long haired hippie guys with Phish and Grateful Dead t-shirts on. Of course they seized my trusty 1986 Toyota Corolla. Of course they made us pay $2000 bail after waiting the weekend in jail to see the judge. Of course they made us sign a promise to come back for court in 6 weeks. Of course we bailed on the Greyhound to Chicago the very afternoon we got out on bail. Of course we said, Show me the Border as we approached Illinois, the lights of St. Louis flickering in the distance.
