You cant burn and smoke something without major health impacts long term. Yes 200 cigs a day is worse then a joint once a night, and no they dont really normalize for that outside of self reporting. Cannabis smoking has most of the same carinogens, you just dont have the wide spread study group as you did when nearly every adult pounded only tobacoo for an entire generation and every indoor space was filled with smoke.
First major paper on harm scale cites that a probable key factor on the data is the average tobacoo smoker smokes 20 times a day compared to a cannabis smoker who roughly smokes 2-3 times a week.
these harm scales do not have vape on vape controlled studies because again illegal and unregulated, but we already know the lack of regulation of cannabis vape has caused exponentially more harm through additives then tabacoo vape. Not the drugs fault, but it shows both the unscinetific study group, and the real world issues with cannabis ingestion.
