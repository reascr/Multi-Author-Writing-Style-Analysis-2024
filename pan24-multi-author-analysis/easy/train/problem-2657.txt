I looked it up and I remembered wrong - the project manager for Swedish Eurovision was like “oh wow I didn’t think they’d be crying about it” and sent flowers to the Russian embassy with an apology that went something like “we don’t regret it but I’m sad you’re upset”, acting on his own, and then our public television company apologized to the Swedish people for his apology as they weren’t standing behind it.

It’s not really Islam in particular, it’s just a characteristic of Authoritarian regimes. It’s a threat to their image of legitimacy and power if they let humorous or subversive media like this spread.
