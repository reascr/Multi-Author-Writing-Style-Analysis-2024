The 2020 elections saw 77mil votes for democrats and 72mil votes for republicans. Gerrymandering affects election results, not votes cast. Half of the country is voting for this shit. You don’t have to believe it, the numbers don’t lie. The longer you take to accept that the longer it will take us to develop a plan that actually works. Without gerrymandering, yes dems would control the house. But I’m talking about the raw number of people voting for them. Why? Because these are the people ready to commit violence. Even so, these district maps are facts, we can’t change them. Saying “but only if there wasn’t gerrymandering” doesn’t do shit to stop the Republic from falling. So again, how was this past week a victory for democracy when it’s all but certain republicans will control congress for the next decade?
Can someone explain to me how winning by razor thin margins is a victory for democracy? Half of the country is voting for a party that not only wants to destroy liberal democracy, but they don’t even have plans to address kitchen table issues.
