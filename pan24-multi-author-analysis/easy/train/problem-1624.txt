I still don’t enjoy it as a secular Turkish person at all, I fucking hate Erdoğan and his illiterate Islamist goons, but still, it’s true that we’re not at the same level as Middle Eastern countries: It’s still not illegal to be an LGBTQ+ person, it’s still not illegal to be an atheist person, it’s not illegal to express criticism against Islamic institutions.
