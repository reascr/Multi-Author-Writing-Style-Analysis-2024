The reason they loved him is because all the others sounded like every politician, saying nothing, yet somehow reading a script. Trump, obviously, broke the mold and won the election, which wouldn’t actually be a bad thing if it was based in sanity, but Trump was a maniac. That came back to bite him when covid happened and we couldn’t have an orange rhinoceros destroying the White House anymore. Denying the election was the cherry on top. We saw the same Trump effect this election. The thing about 2024 is, at minimum 15% of republicans see Trump as being ordained by God to save America. Anyone who takes him on will attract their ire and protest. Desantis is also incredibly weak in an actual fight, which will also help seal the factions of a split GOP. Trump is also facing legal troubles that might incentivize him to run 3rd party (I like to dream). American politics can be surprising, but it’s hard to imagine how this works out well for republicans.
