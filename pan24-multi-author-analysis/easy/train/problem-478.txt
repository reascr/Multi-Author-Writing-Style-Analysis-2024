Ukraine won't negotiate until it gets back all of its territories, and the Russians don't see Ukraine as a legitimate state. Diplomacy between the two is impossible.
Negotiation, dialogue, diplomacy? How is "get the fuck out of my house" not clear enough? This is not a land boundary dispute (lol, wtf?).
Ukraine: "Remove all your troops and equipment from all areas of Ukraine and Crimea, cease all bombing, missile, and drone attacks, issue a public apology for all the death and destruction Russia has caused, surrender perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity to the World Court for prosecution (including Vladimir Putin), and pay reparations for all the damage done since you began your illegal and immoral invasion of our sovereign country.
Same with my mom. I try to make it simple to her. I don’t support war or countries that invade other countries. But I do support anyone standing up to a bully. And Putin is a bully. And if we can help Ukraine while simultaneously helping weaken our biggest rivals military power in the process it’s a win win. And not that I care much about our defense contractors but this is gold for them, and their learning a shit ton about their weapons systems in modern day urban environments. Most of the info we learned in Afghanistan wasn’t against modern urban military like Russian forces. It’s a win win for us.
