Food prices would go up, even in rich countries. Look what gas prices going up did in Europe. I think that + the news cycle would put food waste in the focus. Obesity being solved was a bit exaggerated but it'd certainly help. Militant vegans being happy referred to anything human-edible getting redirected away from being used as cattle feed (including growing human-feed instead of cattle-feed on any fields where that is feasible) as well as some environmentalists' "degrowth" and "depopulation" attitudes.
Ya but snow piercer is more modern. Frostpunk takes place during the victorian era. And fostpunk no idea how earth became a snowball while snow peircer its because of global warming so they put a bunch of chemicals in the air to cool it down. Well worked too well.
It's just cruel that countries that had little to do with the past 75-80 years of global capitalism (in many cases being the targets of state-sponsored racism) are on the front lines of dealing with its impacts while upper-middle class and above, "native" Westerners only have to deal with higher prices.
