Quite frankly, selling the M1A1's would be a disservice almost. They rely on American style mastery of logistics, production, high tech manufacturing, and force projection. It takes THREE HUNDRED gallons of fuel to run the tank for 8 hours. To just non combat idle it needs a gallon of fuel every 6 minutes. At combat idle.. a gallon every 2 minutes. It needs a full overhaul every 12000 miles (engine and trans out.) They also have traction issues in the snow, and require special cleats to be installed in winter conditions. But the tank will destroy the cleats with its weight if they are driven too long on hard ice or concrete.
Never underestimate the Ukrainians. They have shown themselves to be incredibly capable and creative on the battlefield, ffs their unit coordination system achieves 30 seconds from "target spotted" over "clear to fire" to "target destroyed", orders of magnitude faster than Nato, much less Ruzzia.
It is silly isn’t it? Pretty much the only thing that is taken out an Abrams is another Abrams or maybe a TOW missile. They’re tough as hell and have both reactive armor and the Trophy system, active protection against infantry fired antitank weapons. US gave the system to the Israelis and they Merkeva tanks have used them to great success.
