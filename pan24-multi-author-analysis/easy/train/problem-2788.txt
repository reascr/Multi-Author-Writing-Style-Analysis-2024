You know what’s worse about that guys comment? He’s probably talking about an article posted on this sub that comes from yahoo.com and the source of which is the Ukrainian intelligence agency and at the beginning of the article there is a picture of a university document from Tomsk state university outlining the situation for the Russian analogue of ROTC students (these are the students who study in military faculties).
