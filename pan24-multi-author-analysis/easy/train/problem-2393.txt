Maybe someone in Russia had a lightbulb moment and realized that attacking Japan would be an automatic declaration of war from the USA.
Hokkaido. Its huge, next to Russia and the Sakhalin islands. The farthest parts are not that inhabited relative to the rest of Japan and even the other cities in Hokkaido. I bet they could probably get a foothold relatively easily with stealth and timing. However, I think it might be hard to hide the troops massing on the east side of Russia, and re-supply would be a nightmare.
Seriously, wtf. It's not alleged at all. The Empire of Japan was a whirlwind of rape, torture, and massacre that swept through SEA and China. Their human experiments were at the very least as bad as the Nazis. Actually, not really "human experiments," because the hundreds of thousands of test subjects (70% Chinese, major minority Russian) were referred to as "logs," "Manchurian monkeys" or "long-tailed monkeys." And they were documented to be having fun with it all.
Exactly. They were getting the same treatment Ukraine is getting today. The Lend Lease act gave CCCP roughly 152 billion dollars in aid (adjusted using 2020 encon stats, number would be higher now) between 41-45. For reference, Ukraine has received roughly 20 billion thus far. CCCP gets absolutely dumpstered by Axis powers without massive aid.
