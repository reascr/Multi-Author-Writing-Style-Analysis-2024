I'm basically an anti-authoritarian Socialist who wants a living wage, healthcare for all and despises the idea of billionaires . But yes, these people would be nowhere near my halfway decent voting record radar. And, while the line item veto is scary in a way, I wish we had it. The Congresspeople would have to craft simpler legislation if they were concerned about pork just being slashed (not like all of it would be), but these Bible sized bills that nobody reads entirely before enacting need to be tamed a bit. It's like the Pentagon losing trillions of dollars and nobody got punished, and with all the money/"donations" changing hands, it's difficult to identify with either left or right when they're all in it for the money. Both sides seem a bit crazy to me at times, with the obvious dogmatic language and approach. But yeah, these clowns shouldn't distract from the overall history of sit downs in Congress and why people are going ape shit about this particular instance? Peace out.
Lauren Boebert and Marjorie T Green are greedy they are going to support anything other than themselves, one is very uneducated but tries to use big words that she has no understanding of and the other is a lying cheating wife whose husband filed for a divorce, so she had two affairs and had been telling her family lies for years so DO YOU THINK SHE IS GOING TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH ? Hell no sheâ€™s like Trump , you can write it down and ask her to read it she will lie !
