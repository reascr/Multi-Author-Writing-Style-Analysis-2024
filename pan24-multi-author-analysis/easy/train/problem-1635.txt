"The Heartland Institute is an American conservative and libertarian public policy think tank known for its rejection of both the scientific consensus on climate change and the negative health impacts of smoking. Founded in 1984, it worked with tobacco company Philip Morris throughout the 1990s to attempt to discredit the health risks of secondhand smoke and lobby against smoking bans. Since the 2000s, the Heartland Institute has been a leading promoter of climate change denial.".
Because the infrastructure jobs are public private partnerships the jobs are going to be going over budget, hit with delays, lack of transparency, and the workers will likely not be from the local communities...the contractors will not be sub contracted out under the authority of a local state department of transportation but likely have ownership, or lease on the road, bridge, infrastructure. Private sector objective is profit. This will result in increased costs, being subjected on residents without the benefit of increased availability of jobs. As a result when the Federal money dries up the work stops, and national infrastructure is as it was before...Failing.
