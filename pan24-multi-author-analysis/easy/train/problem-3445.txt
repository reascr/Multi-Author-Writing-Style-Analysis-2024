This is exactly what I’ve been concerned about having kept a close eye on the current Covid events in China. It’s spreading way way faster than anywhere else since the beginning of the pandemic and will likely lead to a breading ground for new variants. Everyone from celebrities, family, friends, friends of friends, colleagues are saying that they caught it and just from the symptoms alone i suspect there’s already a few mutated variants spreading around. My gf in Guangzhou caught a very mild variant about 2 weeks ago and recovered only to catch it again within a few days but the difference is this time her symptoms are much more aggressive. Looking around the Chinese Internet, users are reflecting the same thing. Only a few weeks ago, I noticed the vast majority of those that I saw were getting mild symptoms and now all the new infections I see have become much more aggressive. Gonna be concerning for the world.
hospitals overwhelmed due to combinations of low population immunity against omicron, minimum mitigations and fast spreading variants.
