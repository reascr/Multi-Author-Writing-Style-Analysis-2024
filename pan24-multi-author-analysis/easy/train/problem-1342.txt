Yea worth remembering that Russia's christianity is as fake as everything else. The Russian orthodox church, headed by an FSB agent, teaches murder and hatred. Meanwhile, Christians of other faiths are literally arrested for talking about Jesus, yes really.
3. They have adopted the same strategies of brazen lies. Remember how Trump told blatant lies on a daily basis, while he held a 90% approval rating amongst Republicans. His defenders claimed that he didn't lie at all, that the lies didn't matter, that everyone else was just as bad, that the lies were actually a justifiable and smart strategy, that it was just sarcasm etc... that's how it's been in Russia for centuries. Lying as a strategy of confusing the public dialogue and to test loyalty. Those who stand up for truth will get singled out and crushed.
Unsurprising. The real purpose of this "church" is to promote Kremlin propaganda and recruit spies. It is an organ of the state and it's so called priests are nothing more than agents of the Kremlin.
