There will most likely be many excess deaths over the next years, if not decades, related to covid leading to an earlier death in many people. Not distinctly killed/incapacitated by covid, but it's side effects and being weakened and more easily infected/killed later on.
Yup. Up until September, the biggest news stories of 2001 were Tom and Nicole divorcing and a missing congressional intern. I miss the innocence of those days.
Well, in a stunning turn of events: We spent the better part of the last 3 years perfecting different routes to deliver vaccines, and Novavax already has a flu vaccine that's finished a phase 3 trial with fantastic results, so it wouldn't be a huge lift to ask them to specialize their production on a slightly different antigen. I don't think the FDA would blink before approving it outright considering Nanoflu's results showed non-inferiority already.
Seriously. Did no one watch nature shows growing up like we did in my house? Elephant seal bulls weigh 2 tons, and will mate anything they can catch. If the two tons of blubber doesn't kill you, well...
