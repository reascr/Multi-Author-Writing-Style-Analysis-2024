I think we're talking about separate things here. We can definitely talk about gun control legislation separately, but my comment was simply "Whoever has the most guns isn’t necessarily going to win, but the side that’s preemptively and unilaterally disarming itself is probably the side that’s going to lose". Forget about the gun control, all I meant was that liberals aren't even arming themselves in the first place, so they would already be at a disadvantage if a civil war really did break out. Note that I specifically said liberals, not leftists. Leftists are armed and ready, so are plenty of progressives. It's the center-left urban liberals who somehow think the cops will always protect them, civil war will never happen, and they don't need to be responsible for their own safety. It comes from a place of great privilege.
The FBI defines terrorism as the unlawful use or threatened use of violence committed against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.
"Fine"? Ok. Until you have to defend your home; having to frantically reload magazines while taking fire ... 10 rounds isn't much my friend. And I'm a liberal gun owner. My handgun can hold more rounds (17+1).
