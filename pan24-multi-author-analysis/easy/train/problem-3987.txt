Good. Biden is old. But he is also old enough to remember clearly the cold war. And he knows this shit is serious.

Seconded. The people who whine and cry about career politicians are the people who voted in Bobert, MGT and Cawthorn. And the only reason why the GOP abandoned Cawthorn was because Cawthorn broke the cardinal rule. the gay incest pictures that were circulating plus and he ratted on his fellow GOP Congresspeople and their cocaine hooker orgies. If anybody’s wondering Cawthorn admitted to incest with his male cousin. It’s not that the gay part should matter it’s that that’s what the GOP was really bothered by, if it was a cute woman they would’ve rolled with it.
