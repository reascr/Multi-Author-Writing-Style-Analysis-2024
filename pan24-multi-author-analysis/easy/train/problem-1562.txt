In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Maybe. That's between you and your conscience. Just remember, several republican voters have advocated executing Democrats, and several more support literal torture camps masquerading as "conversion therapy" for LGBTQ+ individuals. They are the ones pushing for violence. Are those sort of people to be considered your enemies? I know they are mine, and my conscience would be clear if I defended myself with the violence they advocate.
Unlikely. Thereâ€™s enough generational and propaganda-fueled distaste for the Dems that the GOP will likely exist in some form or another for a considerable lenh of time.
Exactly. Despite the differences, we can still work together and find a common ground to make things better. It shouldn't result to tearing each other apart.
