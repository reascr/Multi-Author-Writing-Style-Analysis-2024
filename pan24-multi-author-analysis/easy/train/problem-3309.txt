And they will typically tell you to mind your fucking business and stop wasting 911 operators time on non emergency calls especially in open carry states or states where concealed carry is common. Hell even in California my local sheriff's department and police department would tell you to stop calling unless the gun has been brandished or discharged or someone is threatening another person with it if you called their lines. 911 operator would likely be a lot more pissy and remind you that you can be charged for calling 911 about non emergency calls. In California your call could be considered harassment and you would face up to 6 months jail and/or $1,000 fine.

Expectations aren’t the reality, especially in densely populated urban centers. The next time someone tries to mug you, break into your house, or worse; go ahead and call ‘the government’ and see how fast they respond.
