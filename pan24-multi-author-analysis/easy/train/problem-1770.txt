I know right? The insanity of that belief is the hardest one to hear. If there’s anywhere in government where 90% of all employees are Republicans it’s law enforcement ie fbi DOJ etc. but hey wannabe dictators gotta dictator so they investigate the investigators. But I think it’s too late for them. They just hit trump with some serious stuff including espionage and what’s the fbi good at? Finding spies and moles and it’s crystal clear we have multiple assets in politics. It’s too coincidental they caught another Russian spy,who by the way looked very similar too Maria botina at MAL recently and given the FBI has been running silent for 6 years, the stolen documents the data breach im betting they have a few people they’ve been looking at.
Exactly. “Law and Order” is contrary to “rule of law.” The former is about maintaining social order using enforcement that has (some) legal backing. The latter is about a system wherein law applies equally to all.
