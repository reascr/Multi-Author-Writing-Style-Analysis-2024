Exactly. Putin has absolutely perfected the concept of “controlled opposition”, even allowing certain, pre-selected journalists the opportunity to write incisive commentary within guidelines, as it blows off a certain amount of steam and is usually pre-packaged with a more complimentary rebuttal that is supposed to be more authoritative and persuasive.
of course they haven't. but are they really going to use them? The US could have nuked Vietnam but didn't. The US could have nuked Afghanistan but didn't. Sometimes it's better to just take the L and go home.
Literally in every democratic or pretending-to-be-democratic country title "ex-president" means something and has non-zero weight. But, in russia it's absolutely meaningless, he was nothing more than a chair warmer for putin. And by saying this I'm not even trying to insult him, this was quite literally his role - putin's placeholder, someone dumb enough to accept this role of beeing dummy and have non-putin name so it kinda somewhat looks like a legit president.
