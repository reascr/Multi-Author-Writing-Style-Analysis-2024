Many gun deaths are a result of (previously or still) law abiding citizens. The purpose of gun laws is to reduce the amount of death, many of which come from non-criminal or accidental actions. So even if we take your statement as true (most people involved in a crime involving a firearm have a prior criminal history), what about people who don't? What about non-criminal actions? If it's true that criminals will just ignore the laws anyways (it isn't), then the laws can still exist to protect law abiding citizens. Get it?
That definition includes espionage or sabotage of Canadaâ€™s interests, foreign influence, acts of serious violence against people or property with political, religious or ideological objectives, or the violent overthrow of the Canadian government.

People who have no idea what they're talking about trying to solve problems that don't exist with solutions that don't work.
