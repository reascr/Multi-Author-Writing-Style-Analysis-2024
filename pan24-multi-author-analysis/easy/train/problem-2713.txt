Workers got sick days. And a 24% raise. Most of the unions were in favor of the deal. They didnâ€™t get paid sick leave because of republicans and Joe Manchin. Plain and simple.
It's nice in theory to come up with plans to totally transform everything, but in real life, political capital is limited and it's hard to do much of anything at all, so it's better to focus on changing stuff that really needs change while leaving stuff alone if it works ok even if it's not perfect.
They did not get sick days. They got one personal day. The have flex days not sick days. They didnt get sick days because Biden didn't even put it in the contract when the board had the power to do so. Is it the Republicans fault? Yes. But mainly it's Biden in this case. He forced a contract that he had a hand in creating. They did not get an immediate 24% raise, it's 24% in 3 to 7% increments over 5 years. Do your research....
