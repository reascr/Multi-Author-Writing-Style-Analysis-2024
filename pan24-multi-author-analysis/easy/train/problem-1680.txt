My new favorite channel on the war Perun had a good point in his video on the war of attrition that the Wests method of voting in small blocks of support keeps giving Russia hope that they will not approve the next batch, which could extend the conflict and that passing a resolution that essentially states "We are commiting to covering the Ukrainian economy and war effort indefinitely" will send a very clear message to Russia that there is no waiting out the West patience, that we will not let the short term pain of the financial impact of this war influence our support and that there is no way forward that will divide the West and Ukraine.
