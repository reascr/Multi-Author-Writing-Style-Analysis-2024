I had to read this like five times to understand lol. Let me see if I'm getting it. You have the right to remain silent (5th amendment.) If you are subpeonaed documents, and submitting those documents would incriminate you, then you have the right not to. But then you can't also say "I totally gave you everything I know about" and that loose end just isn't a good look. So this way there's an added layer of "well idk the guys we hired could not find anything." You don't have to say "I gave you everything I have" or "I can't give you this because it makes me look guilty as hell." Essentially its just a further delay. Am I getting it?
In general, the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply to documents or materials, only testimony. HOWEVER, the Act of Production Doctrine states that if responding to a subpoena is unto itself inculpatory, then the government cannot compel. Since lying to the DOJ is a crime, then saying you gave back all the requested materials without actually doing so is a crime, so the government can no longer force you to admit to a crime by returning more materials.
