I’ve seen Fox News change tremendously since Trump first took office. You have to remember that before Trump Fox News was run by Roger Ailes who was a creature of the Republican Party. He saw Fox News as a way to prop up the Republican Party but since Trump I’ve seen that completely flipped to where now the Republican Party exists to prop up Fox News.
What I’ve seen is before Trump, Fox News was focused on defending the Republican Party where now Fox News is giving marching orders. This is how we got the CRT panic, Trans panic we’re seeing now, even the idiotic “gas stove” panic came directly from Fox News and right wing media and the Republican politicians know that if they want to get their face on TV they have to take up these causes and if they don’t they won’t get on TV and they won’t win their primaries.
1. Why do you focus primarily on Conservative disinformation and not disinformation as a whole? We know that conservative media, specifically the Murdoch Empire, is wrought with disinformation in ways that are not characteristic of left leaning media, but why not also critique liberal media? Aren't you showing intentional bias in your work? Even if conservative media have significantly more disinformation, should we not hold that standard to all mainstream media outlets? (.
If a non-American academic approached you and asked you to identify the best non-partisan, independent media outlets in America, what would you recommend?
Hey! Do you know how a big news outlet gets their news first-hand about not-so-central stuff (East Palestine derailment), how fast do they get there?
