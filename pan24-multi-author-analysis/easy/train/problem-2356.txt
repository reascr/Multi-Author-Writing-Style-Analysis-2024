I used to work for the government. In order to get the job I had to disclose all manner of financial records, personal records, they spoke to my friends, ex employers, neighbors. They don’t care if you’re in debt, or if you’re gay, or you cross dress at the weekends. they don’t care if you tell them you suck Russian dicks at D&D evenings. What they care about is if you try to hide it. Because if you are trying to hide something then you can be compromised. President twat has spent millions trying to hide his tax returns. Now imagine that someone gets them and threatens to release them unless he promises to do ‘x’. Judging by how much money and effort he has put into preventing access, he could easily have done ‘favors’ for anyone who blackmailed him over releasing them.
Exactly. The President needs to be held to a higher standard than an everyday. This is the person responsible for making important decisions for our country. When you are President, everything you do and have done should be under a microscope.
