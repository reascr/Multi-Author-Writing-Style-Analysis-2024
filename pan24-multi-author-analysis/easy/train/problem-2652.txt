The severance package would have to stay in effect. That was compensation for the stress of being fired. Just because you came crawling back to beg for my return doesn't mean I didn't feel that stress. In fact begging me to return only amplifies my stress. So I'm keeping ALL of that.
Yeah, times like this you need to over-correct the problem by hiring 20+ percent more people than you need knowing you are gonna loose some and maybe for a while you may have more people than you need, but in that time you would be making up to your customers for being short staffed by having excellent response times and over time as people quit you won't need to replace them.
jesus christ. 20 years ago i worked in my colleges distance education department. sweet gig, basically video taped (YEA TAPE) classes. in one software engineering masters class, the professor was talking about project management. he roughly said “we’re going to use lines of code as our metric. it’s a terrible metric for the real world. but for this exercise it’s a clear cut enough metric to learn these basics”.
