All I know is that my union, which isn't a great union, it's like a b-/c+ union, still has managed to make sure that my college can't just arbitrarily not give me courses to teach, has done a good job of protecting my working conditions, and is the reason I make an (almost) living wage as a non-tenure-track faculty member.
My wife is a nurse. She works at a union hospital. Nurses don’t need a union. They are in high demand. They can get a job almost anywhere they want.
Exactly, the legislation was intentionally crafted by conservatives to exacerbate free rider problems and undercut the unions which were often the biggest donors to their political adversaries.
I still don’t know how I feel about this. It’s easy to say “go union it makes your life better!” But what do you do for example as a carpenter if you’re surrounded by closed shops and the union isn’t taking more apprentices? Or if the union says they’ll take you but you have to start out as an A1 making $16hr when you were making $25 ?
