Current estimates are that it will take a decade for the Russian military to resupply itSELF to the level it was at in 2021. Assuming certain sanctions are eventually lifted.
1. Putin is removed from power (willingly or otherwise) for failing to be a military dictator. The new dictator will thus be 2.0, and base his legitimacy off of being a conqueror. In this situation, we can expect massive anti-corruption purges, renewed nuclear testing, and a strong China-Russia bond as Russia seeks investments in its new military. This is the bad ending.
This represents an unprecedented opportunity for the western - specifically American - arms industry.
2. Putin is removed from power (willingly or otherwise) for turning Russia into a pariah state. The new dictator will thus look to modernize Russia politically and to move away from the past. We may see some break away states (Chechnia and Tatarstan, for example), and maybe even a fragile attempt at democratization. Oligarchs will be purged via legal mechanisms. It will be up to the West to except the changed Russia and accept its re-integration into global economy. This is the good ending, but very unlikely to last long-term.
