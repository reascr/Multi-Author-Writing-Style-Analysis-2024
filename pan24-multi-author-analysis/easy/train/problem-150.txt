I opened the radio a couple of days ago and they had an hour long program on Prussia. I did not listen from the beginning so I can't say with certainty what it was supposed to be about but in a couple of minutes I learned from the host and the guest who's a professor of history that Frederick William I looked like a swine and behaved like an army sergeant. That his son was aloof, looked like a dandy and did little more than playing the flute.
In Sweden, equipment is regularly acquired by the Defense Material Administration (a civilian department) before being delivered to the military. Poland may work in similar ways.
Your statement is completely underestimating the problem. The Polish government is right-wing populist and has been using anti-German propaganda to gain votes for years. It has also been in permanent conflict with the EU regarding the EU's standards about the rule of the law. And it has been blocking the EU (via veto rights) from sanctioning Hungary, which has become a country less and less democratic with an increasingly authoritarian government and is the only EU country to follow a pro-Putin course. And with all of this the Polish government is playing into Putin's hands.
