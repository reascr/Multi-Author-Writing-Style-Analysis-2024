"We lost business in the EU, the Americas, Australia, Japan, and South Korea, you know, 9 of the top 10 economies in the world, but India. India is our saving grace. India is the shining light that will lead our economy to victory.".
Indians don't majoritarily agree with the invasion as we ourselves had experiences with territorial losses from invasions but we are more concerned about uplifting india to a more develoed nation rather than pander to west vs rus conflicts.
So was I? Saying that India is funding Russia is like spitting in the ocean and saying that it’s making ocean levels rise. Russia is barely making profit from the discounted oil that they’re selling to India. When you throw in all the sanctions from other countries, it hardly makes a difference what India is doing. It can’t even compare to the amount Russia made off Europe for so many years.
Involved Economically and Via trade, not involved Militarily. Our military is to defend our own borders , well aware that no one else can help us in when the need arrives. Only Russia has helped India militarily In Past conflicts, US and EU mainly stood with Pakistan openly supplying them weapons and money and training.
