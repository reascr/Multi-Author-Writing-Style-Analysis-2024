It's a euro centric thing. Europe has this obsession with cleanliness and will barely eat anything out of fear of hygiene. The reason, paradoxically, is that Europe's historically had some of the least hygienic, least healthy, civilizations. While the rats that carried the black plague, and the disease itself came from Asia, it was Europe that had us population massively lowered, because people lived in highly unhygienic conditions.
I read this in an Alex Jones voice. Like, this is up there with saying you have a plan to kill and eat your neighbors if society collapses. Itâ€™s just creepy.
But insects can easily be bred and for a relatively low energy investment return a lot of nutrients, this could make fish farming much more viable and profitable which in return could cut down on fishing in the wilderness.
I had the same thought. It's often played up like society eating insects is a sign of societal downfall. When really that might be a staple part of a healthy human diet one day. especially for something like space travel when protein would be a premium to grow in space.
