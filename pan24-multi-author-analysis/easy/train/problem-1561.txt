Why should I accept giving land my people have owned for centuries just because some people who came maybe 10-20 years ago want to create a country there?
Zionism - exactly. Zionism, the understanding that there is no cure for antisemitism and that only by establishing a state for Jews - not even necessarily in Eretz Yisrael, but only by establishing a Jewish state, the nations of the world will learn to treat the Jews as equals. Enlightenment and Jewish assimilation unfortunately didn't suppress antisemitic sentiments, but arguably worsened them, because now Jews were seen as direct competitors in society.
3. Your ‘family’ analogy is inapt. In this case, the UN would be the family. So there are not two families treating their respective kids differently. There is one family treating the good kid 85% horribly, while his 195 (or however many countries exist) siblings are only getting 15% of the parents’ criticism despite being far worse little bastards.
Who knows? Perhaps Europe, maybe other European colonies, maybe somewhere else. France took in 1 million refugees during the 60s from Algeria many of which were Jews so it isn’t impossible to resettle half that number.
