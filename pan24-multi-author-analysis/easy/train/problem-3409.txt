Religious zealots that want gender genocide in their country under the pretext of religious purity as if he is some supreme being created from God that only him knows the rules and principles that everybody else is suppose to live by. This guy is so fake that he goes to Italy and Italy accommodated him by boxing statutes in order not to insult him because otherwise his sexual urges would burn his eyes and would go blind. Hahaha, what a bunch of idiots, free your women from your stupid blind religion, you don’t represent God in any shape or form, you don’t have a monopoly on religious views and stop imposing your religious views onto others. The police and army should take up the fight with the women because without them these religious zealots are nothing, they can’t defend themselves because they are the biggest cowards.
Interesting point. While I agree that the Catholic Church has done a lot of bad things, I think you are comparing “bad acts” with bad laws to some extent. The difference is the Catholic Church doesn’t promote or condone child sexual abuse. By contrast, the issues I’m pointing out with Saudi Arabia or Iran are literal state policy.
