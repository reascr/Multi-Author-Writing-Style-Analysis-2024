He plays dumb. The stupid potato farmer bit is something he plays up like Krustchev did. In reality he was the college educated equivalent of a Western agricorp CEO, managing thousands of collective workers and high-end business deals. I donâ€™t think he worked in a field a day in his life, he was a military officer before becoming a kholkoznik if I remember correctly. Once he entered politics he cleverly eliminated every one of the old communist elite and the newly emerging democratic establishment, until he was effectively a dictator. In power he began pulling strings in Moscow to introduce the Union State program of restoring the Soviet Union under a "democratic" regime, and it seemed the terms of this was that Yeltsin would make Lukashenko his Vice President and heir apparent, thus overnight making Lukashenko one of the most powerful people in the world.
You seem to have an axe to grind. I'm talking about active troops (hence why I specified Moldova's potential reserves, and what limitations those might have). If you're under the misconception that I'm somehow anti-Moldova, you must not hang in this forum a lot.
Despite your accusations against me here and in that other reply, it looks like YOU are the one that has something against Moldova...as a state. You just want them to join Romania, don't you? Well suprise suprise, I actually think that might be a good idea. But I also happend to think that is a choice the people of Moldova deserves to make themselves. You can consider this discussion ended, because you entered it under the false pretext of making it look like you cared about Moldova. You do look like you care about Moldovans...but not as a seperate state, and that is a whole different matter.
