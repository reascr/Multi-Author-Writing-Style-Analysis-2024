There's a huge difference between traps meant for enemy combatants killing civilians and traps meant for civilians killing civilians. They could set traps on solely military objects like weapons, APCs, tanks, munitions, military helicopters, etc or locations like military bases. Instead, they are setting traps in civilian houses, in civilian home appliances, on civilian corpses and on injured civilians.
Yes unfortunately civilians will touch abandoned military things when they shouldn't, but Russia is trapping things that only civilians would ever touch like home appliances. I'm done with this conversation since it's obvious you just enjoy intentional civilian deaths too much to even bother reading my entire comments since I've said this in literally every fucking comment and you just keep ignoring it.
Victim operated. Anything with a tension release is a super convenient way to set up a booby trap. With the way explosive force works, it will also travel the path of least resistance which in the case of covers and hinges, towards the person who opens it.
