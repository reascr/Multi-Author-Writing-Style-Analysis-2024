Ukraine was supposed to implement some mild constitutional reforms and hold elections in Donetsk and Luhansk and yes, they missed the deadlines dates for doing so, but they could hardly be held responsible when it was Russia's little green men kept shelling the line of contact and attacking Ukrainian border posts with machine guns. Between 2014 and 2022 there was rarely a week that went by without a Ukrainian soldier being killed in one of these attacks.
Is this article literal propaganda? Itâ€™s basically just statements of Russians acting like everyone else is responsible for the war they indirectly started by invading crimea and directly started by invading Ukraine.
That's rich. The situation that lead to a large scale conflict is Russia invading a sovran nation. In 2014 and 2022.
Also worth noting is that Russia and its puppet separatists in the Donbas never actually implemented the ceasefire and other provisions prescribed by the Minsk agreements, and Russia unilaterally tore it up earlier this year by recognising the separatist regions as independent (and then annexing them).
Are you thick? Do you think he's taking that action in a vacuum? We made agreements with him that we were not going to advance NATO forces and every year we have violated that and gained ground. His actions are defensive and we are painting him as an aggressor as part of a propaganda campaign.
