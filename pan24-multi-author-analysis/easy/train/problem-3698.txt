Edit: I just read the entire scenario. Idk why you guys hate it when someone praises the Indian govt or Modi or the ruling party. It was the previous Congress Led Indian govt which opposed the verdict of Delhi high court. And then in 2013 the supreme court criminalised it again when BJP was not even in power. In 2018 Navtej singh Johar filed a petition in the supreme court and the Indian govt took a neutral stance saying they will follow the wisdom of the court. In no point did the current ruling govt oppose Decriminalization of homosexuality.
Well i think India could use Fifa 2034. Our Super league teams could really use better venues. Only if we reduce the number of cricket stadiums under construction. Also sports betting and fantasy sport will probably make it profitable.
Literally no proof of indian govt opposing decriminalization of homosexuality because it's against Indian culture like you said. Center hinting their stand maybe different doesent mean they oppose gay people. Also opposing a private members bill is literally nothing. It's just politics. The govt doesent want the credit to go to the opposition party. I'm not a hardcore modi fan or BJP fan. Both BJP and the Supreme court is shit. But atleast let's have the whole picture clearly.
