JERUSALEM, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court ordered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to remove a senior minister over a past tax fraud conviction, in a setback for the new right-wing coalition government.
Not yet. This ruling is incredibly soft and allows Deris party to retain his ministries, and for Deri to remain a member of knesset (even though he's signed a plea deal as a condition of one of his convictions promising that he won't return to public life). As well, the government is planning to pass laws which allow a simple majority in the knesset to overrule the supreme court, effectively nullifying it. So the battle is far from won.
Castrating the High Court with no constitution or any other mechanism to rein in a potentially corrupt legislative will mean Israel won't be a democracy anymore--as far as democracy is actually defined, which requires: suffrage, 3 branches of power (judicial, legislative, executive) with separation of powers implemented, a free press, human rights to prevent suppression of voters, and as a KPI of sorts for how well it performs: the transfer of power.
This is the sum of what Der'i cares about. Nothing right-wing about it. He doesn't care about israel-Palestine and never did. On foreign affairs he will completely back Netanyahu so Netanyahu will let him a bit off the leash in internal affairs.
