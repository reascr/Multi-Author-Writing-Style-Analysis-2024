That's such a lame surface level view that ignores so much, I don't understand how people can seriously say it. "Russia's been given plenty of chances". Like wtf is that even supposed to mean? "Yeah the Soviet Union did a lot of bad stuff a few decades ago, you gotta pay up, buddy". Just Russia, nobody else, only Russia has to be dismembered, because no other country ever made life a problem for anyone else (considering that people didn't even have control over it for most of the time).
Keep it up. The west is tired of your shit and will be glad to make the lesson hurt for as long as it takes for you to learn it.
Hell, whatever happened to self-determination? Are we not allowed to decide if we want to be in the same country or not? What petty horseshit is this?
The west literally helping Russia become a country after the ussr collapse, the west trading globally with Russia and other post soviet states, the west building pipe lines to trade oil with Russia, the west providing technology and consulting when it comes to their own oil / industrial.
Who cares what he says? He's claimed he would never invade, then he did. He claimed he was fighting against Nazis, and he isn't. He claimed he's fighting against Satan, the US, NATO, etc... but the reality is still that this is just a failed invasion of a neighbor that could end any time Putin decides to end it.
