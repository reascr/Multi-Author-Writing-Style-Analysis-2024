That's just the "Disney version" of what they're doing. The entire GOPer agenda has been to impoverish the bottom 90% - no real raises since the 80's, no healthcare, no retirement, no SS or Medicare - so they will be totally dependant on their employers for their survival, and swapping jobs will be like trying to get a job if the HUAC had declared you a Commie in the 50's. In short, Republican legislation for the past 40 years has been designed to restore SLAVERY on a bi-racial basis. It's in everything they've done - even the military TROOPS are targeted - they used money for Military Family Housing to fund donny's wall fergodsake - and the GOPers opposed every move to compensate troops injured from toxins - Agent Orange to Afghan burn pits - and the GI Bill that USED to cover the cost of college/grand-school now barely covers tuition.
Great idea. Let's glorify plumbers who fix plumbing and shit on architects who design buildings with plumbing. Without college graduates, the trade school graduates will run out of things to patch up. Think of it as trickle-down theory.
