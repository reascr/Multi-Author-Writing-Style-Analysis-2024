Look into the recent history of China saying any number of things and presenting all sorts of similar threats against US interests and activities in the shipping routes near China. What you will find is that the US is the only naval power on earth that’s considered to have truly global reach. The US protects numerous countries from numerous encroachments by China into their shipping routes. Yes, China could escalate, but they’re always trying to escalate. They believe they own the entire sea around them, and the US makes it a point to have a constant presence there to remind them and the UN that these seas are open. In other words, if Taiwan wants weapons (for defense mind you) from these companies, they will get them - likely escorted by or transported on US naval assets. It’s just… the reality of the situation.
Exactly. Safety is number 1 priority in aircraft manufacturing. Something that chinese companies lacks of esp in semiconductors (hell, videos of horrible incidents in eyeblech are mostly chinese factories).
