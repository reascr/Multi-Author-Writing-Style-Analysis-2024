I think the vision of a sudden collapse where from a day to the next Russia simply folds always was a bit too optimistic (though to be sure, sometimes stuff like that does happen), but it's not like they're doing particularly well. They ARE running out of stuff, which is why they keep digging down and scraping the bottom of the barrel for lower quality stuff that however hurts them even more in the long term. Why resort to conscription if not because they were running out of professional soldiers? The problem is that now they have plenty more soldiers, but they're inexperienced as fuck, undisciplined, poorly equipped, and so they get sent out as cannon fodder and killed in droves, and long term this is devastating for Russia's economy and demographics too. Every short term stopgap solution that they take to avoid collapse is only making the future collapse even worse. It's like a man who keeps gambling out his money and then taking out debts from a loan shark to keep playing in the hopes of having a big break. At some point he'll find a few thugs at his door who'll strap him to an operating table and take out his kidney.
“Separatists”…. Gotta stop singing that propaganda. They were Russian troops “on vacation “ that “settled” there.
