Bitching about it in a monetary sense and wanting Russia to win are two very different things. The stance they seem to be taking is “other countries aren’t pouring this much money into this conflict, and we’re damn near the furthest away from it all, so why are we giving so much money to them when it could stay here?”. Now I don’t agree with that and I’m actually glad we’re helping Ukraine. But don’t twist that shit, the vast majority of people in the US want Ukraine to win or just want us to stop sending money bc it isn’t our fight. Both are reasonable and should be debated.
Russia is ready to destroy western democracy in order to gain a few miles of land in Ukraine and the challenge for all free people is to love their neighbors despite their now radicalized political opinions and to basically just collectively give Russia the biggest possible middle finger in absolutely everything. If you ever felt animosity towards a political opponent on the internet, you cannot be sure it isn't just Russians trying to brainwash you into hating your neighbors. Defending against divide and conquer is to unite and prosper and it's important to recognize that rather than to blame Republicans for everything.
