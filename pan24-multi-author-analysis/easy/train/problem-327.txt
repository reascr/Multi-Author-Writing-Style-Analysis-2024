Yes congratulations you've discovered the folly of referendums and why most countries are representative democracies and not directly democratic. You should forward your findings to London. Why was the last vote the "right one" but a new one wouldn't be? A new referendum would have no more or less legitimacy than the last one.
Ehhhhhh. Trump voters and the people who took part in Jan 6 were well aware of what they were planning and calling for. They were extremely vocal about it leading up to the event. It’s a bit much to look at groups like the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers, who spent years building up to it and months planning things out, and say that they aren’t responsible for their own actions. Yes, the ringleaders are the real problem, but those are grown ass adults playing insurrection because they want to murder their political enemies. They had many, many chances to stop, but they were physically assaulting people and government buildings for months as practice because they genuinely wanted to hurt people. It’s a bad idea to ignore that.
Clearly a 52 percent majority is a clear enough mandate to upend several decades of legislative and administrative integration in an economic and political bloc without a long term plan or deep negotiations on the end result. /s.
