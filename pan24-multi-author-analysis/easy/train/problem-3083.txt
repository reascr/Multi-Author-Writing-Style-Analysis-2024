This is the real shame. It’s society allowing this situation to happen. Serial killlers will alway try easy prey and people who are marginalized or on the fringes are easier to get with a lower chance of gerrinf caught. I’m actually a bit surprised they caught this guy.
Idk about that, spreads a dangerous message of if he or she has ASPD then there's no rehabilitation for them (just using ASPD as an example) sometimes it's true but you could say that about people who don't have ASPD as well, I think therapy is important because the issues is more deep rooted than a lack of empathy for others. I forget what percent of the population has ASPD but a lot of them struggle with everyday life because they don't fit in and they know they are different in some way so they try to get help, some don't always know how and some just release their rage on vulnerable (people or animals) to chase a feeling of power and control. It's just a slippery slope to make generalisations like that. I want to end on that I agree the actions are horrible and deserve punishment appropriate to the crime.
