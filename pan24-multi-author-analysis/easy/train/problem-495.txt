There was a tweet I read quoting Jake Sullivan as saying one of Biden’s earlier priorities was improving air detection capabilities to prevent things like this from happening. It was implied that China has done this before, and these balloons weren’t detected until well over the continental US, at which point acknowledging it would have been embarrassing.
So it’s likely China has been doing this for awhile, launching several balloons at once with an understanding the winds will likely mean some won’t end up where they want (and why some made their way over Latin America). It’s just now they got caught, and are trying to explain how they’re not hypocrites.
Propaganda. We have been drilled to view most actions of whatever current enemy nation states to be inherently nefarious, while ours are justified evils or just misunderstood.
Coincidence? Who knows? The threat of a large EMP generating device or multiple devices could effectively decapitate the US nuclear missile launch capabilities if countermeasures are not in place, effective or even exist.
1. It was low enough to be seen with naked eye/cell phones. Meaning what ever it was trying to view, they could not view from space.
