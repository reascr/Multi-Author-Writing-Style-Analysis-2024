KEYSTONE XL, is the pipeline you have been instructed to be outraged about, it's purpose was to increase the carrying capacity of coal sands to the gulf coast. Since there is no excess refinery capacity in the area to accept and refine that excess sludge, it would have been pumped on the boats and shipped to foreign refineries for processing. Who would have benefitted, Canadian oil producers and pipeline companies. Who loses? the people who have to live downstream from yet another pipeline run by a company with the worst safety and environmental record in North America. How much surplus gas an oil would be added to the US supply to lower prices? Zero, zip, zilch, nada, none.
Whether or not it comes to pass, who can say, but this isn’t an issue of “do domestic economic policies cause international recession?” America’s international credit rating very much affects international and domestic economic recession. Like, starving a portion of our population of income to bargain for unrelated things affects the economy. So yea. What’s your point? What do you specifically disagree with here?
