If it came down to it and Russia collapsed, China would be rushing in to grab as many pieces as possible. Having them for an ally is like having a hungry tiger as a guard animal. It’ll turn on you as soon as it’s convenient.
Russia has significant internal geopolitical issues which it cannot reconcile with democracy and capitalism (hence always the Strong-man approach to governance). Look into the vulnerability of the Eastern/Southern cities and their complete dependency on Moscow for subsidies. Until these cities have better access to trade/goods from the southern borders, Russia as the super-sized state will always fall behind in some way. Additionally, suppose the eastern/southern cities of Russia happen to get access to international trade/goods/warm oceans. In that case, their respective republics will likely try to break away from Russia, as they will no longer be dependent on Moscow. Russia has A LOT of issues which not easily resolved. Also, keep in mind how much coercion and soft-power Russia attempts on former Soviet states, e.g. Azerbaijan, Armenia etc.
Yeah that’s how I took it. “Handling” nuclear powers also doesn’t really seem wise. A lot of people I’ve noticed have a bit of a hard for this sort of thing since Ukraine.
