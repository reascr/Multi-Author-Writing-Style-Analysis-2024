Israel's Ambassador to Canada Ronen Hoffman, appointed by former prime minister Yair Lapid, announced on Saturday that he will be resigning from his post this summer because his personal and professional integrity compels him to terminate his position.
Foreign Minister Eli Cohen accepted Hoffman's resignation after sending a written statement saying that in view of the new government's policies, and because it is political appointment, he can no longer continue in his post.
This is the right thing to do. If an ambassador does not agree with their countries policies, to the extent that the ambassador cannot present them to the host country in the best light, and defend them, then resignation is the correct step to take.
