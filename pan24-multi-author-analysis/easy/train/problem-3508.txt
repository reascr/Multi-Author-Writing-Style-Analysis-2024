You know what else mows down kids quite literally on a daily basis? SUVs and trucks. It’s been widely known for a while now that the high, flat front design increases lethal collisions with pedestrians. And yet I hear crickets about it. You love your big cars, even though you’re endangering everyone around you. But guns? You don’t care about them… so they can go, they’re the problem, they don’t affect you. Hypocrisy is all it is.
Exactly. But every time this gets brought up the cult of guns freaks out and buys a million more ARs before Christmas. Gun companies all make massive gains and get to spend even more money on lobbyists and PR troll farms. The cycle repeats and the rich get richer. That "well organized militia" is just a tool for the oppressors to generate income and rationalize a heavily militarized police presence. It's all so fucking predictable.

Exactly. Why circle back to an issue that isn't a voter priority and is stuck not passing the senate?
