They couldn’t be more obvious about their inferiority complex, and it’s manifested in the worst possible way.
unprecedented? They're right where they need to be, which is nonexistent. It's a ganster state and the US doesn't need to wast their time with the stream of lies that comes out of Moscow.
Unprecedented? Yeah that whole cold war, cuban missile crisis, and training kids to cover their heads with books when russian nukes fell was just totally normal. Fuck this loser and his alarmist rhetoric. Theres a real simple way to ease tensions, fuckwit.
“Unprecedented crisis.” Such bullshit hyperbole. There’s been at least three instances where things were a couple of seconds from nuclear war. This is nothing.
There is something wrong with Russia , something that has prevented it from improving in the way that empires have over the past century ( France , Germany , England for example, who committed appalling crimes/genocide against smaller nations, but who have largely faced this reality and grown better from them. This process isn’t complete, England still doesn’t really acknowledge or face up to honestly what it did to Ireland for instance, but they are better than they used to be).
