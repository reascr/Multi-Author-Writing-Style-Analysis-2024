Yes: This is something I’m also very aware of is that the whole discussion of “Part Jewish,” is something created from outside of Judaism. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t people who engage in it (I remember reading for example Christopher Hitchens discovered at 38 that he was 1/32nd Jewish and identified as a “Jew,” for the rest of his life). It seems to be very silly. As you said: It’s a binary and I know for sure that mean I’m not. That’s why I used the phrase “Some of my ancestors were Jewish.”.
So some of my ancestors were Jewish. I grew up in a largely Jewish community and most of my closet friends are ethnically Jewish. A lot of Jewish culture feels very homey to me, and I relate to a lot of it on some level. But I’m not Jewish, I don’t think I get to say that. I always felt uneasy with my place (if I have one at all) in the Ashkenazi diaspora. Because I am part Jewish. I feel like it would be weird for me to like, define myself as a Jew in the same way that it’s obnoxious for me as an American to say “I’m Irish!” Or whatever.
Exactly. Litterly they had jokes about German leaders, like with "Adolf and his top comanders were on a sinking boat who will be saved. Germany ".
