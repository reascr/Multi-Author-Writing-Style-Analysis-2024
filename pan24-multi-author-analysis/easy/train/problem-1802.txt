The reason WWII is brought up all the time is because the parallels are striking. And the world is facing existential evil. I follow ruZZian rhetoric and behavior very closely and I am certain that their victory in Ukraine or a compromise will not be the end of this. This is not a minor territorial dispute that can be resolved by compromise. Their state goal is restoration of ruZZian empire. This includes Poland, Baltic states, Finland (and that's just in the west). The ideology of their superiority is remarkably similar to third reich.
about time…. sheesh?!? somebody is actually talking sense finally… ukraine should have been targeting russian territory long ago. enough of this keep it inside ukraine, it’s time to go all out and hit russia too. good stuff latvia 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽.
Russia can be relied to only periodically bully weaker countries instead of declaring all out war.Every one of the five un security council members can be relied on to not escalate and cause a nuclear war,because its an unspoken agreement that they are allowed to invade weaker countries as long as they don't do it too often.
