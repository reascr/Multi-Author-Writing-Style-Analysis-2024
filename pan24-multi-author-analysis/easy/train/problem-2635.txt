And I'm not exactly a "Bolsonarista". I voted from Felipe D'Avila on first round, and just voted on Bolsonaro on the run-off. Plus, I voted for Fernando Haddad from Lula party for governor of my state against Bolsonaro candidate Tarc√≠sio de Freitas. So I am hardly a avid Bolsonaro supporter.
Now, I'm not saying that a lot of Bolsonaro's supporters don't want to end the Republic. They do. But I don't think a lot of the military are fond of the idea to involve themselves in politics. Is more random people on the streets that wants military intervention to end the Republic. And this particular narrative that a coup was being staged without significant presence of the military is quite weird. Either Bolsonaro is trying to put in a coup as pathetic as the Castillo one, or this was just some excuse that the Supreme Court is pulling out to persecute further the opposition.
Extradition. An extradition treaty between the United States and Brazil was signed on January 13, 1961 and implemented on February 11, 1965. The treaty allows both countries to request the return of individuals if the offense(s) committed are considered crimes by both countries.
