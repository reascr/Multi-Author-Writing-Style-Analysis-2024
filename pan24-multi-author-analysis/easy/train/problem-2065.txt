How did this take until 2023 to happen? The US Civil War never really ended. We played nice with the defeated Confederacy, let them keep their guns after defeat. They became the KKK. Lincoln tried to heal the nation reaching across the aisle to Andrew Johnson, then Lincoln gets assassinated and Johnson ruins Reconstruction and all but reinstalls slavery. We have been dealing with them as a domestic Cold War ever since. Now they would rather end Democracy than give up far right conservatism and theyâ€™ve been arming themselves and itching for a rematch ever since. This is why nothing gets done on guns, the rightwing politicians rely on that unspoken promise of a new civil war.
