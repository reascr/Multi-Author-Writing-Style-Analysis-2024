A dictator doing dictator shit. I’m glad the majority has at least some grasp that these techniques do not work on the masses anymore. Headlines don’t mean shit to the common folk. Good job Putin, you got into another headline… while having your troops geared up in old ass equipment. My city school educated ass sees through your bullshit. Fear was also taught at my church. I left that as well.
Uh layered protection with different incoming target priority. Further it's not about cost of intercepting missile vs cost of incoming missile. It's about cost of intercepting missile vs cost of potential harm done by incoming missile which depending on what it targets can greatly exceed cost of intercepting missile. Target like energy infrastructure isn't just cost of replacing that unit and labor done to restore it, but all the hours it's not feeding energy to power infrastructure and paralyzing it.
That made me laugh. I'm picturing the Russians going up against the Clampetts. The Clampetts would open up a can of whup-ass on them.
