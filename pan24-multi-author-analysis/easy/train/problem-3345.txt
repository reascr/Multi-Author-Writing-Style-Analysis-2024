No. New F-16s (block 70/72) have some of the same tech as the F-35 and are far more capable than their older cousins. They are building brand new ones in SC right now for a number of export customers.
Only time this isn't true is if you're part of the Putin caucus that wants to pull us out of foreign interests to let the autocrats in places like Russia get their way, then you have Butthead lookin Matt Gaetz with his giant forehead, Cavewoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and her god awful annoying voice and batshit conspiracy theories, and Lauren "totally passed the GED on her own without cheating, she swears" Bobblehead who all just want to please daddy Trump/Putin with their bullshit.
But yes they do care. Dictators are bad fir business. Russia occupied and colonized Eastern Euripe so it provoked the West by hating private ownership.But never mind. Now they are so nice.
Then, maybe go back and read the details of the Trump Erdogan quid pro quo thing and think about how his shady covert attempts to halt desperately needed military aid to Ukraine, unless he was provided dirt on one of his political rivals, might be just a little different than what is happening with this voluntary sale of military equipment. This is not breaking any rules or causing avoidable deaths in an active conflict, and it's helping all current and soon-to-be NATO allies.
