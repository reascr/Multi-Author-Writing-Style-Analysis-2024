I’m speaking about a particular brand of twitter journalists plus the way that old media journalists act on twitter (this is a particular phenomenon with liberal journalists, but right wing ones suffer from this also)— being snobby, elitist, promoting some sort of activism but claiming to be unbiased, calling for bans and boycotts, stealth editing articles, cry bullying, straight up lying, virtue signaling for clout, not being rigorous with their sourcing, citing “anonymous sources familiar with the situation”, and then playing the victim when called out on one or any combination of these things.
Edit: adding to list as I see more. Also already seeing some major reporters speaking out against this.
…From following political media for years, these journalists stick up for each other when it comes to things that happen like this. You’re going to see a huge backlash from their peers. This is just the beginning. Maybe Musk will ban them too, but they can obviously speak out in other outlets.
