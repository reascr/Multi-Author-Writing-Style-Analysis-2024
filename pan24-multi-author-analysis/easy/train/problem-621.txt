Honestly when we’re talking about sex before women had any legal or financial power and before anybody knew or cared what the term strong enthusiastic consent meant and before there was a sex offender registry or any way to really accurately track and catalogue crimes. its all a little dubious. As bad as things still are id assume they were unfathomably worse in every preceding era.

The article misrepresents the argument. The question of a “distinct injustice” doesn’t refer to the rape but to the reason why Carroll didn’t file a claim before the statute of limitations expired. They claim that for the ASA to be constitutional it must seek to redress some specific injustice that prevented Carroll and others like her from filing claims.
No, they were arguing that Carroll and others affected by the Adult Survivor’s Act were not prevented from making a claim before the previous statute of limitations expired by a distinct injustice that the act seeks to redress. This is wrong and depends on a poor understanding of trauma, but is a much different argument.
This is wrong and betrays a profound ignorance of the trauma of rape, but it is not an argument that rape itself is not an injustice.
