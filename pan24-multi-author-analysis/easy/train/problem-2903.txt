I like him too! There really are a lot of fairly young, experienced people in the Democratic Party that could step up. I do think Biden has done some pretty solid things, I just feel like his age is a detriment at this point. Too many potential health issues could pop up and the republicans are always going to claim he has dementia even though he clearly does not.
Hopefully. If nothing else tho itâ€™s not like the rest of our government is all that much younger. So Joe Biden has personally known a good deal of them for decades. Whether he makes good use of that or not idk but it seems like a good thing that Joe Biden probably knows at least some dirt on a fair amount of them.
