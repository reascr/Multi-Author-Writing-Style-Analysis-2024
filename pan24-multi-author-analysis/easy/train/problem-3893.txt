So let's do a little thought experiment. First we need to assign a dollar value for voting because, let's face it, a singular vote does not carry too much actual value when you consider it's singular value needs to be weighed against it's value in the grand scheme of things which is a one thousandth, one ten thousandth, or even a one hundred thousandth share in order to effect the outcome of an election even if you cared very much about that outcome. So let's grab the craziest, hyper loud maga and offer them one thousand dollars if they themselves did not vote. Nobody in their right mind would turn that down unless the pool of voters was unrealistically small in which case this raises the value of the singular vote. This is a crazy high end offer but we'll place the value at 1000 dollars. Now let's add a risk into the equation. Say you were notified that you MAY be on the hook for a felony conviction in which case you will lose your freedom, your job, and everything else that comes with a felony conviction which makes it pretty much impossible to survive in society from this point forward. What numerical money value would YOU be willing to gain for even a chance at such a penalty. If the reward is one thousand dollars and my chances at a ruined life were even 100 to one, I'm personally opting out. Remember, these people were notified BY THE STATE, that they may be on the hook for a felony if they vote. Of course they won't vote.
