This is Republican misdirection. Social Security runs at a huge surplus. It’s not going anywhere. Look up social security trust surplus. The trust is not allowed to invest it’s huge surplus in anything but Treasury bonds. Republicans want to put the surplus in the stock market. Privatize it. The only way they will ever get that is if they convince you that desperate measures are needed to keep it going. They also want to push back the retirement age, just like Reagan did in the 1980s.
Millennial here. I always assumed they would steal what I paid in and that it wouldn’t be available to me.
