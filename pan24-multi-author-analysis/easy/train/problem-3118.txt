Yep this is a big one. Police in the US are some of the worst trained among developed nations. Many countries in western Europe have 2-4 year federal police colleges, and require you to have done well in school to be admitted in the first place, if not have a prior college degree. Meanwhile in the US, you can be a C or worse high school student and be admitted to a 6 month training course and get in. And don't forget, anyone that does too well on the written exam will be excluded.
Exactly. Once cops know everyone could be armed, it will only get worse. These fools think a cop won't see them as a threat once they know they have a gun on them. And cops aren't going to be real comfortable about it either.
Exactly. This ant Jason Bourne.. with the stress of everything it's already an impossibly job. I could see something like this actually making it worse.
Exactly. As a vet it both makes me laugh at the silliness of how overboard they go and also sad that I feel safer getting pulled over by a cop in Thailand than I do a cop in the US.
Completely fucking ridiculous. There are zero qualified and properly trained police in the US, because our system doesn't incentivize the qualified to apply, and doesn't properly train the flunkies who do.
