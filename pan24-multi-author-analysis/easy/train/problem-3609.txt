- America is a capitalist society, has privatized healthcare, & the US government only pays 37% of health care costs.
- Canada is a capitalist society, but health care in Canada isn’t privatized, & the Canadian government pays 70% of health care costs (funded by a 3% income tax).
In Canada, you are required to pay 3% of your income for health insurance - then you can’t see a doctor when you really need to because of supply/demand constraints.
Personally, the cost of medical care isn’t a risk I’d like to bear, so I transfer the risk to insurance and that costs me 3% of my pay though a plan sponsored by my employer.
- some folks decide that they’d rather bear the financial risk of medical expenses over transferring the risk to insurance companies by purchasing a health care policy because they’d rather use that money for something else other than such a policy.
Not what i pointed out? that accounts last post was 3 years ago, and as soon as the war started it strted posting pro-russian comments which is proof that its a bought or a bot account. the age of the account is meaningless.
