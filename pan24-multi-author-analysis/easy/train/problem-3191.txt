Like how the Taliban are willing to do business with China while China's government puts Chinese Muslims in concentration camps. They don't give a shit about anything, they just want power.
Your speculation does have some merit, Fran√ßois Hollande, our last president, wasn't super popular (he didn't get reelected) and was kinda considered like a weak man (not that it means much, we're a modern democracy, but his nickname was "Flanby" which is a flan or pudding, not very flattering), well i've been surprised that his foreign policy was far from weak, he involved us in Mali and i remember somewhere that he authorized more terrorist assassination than his predecessors.
What? Mercenaries would never perpetuate violence in order to ensure future employment, that's crazy and definitely not a well known flaw of mercenary soldiers.
Thanks for the reply. If you wonder where this "French aloofness" towards the EU comes from it's probably because of Charles de Gaulle, he was a staunch french "independantist" (he didn't want france to become an american puppet state after ww2), while he's been dead for a while, I think his influence can still be felt.
