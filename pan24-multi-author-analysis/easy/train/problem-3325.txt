IRS has a strong union so, unlike public accounting, it’s a guaranteed 40 hours a week, no crazy hours, no busy season. As a degreed accountant, you’d probably work mostly from home as an agent. If you’re newer to the profession, you’d likely land in a career ladder that pays yearly automatic 25% raises that will put you around the salary of a senior accountant at a big 4 firm within 2-3 years. If you’re experienced you can head straight into Large business and international, making about as much as a staff manager at a big 4 firm. Either way, you’d get lots of training and, thanks to the union, no one bats an eye if you need to use sick leave or take a day off. Federal benefits include strong health insurance, tuition reimbursement, 5% matched retirement contributions, and public service loan forgiveness. You likely wouldn’t work out of Utah, that’s mostly customer service and form processing.
