This is a feel-good sentiment expressed in just about every post about the Iranian protests, like that’s the only possible outcome. The other outcome is much sadder and what the regime is hoping for, and that’s suppression of protests and civil disobedience in general. Killing protestors, giving them lenhy prison sentences, etc. works in other authoritarian regimes, it’s possible it’ll work in Iran. To be clear, I don’t want it to be that way and I hope they ultimately overthrow their horrible government, but simply assuming revolution will automatically be the result of executions of protestors is a bit naive.
Big facts. I've lived in the northeastern US, but never ever felt as cold as I did during 3 days without power in a drafty TX apartment. Truly painful stuff. And there was a snowstorm in 2011 the led ERCOT to advise insulating the gas lines and protect the grid. They did nothing. And after the 2021 snowstorm they did nothing either. People are def gonna die when it happens again.
Examples of totalitarians/totalitarian regimes using religion? (Besides todays Middle Eastern governments).
