I have very little sympathy for him yes in a very true way he is a victim of his upbringing, but looking at his past incidents he as an adult was choosing not to get the help he needed. He came from a well off family that when he started getting into trouble the covered it up and taught him that money and power freed him from consequences. He may well have been acting from a place of self loathing and that may be sad but the instant he pulled that trigger and gunned down people just trying to live their lives I lost all sympathy for him. I grew up in a abusive conservative household and I decided long ago that I was not the person t my family wanted me to be so I got away from them and eventually cut all contact because I got therapy. Coming form a horrible home does not mean you have to continue abusive behaviors and it does not mean you have to become a shitty person. Iâ€™ve met to many good people that came from abusive homes to believe anything different.

Interesting! Perhaps, I had not considered how it would be to actually eat lasagna out or off of someone's butt. My original comment was more about the different ways the "I am not racist" part affects the sentences.
