It is my deepest desire that all the duplicitous shit said privately by these scumbags will be packaged and presented by the Democrats in such a way that the message of, “They lied to you about this. They thought you were suckers and fool. You fought for a lie. Your friends and children cut contact with you because you believed this lie. How much have you lost? What else are they lying to you about? Why should you trust them now?” sinks in.
If one of these super rich progressives really wanted to make a difference they’d start a “conservative” cable news network, anonymously, using the same formula as Fox, lots of family talk and hot blondes, less news and more commentary meant to incite one’s emotions and all with the goal of upending the hold Fox has on their viewers.
I think so? Honestly, I wasn’t really following this one until I came across the doc dump, and it’s surprisingly readable. The trial already going on, I’m pretty sure. Or discovery is? Again, I haven’t really been following it that closely until I came across the doc above. It really is wild.
