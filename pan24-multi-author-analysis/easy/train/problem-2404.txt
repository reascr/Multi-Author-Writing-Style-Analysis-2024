Now? I’ve been reading these people’s statements this last week like they never even heard of Miller, Sessions, never watched trump refuse to denounce white supremac. This is part and parcel of the GOP.
excuse me, wait a minute, I'm way way stronger than the Radical Left, I've done more for our Country, more than Washinon, more than Lincoln, Honest Abe, and he's probably not so Honest if you want to know the truth, and remember I came in right in the middle of a Witch Hunt by the Very Biased and Very Disgraced James Comey, and I fired him, don't forget I heard he was looking at Trump and Russia and I said I didn't like that, and I Fired him, and we took off a lot of Heat, you know what I'm saying, but now you're looking at it and even the Fake News has to say, "President Trump, He's Bulletproof," ok, no more questions, you're welcome.
And what will media do about it? Republicans have been getting away with "staying mum" for years now. Dodge the microphones, say "no comment", make up some squirrely answer that sounds good but leaves loopholes the size of Montana to duck out of later... and media falls for it over and over and over. Every single Republican who protected and defended and made excuses for Trump for years - should be held accountable. (McCarthy lied about Trump denouncing Fuentes... say that. And... remind people that Trump's comment the next day was "I like this guy... he gets me").
