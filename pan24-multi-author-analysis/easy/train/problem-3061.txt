I wouldn’t say that you have to be a millionaire to live well in America but there is absolutely a threshold to clear, and it’s somewhat related to property ownership. My wife and I sacrificed for years and also got unexpected help that allowed us to purchase several years ago. The combination of tax benefits, equity and financial mechanisms that were suddenly available to us has provided us with a level of security that we never dreamed of as renters. Unfortunately a lot of people want to pull the ladder up behind them when they cross that threshold because now they have something to protect. You become elitist because you consider yourself elite, when really you just combined enough good fortune and good decisions to claw your way out of the muck.

Exactly. If it's so critical and important, then you bend over backwards to make sure it keeps running at all times. That includes keeping the workers happy and healthy.
