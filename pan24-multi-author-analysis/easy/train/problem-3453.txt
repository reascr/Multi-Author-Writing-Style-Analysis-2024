Also, the Special Counsel gets to put together his own team. In the case of a counterintelligence investigation, where there is fear that the DOJ (or FBI, part of the DOJ) has been penetrated by foreign agents, a Special Counsel provides an extra level of security. By keeping separate records from Main Justice, there is less chance for spies to sneak in and alter or steal documents.
Exactly. The only reason Trump having classified documents was a news story was because he acted like a big baby over it. He refused to admit he had any until the only possible way to retrieve them was a raid. And he had his Fox News minions try to pretend, a la Baghdad Bob, that he could “unclassify”anything he wanted to without telling a soul.
Constitutionally it is. The President is allowed to see _any_ classified document he asks to see, but there are documents he would never know about in the scientific/technical realm. I overheard the above description of security "above the President," while in the Large Senate Conference Room. (No actual secrets were spoken at that time.).
