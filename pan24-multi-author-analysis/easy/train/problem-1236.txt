Yes, but it's an emergency type law. You can't willy nilly use this and singling out one specific company is a political dumpster fire. If it's invoked, it has to be done in a measured approach. Just because SpaceX says "no, we don't want our civilian network to be weaponized" doesn't mean the government has the basis to say "tough shit.".
SpaceX isn't being stupid, they are being very careful with what they are providing Ukraine because the US is extremely strict when it comes to unregulated arms trafficking and unregulated arms trafficking is exactly what you're asking SpaceX to do seeing how Ukraine has incorporated Starlink terminals for use in suicide drones.
How could I say no? I tried to refuse the money he offered me as honor compelled me to take on this noble endeavor in defense of the innocent, but he insisted. Now, I faithfully and diligently speak the truth about the glorious special military operation whenever I have a chance to. The rest, as they say, is my comment history.
