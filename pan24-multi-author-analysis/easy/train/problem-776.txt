I've honestly wondered what Japan would look like if it had been allowed to keep a military a good many times... I have to go there some for work, and I've never seen somewhere else simultaneously feel both extremely futuristic and extremely stuck in the past at the same time like they do. That, tied to a pretty solid dose of unabashed racism and xenophobia as well as a tendency to put group before individual in almost every case, makes it seem like a Japan that never lost its military could have made global politics a much different environment.
. Commodore Arkhipov was the deciding vote to "retaliate" against allegedly launched Nuclear Missles. For all intents and purposes, he believed that nukes were being launched, and rather than retaliating, he accepted the notion and never fired his own nukes. I hope we never put this theory to the test, but I can only hope that if war breaks and total war re-enters the battlefield, those who press the button will not follow the orders of those who command it, for no matter the risk, the cost of launching/retaliating is that of humanity's future.
