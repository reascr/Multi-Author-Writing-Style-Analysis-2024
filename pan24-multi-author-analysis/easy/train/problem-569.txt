Not really an apt comparison. Syria pulled an ace out of their sleeve in the form of a shitload of religious nutjobs, foreigners and Syrian, that they had stuffed into their prisons and tortured, radicalizing them further. They released them which in turn led to radicalization of a shitload of freedom fighters, leading to a polarizing effect where the apparent option for some parts of the country were foreign backed islamist radicals or domestic dictator. There was a legit freedom fighter contingent in the beginning of the war but these religious nutjobs infiltrated a lot of those groups and brought foreign money and weapons support with them.
I mean, halfway through the war we had literally hardcore Sunni fundamentalist fighters, all touting the same batshit ideology, shooting the shit out of each other AND other freedom fighters because they were backed by different countries or organizations.
This is very sad. Imagine if 15,000 insiders of Iranian regime got executed instead. How many problems that would solve! Is karma ever going to get them?
