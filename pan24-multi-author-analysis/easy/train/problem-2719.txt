That just isn't how that shit works mate. You need minimum 2.1 births per mother, or immigration to make up the difference, or your working population starts shrinking, and the elderly population grows relative to the working population. I don't care if you spend the entire global economic output on elder care, you still need more young people being born, at least at a rate of 2.1. If you don't, you are fucked.
The older boomer liberals have fought hard culture wars for racial equality, just look at all the court cases that struck down laws that enabled race segregation and discrimination in America, which is why we have anti-discrimination laws as part of the status quo right now. The older liberals never did transform into the old racist conservatives of the 60's, instead they became conservative to the status quo racial equality we have today and have accepted it as good enough because they managed to get a nice racial equality benchmark (a black american president) within their lifetime.
