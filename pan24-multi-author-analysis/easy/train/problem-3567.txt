The US, and others, are just beginning to bring on their manufacturing capabilities and ramp up their military production infrastructure. The war in Russia is also being used as an excuse for many to replace their old equipment by donating it to Ukraine and get new stuff. Pretty much all are going to end up stronger militarily as this drags on rather than weaker. The window for a weaker west from all this is closing real quick.
Well nato in theory has too, America signed a arms agreement saying if Ukraine gave up nukes, America would supply it with arms to defend itself, if I was president Biden I would look at Russia and say hey, see this treaty we signed if you do not want us supplying Ukrainian then we need to give them there nukes back so they can decide if they want to use them.
No. Over time they were able to track down leads and corroborate things. But at the time given what we knew, trump had absolutely no good reason to refuse to bring that up with putin on multiple occasions. THAT is what trump was criticized for.
