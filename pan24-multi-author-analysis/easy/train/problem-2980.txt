They’ll grow up and become voters and adults. The GOP can try this shit, but the clock is running out for them. I teach in fucking Trump country and those kids are the same as kids in large cities where I’ve subbed. And many parents, after seeing how strong Gen Z is in their convictions, and seeing how they’ve (parents) been isolated based on extremely conservative political views, are starting to side with their kids for fear of losing them. Not to mention that a large portion of GOP support is in rural America; rural America is extremely poor, and families rely on blue collar jobs. They’re not watching their kids 24/7 and don’t have the time and energy to fight back against education/ educators every day. They’re voting red, but they’re not living it. That’s really important - the kids are growing up with their own political ideologies. I’d love to see statistics on how many children of Republican or conservative parents identify as something vastly different.
Exactly. Flex your muscles back Blue States. Make the AP choose between getting it right for more people, or propaganda for Red States. California, Illinois and NY have more customers.
