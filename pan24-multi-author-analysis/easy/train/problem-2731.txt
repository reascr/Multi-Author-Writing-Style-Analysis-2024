And yes we are a great nation and ofc we have our faults (as in any country in the world) and am proud of this generation they are changing alot of the old ways and it shows in our commen lives , what a hate the most is people like you who thinks they can downplay our efforts in making things better and state shit like this instead of constructive criticism.
We needed to pack it up and go home. They were just not interested enough in freedom. They now have exactly what they really wanted and deserve. As awful as that is.
The two examples can be better compared if you look at Russia in Ukraine like you look at the US in Afghanistan - the aggressor attempting to occupy and hold the place to impose their view of the world and Russia is certainly finding even less support and dedication to their cause on the ground from the Ukrainian population than the US was finding in Afghanistan.
I have an idea. Let's surgically remove the testicles and penis of all Taliban rapists we catch. Doesn't even have to be public, just nice surgery so they have to sit down to piss.
Afghanistan was ambivalent about freedom, not particularly interested in self determination, and unbelieving that prosperity was even possible.
Just pointing out the injustice. They do that to women, or the equivalent (acid, stoning, etc. for infidelity). Wouldn't actually condone or suggest it in seriousness, but the simple fact of the matter is that the Taliban would not even hesitate to do effectively the same to a woman who crossed them.
Me too. I was actually one of the minority of American who was against going in there. At the time, I was told I was unAmerican and even a terrorist sympathizer! But I wasnâ€™t. I very much wanted to get Bin Laden. But we had no real evidence where he was, and I was willing to wait for the intel and then do a surgical strike similar to what we ended up doing in the end in Pakistan.
