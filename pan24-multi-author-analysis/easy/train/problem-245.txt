Honestly, conservatives, how can you continue to justify this shit? Please, enlighten us. You always want to prattle on about how the GOP is actually the party that cares about "the little guy" despite all the evidence in the world to the contrary -- how the fuck does this proposed national sales tax help the lower/middle class most of you are undoubtedly a part of? You guys are already bitching about the gas prices, but if the GOP was to tack on 25%+ more to it, suddenly you don't have a problem? And you don't ever seem to notice that the rich are the ones who continue to conveniently benefit over and over and over and over again from GOP policies? Like, come the fuck on.
The elderly and disabled whose only income is SS and that is below the exemption/threshold requiring them to pay any federal income tax and must spend all they get just to have the necessities needed to survive -- sometimes having to choose between rent, meds, food -- would, with the proposed 23% national sales tax, of course, have their taxes increased 23%. The cruelty of the Republican economic policy is the point.
