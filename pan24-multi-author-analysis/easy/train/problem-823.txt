>The thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war was determined by Carter in early 1980: Carter initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. U.S. support for the mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3 billion. The decision to route U.S. aid through Pakistan led to massive fraud, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently sold on the local market rather than delivered to the Afghan rebels; Karachi soon "became one of the most violent cities in the world." Pakistan also controlled which rebels received assistance: Of the seven mujahideen groups supported by Zia's government, four espoused Islamic fundamentalist beliefs—and these fundamentalists received most of the funding.\[10\] Despite this, Carter has expressed no regrets over his decision to support what he still considers the "freedom fighters" in Afghanistan.\[4\].
Not that simple! That would have meant subjecting to an ethnic cleansing like the Sikhs and Hindus were in Pakistan at the time of partition. Kashmir is a very complicated issue from the way it was given to India, to Pakistan’s role in the region, growing terrorism, cultural genocides of their religious minorities and broken relationships with jammu, etc.
No? Not sure exactly what you are referring to but Pakistan was there at the beginning in creating the roots for the Taliban. Pakistan lobbied USA to fund islamist militants in their fight against Soviet in Afghanistan. Pakistan's ISI then also made sure most of the support went to the more extremist mujahideen. USA is obviously to blame for agreeing to this but to leave Pakistan out of it is silly so a more correct thing to say might be that USA helped Pakistan start this or maybe the other way around. I think both wanted this but that USA had the resources to do it.
