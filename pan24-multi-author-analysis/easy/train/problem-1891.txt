I agree with this, but the hypocrisy is that there’s really no case for allowing alcohol being morally superior or alcohol being moral. People’s best defense for the morality of alcohol being legal in the West is that prohibition isn’t effective, which was true but it says nothing about the morality, it only speaks to people’s dependence (not only in the west) on it. It’s so interesting to me to see people use this as an example of how ass backwards Qatar is for this ban of alcohol, because I agree that they ban it for the wrong reasons (religion) but I don’t think their attitude towards alcohol is anything backwards. The other hypocritical aspect is that the capitalistic view of the West would seem to advocate for the private business being able to have their own rules like Twitter banning Trump for violating their terms of service and how that isn’t actually violating freedom of speech because they are a private business.
If you really cared enough, you would look into them. Plus you wouldn’t be here claiming “western supremacy” when it’s a history full of crime and shame.
