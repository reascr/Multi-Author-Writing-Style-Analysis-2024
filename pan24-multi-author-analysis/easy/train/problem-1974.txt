Donâ€™t both of these countries have universal healthcare funded by the government? So effectively most nurses are federal employees? Seems like the anti-capitalist sentiment here is misplaced.
Ideological? What? The people doing that do it for one reason: greed! That's not ideological. That's extremely practical. They just want more wealth, more influence, and more power.
Governments are operating under capitalism for ideological reasons and forcing each department to operate like a corporation for ideological reasons. The ideology is to blame here.
Other anti-capitalist shit: monopolies, cartels (both of which dominate our economies nowadays, espeically in the US), regulatory capture, legalizing of corruption, revolving doors, making access to information and skills difficult (from the principles of basic capitalism, i.e. free access to information, one can conclude that education, including higher education must be free, and put at the disposal of the population by the government). etc. etc.
Its definitely conservative pollies, lobbied by companies, CEOs and corporate friends, deliberatley sabotaging gov health in an effort to make private health care seem like the more efficient option.
Of course not! Capitalism is to the economy, what democracy is to governance. With capitalism, for the first time, the majority of intelligent hard working peasants could rise, while the majority of dumb lazy elites could fall.
