The Taliban government last month first decided to suspend university education for women, and later issued an outright ban on education for women. However, some girls' schools have remained open.
The republic is unislamic, the current relations with the west is unislamic, the foreign policy is unislamic, the current economic system is unislamic, the laws and constitution is unislamic, the nation-state is unislamic, the consumption of alcohol, prostitution, usury and interests all are unislamic.
What ? Taliban aren't Wahhabi/Salafi, they're Deobandi. The Taliban hate the Wahhabis and have closed Wahhabi mosques and killed Wahabbi scholars/clerics after taking over Afghanistan in 2021. And the hatred goes the other way too, ISIS hate Taliban.
On Wednesday, Turkey initiated an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which called on the Afghan interim government to review its ban on women's education and working in educational and non-government organisations.
