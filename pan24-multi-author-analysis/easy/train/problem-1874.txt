It's completely disgusting how much plastic is used by restaurants in gig delivery. Literally every item by some of these restaurants are packaged in their own container never to be used again. I don't even buy bowls. I just use what I've gotten from these places. Often, they are objects durable enough to be used for years. Delivery before the gig company hijacking of the industry was largely pizza and Asian based because it can be delivered in a paper based container. Most of the items that are delivered in plastic could be delivered in more ecologically sound ways that could and should be cheaper. Many restaurants are victims of their own egotism. "Their food" is special and it's necessary for it to be delivered in packaging that more maximizes temperature like plastic.
Ahhhwwwhh fuck! My entire freezer is plastic. I have a long journey. I appreciate it nonetheless, though. I need to make a lifestyle change.
Our Extended Producer Responsibility scheme will mean packaging producers will be expected to cover the cost of recycling and disposing of their packaging.
You're funny. You come across as quite the practiced devaluer. I'd almost believe you're on some payroll to jump in on comments like these. We've known for some time that gig companies employ trolls on social media to mitigate truth that could hurt profits as do many other sectors.
