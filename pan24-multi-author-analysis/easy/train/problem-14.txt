I mean if the search warrant for Mar-a-lago is anything to go on, then Trump isn't under investigation for 18 USC 1924 (aka mishandling classified documents). He's under investigation for 18 USC 793 (willfully retaining national security documents when their return has been requested by the government). The government requested the documents, and had to obtain a subpoena to get them back and still more were found at Mar-a-lago during an execution of a search warrant. 18 USC 1519 ( failing to respond faithfully and truthfully to a subpoena) because in June Trump had a signed sworn affidavit attesting that after a self conducted search, or at least one done at his direction, of Mar-a-lago all documents with classified markings on them had been returned to the government which was factually false in that either that a search wasn't performed or that the documents were intentionally not turned over. 18 USC 2071 (attempting to conceal the location of government property) for trying to convince the government that no additional documents existed at Mar-a-lago.
Exactly. If NARA, the CIA, FBI and the DOJ didn't notice they were missing, probably not of any real significance. And, if the Biden administration wasn't being completely transparent, we wouldn't know about it at all.... Conspiracy theorists will have a field day with this, get the popcorn ready.
