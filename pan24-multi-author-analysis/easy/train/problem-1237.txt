Schlaffly is just outrageous. She was very much already into politics by that time. She wanted to go to Harvard Law, but because it was still men only she eneded up receiving a MA in government from Radcliffe in the mid 40s. She thought communism was America's number one threat, wrote a book with her lawyer husband about it, and became a researcher for the American Enterprise Institute, which is a conservative think tank. The RNC wanted Fred Schlaffly to run for Congress. When he turned it down, she ran. That was all before Nixons nomination.
I blame megachurches and nondenominational pseudo Christianity. Demagogue pastors are basically assuming the role of tribal warlords in rural America and enforcing a paranoid and primitive social structure. And unfortunately our capitalist overlords have found benefit in allowing their anti- intellectual, anti-government movement to flourish.
No. America does not benefit from multiple political parties. Under the current First Past The Post rules, multiple parties only split the vote. Progressives should not help American conservatives gain power. Focus on pushing democrats further left. Do not enable the fascists to gain power.
