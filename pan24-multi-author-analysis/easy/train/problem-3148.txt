Technically? Nothing. As it is part of the budget it could even be done by reconciliation which bypasses the senate filibuster. Practically? Politics. The debt limit is used by both parties to get concessions on what they want. In the past it was much more of a wink-wink-nudge-nudge in the sense that all demands would be met and the limit would be raised. That's mostly because those demands were, historically, pork projects like a new bridge in a member's district or something like that that makes the rep look good. Nowadays the demands are a lot more unpalatable but politics being politics the debt limit is kept around because of what it used to be.
