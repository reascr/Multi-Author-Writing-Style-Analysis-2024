This is about control. The internet has always been this way, I was on the internet around 13-14 and even with my parents not doing a great job of raising me I still came out fine with it. Parents need to just talk to their kids and teach them about the world as they discover it, not cover them with a blanket until they are 18 and let them loose. Big reason why a lot of kids from conservative families end up the most wild in college. All of a sudden floodgates of sex, drugs, booze, etc open up and it's time to catch up. If this passes I'm creating accounts for my kids, fuck the government, I want the opportunity while they are at home to teach them about what to look out for. Same approach with alcohol, when they are reasonably old (teens?) they can try some and I am explaining very well to them how it works, both short term (hangovers) and long term (liver damage), and how moderation can be fine. Will talk to them frankly about other topics like sex and drugs (not going to give them weed or anything obviously). Teetotalism is the worst approach, we see this by abstinence only eductation.
