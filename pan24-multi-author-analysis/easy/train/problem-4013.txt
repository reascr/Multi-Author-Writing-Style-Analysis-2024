As a former railroader who worked in mechanical as a carman, the railroad knows that this stuff is preventable from the top to the bottom management doesn't care it's all about cutting corners and keeping trains going from a to b a car being or waiting for repairs isn't making money, the railroad police who investigate these derailments or not going to go against those that sign there checks.
Well of course. It’s definitely on me to stay informed on things. If I choose to do so. I’m an adult and no one else is responsible for me. But whenever I do manage to get some free time I choose to spend it relaxing and ignoring most things outside of my own home. So my assumption was just based on the frequency of articles such as this and the past news of rail workers demanding to strike for a better work environment and being forced to deal with it by the government. So I just wouldn’t blame them for going around it and doing what they can to force things to slow down to show the things they were demanding be changed.
