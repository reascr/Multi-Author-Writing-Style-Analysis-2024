"The 27-year-old World Cup fan was shot in the head and killed by regime militias in Anzali, northern Iran, by Iran’s Islamic Regime’s security forces, according to reports.".
Really? Americans fucking LOVE World Cup soccer lol, it’s a great excuse to have a barbecue and drink as much beer as an Englishman on holiday. Obviously you couldn’t pack 100k people in a soccer stadium every week like you can with American football, but Americans love any excuse to party, so I’ve never been to a bar for a world cup match that wasn’t PACKED.
It is that deep. Yes, a lot of the players have families that are likely being threatened in Iran, but at the same time, some of them wholeheartedly support Khamenei. Like Torabi:
Not an Olympian, but Mark Taimanov was a top 20 chess player in the world in 1971 when he suffered a resounding defeat at the hands of the American Bobby Fischer (he lost a match 6 games to zero which was absolutely unheard of for a top player, about the same as, say, Medvedev losing a tennis match without winning any games, or Germany losing a football match 10-0).
