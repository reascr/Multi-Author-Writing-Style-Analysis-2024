Also, this is going to be an unpopular thing to be heard but I'm going to say it. If someone's going to abuse/exploit woman, they are just going to do it regardless. If the UK government want to concern themselves with such an issue, maybe they should first address the underfunded police service that is no longer investigating such crimes due to lack of funding and man power.
Good. The bill was so bad. It gave people the right to get a gender certificate that would allow you to go into spaces for your assigned gender. Ok fine. But those opposed said “ok but what if sex criminals get that certificate to get access to women’s spaces” so they put forth an amendment that would ban sex criminals from getting said certificate and that was voted down by Sturgeon & co. Like why? Why not have that provision in there? If they had had that provision in there it would have been less likely for Westminster to block it. Put forth a bill that helps trans people but has provisions in it that make sure sex pests won’t use said laws to access to women’s spaces for obviously bad reasons.
And also, now your argument is that since there are trans sex criminals there shouldn’t be any provisions? Like what? Is tying trans people to sex crimes a bad thing or not?
