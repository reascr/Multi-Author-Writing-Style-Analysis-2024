I mean in the end countries will do what they need to do. I mean they literally have china as the best example with all the deforestation and environmental mess they did to their own land. But once u get to a point tides start to change abit, people get aware and protest. Now China has the highest reforestation percentage in the world. Still not enough but I mean u get the point. We only start action when it’s too late. U can’t forcefully dictate what other countries can do…. U have to negotiate with them and come to a term they all agree. I bet if the richer nations paid for it they are more than happy enough to choose the alternative. It’s a depressing topic. I say we are already too late and too selfish even the west. Too slow too little inaction but I mean what can u do. Hopefully we finally realise the emergency of the situation but honestly we don’t.
Exactly. Europeans already cleared most of their forests centuries ago, and this is directly causal to the European industrial revolution and subsequent global colonial dominance. Now they're just pulling up the ladder with more protectionism.
