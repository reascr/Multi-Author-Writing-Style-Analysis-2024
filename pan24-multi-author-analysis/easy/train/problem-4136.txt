Not OP, but I might have somewhat of an answer. I come from a conservative, pretty redneck area, where so many people have that mindset that to be cool you have to be tough and a “real man” (I suck at describing the type without being able to mimic how they act, but half of their attitude boils down to “did you just look at my girl, I’ll fuck you up” and “what a wuss, I could kick their ass”, you know, just shitty attitude and fake toughness up the ass). So where I live, those are the people (mostly guys) who glommed onto ICP as hard as they could, and were the most vocal about it. They don’t understand irony or satire, and think that being rowdy and destructive makes them cooler than anyone else, and they worship ICP for who they think they are, not who they actually are. Those guys kind of ruin the fandom in areas like mine, where the fans who get it just keep their mouths shut so they aren’t associated with the “I’m more badass than anyone” crowd who makes shitty style ICP worshipping their entire identity. Possibly the commenter you replied to has had a similar experience and that’s the unfortunate picture they have of the ICP fandom. I wish I was better at explaining the attitude type, they are also racist and bigoted as hell, and just suck.
