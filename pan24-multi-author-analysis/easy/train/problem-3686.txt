I'm curious as to what you do for work, not that you need to answer that. But for jobs that I won't even apply to, it is very common that I see them put something like that. Make as much as x! When there's no way to make as much as x, because that particular role is filled. So, if it says make as much as 18 at McDonald's but the only job available is fry cook and they know it, you're not going to be making anywhere near $18. So they shouldn't say make as much as $18. They should say make from 12 to $18. Then people who are fry cooks won't get their hopes up and people who are somewhere above a fry cookbook below a manager might not waste their time looking at a job that pays less than they're used to while thinking it might pay more.

Typically scummy companies (most?) like to withhold salary info until you’re exhausted from the many rounds of interviews and you’re too invested to back out, then hit you with the low ball offer wasting everyone’s time.
