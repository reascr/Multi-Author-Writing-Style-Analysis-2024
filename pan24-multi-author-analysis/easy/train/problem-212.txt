Now, you may notice that I focused on the TCJA and not the dereg work in that section. This is because the TCJA is a sort of avatar of dereg. The time taken for legislative reconciliation action such as the TCJA to get through and take effect is only slightly longer than the time taken for executive action such as dereg to take effect. Adding a 9-12 month delay to both of these allows us to choose 2019 as a model year for sampling. If it were not for the pandemic in 2020, we could judge the dereg based on 2020 and 2021 figures. Unfortunately, Chairman Xi ruined what could have need an interesting statistical experiment.
100% agree with them.... It's a huge diversion from the fact that the blame lies with all of our government. While shitty, what Trump did has nothing to do with the derailment. Our government has been letting carriers get away with murder by letting them control laws and regulations. Not to mention they don't want the fact of Biden fucking over railroad workers by forcing the contract.
