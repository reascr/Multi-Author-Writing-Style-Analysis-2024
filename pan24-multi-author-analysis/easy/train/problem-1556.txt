If it wasn't for this war, he could pull this off successfully, hell he may even still. This is one thing Russia is good at. If Putin was not so very stupid as to invade Ukraine militarily, he could probably destroy Europe easily by means of contaminating the government with his agents as Europe will just continue to be complacent towards Russia.
LOL. EU lied for 20 years, saying it was going green and shutting down coal power plants and other forms of energy. But as well know now it was huge lie because they just kept buying more and more oil from Russia.
The EU delivered billions to Russia while lying to its own citizens about where it was getting its energy from. Now the EU is out buying energy and other resources on the open market reeking havoc on global energy prices as they scoop up energy, paying higher cost, raising overall energy costs and redirecting much needed energy from other countries to the EU all while telling the globe they can't touch a major cash of russian oil, nat gas, lithium, grain, and a host of minerals.
