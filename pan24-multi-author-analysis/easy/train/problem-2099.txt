That would be terrible. Candidates would only have to compete in CA, TX, NY, and FL to basically secure a nomination, it would completely prevent small low-funded candidates from ever having a chance.
I don't understand. What issues do you feel disproportionately affect Hispanics and are being neglected in favor of issues that disproportionately affect Black voters? I think it's dangerous to pit Black voters against Hispanic voters when their issues aren't mutually exclusive. Black and Brown communities both experience wide disparities in health, justice, education, and economic outcomes.
That's fine with me. I don't think such candidates should be entitled to having the primaries structured in ways that give them a boost. If they really want to go for high office, they can work their way up through lower office and make their name there, perhaps at the state level (governor?) or Congress. They can still try for high office, just gotta actually show up with some sort of experience that allows them to build up a national profile for themselves, rarher than filling their heads with dreams of just running an effective insurgent appeal in two undiverse and low populated states and then use that to artificially catapult themselves to national fame.
SC is a good choice. Smallish state with a large black population (the most reliable Democratic voters there is) and importantly ads in SC also play in NC and GA which are both trending (at times) towards Dems and can are important to flip in the future to account for the loss of FL as a swing state.
Didn't need Title IX to have girl's sports. In 1970, 20 percent of all girls participating in high school sports across the country were in Iowa.
