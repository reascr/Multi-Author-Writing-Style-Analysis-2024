AOC has been sticking it to the establishment democrats too — she endorsed a successful primary challenge against the 2nd ranking house democrat last cycle (the guy who she endorsed, Jamal Bowman, won handily in the 16th district on Tuesday), and also endorsed an unsuccessful primary challenger against Sean Patrick Maloney this cycle (Maloney is the head of the DCCC and just lost his race, even though he’d switched districts to run in the more dem-friendly 18th district this time around. What a fucking putz that dude is.).

Exactly. The chair of the state party spent more money trying to make sure on corrupt Buffalo mayor Byron Brown’s write-in campaign after he lost his primary to a more progressive challenger than he spent on Hochul’s STATEWIDE campaign this year for governor.
