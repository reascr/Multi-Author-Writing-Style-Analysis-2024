30 years from now we will be able to tell grown ass adults who have never heard of Donald trump in their life except for some nationalists and national security history, this story of how a president was the cause of a massive rail accident in an American city. Who then proceeded to blame it on his political opponent and then gave the town old-stock water bottles with his own name on it that have probably been sitting in sunlight on the outside of a warehouse bleeding plastic chemicals into it for over a decade because he is such a shitty and cheap buisness man that he probably defaulted on storage space + the water company failed.
Nope, I don't. But I do believe it's a leaders responsibility to show solidarity with his people, regardless of who is at fault.
I believe that leaders should accept responsibility for things that go wrong under their leadership, and find ways to move forward and resolve issues.

Definitely! And every day that President Biden doesn't show solidarity with the house leader over this issue is another day that reinforces that Democrat leadership does not see it as worth their time.
