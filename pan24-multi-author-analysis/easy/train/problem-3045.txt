In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. We have to realize that many Republicans are actually just reasonable, normal people when they’re not chugging the firehose of right-wing fear-mongering, hateful propaganda. FOX Propaganda and their ilk is truly what is to blame for this tide of fascism in the US.
Really? Not even abortion rights and school shootings kept Texas and Florida from being dark red. Democrats just barely keep the Senate. The dangerous urban/rural divide in the House remains.

You’re seeing disproportionate representation. In 2018 it was something like 56% of voters were represented by 45% of house representatives. I’m sure with the redistricting with the 2020 census it has got worse. It is to be expected in the Senate as that was to provide a equal representation to the states themselves instead of individual localities.
