Specifically this was the Nov. 2022 issue with the cover story being titled "Minority Rule -- How 3% of Texans call the shots for the rest of us" by Michael Hardy. A further description of the article's thesis in the Table of Contents attributes the current seemingly deep red make-up of the state's elected officials to "gerrymandering, voter suppression, low primary-election turnout and an anemic Democratic party". There was a interesting little chart in the article showing just how few Texans -- GOP and Dems -- actually turn up to vote in the primaries. So a 'tiny fraction' of voters are choosing the likes of Abbott, Cruz, et al. And I'd guess that a lot of what this article says might well apply to Florida as well.
Politics. Somebody must define expectations on blue or red wave, since its never happens. Senate move in 2 or 3 seats. governor also 2 and 3. House changes could reflect people sentiment, but 90% of the seats never change, so it is the sentiment of 10% of the population. Party fanaticism is hurting USA.
