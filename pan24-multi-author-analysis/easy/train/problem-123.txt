Also, the fact that Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia - Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- are inhabited by distinct ethnic groups (Abkhazians and Ossetians). The Abkhazians were involved in a bloody conflict with ethnic Georgians from 1989 through the 1990s (Abkhazâ€“Georgian conflict). To this day, Abkhazians have strong opinions about being controlled by Georgians. This of course doesn't justify Putin's invasion, which anyway happened at a much later time (2008). Nonetheless, my point is that Georgia trying to retake its lawful territories will have much worse optics than Ukrainians retaking territory that is primarily inhabited by self-identified Ukrainians. Georgia's sub-4mln population and small land area also means they have a lot to lose by getting involved in another war with Russia.
Seriously. Day by day, the US keeps proving itself to be greedy as hell. I know Russia has its ultra rich and stuff, but I'm willing to bet the US is the most greedy country by a decent portion.
