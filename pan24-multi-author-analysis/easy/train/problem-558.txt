I don’t think you have any understanding of what ‘better purchasing regulations’ even means. Even if I suggest an obvious solution you will not accept it because you are obviously already trying to make it harder for everyday people to own/buy guns. This is not an aircraft made by a private company we are talking about, this is is you and my natural right to defend ourselves. That number is not extremely high, it’s actually extremely low given the tense nature we are in, we just came out of a worldwide pandemic, a recession, and we are supporting a defensive war. If your goal is zero deaths, I cannot be on board because that’s not possible without banning the sale of every gun and even then it’s still not possible as there are hundreds of millions of guns in common use so you would have to go door-door and literally threaten people with violence unless they comply. Right now, we aren’t doing that bad and you can argue there was never really a time where it was bad in the US, it was always relatively safe so long as you don’t frequent shady areas and even those areas are usually pretty safe.
