If the constitution protects the people’s rights, why do so many people buy guns to protect themselves??? The constitution is a piece of paper and it does absolutely nothing to protect anything (it is often not even clear what the constitution means - experts and others are fighting over its interpretation). It is absolutely wrong to say that something is not a right if it depends on other people’s labor or finances. Example: without the military, you would most likely a Russian or Chinese serf. Without the police, your life would be at much higher risk. Both military and police rely on being financed by taxpayer’s. Like it or not, humans form societies, because they cannot do everything themselves, and that includes protecting their rights - whatever they may be. If somebody legally challenges your rights, you yet again rely on other people’s labor: your lawyer. If you cannot afford one, taxpayer money will pay for one, meaning your fellow citizens are paying. But back to abortion: the ‘right’ or the ability to have on abortion is included in the right of women to bodily autonomy.
