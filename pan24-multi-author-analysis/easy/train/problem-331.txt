As an American, I'm really exhausted. Im tired of feeling like I'm holding my breath. Statistically, I know the odds of being in a mass shooting are low, but they're a lot higher than it needs to be. We all know its fucked. Anyone who doesnt think this is a problem can actually suck a butthole. But I gurantee not shit will be done, and that is so frustrating. I believe that the general public should have access to guns because you never know when a government is going to pull some shit. I also recognize that there are just enthusiasts and hobbyists within gun culture. BUT there has to be something we should do to screen who has access to this shit. I know that this analogy is cliche, but it is like responsible vehicle ownership: you have a license, you have insurance, you update your tabs, etc. Are there people who slip through the system? Absolutely! Are there people who just "drive" erratically or break the law? Yeah. Humans love to break rules, and we'll be here all day if we try to figure our all the different ways someone can skirt the rules. If you're worried that a law that restricts access to gun ownership if you have a history of violence, domestic abuse, erratic behavior, etc. will directly affect YOU, then you are exactly the kind of person that should not posses a gun.
Fit-for-purpose mental health provision, more accessible education, gun owner-competency laws. It would be a long process and all of those that need fit-for-purpose mental health provision, a better standard of education, and wouldn't pass owner-competency tests would fight against it.
