The Republicans also just went to hard on the social issues. MI is a weird place where the same person can drink organic small batch Kombucha while doing Drag Queen Bingo and then volunteering at Planned Parenthood one weekend and go deer hunting, drinking PBR, and going to church the next weekend. Republicans focused too much on social issues and to be fair to Democrats they played "hard" on economic issues (Trump won in MI in 2016 in part because it was factory workers in the Midwest who lost out when American (and foreign) officials, media, and labeled protecting American jobs as "protectionism, nationalism, Sinophobia, any other phobia, etc." but labeled the same practices by other countries as "economic sovereignty, protecting legitimate worker interests, going against global imperialism, etc." Democrats were less afraid to be politically incorrect around jobs and the economy and say that they would fight for workers.
Interesting! I haven’t visited Atanta since the early 2000s. A friend of mine went to this year’s Pride, and she said it was fantastic. I should probably visit soon.
