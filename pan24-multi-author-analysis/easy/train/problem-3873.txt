Fani Willis is the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia (Atlanta metro area). A DA's job is mostly prosecuting violent crime. She is woefully ill-equipped for investigating election fraud. You'd be hard-pressed to find a DA with experience investigating these types of crimes, especially involving a former POTUS. Her office doesn't have the manpower or the budget to be doing this, so it's taking a long time. I also think that lends a lot of legitimacy to the situation. Every dollar and man-hour she spends investigating Trump and his cronies is a resource she can't spend prosecuting violent crime in Atlanta. She's an elected official and her job security depends on keeping Atlanta safe. This whole investigation is a gamble for her. After two years, I think she's really "pot-committed" as the poker players would say.
