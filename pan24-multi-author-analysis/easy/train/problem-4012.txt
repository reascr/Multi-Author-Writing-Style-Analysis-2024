It is easy, the previous government was unified only by the fact they wanted him out. Once they put him in opposition, they had to negotiate with all wings of the entire political spectrum. Once the government is shown how fragile and ineffective it is, he can swoop in. This time he had to negotiate with the more radical wings of politics to come back to power, and the worsening of conditions on the ground for both Palestinians and Israelis makes them more hardline (we don't like them but they are doing what needs to be done rhetoric) that normalizes more extreme ideology.
Big NO on that one. They refuse to take in more refugees, including those they left behind after the war of 67. This is a big reason why there is such a problem even. If Jordan owned up to its actions of attacking Israel twice, we wouldn't have had the refugee problem that we have.
Oh yeah, Jordan fought a war with Israel half a century ago that create a refugee problem for them, never omit this part.
You are also not mentioning that Jordan refused to give the Palestinians their own country between 48 and 67. Why is that?
