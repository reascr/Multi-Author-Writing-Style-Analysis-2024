Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive against Russian forces continues to surprise and impress. It surprises for the military’s ability to emerge from six years of grinding war as a force that’s agile, strategic and lethal. And it has impressed with how it’s been able counter Russian President Vladimir Putin’s propaganda machine, Russia’s brutal attacks on civilians, and has rallied the United States and Western allies to arm, train and plan.
But while we cautiously applaud Ukraine’s success and resistance, we can easily forget Russia’s steadfast allies — allies who stand with Moscow’s objectives and, therefore, against the principles for which Ukraine and its partners are fighting.
...you guys? Who exactly are you generalizing - I found this out from Indians themselves...they're literally saying this in the comments here? And everything is not black and white - THIS is.

No. You're of course changing what I said. I didn't say anything about oil specifically - that's one of many imports like fertilizer and defense that India can't afford to have Russia threaten, and therefore won't go against Russia.
