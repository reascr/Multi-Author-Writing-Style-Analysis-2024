Turks have been living in Anatolia in large numbers since at least the 1100’s, and European Greece had been controlled by Turks for almost 400 years. I would be surprised if the Greeks and Turks aren’t genetically closer. 1000 years of close proximity usually deludes ethnic differences. I have no proof of this but I always thought of modern 20th/21st cen Greeks and Turks as just two cultures of the same people. (Granted I could never say this to ether of them. They’d probably call a truce just to kick my ass).
Climate change is too abstract and scientific for most people to see the causality chain from our own actions to death and suffering to get an immediate emotional response; digging up oil, driving around in an SUV, exploiting the environment for fun and profit is rather incentivized and not like going further than Hitler ever did by gassing the whole planet; also we aren't feeling helpless, we just don't feel like it; it requires long term investment and fundamental changes, we can't just throw money at it, feel good, and continue with business as usual.
