I disagree, people miss boxes on government forms all the time. The rule in Pennsylvania is that ballots must be received by 8pm on election day. Thousands of people met that rule. The government is suppressing vote-by-mail using a loophole. A dating error does not match the severity of the consequence, which is eliminating large blocks of voters from choosing a candidate. So the onus is on the government to make this correction, in my opinion.

Filed in federal court on the eve of Election Day, the lawsuit argues that a Pennsylvania state law requiring voters to date the outer envelopes of absentee ballots "has no relevance to determining whether an individual is qualified to vote, in violation of the Civil Rights Act, and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right.".
Absentee voters have historically voted Dem. So it's easy to assume that ballots voided for missing that line would disportionately be Democratic ballots.
