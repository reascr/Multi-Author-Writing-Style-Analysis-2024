I think it’s just an example. What if the next prime minister of Ukraine is less Zelensky and more Lukashenka. After this mass transfer of arms that leader is going to be in charge not only of one the largest and most advanced militaries in Europe but also will own and have access to the weaknesses of all the other western powers tanks and technology etc.
1. Globalization is not going anywhere any time soon. We’ve been globalized. International supply chains will change structure. But because shit like republicans wanting cheap goods and shitting on labor in this country- that’s not gonna change. Take it up with them and support SHIt like tarrifs and collective bargaining. The fact that Russia and China are being isolated does not mean “globalization is ending”. American culture will ensure that we go to places like Vietnam or some poor Latin American country to produce cheap goods.
Escalation. When the Rammstein Meeting is over and they announce that DE/PL/NW/USA/GB ectpp will send like 600 MBT's in total. What will russia do? Go to a fully fledged war state? Mobilize 5 Millions, Open ALL Depots? Drown Ukraine in warm bodies and blood until the West breaks apart over cost and the will to defend a NON Nato member?
