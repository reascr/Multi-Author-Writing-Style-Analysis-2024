Yes they can. House passed 2 bills, one of which they knew was dead on arrival as a pure token gesture. A sacrificial lamb. The House could have passed a single bill to the Senate that included the sick leave. Forced the Senate to take up the only bill available to them. They didn't. That's what hardball politics looks like and what the Democrats never do.
Which is what the House democrats knew what would happen. They could have sent only that 2nd bill to the Senate. They could have forced the Senate to vote only on that one bill. But nope, they offered up that 2nd bill as the sacrificial lamb that never had a chance of passing and everyone knew it. Its insulting to these Rail workers that Democrats will claimed they tried. They didn't. They took the easy way out.
They did the easy move. Break the union, let the Rail companies win like everyone knew they would. Rail companies knew Biden and Congress had their back so never had any motivation to negotiate in good faith.
