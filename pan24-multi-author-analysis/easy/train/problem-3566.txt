PLUS University instructors, railway train crews, post office workers and many others. The UK is in a downward spiral, and their currency is falling fast. Those that can afford to are getting out, while they can. Applications from UK citizens who want to come to Canada have increased about 35 percent this year, over last year. JimB.
Oh yeah its really gotten worst in the past year, between Truss mini budget and the massive rise in the cost of everything from food to electricity, to point that essential workers like the police and nurses are forced to use foodbanks to support their families.
Amen. Capitalism will always be a system where the powerful profit off exploiting the workers - there is no reason to treat workers humanely, as that costs more than treating them like trash. The core goal of capitalism is to make more money, not advance human rights. Only by working in collective unions can workers ensure they are treated fairly - by threatening that ability for companies to profit.
Honestly, probably . It’s purely a result of logistics… if an entire nation wants to buy literal tons of goods in December for Christmas, there’s literally not enough storage space in the store for it all, and there’s not enough transportation capacity to get it there. So stores NEED to clear inventory in order to get more in. This naturally creates Black Friday.
