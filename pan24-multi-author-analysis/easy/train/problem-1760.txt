And just because dems will lack 60 votes does not mean that this will not continue to keep their base engaged on these issues - the opposite effect in republican voters in rural areas was actually noticed for the mid term election, so I wonder what the timing of this will do to their enthusiasm combined with the piss poor showing on the midterms overall for what was supposed to be a red tsunami, as they say.
Yup, it’s a shithole. I know it’s hard to relocate. I’m in southwestern Idaho, and want to relocate to the Oregon coast. It’s not just the people, and politics, but the climate (extreme winters/summers) sucks here. Someday it will happen. Patience will pay off.
