I know how you feel. Both my parents are very conservative so I've just resorted to greyrocking because they are rude as hell any time I disagree with them and like you said, the conversation is pointless because nobody's minds change. So I just completely ignore them when they rant about politics and change the subject every time, usually with my father. But my mother is much more aggressive when it comes to politics and it's clear it's just a copy paste of whatever that pompous fuck Tucker Carlson said, so why would I waste my mental energy listening to what someone else told her to think?
Oh absolutely! And "religion" is a bit too encompassing - I should have written, "evangelical christianity with a bit of judaism thrown in because we actually believe the rapture is a thing and we're going to need a visa to get into israel even though the god we're going to see is supposed to be omnipotent.".
