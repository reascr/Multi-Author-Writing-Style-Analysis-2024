Back in June they put out a request at the UN that the international community start calling them "Türkiye" instead of the aglicized "Turkey", and I believe everyone went along with it, because hey, their country, their name.
1. Create NNATO (New NATO) with a charter exactly the same as the NATO charter except that admitting a new country only requires 2/3rds of the members to approve it.
Why? To include our great fearsome force of 80k reservists/home guards in a giant plot of woods where our only geopolitically relevant area is Gotland? Our society of people whining when LIMITED CONSCRIPTION was re-inteoduced after this fucked up security situation in Europe? Does this sound like a sound decision from a military pov when we are against a country like Russia? Would we risk having Turkey join THEIR bloc? I know Erdoğan plays us with this fear in mind but it is 100% legitimate.
While important economically it's not that important militarily. Access to the middle east is, especially if we have to take on Iran. Turkiye hosting early radar warning system is another example. Their naval bases and airfields are as well. Especially since the sues canal is so close to it's bases.
b) Turkey has SHOWN since their entrance 1952 their dedication (for good and bad) to the conflict against communism, taking part in the Korea war, fighting vigorously against communism in their own country and blocking Russia several times in the Middle East - whereas Sweden decided on a pure whim (and after political threats from our opposition against our anti-NATO Socialdemocratic Party) to join NATO with public opinion being STILL very divided on the topic. Basically, Turkey has known what they've wanted since 1952 - Sweden found that out 2022.
