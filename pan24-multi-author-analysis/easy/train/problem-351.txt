Which is why most ignore it. I had a highway patrol officer tell me about pulling over a young gal in a yellow mustang for speeding. When he came up to her car, she had two unopened mile high mint THC candy bars sitting on the seat next to her. He said, “I’m going to go back to my car and give you a chance to put those away”. He did, and returned and asked for her license and proof of insurance. She opened the glove box and the bars fell out onto the floor. She started crying and handed him the bars. He said,” Just leave them in your glovebox, don’t ever try smuggling for a career, and slow down”. End of stop.
Weed isn’t creating crime, government failure to handle our crumbling infrastructure, stagnated wages, and outsourcing of good paying jobs is what created that crime. If you think otherwise then damn do these billionaires love a fool like you.

Seriously though. I spent my early childhood on the border with that Kansas. Why their faces so round. Is it the wheat or the inbreeding you think?
