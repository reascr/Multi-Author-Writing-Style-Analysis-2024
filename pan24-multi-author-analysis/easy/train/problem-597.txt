Yep. I could never agree with a conservative, but I can respect the principled ones who are willing to compromise. Despite being solidly on the left side of the political spectrum for life, I firmly believe we need other points of view, and corrupt/maga conservatives are denying actual conservative viewpoints to our entire country.
If only. The big 3 tv media lives off drama. Might as well be Bravo. But they’re shirking their responsibility to the American people to be our investigators.
100% true. Currently live in AZ. Any democrat could see this coming from a mile away. The outsiders kept saying “kari lake is leading in the polls…”. Secretary of State , senate seats and superintendent went blue in 2018 because of it. Then Biden won. Then governor, Secretary of State, AG and senate seat. They can’t stand trump. Once they see Horne as superintendent he’ll be voted out in 4 years.
