These guys are so afraid that they had to put "Nordic" there to put credibility on them because "loser Islamic faction who had to escape to Sweden from Turkey because of another Islamic faction in Turkey" sounds a bit less credible. They draw their news from their times in Turkey, and it's very apparent in their titles. They were in Turkey when Turkey had the idea of "Muslim Brotherhood". When it turned out Muslims had no business or interest in being a brotherhood, Turkey turned to Israel and other allies. Turkey doesn't care about Kashmir or Palestine anymore. SADAT is now at their lowest.
After the 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum resulted in a 93 percent pro-independence vote, Iraqi forces invaded and retook a large portion of Kurdish-held territories. In response, Netanyahu stated that Israelis had a "deep natural longstanding sympathy" for the Kurds.[29].
Kurds have taken and still get bribes from the rival of their host country in order to bomb/burn schools, hospitals, marketplaces, assault military installations (but only the defensive ones), or if no one pays then they transport drugs, do illegal drug dealing, etc.
