All countries should be able to dictate whether another country is allowed to do business within their borders or not. So, yes the US, China, Russia, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, don’t give a fuck, should be allowed to shut countries out of their national markets if they want to. Hell we even dictate to a degree US citizens and business ownership with the various regulations (national or international) as well as needing to maintain a business license.
ok. I am not really looking for a debate with a person not wanting to push forward the conversation. So, one more try.
I'm trying to understand why you think America (or any country) doesn't have a right to sanction companies conducting business on American soil/with American government entities and corporations, and beyond that, to decide that we do not want their products in this country?
And? Your other comments about if China overtakes the US in terms of economic strenh that we would be crying. That is just a fever dream you have. from operating within their borders. You won’t find US citizens or the US government bitching and moaning that they did it either. It is their right as a sovereign country to do so.
