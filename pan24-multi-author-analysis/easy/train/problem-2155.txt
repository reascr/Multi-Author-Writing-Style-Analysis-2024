I don't remember seeing communication from NATO. If their communication is "hidden" (published) on their website and people are not actively searching about COVID-19 on the NATO's website, how this make any meaningful impact?
The information on NATO's website about the COVID-19 disinformation is dated 2020. Today is 2023. There is new disinformation. Hm...
In 1936 the Spanish civil war began, by order of the government of the Second Republic, chaired by Francisco Largo Caballero, 510 tons of gold were sent, corresponding to 72.6% of the gold reserves of the Bank of Spain, from its deposit in Madrid to the Soviet Union, a few months after the start of the Spanish Civil War for fear that the opposing side would seize that gold, when the war ended and Spain sent people to Russia to recover their gold they were almost shot, Russia stole the gold from Spain and it was NEVER returned, so yeah, we hate Russia and we hate the idiots who sent the gold there, it's hard to hear that the fucking Russians have metro stations made of gold, we all know where they got it from, They're fucking thieving communist bastards sons of bitches.
