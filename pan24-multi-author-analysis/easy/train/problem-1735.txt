ATMS costs 2 mill each. HIMARS are 4 mill. GMLRS are about 4 million. All costs based on finlands purchase of the same equipment that included ammo. Thats only 144 million. Where is the extra 9.85 billion going?
Finalnd's cost also only includes "a Quality Assurance Team (QAT); transportation services; and other related elements of program and logistics support", instead of Poland's "Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rockets; support equipment; communications equipment; spare and repair parts; test sets; batteries; laptop computers; publications and technical data; facility design; personnel training and equipment; systems integration support; Quality Assurance Teams and a Technical Assistance Fielding Team; United States Government and contractor engineering and logistics personnel services; training; sensors; and other related elements of logistics and program support".
to quote you... "It's a sale... the US is making money off this. Nice try though, better luck spreading FUD next time.".
