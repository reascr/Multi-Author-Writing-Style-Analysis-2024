I don’t know. I think that if McConnell is proven right— that the crazies can’t win the Senate— it would be a big knock on his brand. Governorships are also at play. The House is so hopelessly gerrymandered they would really have to screw it up to lose there. Nevertheless I think these pre-emptive voter fraud charges are insurance to protect his brand. But losing and claiming fraud still isn’t winning.
Gerrymandering maybe? Suppression of voting, banning mail in voting, changing the rules, installing nutters who are conspiracy cults, intimidation of ballet boxes, invalidating your ballot because you forget to date it, umm there’s so much more but im tired of thinking about it.
Nope. That's fine. I'm sure we'll do it when we get into power, too. But you can't simultaneously argue that college admissions are kind of bullshit and award people for being rich, being legacies, SAT's are racially bias, etc. Then turn around and say (and this is something I've heard liberals say) "colleges are so left wing because the smart people are all liberals.".
