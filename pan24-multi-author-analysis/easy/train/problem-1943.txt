This breaks my heart. My wife taught for Chicago Public Schools when we lived there and specifically at schools where the kids were in need. I remember spending $1-2k per year of our own money on supplies, but being happy we were in a position to do so. Our first couple of winters there I remember being amazed that CPS never closed schools for any amount of snow/ice/whatever and my wife was kind enough to explain to me that it was because school was the only source of food for the day for something like 30-40% of the students in the school system. At the time CPS had 400,000 kids in K-12, the math on that is horrifying and literally had me in tears, the idea of kids going hungry guts me. We live in NC now and measly amount of money they pay teachers here is pathetic. I have two kids in elementary school and their teachers are weekly asking for snack donations and parents to buy things from their Amazon wishlists. We do as much as we can each time because they shouldn't have to do that, but they do and all we can do is make it as least stressful as possible.
America. A country has been around for like 200 years in its current state. Had the opportunity to take and learn from all the best bits of what other countries do right.
Heartbreaking! As a teacher who retired this year one memory I have of a former student who was being picked up early by the parent was asking to go to the lunchroom before leaving to pick up their lunch to eat at home. They needed it.
