Same thing with road fatalities: Roads were for everyone but after mass protest about all the child deaths at the wheels of the new automobiles tearing through them with no warning, mass campaigns paid for by Ford, etc., accusing people of "jay-walking" (jay being another term for hick or hillbilly) eventually became codified in law. Again, deflecting blame from the companies that make dangerous things and onto the individual for the state of the commons.
Scientific literacy? She's just the loudest voice telling people to look directly at reports and science. Hell, you can read oil companies own reports from over 50 years ago, detailing the effects climate change will have due to their practices. They've literally spent the last half century making this a political issue so there will be "2 sides", whereas in the 80s and 90s it was just discussed as a thing that is happening because of industrialization. One of the main themes in the Dune books was the negative effects from human intervention on climate, the first one was published in 1964.
