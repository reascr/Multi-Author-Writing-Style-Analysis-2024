Bolsonaro is clearly worse. If you're talking abt the Palocci Audio, it isnt evn confirmes that it's Lula, and of we're talking about supportung violence, Bolsonaro has literally always been open abt how he thinks that the military dictatorship should have killed more ppl, how he is pro-torture, how he thinks that it would be better for a child of his to die in an accident than to turn out gay, and so on and so on. Its abundantly clear how Bolsonaro is worst.

It is slow! I was a young boy in apartheid South Africa and my family emigrated, but I remember every stage of ANC government. If you had told me in the 90s when mailmen were throwing sacks of mail into the sewers that ANC would stay in power till at least 2023, I would never have believed you.
