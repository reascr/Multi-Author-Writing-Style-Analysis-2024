I don't feel like summarizing a Google search for you so I'll only list one point. Canadian Supreme court justices are not politically aligned, because that's the whole point of separation of powers. The more important point regards the bases of Canadian law and I'll let you find a Youtuber or something else to figure out yourself. I'm not a legal educator.
Yes you can still be infectious, but your immune system already knowing what to target straight off the bat means that you are infectious for a shorter period of time and don't spread as much of the virus (since there's not lag time in which the virus is reproducing like crazy while your immune system finds its feet). Ergo, less infectious than your unvaccinated counterpart.
No, we're good. Most Canadians (over 70%) were fine with the public health measures and did not support the convoy. I like when the government steps in to stop a populist blockade initially attempting to overthrow our democratically elected government. It was our very weak ass Jan 6th and any other country would have sent legions of cops in on the first day, or...maybe put up barriers. We're so nice we're kind of stupid sometimes.
Overwhelming majority of reddit are uneducated 20 somethings who have absolutely no issue with authoritarianism as long as their political team is the one with the power.
Sorry! I should have said "foreign nations". But the narrative was primarily pushed by US shit disturbers. The amount of airtime the convoy got in the US is probably more than all the airtime Canada got in the las decade XD.
