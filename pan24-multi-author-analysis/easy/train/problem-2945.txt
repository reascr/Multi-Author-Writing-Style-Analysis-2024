I don't know about that. While Warnock is leading in polls, some of the polls show Walker voters are slightly more enthusiastic about voting. See the last page of crosstabs here:
Exactly! I sometimes wonder if voters actually pay zero attention to who and what is on the ballot, but just go, "Eenie, meenie, miny-mo," and vote for the name they like the sound of the best. Maybe they remember the name Herschel Walker from his football days and just vote for him because of that, having no clue what he represents or stands for. I can't think of any other reason that any sane person of average intelligence would vote for that knucklehead.
