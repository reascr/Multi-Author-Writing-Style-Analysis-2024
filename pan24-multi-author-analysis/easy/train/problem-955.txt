With optional voting, unless there's a huge incentive to vote (awful government), you often get those that are very passionate about politics voting (usually the far-right & far-left), and retirees who have a lot more time on their hands.
The fuck? This was evidence FROM the election 6 months ago. Both coalition and labor are both shrinking in primary vote, teals destroyed the remnants of the lib wets, Greens took 2 seats in Brisbane of all places. It's a different ball game now.
To successfully conduct in-person voter fraud, you need two things: (1) a massive volume of people with transportation (since you obviously can't keep turning up the same polling booth saying you're different people), and (2) a big list of voters who you're absolutely sure won't themselves go vote on that day (which is impossible unless you individually set out to also intimidate a whole bunch of people to stay at home).
2. Mandatory voting - The government taxing you is mandatory why should it not be mandatory for you to tell them how the tax should be spent. It seems like two sides of the same coin, everybody is taxed and everybody gets a say in how the money is spent.
As an Australian it seems like two sides of the same coin, everybody is taxed and everybody gets a say in how the money is spent.
