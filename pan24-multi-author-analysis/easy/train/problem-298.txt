In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
No, I haven't. Have you worked in a classroom with elementary children? This has nothing to do with a particular view of the military. It is an issue of qualification, which, being a veteran, does not qualify someone to be a teacher. I could see allowing veterans who have certain types of teaching experience to be able to use that to gain an emergency teachers license, but even then that requires furthering education toward a teachers license. People do not give enough credit to all of the hard work teachers have to put in and the level of education required to be effective.

Yes. My husband has been teaching for almost 20 years. Admin will tell you what you are expected to teach, how to teach, and to make sure everyone passes. Teachers are constantly screamed at for the dumbest shit with a "let's try this new thing this year" a regular occurrence at the school.
