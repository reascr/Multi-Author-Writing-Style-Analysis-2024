Ahh, but the Russians, like everything, go all-out with their fake units. Instead of broadcasting marching sounds and inflatable tanks, Russia, being the best country in world for 2000 years and counting, is using real troops and tanks for the fake army. So effective it will fool everyone!
if i had to guess it likely wouldnt change the ukrainian force allocation much, they probably already have that area heavily entrenched and garrisoned just in case russian command is daft enough to try for round two of a push on kyiv, in what would likely enter history alongside such debacles as the great marianas turkey shoot and the war on emus.
That is fair. That being said, I think this time it will be harder to hide it. It’s going to be way more obvious if your heading to the border of an active war zone for a “training” exercise with a ton of Russians and Russian leadership. Additionally, Lukashenko and his generals would have to be included in the planning which is going to make it harder to keep it a secret internally.
