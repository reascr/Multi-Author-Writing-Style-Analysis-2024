look, just because I said he happens to be Black doesn't mean what the Radical Left thinks it means, all I was saying, you have Ye, Kanye, he's one of my Great African Americans, because I know a lot about what happened, and it's a real shame, but it had nothing to do with me, just so you understand, nothing to do with Trump. the Radical Left was probably there, I bet Nancy Pelosi, she would've had a lot if you know what I'm saying, but now you can't say it, because if you do the Fake News will start a Phony Witch Hunt, and then we'll be back at Square One. we came so far for 4 Years, we had, and when I say this I'm being 100% Honest, but we never had a better time than we did when I was in charge. no Taxes, no Deaths, we came a long way after Obama, but then Sleepy Joe and Crooked Hillary took us back to the Stone Age. we used to be, they said, "America is Number One," and now, we don't even know what Last Place is. ok, enjoy yourselves, have a nice time. you're welcome, by the way.
Now, for the outrage in trump and his nazis, well, he's using nazis to undermine so many vital efforts (at the national security and security of our species level) and to destroy US democracy and NATO so fascist russians can take more and more power, which benefits fascists everywhere.
He’s not under fire. Trump is given a platform by the media and the Republican Party. He’s the most powerful Republican in the country and everyone is still afraid to challenge him. Cowards.
