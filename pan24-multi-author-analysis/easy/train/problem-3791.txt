In China Mao ruled as Mao wanted. He was convinced that his orgies with young girls would keep him virile and alive forever. Unfortunately for Mao things don't work that way, and he died anyway, without there being an obvious successor. This lead to a lot of chaos and rancor as the party fought to figure out who the hell was going to lead them. A similar situation followed with the death of Zhou Enlai, though not as dramatic. Either way, it seemed rather disorderly, and its leaders potentially weak as they need to consolidate power. This was not good for the party, which sought to project constant orderliness and control in order to counter any perception that their power was not absolute.

Exactly! Old conservatives show up to vote with a lot more consistency. I know a lot of young leftists who make all kinds of excuses to not vote. They expect politicians to motivate them first, but politicians are more motivated to go after the people who will actually vote.
