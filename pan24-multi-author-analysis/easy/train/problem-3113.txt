I grew up both homeschooled and with a religious exemption, that was before the study linking autism was found to be falsified. But my mom was never against vaccines she just wanted to wait till I was not an infant, in her mind avoiding all the complications that could arise from them. I ended up getting all my vaccines before going into public school, had absolutely no reaction to any of them since I got them when older. I was homeschooled on a farm, and never really went out in public, we only had one car and my dad used it for work. And both my parents were vaccinated. I was sick considerably less than all the other children in my family. That being said that is not the route I went for my kids, and they are all completely vaccinated and boosted. Does not prevent everything though we all just caught the flu despite being vaccinated.
Exactly. They’ll behave the same way they did with Covid. Once complications arise, they’ll go to the hospital where they’ll accost the doctors because the proper treatment doesn’t fit their beliefs of what the heavily trained medical professionals should be doing. If the kid dies in the hospital, it was all the doctors’ fault because “I knew they were doing everything wrong from the very beginning”. If they choose not to go to the doctors and the kid dies then mama bear did everything she could as the evil doctors would have just made the kid suffer more.
