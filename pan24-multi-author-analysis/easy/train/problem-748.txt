As an Evangelical pastor, I agree with that statement, and strongly oppose the current state of the GOP. However, the slander that Evangelicals are a “doomsday cult” is entirely false. No genuine Christian is trying to engineer or hasten the end of the world. We are commanded to love our enemies and preach the gospel to every nation until the end comes (Second Coming of Christ to judge the world). Lately this slander has gained traction among outsiders who focus on fringe sects (like White Christian Nationalists) who hardly represent mainstream Evangelicalism. For a sense of what we believe, check out the National Association of Evangelicals website (www.nae.org).
Islamaphobia. She had a right to voice criticisms about human rights violations by Israel. The Palestinians weren't invited to participate in the so-called peace agreement. They should have had just as much input as Israel since they reside there.
