That’s why this is all a charade. Homeland security has already done very thorough checks on this fool. Especially after the appointment to congressional committees. Why are the Democrats not asking this question. They know. Every member of our house and senate has to have some degree of security clearance. People this is NOT a fucking Wendy’s!
Considering the licensing process of approval and background check I had to get to sell insurance is disturbing compared to the vetting they do for politicians this is just disgusting if you’re a politician we want to see ALL your finances and tax returns PUBLICLY why should it be any other way they LIVE off tax payer dollars and get paid farrrrr too much already… shit it’s harder for me to continue my adderall perscription than it is to get elected into office OR get a gun in this country.
What do you expect? We have a rapist and a cult member for a Supreme Court justices, at least 19 members of Congress that were actively involved in an insurrection and a Speaker of the House that is beholden to Russia. They likely view fraud as a cute attempt to fit in.
