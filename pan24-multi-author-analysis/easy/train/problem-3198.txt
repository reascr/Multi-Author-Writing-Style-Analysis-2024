Kamala Harris hasn't been useless. She has in most cases been trapped in Washinon in order to be the tie-breaking vote to pass the Democrat agenda and stop Republican tomfuckery. She hasn't been able to do much else because doing what she had been has been so essential.
Everyone understands that. Manchin and Sinema are a constant top of discussion. Even with Manchin and Sinema, Congress passed a massive stimulus package, and it allowed the passage of bipartisan legislation on chip manufacturing and climate change/infrastructure spending. If GOP control the Senate then legislation doesn't even get to a vote.
Theoretically, you’re correct. But I don’t see them simply abstaining without significant political maneuvering. They don’t agree on disagreeing about the same things, but the biggest thing is the filibuster, which is the biggest thing holding up major legislation.
