I wish, more trains, more public transit rails, less cars, more nuclear power plants. Build walkable towns and cities. I don’t think American people are ready for this tho.
These solutions aren’t unpopular. People want housing. The big issue is that America also has wide open spaces, and cars are a necessity for a lot of people because we’re so spread out. Hence the focus on expanding EVs both on the consumer side and via charging infrastructure. My hope is that the infrastructure upgrades will also incentivize a look at green public transit, including trains. There’s a huge outcry for better public transit and national rail from the younger gens. It’s coming.
The big bottleneck is still not enough funding for next level energy storage and after that getting the costs down on CO2 sequestration, but there is no choice because emissions reduction and just leaving in the pollution up there to keep warning AND acidity the oceans to max isn't a real solution given how far behind emission goal we are and how unrealistic converting the world to utopian level minimalism really is.
What a joke. I mean propaganda. There is so much excess and waste in the United States, and that's only what you can see in consumer habits.
