Sigh. Freaking New York, my state gave the GOP the majority. Literally half of their net gain and any 219-222 seat margin they have their majority will come entirely because they flipped those NY seats even while they did badly in most swing states.
Even still the GOP only netted 3 seats out of Florida (flipped two seats, won one of the 2 new seats) , which is a big part of why they probably have the majority but in New York.. they flipped 4 and only BARELY missed on a 5th. They have every single non NYC Long Island CD now and most of the Hudson Valley suburbs ones now too.

Crime basically. Despite that not working anywhere else it DID work in the NYC subrubs. Probably helped by the fact NYC local news reports on literally seemingly every crime that happens and a mayor who can't stop talking about crime. Despite the fact that yes while NYC has had a crime increase mostly due to the pandemic and it's consequences it's got a much lower crime rate than other cities where the GOP tried the same shit in the suburbs of like Philly, Chicago, Balitmore... and got creamed this year. The fact we did Bail Reform just a few years ago provided a simple convenient target for the GOP to go "THE DEMS DID IT, THEIR THE REASON CRIME IS UP" by pointing to it despite there being no studies that credibly link bail reform to the current crime increase (again that's nearly all due to the Pandemic).
