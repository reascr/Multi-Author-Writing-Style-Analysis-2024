Just yesterday i had to listen to some Italian woman rant to me (I am traveling there now) about how Russia is just the victim of propaganda by americans and "northern europeans" (me) and all the pictures videos and evidence of war crimes in ukraine is fake and they are just trying to remove the nazis in ukraine and oh yeah about how bad vaccines are.
Yeah. I get that. It just doesn't stand up to the slightest application of critical thinking. Anyone then who would believe it is also already in the True Believer camp of Russian propaganda. It's all just pointless. I imagine it's more about someone doing some demonstration of how loyal they are to Putin bootlicking. "Look at the level of bs I'm willing to put out for you, Putin (Don't harm my position)." Theater of the ridiculous.
The thing is before this people always gave him an extreme benefit of the doubt because they wanted to normalize relations with Russia and keep them that way, and because once you buy into the idea that Putin is actually a competent statesman who's good at sports and super buff like he claims he is, all of his blunders tend to be excused away.
