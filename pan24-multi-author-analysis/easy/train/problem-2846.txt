The U.S. and allied governments need to start treating the GOP the same way they do ISIS and Al Qaeda. Until that happens and there is some accountability doled out, innocent American citizens and government employees will continue having to live in fear of these GOP terrorists. Those who took an oath to protect the country and uphold our Constitution need to start doing so and root out these scum.

Sen. Scott Wiener is great. I live a few blocks from him and he actually cares about who he represents. I always see him at local events, coffee shops, book stores etc talking to people and intently listening. Dressed casual all the time and super approachable. MTG is insane and anyone, adult or kid, would be lucky to have Scottâ€™s presence in their life.
