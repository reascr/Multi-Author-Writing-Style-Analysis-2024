May have to find out how I can return it. Be cool to see it return home, even if it's the size of an iPhone.
Honestly speaking I think that some kind of artefacts protecting/keeping global institutions would be a great thing, especially when I remember how much historical artifacts and other work of art were destroyed in my Country during WWII (Poland, for example entire libraries full of medieval and later manuscripts were burned by Wehrmacht) But it would be probably very difficult for some those artefacts to not disappear during the entire thing and with the return later after the end of the war or some other instability.
Yawn. Show me one example of an Egyptian actually calling for museums to be looted because it offends their religious sensibilities. You're just regurgitating the tired stereotype of all Muslims being religious extremists by default because of AQ and ISIL, and assume the average Muslim gets easily offended by everything, even though most ancient Egyptian artifacts remained intact over a millennia of being ruled by Muslim leaders.
Lol. Show me your credentials and let’s all judge to see if you have the slightest clue about anything on this planet. Or don’t, you’re the one who responded to contest.
