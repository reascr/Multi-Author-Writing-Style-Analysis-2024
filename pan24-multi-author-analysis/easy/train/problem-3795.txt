He's talking about how America's reluctance to be the world police anymore (since Trump) combined with China and India's economic rise means that power to make world-shaping decisions has shifted from America/Europe-centrism (e.g. bodies like G7) to more multi-polarism (e.g. bodies like G20).
The American-led, Western world order is only one which human rights were placed as an idea of progression from a barbaric past in which the chief propagators of historical atrocities supposedly learned from their mistakes. The Chinese definition of human rights is nothing more claiming that the chief duty of countries is providing essential and survival services to their people, which frankly is what all normal countries have to do anyway in order remain secure in a world of interstate competition. And it's rather disheartening to see that India, which suffered at the butt end of European imperialism, to begin promoting the same outcome which led to its own slavery.
How brave! Any random citizen / journalist can 'resist pressure from the US and numerous EU governments' because western governments don't hurt random citizens or journalists.
Yes. Just replaced the imperialism of Europe with the capitalists of the US. You go against the US and the entire west turns against you. How is that acceptable? So one imperial power ends and another takes up it's mantle, is that how it works?
