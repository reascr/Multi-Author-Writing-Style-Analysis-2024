However as you already mentioned this energy was released over minutes and the largest part probably went into heating the water by a miniscule amount (it takes 4190 Joules to heat 1kg of water by one Kelvin, so heating up 1 kiloton of water would take 4.19 gigajoule aka 10^9 J, so the release of potential energy could have theoretically heated the whole kiloton of water by 0.1K).
It's on film. They even know who did it. It was Ethan Hunt. You could hear him say, "Mr. Kitrich, you've never seen me very upset." Then it looks like he throws a stick of gum at the tank near before it explodes.
