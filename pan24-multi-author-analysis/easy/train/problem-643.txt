look, I had a very important and very very scheduled Presidential Physical, and they usually do it in 3 parts, but I was so good I only had to do 2, and I was told by Dr. Ronnie, he used to be your Doctor, now he's your Congressman from the Wonderful State of Texas, I love Texas, Texas loves Trump, and it was perfect, I tested perfectly positive, which is negative in another sense, but totally positive, and I really have not only the best health but the best look out of all the Presidents, if we're being honest about it, and you never got that with Obama, he wouldn't even take the Presidential Test because he knew he'd Fail Miserably. now you have Sleepy Joe letting China walk all over us, you have gangs and vicious mobs of Radical Left Thugs who have destroyed our beautiful Cities and hurt your Constitution because they wanna take away your houses and your 401Ks, but the Fake News would never tell you that.
Sure you can. If it meant losing your fragile grip on power, you’d “take it like a man”, just like he did. But still, it boggles my mind what would lead a man to that mindset.
