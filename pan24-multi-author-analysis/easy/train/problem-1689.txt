But here’s the deal, China doesn’t care about Taiwan itself or its people enough to risk such a difficult operation. It’s more about the semiconductor factories, so “destroy it and leave it in ashes” is the opposite of what China wants. Oh and did I mention that these factories require people with very niche knowledge? Like “only the Taiwanese person who has been working on this factory for the past 20 years knows how to do it” niche knowledge. So not only do they need to capture the island which is hard as is, they should do it in a way that won’t damage the factories and won’t endanger civilians.
Well, obviously. China’s military has no wartime experience with amphibious landings or paratrooper operations. It’s been decades since China went to war with ANYONE at all, so none of their soldiers has any combat experience. The idea that China would be capable of such a thing is laughable.
Precisely. Just as was done in Iraq, disable the kill chain to these area denial weapons that literally everyone knows about. I really doubt our high-command doesn’t have a plan to deal with this issue.
Probably power requirements. It probably takes multiple radar arrays that need to be used with each other and that would require multiple times more power.
