If this were true, the correct action would have been to inform the countries where you expect the balloon to reach ahead of time. Hey, we lost control of our gigantic weather balloon, here is what it looks like and is designed to do, it might be headed your way, let us know if you spot it. Not post facto.
The Biden administration says China was using the 200-foot-tall balloon for surveillance, with a senior State Department official saying Thursday that it carried “multiple antennas” capable of collecting signals intelligence.
How were they ever not going to get caught? This wasn't a subtle thing that no one was going to see. I do wonder what the long game was. And why the authorities were so scared of downing it over land. There must be some reason they were worried about it landing on US soil. Something they can't share with the public.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry repeated Beijing’s insistence that the high-altitude balloon was a civilian airship, and criticized a unanimous resolution by House lawmakers on Thursday condemning China’s use of the balloon.
