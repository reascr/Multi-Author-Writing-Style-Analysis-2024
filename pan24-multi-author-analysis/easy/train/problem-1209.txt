I always wonder how people would feel about the larger cities in the US just electing to become city states. Like, okay, the rest of the entire state doesn't think like us, doesn't want us to represent them, and prevents us from getting anything done. Fuck it, we're pulling a west virginia, please give us our own two senators, 2-3 of the state's house reps, and our complimentary 3 electoral votes." Flip the script on them since most major cities already meet the required specifications for statehood.
Seriously. We’ve directly elected senators since 1912. Federal income tax since 1913. New deal alphabet agencies since the 1930s. For better or worse, the Federal government has been playing a direct role in citizens’ lives for over a century. They’ve already “put you in thumbscrews”, and you already have representation at the federal level. The question at this point is really one of electoral systems, and the EC is not a good one. It shifts a disproportionate amount of power into a small slice of the electorate, and can even allow for the candidate with less popular support to lose the election.
