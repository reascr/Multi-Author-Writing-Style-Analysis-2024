Define "working" lol. The Russians have been dying in droves at Bakhmut (the footage coming out of there daily is gruesome) and while yes Ukraine also suffers heavy losses Russia hasn't gained any notable ground since the summer, so almost 6 months ago was the last time Russia was able to make any sort of notable push. And it's not like they don't want to, they've officially annexxed a lot of land they currently don't even hold including large chunks of the Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.
Embarrassingly small numbers protested. Despite claims how brutal the suppression of protests are, we never saw anything resembling violence exerted on Ukrainians during Maidan. And correspondingly we never saw outrage over such violence from Russian population. Saying they lack ambition hides the truth - they actually agree that those protesters should be detained. They consider protesters to be trouble starters at best and traitors at worst. They will try to escape mobilization be fleeing the country but will never believe that Russia is at fault.
Which isn't particularly relevant. Wars rarely come down to a country literally running out of sufficient replacement manpower, insanely rare in fact as even in WW1 there were still youth to continue to call on (WW2 Germany ran out and a few others, but it's rare). There are two ways to actually win by attrition.
