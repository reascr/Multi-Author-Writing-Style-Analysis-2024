Nah homie. They ain't leaving. Been the same people since the civil war here decades ago. Literally same people. In a few cases, sons or sons-in-law.
The existence of exchanges and other centralized entities like tether are the reason your shit coins are worth anything at all, because they facilitate speculation, the only true 'utility' provided by cryptocurrencies.
Hello friend. Thank you for the very kind thoughts. I've had a rough weekend so I appreciate the warm thoughts. Hope you have a great day and yeah I hope at some point we can get some proper help. But as you would surely agree with, we Lebanese need to also take responsibility. It's on us, too.
"Bitcoin makes banks obsolete", but there's still a massive market for people to hand over their bitcoin and other crypto to an exchange for security; yeah sure it's less obvious when you've got 10 bitcoin on a thumb drive in your safe than $200k in cash, but the risk of losing it is actually higher, since it's just data. Keeping money dry and sheltered is enough to make it last a century at least, but a thumb drive? read it too often and it'll fail, and there's always the chance it just fails anyway. People put money in a bank or crypto on an exchange to make it easier to access and trade, as well as to make it more secure in storage, since you're having "professionals" do it.
Cash is still more reliable, both in terms of not needing security codes to access it, and not needing a working internet for transactions. Bitcoin on the blockchain is slow. Bitcoin off chain is fast, but insecure. if it does get stolen or even just lost in an error, you have no recourse like you do with visa or mastercard.
