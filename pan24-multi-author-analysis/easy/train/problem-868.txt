The difference between Mississippi and Georgia is Atlanta, a large city and economic hub that draws liberals from other states. In fact, Atlanta might be a reason why Democrats lose in Mississippi because liberal voters might emigrate to Atlanta. The population of metropolitan Atlanta area is enough to compensate for Republican advantage in the rest of the state.
The population of metropolitan Atlanta area is enough to compensate for Republican advantage in the rest of the state.
The population of Atlanta is not yet enough to compensate the Republican advantage in the rest of the state as evidenced by the success of 8 out of 9 statewide Republicans in the midterms...but it is sufficient to give a good dem candidate a fighting chance against a bad Rep candidate like Walker.
What? Abortions only take place in the final trimester (third) when the mother wanted the baby BUT her life is seriously at risk. All other abortions take place well before the fetus has consciousness, sensation or awareness. The only fourth term abortions conservatives should be thinking about are the ones god committed on all those Egyptian kids in the Bible.
