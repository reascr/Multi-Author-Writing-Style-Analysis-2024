Perhaps the last thing that remains non-political, when it comes to Congress is the near-universal agreement that handling casework for your constituents is important. The reason is because elected officials are single minded to seekers of reelection, and when your office gets a reputation for being completely useless and constituents are having issues related to critical government services, that opens you up for challengers. A few years ago, in my state of Maryland, one of the deciding factors in a primary election was when to sitting members of Congress ran against each other in a primary; a bunch of these other state and local officials came out against one of the members because they had to pick up the slack and address their residentsâ€™ concerns because that member of congress didnâ€™t have a functional office. Mitch McConnell and Elizabeth Warren might be polar opposites, but both have offices with robust constituent services and know how to advocate for their residents dealing with executive agencies.
Man, wow. If youâ€™re referring to Hitlerâ€™s Eagleâ€™s Nest, you just reminded me that I (Pennsylvania girl) went there on a family trip to visit relatives in a nearby country, when I was 11. ðŸ˜‚ I hadnâ€™t thought about that for a whiiiiiile.
