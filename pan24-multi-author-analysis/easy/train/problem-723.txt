I'm not saying the whole party is this way. But there's a very odd mix of people in the Republican party. In one group, you have Putin sympathizers. In another you have religious extremists. In yet another you have fascists. In another you have racists. In another you have carrier lobbyists. And there are some left over that are actually reasonably normal people. But it's all pretty much a shit show, and I don't really get the long play. There's no long term win. They're a bunch of micro demographics and represent the extreme end of those demographics meaning they also alienate some of their market segments too. The whole party rests on an ever shrinking voter base, and they do not seem to care. They don't try to fix the party. They don't try to correct the problems. They seem entirely hell bent on imploding themselves for very, very short term personal gains. It almost feels like "I'm here to make my money and get out." It has that feel. The other feel is "I'm fucking god, and my will rules the land." There's not really much in between. There's just greed and insanity. They don't even have an agenda. They don't have any sort of action plan. They're playing the religious extremism card right now, but I have no clue why. I can only assume it's the same move as the whole Hunter Biden thing which was quite specifically a distraction move. I assume this is just the same, spam the news with bat shit stuff, and keep eyes off the corruption. Distract, distract, distract. But to what good? Again, the plan still just alienates even more voters, this time a large swath of women voters. The next election cycle is going to be absolutely BRUTAL on them for it. So where's the value? I don't see it.
The story noted other oddities about the self-described gay Trump supporter with Jewish heritage, who would go on to flip New Yorkâ€™s 3rd Congressional District from blue to red, and is now under investigation by authorities for misrepresenting his background to voters.
