ancien r√©gime isn't the beginning, the frankish people adopting roman administration and ruling western europe is a good genesis for the modern french polity.
Exactly. Modern monetary policy is printing free money for the "risk-takers" who never actually lose when their risks blow up, and austerity and suffering for the poor. Socialize all losses in every way, starve the beast, push suffering to only the marginalized, not the "good" people like managers or business owners. Steal as much bullion through grift and kickbacks, park it offshore, provide literally no benefit to the world you are leeching from. But the poor who actually do the work deserve nothing, because if they were good people they would figure out that being poor is bad and they'd stop.
Moronic. The French (and everyone else, relatively) spend a trillion per year on entitlements. You can have yourself a revolution and be back at square one in under a year.
Sorry, literally Socialism. The Neoliberal Hegemony can't allow that to happen, not out of malice but out of self-preservation.
