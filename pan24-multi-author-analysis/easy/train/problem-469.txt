As it is, you have some people voting their favorite, and a lot of people doing math (all slightly differently) to try to figure out who they think is most likely to prevent a bad outcome (like Trump). They’re all trying to guess how everyone else will vote - it becomes like poker, trying to guess what’s in everybody else’s hand. Ranked choice would remove that pressure, because it will figure out who is most electable for you - so you can vote for who you really want, first, then vote for the ones you’d be willing to have in place of the bad alternative (e.g. Trump) - you can say, “I’d really prefer Bernie, but I’d rather take Warren or Biden over Trump” - and maybe it turns out everybody else is thinking the same way - you don’t have to worry as much about guessing the same as everyone else to prevent disaster.
Lmao temporary relocation? If I lived in that area I’d be gone forever, no vinyl chloride in my water thank you. They better give every single resident enough money to fucking buy a home somewhere else.
