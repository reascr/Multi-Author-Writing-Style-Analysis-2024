I don’t know my planes very well but I was under the impression that the F-22 is basically the most advanced and capable fighter in the world by a long margin but is expensive and complicated as fuck.
I thought the F-35 was basically a less capable but still very good plane that was cheaper and more versatile to have in service and also something the US would export to allies unlike the F-22.
Was there a particular reason the F-22 wasn’t simply updated with the F-35’s avionics or is the F-35 and it’s associated avionics package just too different for that to be a consideration ?
It's not that simple. Fighter electronics usually have to be custom made for that specific platform. Noses are different, computers are different, cockpit is different, airframe is different. Adding IRST to the F-22 for example, would require massive redesigns of the airframe in order to hold it.
F-35 has a dramatically superior frontal RCS, and has less trouble maintaining its RAM coatings across the entire airframe.
F-35 has DSIs instead of a traditional diverter plate at the intakes, which is a massive advantage for minimizing RCS. It also has 20+ year newer RAM, so it's not literally falling off an F-35 after just a couple hours in the air like it is off an F-22. F-35 also has an IRST system, so it can identify, track, and engage an enemy without ever emitting any EMRAD from the radar that can be detected, unlike the F-22.
F-35 beat the F-22's Red Flag record, it's stealthier than the F-22, it has more advanced radar, and it actually has an IRST system.
Per the USAF, the F-35 is stealthier, has a better radar, and has an IRST system the F-22 never got because of budget issues. F-22 is the better air superiority airframe, but rhe F-35 has the better avionics. It'd honestly likely just come down to the respective pilot, but my money would actually be on the F-35. Electronics win air battles, and a better radar + IRST is one hell of a damn mountain to overcome.
