I did a project on this for my university and Brazilian cattle ranches are also just plain inefficient. I believe it takes four more times the land to raise a cow/bull in Brazil than it does in the most inefficient areas of the US. That's why so much land is needed for these ranches. It's a compounding issue but still part of the equation. Finding a way to increase the efficiency and productivity of ranches in Brazil may also help significantly by reducing the land needed to produce X amount of beef.
2. It makes no sense to punish the country's entire population for the actions of a comparatively few huge ranchers. The country is (unethically) answering to the global demand for meat. However, there's two parts to the equation.
we can live vegan, depriving animal exploiting and environment destroying industries of the support to continue doing their unethical business. business that also hurts humans in many ways, including paid and unpaid workers, neighborhoods, pollution, increased risk of pandemics and rampant disease. also hurts animals via all the environmental degradation.
1. The "West" has no interest in doing something it benefits from. The US is right there in the list of top buyers. . You can see Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, and Germany in there as well. Obviously European countries are far from comparable to China, but are still in there.
