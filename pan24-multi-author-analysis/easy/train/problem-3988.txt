How does speaker voting work, can like every dem secretly convince a dozen moderate gop folks to vote for one of themselves and the Dems agree to vote for them too? Seems like the various groups within the gop should be courting that Dem vote.
Hmm.. it sounds like if the R vote is split in any appreciable way the democrats could have their choice of which one they want to win by voting as a block for them. Or just letting it be chaos.
And that was before Jordan, with incoming House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chair James Comer, repeatedly insisted the FBI had colluded with “Big Tech” to undermine former president Donald Trump by “suppressing” information about Hunter Biden’s laptop prior to the 2020 election.
Surely not. Kevin McCarthy will prove to be an expert at herding his majority of ADHD kittens, with at least 2 to spare towards winning votes, to great things for his party.
