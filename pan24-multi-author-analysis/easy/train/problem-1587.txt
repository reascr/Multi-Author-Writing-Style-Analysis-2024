If you bothered to go to the absolute minimum of effort to have any idea or knowledge in the slightest about what you are talking about you would know that the striking nurses are leaving what the government believes are safe staffing numbers in place - a "Christmas day service". No wards are being left devoid of staff. However the point being made is that this Christmas day level of service that is apparently so unacceptable on a strike day is actually very commonplace and nurses are filling the gaps of the 40,000 unfilled nurse posts with bank shifts, unpaid overtime, working through their unpaid breaks etc., and the government thinks this is fine to continue, provided we call it service as normal and not a strike. No-one is leaving anyone to die except for the government who are deliberately running the NHS into the ground to ensure its imminent privatisation.
Lol. They're too important to strike, but not too important to pay 100K to? It's a free market, you pay people to motivate them to do a job. If the job is shitty and the pay sucks, fewer people will want to do it. If you raise salaries, more people will do it because the salary is worth the bullshit associated with the job. If few people want to be a nurse, you raise the salary until you have enough nurses. It's that simple.
