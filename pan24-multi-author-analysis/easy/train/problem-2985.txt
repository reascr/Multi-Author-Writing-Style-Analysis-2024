Biden can name drop us in the SOTU but words dont fucking matter, ACTION DOES. Call these people out BY FUCKING NAME. I am sick of watching the GOP wield minority power far more effectively than Dems wield majority power. The fucking corpo sellout centrists throughout the party demand silence on trans people and that silence IS WHAT LEAD TO THIS SHIT.
Hey if the Dems could stop being a bunch of fucking spineless corpo hacks maybe they would stand up for LGBT people, emphasis on trans people, that would be great. Every day the GOP points to their giant media operation including Chaya Raichik, Matt Walsh, Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro and every fucking day the dems leave us defenseless.
Exactly. Oregon just passed a Measure to increase background checks on gun purchases and limit the size of magazines to 10 bullets. You would think the world is coming to an end by the insane overreaction of gun nuts in this State and the mad rush to buy as many guns as possible (no, Iâ€™m not exaggerating) before the law takes effect and the lawsuits being filed against it.
