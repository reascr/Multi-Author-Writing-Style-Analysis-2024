On the flip side money in politics does not have a positive influence in the same way you think it does. Candidates who raise a lot of money from one or two sources like Michael Bloomberg and Mehmet Oz do poorly in elections whereas candidates who raise money from smaller donations do. Itâ€™s generally advisable to have a war chest funded by both large groups and individual donors like Joe Biden did. The trend definitely is that candidates who spend more win more but there are other factors at play here: incumbents win more often than not as well, partisan districting plays a role too. Often candidates will spend millions in districts where there opponent will spend nothing because the district is unfavorable. And finally the DNC has outraised the RNC for a number of years now so the progressive wing of the party can bankroll a progressive candidate as well.
