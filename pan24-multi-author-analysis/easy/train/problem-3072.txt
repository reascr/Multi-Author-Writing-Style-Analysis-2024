In order for it to be antisemitism I have to accuse a group of Jewish people of doing something negative. They didn’t proclaim Jerusalem the capital of Israel, Trump did. An act which if I was an Israeli I would applaud. So is making the observation that Israelis (of all ethnicities) applaud Trump for HIS action antisemitism? Is so, is Trumps action of proclaiming Jerusalem the capital of Israel sympathetic to Nazis? Lastly, who cares about any of this gossip?
People who vote for Trump do you not see who this fool associates with haters , crazy people who lie snd hate every race but their own Trump is a fool - remember the movie The Christmas Carol, the 2nd ghost was Christmas present towards the end Scrooge ask him what is that under your robe - the ghost opened his robe to reveal two kids one was want and the other ignorance - stay away from the girl who was want beware the boy who is ignorance - that’s Trump ignorance who will do ANYTHING to get what he wants THINK HARD AND LONG BEFORE YOU VOTE FOR THIS DICTATOR!
