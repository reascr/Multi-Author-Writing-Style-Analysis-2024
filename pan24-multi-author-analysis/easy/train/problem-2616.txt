If rogue powers are allowed to shit on the world economy and cause massive humanitarian catastrophies without actual meaningful threat of retaliation, what is the purpose of the most potent military alliance in history? Without firing a single shot directly at Nato, Russia has managed to upend food and energy security in dozens of nations as well as causing a recession that not only affects non-aligned nations, but Nato nations as well. This is hybrid warfare. Just because missiles aren't flying into Poland or Estonia or Britain, doesn't mean that billions upon billions dollars worth of damage isn't being done in more subtle ways. Combine that with the global damage being done via distracting nations from dealing with climate changing industries, and you may find that Russia has managed to shit into every single person's mouth alive today and still unborn.
Intimidation during negotiation. They hope they can change the outcome in their favor that way or scaring nations to make others choices.
Utterly cowardice. What a tiny dicked individual to do this. This isn't KGB training. This is pure desperation and a weak man's strategy.
