Of course it’s “radical” talk. So was the declaration of independence. when the status quo is stubbornly delusional, those with enough insight to say wise and necessary things are indeed being radical. The only reason that word carries a suggestion of “dumb” or “bad” is that is how people that are benefiting from the stubborn delusion want others to hear the radically wise and necessary things that are being said. Imagine a foreign enemy who bioengineered some sort of disease, that would only kill our own agricultural crops. We would wage unrestricted war on that enemy yes? Well, we have seen the enemy, and the enemy is us. Start reading about “food security” “dusrbowlification” and “insect decline”. It’s true main stream Democrats benefit from the status quo, so they are still unprepared to deal with the multi generational existential crisis that is already upon us.
