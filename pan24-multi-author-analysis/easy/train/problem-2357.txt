My reply was to answer the idea of not understanding how people could starve on $20/hour in a variable-hours job. I live in a LCOL urban area. They aren’t paying drivers $20/hour here. If we recrunch the numbers with $12/hour, and lower the rent to the low end of possible, our hypothetical driver just starting out can’t afford a car, food, and a room/utilities at $600/month, especially just out of prison with nothing in any accounts (so, no money for deposits). If we bump to a HCOL area where the drivers ARE making $20, it’s even more difficult to have a car, food, and a roof. Average rents in New York, LA, or Chicago are way beyond that price point, even with roommates.
really? You think boomers are responsible? That is a warped viewpoint filled with confirmation bias. The supply and demand of the marketplace are responsible. Nothing else. It sucks for everyone to have to pay more. The only thing remotely true about your comment is that more boomers than others can afford the market price.
