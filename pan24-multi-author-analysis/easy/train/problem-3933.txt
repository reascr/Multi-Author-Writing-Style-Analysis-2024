Disappointed? We all got to see Trump horribly humiliated in 2020 in one of the most embarrassing defeats in history. For fuck's sake he lost to Joe Biden. Now he's fucking whining like a loser every day like a little pussy on Truth Social but nobody gives a shit. Will he go to jail for obstructing the feds from recovering classified US secrets he intentionally stole and refused to return? Maybe, maybe not. But the fact that he's going to spend the final years of his life as a giant fucking loser and a sad joke is good enough for me. ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜‚.

No comparison. Biden is doing the right thing. Trump is doing the wrong thing. Biden and the WH is instructing the searches at his residences. Trump is trying to dodge searches at his residences. The Biden snafu will end up being nothing. The Trump snafu will end up he being indicted. Biden will not say he did anything wrong (because he did nothing wrong); and he will not step down/to the side. He will run again in 2024, and he will win again. Trump will also not say he did anything wrong, but he will continue to incriminate himself with his dipshit posts on TruthSocial. He is supposedly running in 2024, but you wouldn't know it, as it is the most lackluster re-election campaign in recent time. Apples, oranges.
