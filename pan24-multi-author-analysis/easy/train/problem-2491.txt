There were still 9 seats, one was temporarily empty but it didn't legally stop existing. Court packing is when you change the number of seats, not the number of justices.
Expanding the court is packing the court. It was extremely controversial the last time it was tried, to the point where it made FDR a lame duck domestically for the rest of his presidency. It hasn't been tried and actually done in over a century and would be an extreme violation of institutional norms. Democrats need to be trying to lower the temperature, not doing extreme brinkmanship like that.
Exactly. The list of broken norms is ridiculously long. Taking the highroad when you’re dealing with people who don’t care about violating the rules let alone the norms is next to complacency. You’re literally helping them by being so lame and useless. If a bully decides to break the rules you can be sure the recipient needs to be prepared to do the same just in a smarter way.
