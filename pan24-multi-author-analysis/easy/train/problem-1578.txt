Edit: I just remembered one of the examples. It was the 80s or 90s, Sudan needed help, they were in a crisis of some kind. The IMF or World Bank provided a loan, but they ended up forcing the Sudan to grow cash crops (like cotton) over food crops, to pay back the loan faster. This caused a serious famine, as one could obviously predict would happen. That is how they operate.
> The term petrodollar warfare refers to a theory that depicts the international use of the United States dollar as the standard means of settling oil transactions as a kind of economic imperialism enforced by violent military interventions against countries like Iraq, Iran, and Venezuela, and a key hidden driver of world politics. The term was coined by William R. Clark, who has written a book with the same title. The phrase oil currency war is sometimes used with the same meaning. In reality, the use of dollars in international oil transactions increases overall U.S. dollar demand by only a tiny fraction, and the dollar's overall status as the major international reserve currency has relatively few tangible benefits for the United States economy as well as some drawbacks.
1. Sanctions from Gulf War I had kept their light sweet crude (aka easily refined oil) out of the global market and the US wanted some way to make it legal again to keep prices low. Oil for food wasn't cutting it and there was no hope of reconciling with Saddam, particularly post 9/11.
