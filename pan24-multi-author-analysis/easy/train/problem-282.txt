I’m sure I will get downvoted for this BUT the issue isn’t the SC, it’s congress. Take the Roe v Wade repeal, the SC said there is nothing in the constitution that specifically guarantees the right to an abortion, therefore according to the constitution laws regarding abortion should be left up to the states. If congress wanted to guarantee rights to abortion, they could have passed a law that said that, but they never did and according to the constitution, anything that’s not a specific federal law, is left up to each state to decide.
No you’re not understanding…congress DOESNT have to pass laws protecting those things because they ARE in the constitution, there is absolutely no law protecting the right to an abortion, it doesn’t matter who says it’s settled because it’s not in the constitution. The constitution specifically says anything that is not federal law should be left up to the STATES, which is what their ruling DID.
They're administrators. And we should think of them just as that. They're administrators for our taxes and for implementing the policies that we want. That our interest are backed by the military, the law and the courts.
