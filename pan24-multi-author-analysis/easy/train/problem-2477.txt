Almost everyone in Congress is on the take. Why should I care about the exact dollar amount and source? You either are corrupt and accept bribes or you don't. There is no gray area here.
While there probably is in fact some deeper blackmail or leverage that the general public is unaware of, I think the most obvious driving factor is that we’ve already invested way too much in them as a regional “ally” and have spent so much time posturing against hostile nations in the same space that we have no feasible exit plan from such an alliance (or at least, no exit plan that’s more profitable to the decision makers than the status quo).
OK that's very bad. Throw him in jail. But he's not an elected official, and selling military secrets probably doesn't affect the average American like inflation, expensive drugs needed to stay alive, lack of health care accessibility, poor wages, garbage schools, lack of worker rights, and I could make an even longer list, but that is just some of the reasons why corporate bribery of our elected officials is as bad as anything because it has real detrimental impact on 332 million people.
