Here is another interesting resource: where you can see that, much like the wealth/property statistics today, the top 10% of families owned 84% of the slaves.
And according to , after adjusting for the slave population itself, 4.75% of the free population owned slaves. The article goes on to indict the family members of the people who actually owned slaves counting that 1/3 of southerners, pre-civil war, owned slaves. Maybe that's fair, but women and children couldn't own property nor could they vote, so to me, politically, it makes more sense to cut the pop number in half, bringing the percentage to 9.5% of the pre-civil war south owning slaves, which at least would include the male children, ie future property, ie slave, owners. And if you add the northern population of free and enslaved people, the number probably actually gets diluted on a per capita basis (edit: assuming there were any at that time, idk the exact numbers there).
