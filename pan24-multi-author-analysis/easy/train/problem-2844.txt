Most studies on this topic in my field are.... they're extremely poorly run, biased moreso than I have ever seen, and terrible at removing all but the rested variables. It's sad to see.
Still, I wouldn’t be surprised if a bigger study gave similar results, mainly because (from my understanding) marijuana is almost exclusively smoked through inhalation, whereas many “tobacco-only users” may smoke only pipes or cigars, which you don’t inhale and thus tend to result in fewer health problems.
I get your point. But there's no safe amount of things you can light on fire and inhale. Whether that's weed, tobacco, firewood, trash, etc etc etc. It's not safe to light things in fire and inhale the smoke.
I will say it point blank, lighting things on fire and inhaling the smoke and carbonized ash of ANYTHING is bad for you. Some things might be worse to burn and smoke than others but there's the healthy amount of things you should smoke is 0.
