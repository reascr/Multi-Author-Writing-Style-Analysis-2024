In Brazil, the president appoints the supreme court for life until a retirement age of 75, and there are 11 judges. The nominees are approved by the Senate of Brazil with 3 senators per state of which there are 26, plus 3 from the federal district of Brasila, serving 8 year terms, and voters vote for either two or one depending on whether 2/3 of the senate or 1/3 of the senate is being chosen (all states and the federal districts choose one or two senators every 4 years), and the two or one candidates with the most votes win. The president is elected by direct ballot, if nobody has a majority which normally happens, a runoff occurs 4 weeks later from the top two. The chamber of deputies is elected proportionally, every state has between 8 and 70 deputies, and if a party wins say 30% of the vote in a state, they get 30% of the deputies from that state, and voters also vote for individual candidates from that party, and the most voted candidates from the state are elected, and they serve 4 year terms.
Good. I hope the fascists face incredibly more severe consequences than the laughable sentences the magatwats recieved. This is what happens when fascism isn't dealt with a strong hand.
