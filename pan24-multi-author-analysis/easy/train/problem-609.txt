Some things take a lot of effort to make and are therefore going to cost a premium just for the creator to break even. These sites are a blight to them and future quality content creation. This does not include large textbook companies which are thieves and I fully endorse their stuff to be available on free sites.
I only say free about large textbook companies because they are literally thieves and are a blight to society. I had been forced many times to buy new books that were $300 to $500 when older editions that were almost exactly the same as the new would have been more than adequate for class and would have been a fraction of the cost. Professors would complain as the administration and local government forced them to use the new books. Here in Texas the politicians are thick with these publishers and students literally pay for their corruption.
You fundamentally misunderstand why people pirate. There are generally three reasons people pirate, price, convenience, and availability.
Convenience - If people pirate because of convenience then the price doesn't matter. If I go somewhere with no internet and I want to load on stuff to do, then the price is irrelevant if I can't access the product offline. If a company takes away a product you already owned from your account, then the price doesn't matter. If I'm forced to go through a DRM and cannot read the book on the device of my choice, then the price is irrelevant.
