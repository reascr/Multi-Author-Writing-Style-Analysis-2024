Hopefully, the people who voted them in will soon realize that all of their pre-midterm bluster about the economy etc was just that ..bluster and bullshit. They have no intention of working for the American people at all. Their only plan is to disrupt, obstruct and destroy the economy so that they can blame it all on the Democrats in 2024. Same old gameplan, just different players at the table..
"While Democrats have built a coalition in the last six years of disaffected Republicans and independents, joining their cause for healthcare, education, immigration reform, and criminal justice reform, Republicans have built a coalition of insurrectionists, white nationalists, antisemites, and other people who want to tear down the government, and so that's what we're seeing on display.".
Absolutely disgusting I am so sick of these revolting, criminal-supporting politicians Our country is supposed to be the shining light of democracy for the rest of the world and the Republican Party is exactly the opposite of that!
