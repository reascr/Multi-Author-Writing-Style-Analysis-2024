No. It wouldnâ€™t as long as we continue to support Ukraine. The issue is the Russia controlled GOPers want to cut Ukraine spending not defense spending.

Conservative here. DoD is a bloated bureaucracy just like every other government agency. Any serious conversation about balancing the budget should involve cuts to DoD along with every other agency and reform in entitlement administration (not saying to cut benefits, but reform the administration of those programs).
100% this. Also put more scrutiny on the contracting process. Projects being late and over budget happens so often it is expected. Once companies have a contract, they have little incentive to get the job done for the price they quoted. The exception is if it is some kind of fixed price contract which never happens for major programs.
