Very early in his tenure Sinema made it crystal clear that getting things done that help the public (and not corporations) was going to be hard. Real progressive policies like Bernie champions would have been dead on arrival. I don't know what Bernie could possibly have done to get the multi-trillion version of Build Back Better passed - it seems pretty clear that we were simply never going to get that while needing both Sinema and Manchin in the Senate.
Actually, woman. I’m trans, Doug Ducey’s laws from last year were scary, and this year they are still trying to implement more laws against trans people (look up the AZ Drag laws). If Kari Lake was governor, we’d be looking at queer people being in major danger, but with Katie Hobbs it basically makes it impossible for any further anti-queer legislation to pass. I feel way safer in AZ right now with her as governor.
seriously. Biden was way down on my list of preferred presidents, but I don't believe that Warren or Bernie would have accomplished as much as Biden did in his first two years.
