Not remotely, since Sam is demonstrably competent and nerdy about very complicated fields of advanced study. But they're also demonstrably showing horrifying lapses in judgement, impulse control, and honesty that does render them unfit for positions of public trust. If it's something that they can treat, awesome, maybe they'll be in a similar position someday, but hot damn I do not need our most prominent genderqueer appointee making us look this bad on the national stage and I won't tolerate a critical member of the DoE exhibiting these behaviors.
Get rid of him. Not worth the headache and distraction this give the other side ammunition (as bizarre and low-stakes as it is) to work with. Also a poor indicator of character. Not as if he's not being paid enough in his current position to afford his own luggage, and obviously doesn't care if he reflects poorly on the Administration. If he has mental issues, then get help. Winona did, and she seems to be in a good place now.
