I can't believe that this egocentric buffon (Trump) is not gone to the gaarbage of history. Guy puts his personal interests before that of the state. Disgraceful.
Very good point. We have a massive military budget and for the first time since WW2 we are using it for good in the world. For those saying that we spend our money on this instead of healthcare remember that we spend twice as much for healthcare as any other country due to insurance lobbies and for profit hospitals and drug companies . We won't use the funds we save to help climate change because of oil lobbies. If we used saved funds to pay down the debt the GOP will just blow up the debt next time they get the white house. There's no reason not to send whatever Ukraine needs to defeat Putin.
The way I see it politicians credibility is always on a sliding scale reading you have to take each law passed each veto raised in every statement issued and individually assess it, so is this is this Sen graham is right on target and everyone should support actions that move swiftly in that direction he is absolutely, and resolutely correct is stating that the more or less than world order is at stake what he said last week what he voted for last year who is he trying to get reelected yesterday? Doesnâ€™t have anything to do with the absolute correct side of politics he is on this issue.
