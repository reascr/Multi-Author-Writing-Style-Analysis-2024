For so many years, decades even, russia has been living off this fear they presented to the world. Of their army, of their military might, their military weapons, their military intelligence. They showed themselves as ravenous bears on the battlefield. In reality, that masquerade popped as though that ravenous bear was truthfully a balloon bear.
Exactly. From the outside, we see the mass slaughter of Russian soldiers and think: They haven't changed their strategy at all!
Everybody deserves empathy. Including yourself, by realising that you can still understand what conditions drive people to do what they do, and how a person can be shaped into something terrible. The word you're looking for is 'sympathy'. No sympathy. But fuck me if I'm gonna look at some dude who turned 18 a month ago and has never had a chance to effectively change Russia's course because they were an actual kid, and say: "Yeah, his compatriots have been horrible. Let's turn him into red mist and watch footage of it like this is a fucked up reality show.".
