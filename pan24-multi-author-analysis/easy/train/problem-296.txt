Unfortunately, no. They have to prove that Trump had criminal intent and knowingly asked Raffensberger to commit a crime. If Trump genuinely believed what he said--that there were fraudulent votes, and that he was asking to Raffensberger find enough of the fraudulent votes to prove he won--then he was not guilty of Georgia's "solicitation to commit election fraud" crime.
Unfortunately in the case of Georgia's "solicitation to commit election fraud" law, this is a defense. The prosecution must prove that Trump's intention was to have Raffensberger commit a crime. If Trump's defense can persuade that Trump believed what he said --that he was asking Raffensberger to investigate and find fraudulent votes he genuinely believed existed--then Trump was not soliciting a crime and therefore was not guilty (of that particular crime: we all know the fucker is guilty of a lot of other shit).
