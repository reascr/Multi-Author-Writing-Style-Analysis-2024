Oh, he will be in the news again soon enough. Probably will be about how he tragically fell from 30 stories for a 3-story building after shooting himself a dozen times in the back of his head. Truly tragic.
If you pay attention to Russian media recently, as in the last 6 months but especially the last 3 - and which I will remind you, this media is all strictly state controlled, so the opinions presented there are at the very least state approved if not actually directed - you will see that it has explicitly genocidal aims being promoted, saying that the Ukrainian culture must be totally destroyed, that the people donâ€™t really exist and are just corrupted Russians, and if they resist this then they must be destroyed utterly.
You are correct. The US discovered where he would be and did not share it with Ukraine because they didn't want to escalate the situation by killing a senior leader at that level. However, Ukraine discovered on their own where he would be and prepared a strike package. The US told Ukraine not to hit his position, but Ukraine supposedly received the message "too late" to call it off.
