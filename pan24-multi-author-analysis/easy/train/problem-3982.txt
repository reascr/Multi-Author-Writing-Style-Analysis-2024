In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly. I'm not calling for some heavy-handed overzealous regulation that breaks everything, that'd be bad. But to do nothing and act like everything is ok is equally bad. And I'm not saying I have the answers to any of this stuff. We'd have to actually sit down and have a real discussion about what makes sense and what doesn't, and really dig into it. But we can't even have that discussion unless people are willing to see that some regulation can make sense and help.
