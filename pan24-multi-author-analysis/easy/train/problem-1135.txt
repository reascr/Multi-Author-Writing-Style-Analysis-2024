If there's one thing that should impress upon people the importance of government and taxes, it's our military. Not because I think the world needs massive armies to kill each other, but because the logistics are second to none. It is absolutely amazing what our mobilized forces can do. Now imagine what we could accomplish if we used that for construction, repairs, etc, of civilian stuff. When NY rolled out the National Guard to help with COVID vaccinations, it was an absolute machine. It had to be the most efficient thing I've seen in a long time. No waiting (other than for my appointment time, but plenty of parking where I was), signs everywhere, in and out. If only we could use these powers for non-military things more often.
Exactly. With ships and aircraft many nations do shows of force and freedom of navigation exercises, along with intelligence gathering in international waters/ airspace. They're often "intercepted" or just shadowed, by their adversary, and it usually only makes news when one of them does something incredibly dangerous like maneuvering too close or causing a collision.
