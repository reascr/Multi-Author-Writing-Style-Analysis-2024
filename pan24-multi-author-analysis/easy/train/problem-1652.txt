Mechanically not any more difficult than the Mig-29 or Su-27 that the Ukrainian Air Force already operates. I don't know why people act like the UAF is flying biplanes around. They operate a fleet of modern jets.
Definitely the most battle-hardened. Training wise they will probably be on-par with the other NATO countries, but honestly equipment-wise they still don’t have any western MBTs and no modern Air Force or Navy to speak of, they (absolutely heroically) make due with a few dozen MLRS and western artillery, some air defense and smaller systems.
Hell. I wouldnt be surprised if more Russians surrender during winter months. Nothing like frostbite to make you reconsider.
>Under the new program, the US would begin training much larger groups of Ukrainian soldiers in more sophisticated battlefield tactics, including how to coordinate infantry maneuvers with artillery support – “much more intense and comprehensive” training than Ukraine has been receiving in Poland or the UK.
Honestly we just have to wait to see how bad the snow will be this year. A foot or two won't change much especially with equipment made for the area. But if we're looking at several feet worth of snow then probably the frontline goes static in that area.
