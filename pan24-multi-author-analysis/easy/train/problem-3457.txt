"activist group spreading misinformation" almost always means some right wing extremists probably funded by wealthy Republicans trying to connect with poor, uneducated folks through lies and incendiary language.
Sure. But it was in the case of this article, and this farmer, and his county being gaslit into preventing him from converting his money-losing cattle pasture into profitable and desireable solar power generation. No trees harmed.
The article later says that Susan Ralstonâ€™s consulting company later received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from republican foundations which received donations from the oil industry.
You're not wrong, per se... It would seem obviously preferable to use existing cleared land or existing developed areas rather than clear-cutting hundreds or thousands of acres of forest to make room for solar.
