There is a big gap between a working prototype and a fully operational nuclear corps. Iran building and testing one nuke might be possible in the next few years, but that doesn't automatically make Iran a nuclear power. It might take another decade of engineering, training, and literal rocket science before they can reach the level of North Korea. Unlike North Korea though, Iran's regime is more fragile, geography more vulnerable, and their enemies more determined to stop them.
Irrelevant. Iran doesn't have a notable fighting capability as it is. Their air force is insanely weak, they have a lot of ground troops but outdated armor, not much of a navy, etc. They do have a lot of missiles. In fact, more than a lot. Fara more than anyone else in the region.
In addition to a calculated Israeli strike, provided it is focused on military target, any Iranian attacks on civilians will be met with a multi-state devastation of their fighting capability. In a few days, Iran will no longer be a war fighting nation, and much of its leadership will be dead in precision strikes.
