There's some think outside the box stuff that could definitely happen. Russia could agree to return everything in exchange for other stuff entirely like security assurances and economic benefits, they could agree to something like those regions all return to the Ukraine but Russians or residents of the dispute areas are free to enter, leave, reside and work there plus enjoy the benefits of being a Ukrainian, Russian, or duwl citizen. They can create a special region with special rights. When its sovereign countries negotiating at an international level there really are no rules they could come up with all kinds of weird stuff that would at last superficiqlly be ” win win”. There are a number of disputed regions and borders in the world ame lots of countries are making it work even though its messy. Messy agreements are better than war. War is the worst thing for everybody, even russia. People die in jig numbers, societies get weaker, the economies go into the tank. There's pressure on all parties to resolve this despite the sabre rattling.
Interesting move. This meeting will be beneficial for both side. My doubt still remain thought. It's clearly normal for China to talk one way and act in another.
