You busted into a conversation about a guy saying that Russia will be completely fine as North Korea is rn and are arguing against me that is saying that North Korea is exactly as the West want's it to be and that Russia is indeed being "messed with" as in: no one is scared of them and no one is scared of North Korea either.
Nah I don't like that option. So because they have nukes they can do whatever they want as long as it's not to a NATO country? There is a line they could cross that would be too far and we all know it. It's just sad that the death of 100s (maybe 1000's?) of Ukraines and their infrastructure isn't over the line and it's just something we have to allow. That's what is too stupid.
Permanently on the verge of mass starvation and economic collapse only propped up by China who are absolutely terrified of what kind of humanitarian and economic nightmare would unfold on their border if the country imploded.
Meh. The Russians are selling it super cheap and not making much off it. It helps keep the energy market from becoming a complete nightmare for the rest of us.
