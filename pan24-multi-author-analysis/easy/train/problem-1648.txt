Not only that, but engineering as well. There have been great strides made in designing for accessibility, and I assume courses on those topics are standard or common in programs leading to jobs in R&D fields.
Fuck. I've been fearing this, too. Roe v. Wade was the point at which I realized that our worst fears about the Supreme Court were true--that they were willing to use their seat to carry out the right-wing evangelical agenda. There are no checks and balances, and I fear what will happen after 2024. Things just keep getting darker and darker. I left my home state of Kentucky this summer for a less radical state, but it feels like I just bought myself some more time running from the inevitable. There is a psychological stress I've been silently carrying since 2016 and I can't talk about it with my inner circle, because politics is considered a divisive subject. Everything I've feared and was told was I was ridiculous for fearing has happened to date, including Trump stacking the courts, attempting a coup, and having Roe v. Wade overturned. I want to be wrong for once, but things are heading in a very obvious direction and I feel like no one wants to see it.
