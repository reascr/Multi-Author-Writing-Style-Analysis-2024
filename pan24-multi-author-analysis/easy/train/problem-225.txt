My mother figure is in Russia. She hates the war herself, but between her mother who she has to support, her lack of personal income (is a digital artist but has to play cat and mouse to get commissions... She changed payment methods 4 times this year I think.), and her husband's inability to consume non-russian news because he cannot speak any language but Russian, she cannot get out on her own. Plus at this point, much of Russias exits have been cut off one way or another.
And whereas nobody recognizes North Korea as a democracy, both capitalist and socialist governments have recognized authoritarian socialist governments as being socialist.
You missed “won’t”. Putin spent 20 years making sure Russians focus on their lives and stay out of politics. Now that he wants them to fight lost are in a “leave us alone” mode.
Unfortunately you're wrong. Older people in my country keep sucking Ruzzian dick. We're a former Soviet country and I can't believe how dumb some of my countrymen are. "mother Russia" my ass.
