In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly! Almost every Republican’s questioning session was completely detached from the rest of the hearing. Most of them only showed up for the five minutes they were asking questions, and didn’t even listen to the responses from the witnesses. It was 100% putting on a show for the camera. Not legitimate governance.
Tell them to go pound sand. Isn't that what the GOP did with little to no consequences to freaking subpoenas? There rules are made up and the points don't matter.

Republicans on this committee got humiliated yesterday. The 2 young people on that AOC and Maxwell Frost completely slapped them at how old, out of touch and clueless they are about how social media works. Now they have to do something to salvage it.
The republicans literally don’t even know the law and they’re pressuring witnesses to unethically share information. Multiple Republican members also threatened the witnesses with arrest and indictment even though it was clear no crimes were committed.
