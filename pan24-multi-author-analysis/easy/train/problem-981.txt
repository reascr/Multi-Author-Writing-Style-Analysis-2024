Edit: Correction, it wasn't a requirement, it was a right reserved for the States per Article 8, Clause 16. The Congress shall have Power To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.
Yeah this is not going to help at all. It will only help the alt right. In Portland the police would take away leftists protests signs and other things they could use as weapons while letting the proud boys and friends bring whatever they want. They were regularly armed and pointed their guns at crowds with photo and video evidence and they were completely left alone. In fact the cops seemed nonexistent when the proud boys were out in droves. Curious.
they wanna be gun bunnies, sign here. You are now in combat arms for the US goverment ------... <-derogatory term for pale skinned terroist.
