Interestingly one of NATOs responses to the use of a tactical nuke is to attack Belarusian military facilities (possibly with a tactical nuke).
I should point out that a) I said possibly a tactical nuke, this doesn't mean definitely, b) Russian nuclear doctrine says they will use nuclear weapons to defend Russia, so a NATO strike on Russia soil would give then cause to use nukes, NATO know this and are fully aware of the risks involve with actually attacking Russia and c) I said one of their responses. This doesn't mean it's the likely response or they still have that as a plan. There are properly 100's if not 1000's of possible responses they would of planned out. 99% of them we will never hear of.
What I can see occurring if Russia drops a tactical nuke in Ukraine as a final warning, is that no, the West would not retaliate militarily at least with nukes, virtually all of Russia's allies (except for North Korea) would condemn this suicidal move and distance themselves from Russia, especially China, who has already warned Russia to avoid nuclear escalation.
