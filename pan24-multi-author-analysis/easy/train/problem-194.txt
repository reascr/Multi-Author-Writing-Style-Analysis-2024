>So, should one simply concede that it’s all politics, all the time, all the way down, and that everyone is simply spreading their ideology? Of course not. Education is political not because everyone gets to teach their politics to innocent charges, but because it is indispensable for democracy. As John Dewey, the greatest 20th-century philosopher of education put it, “democracy has to be born anew every generation and education is its midwife”. Countries with well-functioning democracies also do well on civic education scores. But that is not just a matter of knowledge about democracy, but doing democracy, which can be uncomfortable, even distressing and guilt-inducing (feelings which the Sunshine State Inquisitors try to banish by law from the classroom).
Yup. Try telling an 18 year old that somehow has never heard of religion that a man 100ft (maybe taller I forget) got all animals on Earth in a boat. Male and female. They'd laugh at the idea.
Absolutely. This is the real issue with “grooming” in conservative spaces — it’s boringly obvious projection, just like pizzagate. Imagine being hood-winked by this blatant bullshit.
