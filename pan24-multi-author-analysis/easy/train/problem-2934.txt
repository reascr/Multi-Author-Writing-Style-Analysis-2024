Meth addiction I would argue is actually worse, despite the milder withdrawal. Because with the milder withdrawal (lack of extreme pain), the meth addiction is mostly described as "but life is better this way." Whereas many more opiate addicts wish that they weren't in active addiction, but are so terrified of experiencing the withdrawal if that makes sense.
The biggest part of the opiate addiction is the existential fear of going into withdrawal. Every nerve in your body experiences the most extreme type of pain ... for days.
I think part of that is probably because in the modern Christian tradition monastic orders largely have relatively little influence/authority and hence less potential for corruption. They've been neutered, and this in turn influences the way they are viewed in the west. Corruption in modern Christianity you would expect to happen with priests/ministers and that whole hierarchy.
No. The gangrene it gives you will eat the flesh. It has chemicals in it that will cause sores in your skin that tend to go gangrenous but it actually isnâ€™t what eats the flesh.
