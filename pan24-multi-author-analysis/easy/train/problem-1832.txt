“Some such divine claim underlay not just 'the occupation' but the whole idea of a separate state for Jews in Palestine. Take away the divine warrant for the Holy Land and where were you, and what were you? Just another land-thief like the Turks or the British, except that in this case you wanted the land without the people. And the original Zionist slogan—'a land without a people for a people without a land'—disclosed its own negation when I saw the densely populated Arab towns dwelling sullenly under Jewish tutelage. You want irony? How about Jews becoming colonizers at just the moment when other Europeans had given up on the idea?” — Christopher Hitchens.

Israel occupied Gaza illegally. Then in order to maintain an occupation over a majority, needed to massacre thousands of Palestinians living there. Israel returned Gaza back to the Palestinians and asked the world to recognise its unique idea of charity.
extremely ignorant statement. There were already Jews there. They may started migrating from Europe later on but they were never considered European by anyone.
