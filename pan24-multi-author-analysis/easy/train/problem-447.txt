Listening to a lot of conservative talk show hosts the theme was they want Desantis and upset that Trump is ruining their chances. Trump will still steal the die hards away or sell that elections are rigged and they won't vote. Just the idea that the talk radio peeps turning on Trump is a change. He was their messiah for 6 years. Even on /r/conservative are turning. They are realizing that he will fuck the party out of self interest which everyone who isnt a battered spouse knew.
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications. If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
I'm legitimately excited. The party hates him and their voters have accepted DeSantis as their next strongman. Trump's narcissism is now a weapon against the GOP just waiting to be wielded.
Trump is not capable of using his own narcissism as a deliberate weapon. It makes him do things that hurt the GOP, yes, but he's powerless against his mental illness. It works through him. Others, however, can absolutely use it to unleash him against the rest of the GOP.
