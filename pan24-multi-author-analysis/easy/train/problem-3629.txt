What? No! That’s consequences. There can’t be consequences. How are they going to enlist more criminals officers if they aren’t rewarded for years of committing crime.

I’m definitely more fiscally conservative. I think we’re grossly overtaxed. But, more than that, I think where our taxes go is completely wrong. But, I am also very into personal freedoms. Anyone should be able to marry anyone and do anything with their bodies they want. I don’t believe any drugs should be illegal, nor should prostitution. But also, stay the fuck away from my guns. When Beto made his comment “damn right I’m coming for your guns” that was it for him in my book. Those who would sacrifice freedoms for security deserve neither. Abbott is a shit stain (I live in TX if you didn’t catch that haha), but Beto is a fucking loon. I believe our international policy needs to be completely revamped and we need to let Europe handle Europe. We should not be fucking around in Ukraine until and/or unless the rest of Europe is already exhaustively helping. Bring all occupational forces home I don’t know how, but that shit needs to end. No more empire building.
