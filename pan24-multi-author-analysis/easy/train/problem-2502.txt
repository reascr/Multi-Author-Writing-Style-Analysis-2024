Yeah this study was done a while back and the exact amount varies from country to country. The idea or theory in essence is that when you have plenty for recreation, core needs, and peace of mind, this dramatically lowers our stress and takes us out of fear/survival mode. It would definitely have to be adjusted for inflation ðŸ˜… Also, $100k/yr in San Francisco and New York is totally different than $100k/yr in a rural area with low property cost like Arkansas.
Orâ€¦. Like the Patagonia CEOâ€¦ heâ€™s gonna donate it to a bullshit 501C3 to give the illusion of being civic but really he just needs the tax benefits to launch more dicks into space. Stay tuned.
I would like to start a mental health an resiliency foundation that provides free licensed, secular therapy, social emotional learning, parenting education and pays the therapists well. Please, let him know.
Yeah, seriously. No one needs 110B. If he is just going to donate it in the end don't pay him in the first place. Raise the poverty wages of those that work for the billionaires instead. He obviously doesn't need the money but his employees sure as hell do.
