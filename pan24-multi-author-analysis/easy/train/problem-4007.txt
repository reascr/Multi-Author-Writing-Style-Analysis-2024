It isn't. Don't act like the poor Christian conservatives of Georgia don't willingly flock to the polls every election year to cast their vote for anybody with an R next to their name on the ballot. I'm so tired of the rich being the only people we blame for doing shitty things. The poor suck, too.

Probably. I own my home in Texas. For me to get the homestead exception, which I'm assuming is the tax break he got, my state ID has to show the same address as my homestead exception. I don't think I can have a TX DL License & one in another state. I know my cars all have to have the same address that my DL license when I register them.
