\+ A lot of the applicants also expected PAYE. Your average farm doesn't have the staff or training to be able to calculate how many hours you have worked for your pay (you either work and got paid in cash, or don't work. So the farmers know that if some British mum calls in and claims that she's sick with covid--they can't just immediately let her go because she'll start a snit with the Citizens Advice Bureau). Plus you can't rely on other staff to let you know if someone's skyving off because these other staff don't sleep/eat together. So you're going to be busy not only doing farmwork, but also to keep an eye on all of your farm hands and remember which person has arrived on-time, is late, or sick because that's going to impact their paycheque later on.
Not quite but kind of. As the laws are written these berry pickers aren't picking on private land but public land, these are "forest berries." The companies sell the berry pickers services (accommodations, transportation, food, etc.) and the berry pickers sell them berries. As the law is written the berry pickers can choose whoever they want to sell to. But obviously it's easier to sell to the people you own debt to because then they can resolve your accounts faster. It also means these companies are more likely to invite you back next year to berry pick again using their accommodations.
