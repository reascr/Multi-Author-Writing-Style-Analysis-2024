No, Evangelicals control the Republican Party, and the reason I listed is the evangelicals support Israel. Israel has bi-partisan US suppprt because of this. For the dems and some republicans it is geopolitical. For the evangelical block it’s apocalyptic day dreaming. If the evangelicals change their mind so will the Republican Party. Hence, Israel’s continued support in the US is only bi-partisan because one of the parties has a substantial block that thinks we’re just bringing the rapture. Just google “evangelicals Israel” or “Christian Zionism”. It’s just rude to say I’m not American because I’m actually informed on the subject. Israel is a shit ally and we could toss them aside for better relations with basically any country in the region that could fill the same gap. We already protect a bunch of the Arab states. Israel is famous for stealing our tech and selling it to our enemies. Some ally that is.
In 2000, they sat down again to negotiate and to the suprise of no one (except Clinton the US president), Arafat completly refused to negotiate, and the 2nd Intifada started (again, later revealed to formed under his guide), which included the same suicide bombers and gunmen, only on extreme amounts, which only stopped after Israel occupied the West Bank, again.
