Are they gonna prevent intermediary canadian companies from buying the homes FOR foreigners? Because if the 6% foreign ownership statistic in the article is true, this won't change jack shit.
Really? Not sure where “in here” is but you can get an apartment with no central air and no stove? What do you do for heating? Run space heaters? That doesn’t sound safe at all.
Basically, the first "Prescribe real property" refers to prescribed exclusion in the Regulation (See section 3(1) under sub-title "Residential property - exclusion" in the Regulation), while the same term in paragraph (c) is defined by section 3(2) of the regulation (Which applies the Prohibition to vacant land zoned residential or mixed use in the property census areas).
Hold up. I was just watching a new segment earlier this week about how Canada was trying to encourage skilled immigrants to come there to work. Is the point "we need you to come to work, but this is not your home?".
It's also unfortunate, although understandable, that the prohibition is being applied using census agglomerations and metropolitan areas but, does not apply to areas outside those categories. This means that professionals who don't normally deal with census data will now have to dig into it sometimes. Might be good for rural development though.
