"Immigrants in a US detention facility endured excessive, unnecessary gynecological procedures, often without consent, according to a bipartisan Senate investigation that offers the starkest details yet of alleged mistreatment.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
The investigation builds on earlier scrutiny of the privately run Georgia facility following allegations from a whistleblower who said a doctor contracted by the detention center had performed gynecological procedures on detainees without their consent. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas halted US Immigration and Customs Enforcementâ€™s use of the facility last year.
It's the same doctor. He basically figured out a cheat code to bill the government for extra services. The question is why the federal government continued to do business with him after that.
