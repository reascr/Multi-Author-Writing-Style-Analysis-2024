The "block deal" is not meant in the physical sense, it just means to limit/prohibit access to interaction with US entities such that the benefit of cheaper oil is outweighed by lack of financial opportunities from interacting with US entities.
Most of this is incorrect. Oil only hit 120+ after the war started and that was Russias own fault ( Oil is currently right at $80pb and RU is providing India/China oil 30% below the 'future' crude prices ( Added to the fact that they dont have enough boats ( - And again even if they bought all of the boats being built, they dont have the icebreaking boats needed further north. They arent in a great position.
Sanctions just mean the targeted nation or individual is limited/blocked in its interactions with US entities, mainly financial institutions and companies. No one has inalienable right to be allowed to interact with US entities. Pakistan or anyone else can do as they wish, so can US.
