If my company had slides and arcades and all that sure it would be cool, but I’m an adult and don’t really think I would utilize a slide for fun or hopping on tetris at my corporate job lol.
Post-move, that luxury all-but-vanished. Sharing an office tower with bankers and lawyers was a paradigm shift in the culture that we were scarcely allowed to affect. Sure, it came with great views, but the camaraderie was fractured as the change validated the corpo-minded alpha types. Everything became severe, sterile, and bland all at once, and they seemed completely oblivious as to why they had such a high turnover rate shortly after the change. It was like watching Average Joe's become Globo Gym from within, and it was heart-breaking.
