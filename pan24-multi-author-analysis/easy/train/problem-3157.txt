The problem is that the way Senate and House rules are written more or less assumes a two party system. The Parties themselves are juggernauts who will make it even harder for a viable 3rd party to have any success. As it is, the Republican Party is very much a coalition of two distinct groups, with old-school, McConnell/ Romney/ Larry Hogan/ Chris Sununu types opting to vote with the Gaetzs and Boeberts. Democrats love the fact that those two factions will make the Party even weaker as the crazy faction continues to gain power while those who are simply cruel (but effective) cede theirs. On the Democratic side, progressives and moderates are on the same page on most of the bigger issues and both sides are willing to give the other some elbow room in order to keep a strong unified party. Parties like the Greens bring up some issues during the primaries that force the others to make some small concessions, but the U.S. is simply not designed like a parliamentary government where many small, distinct parties form coalitions and end up finding some way to work with parties that have very different priorities. It would be great. But I have never heard anyone argue that it is even semi-likely, much less argue for how that could come about.
