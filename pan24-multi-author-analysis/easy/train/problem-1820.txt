Thank goodness for this guy. I live in the same town, and my child is a high school student at another public school in the county. I am a teacher in a private school in another town, but I'm thinking of ways to create a protest movement at my school. But this teacher from the article gets it - they are trying to get teachers to quit, so public education falls apart and they can privatize everything.
Precisely. This isn’t just capitalism, it’s white nationalist, fascist Christian theocracy, trying to take over. We’re not safe until they’re stopped, and voting doesn’t stop it. You don’t debate fascism away. You can’t vote it away. You can’t reason with them.
Manatee County, Florida. That's where some developers recently bought up productive farmland. Now they want to re-zone it to 3 residential houses per acre, right next to a race track, that moved out there 50 years ago so they wouldn't bother the people in town. Thanks, urban sprawl, you seem to be bringing out the stupid in my species.
