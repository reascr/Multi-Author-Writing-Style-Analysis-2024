Entities seeking profit =/= capitalism. Reddit has this strange thing where it takes every basic tenant of economics and calls that “capitalism”. It’s still wrong.
The most advanced EUV machines are made by one company in Europe, and the not only has the US has banned them from selling those machines to China, other companies like Intel and TSMC and Samsung are currently on a years long waiting list to get future fabs. This isn't a problem that China can just toss billions of dollars at and fix (because they already are). The expertise just isn't there in the country, and while they are rapidly building up a homegrown body of talent, that talent will continue to stay years behind the rest of the world without access to the latest equipment.
Incorrect. Everything else you said is just standard Reddit-fare word salad and I’m not interested. The answer to China extorting private companies into participating in their security state without legal recourse is not “capitalism”. That’s the point.
