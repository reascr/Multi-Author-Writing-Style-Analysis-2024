In Biden's case, I think we both know he almost certainly did that accidentally, since his lawyers found them accidentally, and already proved he had no intent of keeping them by literally giving them back the next day, and cooperating with further voluntary searches of his property. Since he wasn't asked for them, he could have easily destroyed them and no one would have ever heard about it, instead he did the right thing. Good luck prosecuting someone on that evidence.

You understand incorrectly. That only applies to higher level classifications like the TS/SCI docs trump had. Classified includes 3 levels, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret, SCI is a further designation that basically restricts parts of the full document, so no one ever has the complete information. SCIFs are required for TS/SCI documents and may be used for lower levels, but it's not a requirement.
