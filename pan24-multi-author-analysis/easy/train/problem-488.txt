Nah it's just that the political system in turkey is more fragile and open to abuse compared to more civilised nations. Erdo is one of many who figured out how to abuse the broken system. What he has done better than the rest so far is that he prevented others from gaining power and fed the right people in right places. Others abused the system as well but they either were too busy grabbing all they could for themselves, instead of feeding the right people; or were unable to prevent others from gaining some power, so they all came and went. This cunt is still around after more than 20 years.
By the way, elections were a combined one of district/county, city council and metropolitan municipality elections, done at the same time, all ballots in the same envelope - which means you could vote for one party in county/district level, for another in metropolitan level.
Could you please explain your belief further? What is it about Yavaş that makes you feel he will be a better president than Ekrem İmamoğlu?
