As an example, CNN was running the headline that "Tensions Rising" with China over the shooting down of the balloon. CNN reporters were confronting Chinese officials, who themselves said that the US Government was "overhyping" the story. CNN then has the ranking Democrat member of the Intelligence Committee on, who was saying shooting it down was a "huge intelligence win". You will notice that Republicans and Democrats don't really differ in their assessment that this was some kind of serious threat by China. They only differ in they assessment of how the White House reacted to it. This was a 10 minute prime time segment on CNN dedicated to the story - it wasn't just Republicans going crazy over this story.
The point is, this wasn't a story manufactured by Republicans. They overhyped it no doubt. But both Democrats and Republicans were acting as this balloon was a grave infringement by China - they only differed in assessing the White House response to this "threat". This was made into a big story by mainstream media, not just "right leaning media".
So why was it all over the news on largely Democrat leaning media? This wasn't a story confined to Fox News and Newsmax. There are plenty of those types of Republican outrage stories. This wasn't one of them.
That or the third MAGA option, this is all a multi-Governmental agency conspiracy spanning multiple years and thousands of people all in an effort to make him look bad years after the fact so the future presidental bid they didn't know he'd be in the middle of would take a minor PR hit when he talks smack about the unknown future Presidency dealing with a similar incident.
Fair enough. Though unfortunately it does help fan the flames for people making excuses for the previous admin not knowing about/responding to the events.
