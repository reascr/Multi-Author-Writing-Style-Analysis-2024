Putin has made sure Russia has a massive victim complex. The population is miserable because of the West, not the absolute corruption of Government and industry. He has been “democratically” elected for the last 22 years, come on Russia, do what you do best, throw off your shackles, fuck the angry dwarf off, replace him with another psycho, continue to exist in the 20th Century. You can do it.
Very different people/situation though. Just population density would make a huge difference, plus Japan was thoroughly defeated and the allies completely took over and set the agenda.
Zelensky correct. Ukraine is the final vast land mass separating EU members states from Russia. If Ukraine fails in garnering support from EU, precedence set to invade neighbouring non-nato countries. Moldova, Sweden, Finland next targets.
Incredible. There's nothing I can say to open his eyes. Ah, to quote him "by the way they say Putin is a dictator, it's not true, things work differently there but here people don't understand it" 🤷🏻‍♂️.
