OMFG… I had to Google that because it seemed like you were referencing something but I had no idea what. How do these people even function?
I personally believe that contestants of Miss Universe contestants are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don’t have maps and I believe that our education like such as in Belarus and a the Hungary everywhere like such as and I believe that they should our education over here in the Ukraine should help the Ukraine or should help Belarus or should help the Hungary and the Black Sea countries so we can be able to build up our future.
Man is doubling down. People are pointing out that the war in Ukraine was widely broadcasted because of how it affected the whole world directly or indirectly, may it be the lives of the Ukranians to its political and economical effects to the rest of the world. It got so broadcasted that it's perplexing to find people with no knowledge of it, which is fine on a level. But comparing it to the wars in African countries is not the same. No one is saying the people in these wars should give a fuck about others if they're not in it, you're the one who made that narrative.
