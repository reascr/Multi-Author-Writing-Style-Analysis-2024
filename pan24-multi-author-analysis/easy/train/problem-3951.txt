So, Russia started the war with about 170 battalion tactical groups (BTG). They invaded with about 110 plus irregular troops, support staff, etc. Total was about 200k. They didn’t pull everything because they still have keep troops around their borders. That 200k was WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. Russia assumed that Ukraine would not resist. The operational plan was going to be rapid armored thrusts into the Kyiv and the eastern cities and through Crimea into the South. This was going to lead to the collapse of the Zelensky government and the isolation of Ukraine’s best units in the Donbas. They really needed at least three times the force they sent. Once it became clear the Ukraine was all in on fighting, Russia “special military operation” was doomed. Russia has been trying to replace/expand their forces through a vigorous recruitment program for previous veterans (offering relatively massive monthly salaries) as well as conscription in occupied territories and prisons. They have now exhausted those options. Russia doesn’t have an equivalent national guard like the US to pull from. So Putin was finally forced to a general mobilization to get the manpower he needs. Also keep in mind the “million man” armed forces also includes the navy and Air Force. Active duty Russian ground forces was around 350k at the start of the war.
Oh absolutely. Ukrainians are also outnumbered at least 2:1 in that video, and are all out in the open. At least one of the Ukrainians got hit.
