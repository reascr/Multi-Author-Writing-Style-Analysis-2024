Tucker still hasn’t admitted he’s gay. Why? I’m just asking the question. Maybe there is a perfectly reasonable answer. I don’t know that he’s hiding something. But why won’t he answer the question? <confused look>.
How should we, the U.S., compensate the MILLIONS of us who did come out, for ourselves and for the Pete Buttigieg's of the world, and who were simply, legally and illegally fired, oppressed, not hired, not allowed to serve in the military, denied the right to marry, denied SS benefits, denied health insurance coverage, denied informed healthcare, denied the right to adopt children, had our personal property defaced, assaulted & murdered, and who have been out, fighting, many of us for decades, in a bloody war, for our human civil rights, the right to live, and the right to thrive?
Seriously. So fucking tired of hearing this stupid assumption that if someone is homophobic they must be gay themselves. We are not our own oppressor. Some people are just genuinely full of hate for people different from them.
