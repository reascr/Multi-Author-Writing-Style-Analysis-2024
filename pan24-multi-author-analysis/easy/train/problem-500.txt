Edit: folks you’re reading too much into this. I was making a hypothetical where the US somehow was _forced_ to enter the conflict and a scenario where Russia isn’t stupid enough to engage with nukes. And I was being hyperbolic when I said a weekend. This isn’t supposed to be a thought experiment where I’m trying to analyze and break down the logistics and the likelihood of certain events in the potential involvement of the US in the Russia-Ukraine war.
Haha! Russia lecturing the West about consequences. Russia cannot seem to fathom the consequences of their little special war. The world now sees their military is useless, being propped up by their nuclear arsenal. They cannot accomplish military goals, so instead they target civilians. They are destroying a beautiful, sovereign nation and killing civilians left and right. The world now sees them as a brutal, heartless country. So let's tally up their consequences .. the world hates them, they are now justifiably a pariah, they are exposed as weak and are now clearly exposed as butchers and their economy is obliterated. There are others but it would take too long to write them down. I wonder if Pootin and his ilk will ever accept the consequences of their actions?
Russian intimidation tactics. Pounding of the chests. Toxic male. What ever you want to call it. He does not care that his country would be wiped off the planet. Vaporized, shadows on the walls holding hands. I hope we don’t do this again.
