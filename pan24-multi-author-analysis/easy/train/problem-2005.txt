Turkey has been fighting a proxy war against Russia in Syria since before this war started. Turkey serves Turkey's interests and while I disagree with the results (and think Erdogan is a moldy bread basket), I can't fault any nation for prioritizing self interests when literally every nation does it.
In Turkey's defense, they've never not been a strong NATO ally, but Erdogan has been openly hostile to EU interests after Turkey got rejected in the 00's. This dick wagging is 100% on brand for Erdogan and is just about the only thing he can do to hold his elective base after running the economy into the ground, but once in, there's no reason to assume Turkey will be anything other than a cooperative NATO ally despite any lingering grudges.
No can do. The fact that they use Russian made air defense systems prevents this from being possible. If Turkey had access to the F35 for daily operations and training, they would be training with them in an environment where they could learn how the F35 countermeasures defeat the S300, the system it was designed to defeat. It was a very specific condition placed on Turkey that if they chose to acquire these systems, they would not be allowed to have the F35, because those two systems coexisting in a training environment could very quickly lead to their obsolescence against the foe they were designed for, and the US very much wants to keep these jets relevant for a long time.
