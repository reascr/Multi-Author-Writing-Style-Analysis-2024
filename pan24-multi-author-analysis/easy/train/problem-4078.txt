I'm honestly amazed Putin hasn't just had this guy killed. He's killed so many other opposers to his regime.
He DEFINITELY miscalculated in Ukraine. But will he admit it & back down? Or will he double down until this whole thing plays out - whether with this back & forth or with Putin getting assassinated & a new Russian leader takes over who TOTALLY pulls back out of Ukraine, saying “that was ALL Putin” - and they’re back on the world stage with a microphone again?? Remains to be seen, but yes, he is a terrible coward.
Anti-Putin and anti-war in case of russians absolutely does not indicate anti-imperialism. We, Ukrainians, exercise a great caution when it comes to russians because almost everyone of them breaks on a Ukrainian question. Same goes for TV Rain and Navalny team. Many Ukrainians think that they are way more dangerous than Putin - basically a smarter version of him. See, even you are unable to distinguish anti-war vs anti-imperialism which TV Rain and the likes of them(russian “liberals”) has been displaying constantly.
