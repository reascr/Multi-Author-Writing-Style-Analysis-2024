Edit: to clarify there is no misdirected hate here. I live in a country with a very expensive public medical system that mostly pays for end of life care (up to 90 percent of total spend) and otherwise offers limited access for everyone else. It's by some fucked design or lapse thereof. Meanwhile my sick wife needs to wait 6-18 weeks to speak to someone who's gonna be rude and not helpful for several essential healthcare needs.
Pathetic, they abandoned their supposedly-precious principles for money. What would their god think?!
I actually agree with you that direct democracy is a better form of democracy than pure representative democracy but comparing a modern EU country to Nazi Germany is absolutely absurd.
BS. That's no democracy. That's just popularity contest where winner has no obligation to own voters. It's just blatant propaganda made by these corrupt liars. Polish (similar to many other western countries) people have virtualy no real power over politics.
Polish corrupt politicians choose that but it's typical imperialist trick to buy local leaders and pretend it's all their choosing and you falll for that.
