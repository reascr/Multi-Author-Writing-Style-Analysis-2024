There is some amount of resistance, but it's not enough. My kids are being told at home they can be anyone and love anyone, then walking into school and hearing the opposite. I do think progress is inevitable, and in 20 or so years this will be a great place to live, but my kids are only in middle-school for 3 years each, and I need them to survive until they can find "their people". If we stay here, that won't be until college.
How about giving credit to the candidates who put forward positive, truth-based political policies which appealed to a majority of US voters, whose votes for some legislative races were squelched through gerrymandering, and yet still managed to prevail in a very difficult economic, political and media environment? How about the idea that political media has been hijacked to make a small, fringe minority sound like they own the country? How about the narrative that human beings want good, progressive government and do not want to live in a billionaire's fantasy land?
