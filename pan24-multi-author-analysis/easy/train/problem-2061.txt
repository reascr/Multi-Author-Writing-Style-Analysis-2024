Those millions who voted for Trump are outnumbered. But unless everyone else pulls their head out of their asses and votes blue, all that happens is we ignore the termites for another cycle while they keep packing the lower courts, state houses, governor mansions, and state legislatures with election-denying fascists.
They are dangerously close to controlling enough state legislatures They are basically telling us what they plan to do, and a disturbing percentage of the electorate is 100% on board with autocracy (40% according to polls). We're basically replaying the fall of the Weimar right now, complete with the book burnings. If you don't think that it can happen here, you haven't been paying attention.
