Oh great. That guys is a nut job and tries to talk like a preacher. There is nothing real about him. Such a fake. Can you imagine him preaching to us every day. Oh hell no. Fucking church people are ruining this country. Fuck church people. They will be trying to send their priests to rape your kids and take freedoms away.
Seriously! Who is gonna vote for the guy? The Dems hate him because he is a sanctimonious religious freakazoid. The MAGAs hate him because of Jan. 6. Who does Pence think his audience is?
