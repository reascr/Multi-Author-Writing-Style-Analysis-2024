MPs who visited the border on a fact-finding trip have appeared to corroborate reports – first aired in a BBC Africa Eye investigation broadcast last week – that dead bodies were dragged out of a Spanish-controlled area by Moroccan police.
Experts from the UN committee on migrant workers have also called on Spain and Morocco to carry out thorough investigations into what happened on 24 June, adding: “It is yet to be determined whether the victims died falling from the fence, in a stampede, or as a result of any actions taken by the border control officers.”.
The world doesn't work that way. You can't just force your way into a foreign country. Where are the women? Why is it always mostly single men fleeing ? Do they leave their women and families behind?
Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, has insisted “there were no deaths in Spanish territory”, adding that Guardia Civil officers acted “totally within the law and with the necessary proportionality required by events”.
“So if there were deaths in an area under the control of Spanish authorities, then Spanish authorities are the ones who need to be carrying out an investigation.”.
“Given what we’ve seen, everything suggests that people obviously died in an area that was under the control of Spanish authorities,” said Enrique Santiago, an MP for the Unidas Podemos alliance, which governs Spain in coalition with the larger Socialist party.
