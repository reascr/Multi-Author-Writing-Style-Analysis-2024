I read your link and read a little more. The official is technically correct, the original rule was to apply to cars of 20 or more and while applicable to all flammable liquids was primarily aimed at ethanol and oil tankers. But is this technically correct answer really satisfactory to you? The industry stopped any adaptation of ECPs. They claimed that the breaks would cost 35 million a year while the savings would only amount to 19 million. Meanwhile, some railway safety experts say that the nature of the materials transported means that even the fewer number of cars should have caused them to be classified as hazardous. But this could never happen if you could not force ECP on 20 cars. You are technically correct but the residents got a raw deal. I hope the inevitable civil lawsuits bankrupts the rail company.
Really? So when his governor got a call from Biden telling him that he can have any resources he needs to help his constituents and the governor said “Nah, we good.” wasn’t the biggest slap to the face? Interesting...
What a crappy mayor. Why do they need the President to get involved? Why can't they handle it through their state agency? It's a waste of resources to see the leader of the country to the area.
