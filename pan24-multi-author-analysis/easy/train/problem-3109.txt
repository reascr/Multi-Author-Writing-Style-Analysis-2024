I worry any time the Supreme Court is tasked with deciding a case involving “new” technology (which, to be clear, ought to be a joke when talking about the internet at this point). Although changes to the Court have made it relatively younger than the forgoing standard, some of the Justices didn’t adapt to new technology in a timely fashion because they had a person who handles all of their typing, research, communications, etc., when these technologies emerged. Consequently, there is a frightening lack of technical literacy and even basic competency when it comes to technical matters. That doesn’t automatically mean they’ll reach the wrong decision, and it’s not like judges are expected to be experts on matters other than the law, but it’s a major hindrance that, given the political circumstances and partisanship demonstrated by the present Court, does not inspire confidence.
2. Parental responsibility, if you leave your kid on the side of the road somewhere, some parts of society will be helpful, some will be harmful. Don't like it? Keep your kid away from it. A bit like porn, you can't take it away from the rest of us just because you don't like it.
