In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
So what? Conservatives don't care. And there's plenty of liberals in here complaining about how much alt-right stuff they get pushed in their feeds now so they aren't upset about this enough to leave the platform.

A tech CEO buys a massive platform, immediately and consistently spreads multiple political conspiracies, claims election interference, and replatforms open and proud extremists. You don't think that's political news lol? The guy was one of Trump's advisors for fucks sake.
