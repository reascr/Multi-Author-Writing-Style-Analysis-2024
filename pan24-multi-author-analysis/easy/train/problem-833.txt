I’ve seen this slide in real(excruciating)-time being a progressive voter and activist since ‘96. I was the asshole at parties that would talk about the issues of the day only to get a lecture the next day about, “don’t you know not to talk about politics?” Like, fuck you, if we don’t talk about politics they will take over. Then I just became the crazy-loon, conspiracy theorist. But I was right about the Iraq War, about the Patriot Act, about voting machines, about Citizens United, about trump and so many others. And then I started pissing off liberals when I pointed out Obama and the Democrats were pulling the rug out from under us by telling us what we wanted to hear yo get our vote and then when in power work only for reelection and to make excuses as to why they can’t help the working class.
1. Everyone sending these texts knows there was a possibility they could be seen someday if things went south. That’s why they keep using the patriotic bullshit about saving the republic, they want to try to argue that they really thought they were doing the right thing, claim negligence or some bullshit from the wacked out articles they got their information from. But knowing damn well the whole time they were coordinating and communicating about a coup. It was just a wink wink between all of them.
