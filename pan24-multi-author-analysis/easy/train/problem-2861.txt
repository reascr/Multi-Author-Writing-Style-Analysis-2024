A statement by the Kremlin is obviously more newsworthy than a video released on twitter by an embassy. If the Russian embassy in Washinon tweeted a video I doubt it would make the news unless the white house made a statement about it. That does not make this pro Russian propaganda.
Again, a statement by the Kremlin is more newsworthy than a tweet by an embassy. Once the tweet was commented on it became part of the story so of course Reuters described the tweet, which until that point was not necessarily newsworthy on its own. Still not pro Russian propaganda.
As for hypersonics with conventional warheads; they would be very useful in attenpting to sink aircraft carriers or some other ships (that are multiple times more expensive than the missile not just in terms of monatery cost, but in time to make a new one or just remove a major piece from the battlefield), or destroy some high value target (like fighter jet manufacturing facility or some other high value military or infrastructure target) in war. Ukraine doesn't really have that many targets where such a highly expensive (and valuable in terms of production) would make sense.
