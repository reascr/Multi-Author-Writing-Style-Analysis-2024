Ok… y’all need to stop talking about “x was about Trump”, “Trump lost…”, etc. It all smells to me like that fateful night when Obama made fun of him at the correspondents dinner. For every person who’s thinking “I know, right?!”, there’s one or two who are quietly thinking “yeah, we’ll show you… just wait”. Just move along… concentrate about something else. It’s amazing how much Trump lives rent free in so many people’s heads. Stop talking about him. Marginalize him. Make his presence smaller. God, it’s like a bad infatuation.
All of the results from 2022 suggest that America more generally wants non-radical politicians who actually have platforms and demonstrable success rather than hyper-partisan candidates.
Of course. Because the Republican Party platform doesn’t exist. They don’t stand for anything anymore. They’re just rubber stamps for Trump. Now that the ship is sinking, they’re starting to realize that a nothingburger cannot support a party platform. I have no sympathy and no respect for them whatsoever.
