It’s a little weird for me, a girl who is female, but hey - if it makes someone feel better about who they are, I’m all for it.

Gender identity is individually determined. There should be no laws defining gender identity. Just let every individual identify as they see fit. It shouldn't be for governments to define an individual's identity. Why are authorities always trying to label us & put us into boxes that makes them feel comfortable? This should be a non-issue and every human beings right to privacy as to how they identify is paramount.
