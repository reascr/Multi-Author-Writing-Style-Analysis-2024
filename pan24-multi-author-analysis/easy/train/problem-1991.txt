The happily non-democratic countries are where modern day slavery is occuring. But you know that cause you are so knowledgable. I really want to know which supreme leader's dick you are on. MBS? Kim Jong? No no I'm sure it's one of those african countries, Eswatini? Or it could be Erdogan, but he started by being elected democratically before becoming supreme leader. Oh I got it. That guy from Syria is doing a bang up job as supreme leader. Please do the world a favor and go back to r/conspiracy. The big kids play here, you might get your feelings hurt.
That doesn't mean that it isn't worth trying or supporting democratic movements, just showing that with a narrow view pointed toward 'less overall suffering, instability, and death right now' autocratic governments can be seen as a net positive.
It is unfortunate that many countries in the world today would be unlikely to become or stay democracies if their autocratic rulers were overthrown or even peacefully abdicated. That usually means that civil wars, internal strife, and increased instability will occur and likely cause a lot of suffering, injury, and death among the populace, when after all is said and done the conclusion is more likely than not to be some form of autocratic government taking power again.
