No. It's going to take at least two more years with a new special prosecutor especially since he has to juggle both 1/6 cases and the document case.
terrible terrible terrible. It doesn't matter whose appointed, how can just filing to run for President warrant someone getting a special counsel? Garland is a coward whose afraid of foxnews calling him political, not of the department seeming political.

Instead, Garland as he has done his entire career, goes forward at his own pace doing nothing until he considers it complete and polished to a mirrored finish, the guy has no conceptualization of the 80% rule there is 100% complete or nothing, it may be fatal, because there is a timeline here that controls the DoJ, and Garland seems to be completely unaware of that and that if Trump should become president again, his whole investigation will be for naught.
Garland gave up. He bundled both the insurgency and the document theft into one massive case and handed it over to somebody. it's going to take two to five years to get this done.
It's taken two years to get this far. DOJ isn't known for being fast or willing to convict republicans and rich people.
