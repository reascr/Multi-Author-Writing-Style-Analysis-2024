Also, you are wrong. That is not what it did. The emancipation proclamation ended slavery in states that were in rebellion. This not only gave incentive for slaves to escape to Union lines, it also was the effective follow-up of the previous Confiscation Acts and the Militia Act 1862 which authorized “persons of African descent” to be able to serve in military or naval service for the Union.
Wrong all around. The Emancipation Proclamation freed only slaves in territory held by the Confederacy. Slaves held in areas under control of the US government were not freed by the Proclamation. Since it only applied to slaves in areas held by the Confederacy, it wasn't really enforceable and to some degree it was more symbolic. But it was a very important symbol. By issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln had essentially declared war on slavery, cementing it as a central issue of the war. While this was important from a moral standpoint, it was also a critical strategic move. The South had been trying to get European powers like Britain and France to support them. By issuing the EP, Lincoln ensured that Britain and France would not be able to declare support the Confederacy without declaring support for slavery.
