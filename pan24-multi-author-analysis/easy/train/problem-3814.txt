In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Maybe. But McCarthy also takes direction from the donors/actual leaders of the GOP. The last thing the actual elites in charge of the GOP are going to want is a full on festival of MAGA fuckery for the next 2 years.
Not necessarily. It’s better just to use the actual margin because absences and “present” votes can affect the number of votes necessary to pass legislation.
If 214 Dems vote against a ridiculous bill, 215 Republicans vote for it, and 6 Republicans vote “present” or just skip the vote altogether, the bill passes. There’s an example where a seven vote margin gives the some extra room for “moderates” to abstain and still not hurt their party.

Americans don't want investigations. They barely wanted it for 9-11 or January 6th. They want Congress to STFU and just do their job. If Republicans look like they are going on a vendetta tour and hold the gov't hostage, Americans will punish them for it.
