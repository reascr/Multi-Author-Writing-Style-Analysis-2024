As for voting for him... Democratic turnout was shit. I held my nose and voted Crist, but I don't know anyone that actually voted for him and not against DeSantis. If Democrats had turned out like they did in plenty of other areas, the race would have at least been a lot closer. I figured a 55/45 DeSantis win, but he won 60/40.
I'm not saying criticizing this appointment is necessarily a objection to democracy, but the author is using a rhetorical sleight of hand here, perhaps unintentionally, actually a . In syllogistic form, she's saying:
Add onto that, Florida is skewing significantly more Republican (R registration passed D registration for the first time in a long time about a year ago), and A LOT of people moved here during COVID because they liked that we were "open" and had "freedom" compared to New York and California, and a lot of them could work remotely so they bought property here and that demographic skews heavily conservative. The Villages is a huge, mostly conservative retirement community that is also one of the fastest growing metro areas in the country.
