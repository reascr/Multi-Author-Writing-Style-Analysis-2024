They're probably trying to a) deny minorities the public school money needed for them to get a proper education in a public school (this would disproportionately affect Tennessee's minorities), and b) force people to switch to private schools, probably with the intent to get people to stick with private schools if they're forced to send their kids there for long enough.
Haaaa! Already 1/2 way there.. Water supply fluoridation referendums have shown up recently on many local town and county ballots.. Add that to low/no dental insurance and we get unfortunate jokes like “what’s 150 long and has one tooth? — the Ferris wheel line at the county fair..”. It’s embarrassing..
They will no longer have to follow special education laws. This is a huge bummer for those families with kids with special needs. In the old days, those kids were neglected and denied a proper and fair education. I wonder what kind of civil rights protections they will be allowed to ignore too.
