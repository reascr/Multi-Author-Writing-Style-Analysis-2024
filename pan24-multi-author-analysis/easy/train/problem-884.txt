Japan paid way back in 1965 when they re-established relations, they even wanted to pay it directly to surving women but S.Korean government at the time (a dictatorship at the time) seem to have insisted on a govt-to-govt deal and unsurprisingly most of the money never reached those poor women.
No. You're still not understanding. I'm not likening your comment to antisemitism in terms of racism. I'm likening it to ridiculous things like belief in the Illuminati and anti-Semitism. You don't have to take it so personally or be so offended by everything. You're still ignoring everything else I wrote.

Not just comments. A lot of their top politicians (and a significant portion of the Diet) are members of ultranationalist organisation Nippon Kaigi which such have wonderful beliefs.
Could've easily had an interesting discussion about the Nippon Kaigi and whether they inflate their membership, how influential their political campaigning is, etc.
