This is happening all over the country. Republican lawmakers are getting away with authoritarian anti-democratic practices. Why aren’t there consequences for their behavior? How can we expect to remain a free country if those who want to overthrow the Republic are not held accountable?????
Thats what I meant earlier when I was saying something unconstitutional isn't necessarily illegal. You end up with stuff like this. Because there is no legal relief to give because no legislature has written a law that punishes officials for acting unconstitutionally.
“But the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from awarding declaratory or injunctive relief of the kind at issue against a state official based only on a violation of state law.”.
But there is no relief because he's a state elected official and the 11th amendment doesn't allow this court to reinstate a states elected official. You wouldn't want to give the federal court the ability to appoint people to state positions for obvious reasons. It's a state right to appoint, elect, or reinstate a state official. Not a federal one.
