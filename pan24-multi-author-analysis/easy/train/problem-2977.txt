Due to the overreach on the initial layoffs, current Twitter employees are in a pretty empowered position right now. Twitter is sinking and Elon removed the majority of the bilge pumps along with most people who know how to run the boat. He needs every hand on deck and can’t afford to fire people giving 80% and telling him to fuck off from his return to the office edict. Curious to see how many return.
Twitter has the right setting to lure in people who normally doesn't use media, similar to Facebook (ignoring all the bad stuff about both of these media platforms), so basically this means we can enjoy seeing boomers complaining about modern day society and companies typing cringe worthy stuff for the sole purpose of free advertisement. Idk this is just my guess.
This combined with higher regulatory standards, means universities and hospitals can no longer afford to bring these medical innovations to market without major financial backing. The type of financial backing that requires venture capitalists and big banks.
Exactly. Also LLY’s dip is still up over a 1 month period and the same dip had occurred 8 days prior.
