Thx for the history lesson 👍 i didn't know Morocco was an early ally of ours. I don't think I remember anything about Morocco aside from its location lol. History was the only subject I was never very good at in school. Couldn't seem to keep the places, names and dates all organized in my head, especially when it came time for a test, even though I usually found the subject matter fascinating. Geography, fine Math, science, music and spelling/grammar came easily too 🤷‍♀️ (Oddly enough I just realized I have the same issue with movies and actors. I might enjoy a movie while I'm watching it, but dont ask me later on what the name was or who was in it!) 🤔🙃.
Probably due to them wanting more of their strong allies to support them in getting their ownership of the western sahara, especially since they clearly aren’t getting any of that recognition by other north african and african countries and some of them even almost recognized the independence of the region this summer.
Wow are they really? That’s incredible, I remember some very good players and teams back in the day from Cameroon, Senegal, Cote D’Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Tunisia, Togo, Algeria… amazing that Morocco had managed to push farther than all of them. Tremendous accomplishment.
Don't drink the water. Prepare to get sick at least once. It's a squat/hose/bucket nation; buy a roll of TP when you get there if that is your most comfortable option.
