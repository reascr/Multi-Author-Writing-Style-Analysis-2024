For instance Finland is completely self-sufficient in weed, as in we grow enough for the market and wouldn't need to import. And all that growing is happening illegally "in secret".
Growing illegal plants isn't quite as "clandestine" as you might think it is. Hell, half the apartments I know of in this area have their bedrooms as grow rooms. Two large tents usually. Hydroponics and a good light and the yield is bonkers.
It’s crazy how people will recognize prohibition for alcohol didn’t work and created an illicit a lucrative black market for criminals, prohibition of marijuana didn’t work and created a lucrative black market for criminals, but still somehow think it will work for tobacco.
I see. I guess I'm betting that that won't happen to an appreciable degree, because tobacco prohibition won't be 1:1 comparable with drug prohibition. We'll have to see!
Decriminalized, yes. Allowed to be sold in your local stores? I'm not so sure about that. Not all drugs are equally dangerous, and tobacco is certainly one of the most addictive and kills many people.
