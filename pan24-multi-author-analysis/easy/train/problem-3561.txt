I don't disagree at all. But what I'm talking about is people's disconnect on the realities of certain things. People seem to think Ukraine is absolutely shit stomping Russia and not taking losses in the process. While that's partially true, they have done an absolutely monumental job so far, no one knows the severity of loss the Ukrainian military has suffered in the process. And sadly it's probably pretty high with the amount of artillery, mines and missiles that have been dumped into that country.
Hmmmm. The US Army is not fighting. By doing this, isnâ€™t that general directly undermining the existing diplomatic path? In a way that benefits Russia?
Exactly. The people trashing the dude also have no skin in the game. It is easy to tell Ukrainians to consider diplomacy when you aren't losing part of your homeland. It is easy to say "RESIST!" when it isn't you or your families lives on the line.
Diplomacy? Russia is actively seeking out and raping and murdering non-combatants including women and children, and castrating men. There is literally no diplomacy to be had.
