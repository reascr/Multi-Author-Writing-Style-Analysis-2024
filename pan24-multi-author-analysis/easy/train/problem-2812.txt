Yeah, kinda starting to feel like it's not just a "wave" anymore, and this is just becoming a lifestyle. Hostile thoughts beget hostile words, and hostile words beget hostile acts. It was only a matter of time before all of the fomented rage Fox News and their ilk promote would go from "just asking questions" to people getting hurt. We need to end the dynamic that makes pitting people against each other profitable. Until we get this under control, it's going to get worse. I get that we don't want to trample the First Amendment, but we can't just let lying to the public be OK anymore. There's no way the Founding Fathers thought we'd have a way to talk to literally the entire country at once and tell everybody that the president is Satan and his political party is full of pedophiles.
Exactly. We didn't make slavery or Jim Crow go away by hugging slavers, slavery supporters, and segregationists. We literally had to MAKE them stop at gunpoint. Including segregation because it took deploying federal troops to make it stop.
