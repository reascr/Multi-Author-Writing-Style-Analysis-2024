Here in Poland people boycotted Leroy Merlin, Auchan, Decathlon and other French brands for not leaving Russia - hell, they expanded their market there after their competition left - but it was only good enough for a month or two. After that, people seem to have forgotten. Leroy Merlin ranked up their advertising on one of the main TV stations after the boycotts started and people got upset the TV station actually kept showing the commercials, to which they replied "the Polish branch of the company is not responsible for the actions of the corporation." Money grubbing vultures.
TLDR, I can't make a sensible post that isn't going to solicit ire from everyone (and when both/all sides are unhappy it doesn't mean you're right), so I'll just say this has me conflicted; Slava Ukraine; Putin can get effed to the bottom of the ocean, I hope this nonsense ends soon with Ukraine on top and made hole and that the respectable Russian people can make a better future for their people and those that sought to benefit from these atrocities will be rightfully judged and punished... And yes I understand those can't all be attained.
