They need something to show for the entire Eastern theater of the war since Lysychansk 5 months ago. Especially since all the withdrawals from Kharkiv, Kherson, and (possibly upcoming) ZNPP have made Russians forget even those few victories, and the public opinion is gradually changing to "Russia is losing." Putin needs a recent win to have any chance of ending the war on non-disastrous terms for Russia and himself personally.
Preparing. It takes them months of effort to do a fast push gaining lots of ground. My guess is nothing will seem to happen until late January when we see another large gain.
Exactly. They can't imagine that even if Ukraine and the west were to agree to whatever new borders Russia wants that they would return to any semblance of how it was before the war. The sanctions will remain so long as Russia occupies anything beyond the 2014 Minsk agreement. The 300 billion dollars the west has frozen will never return to Russia. Western Countries will continue to develop new energy infrastructure that doesn't involve Russia. NATOs border against Russia expanded 5 fold. 100k dead. Complete stagnation of their military industry.
1. Capture Bakhmut at all costs (even though it'd just be another Mariupol-style destroyed city with no value by the end of it.).
