>In other words, if you are a victim of rape and become pregnant, you would present your case to a community board to see if the situation was bad enough to merit your getting an abortion or whether your rape was legitimate enough (to paraphrase the immortal Todd Aiken) to merit an abortion.
This guy seems like a dipshit. Avoid voting for dipshits. Avoid dipshits who want panels to determine if the rape was rapey enough or if the incest was incesty enough. And by all means avoid candidates who will likely make showing your junk to a panel of local yokels part of some dumbass process.
WTF republicans? You’re thinking it’s the rape victim’s responsibility to go before an ‘impartial’ panel? Maybe someone who read further can tell me what penalties he thinks the rapist should face cause that first graph puts the entire onus on the woman. So the 10 year old Ohio child should go before a panel? How about a kidnapper women held in a shipping container? Maybe the wife trying to leave her abuser?
