The reality is that the Russians know they have to make major gains before the Western tanks start arriving. Then they will attempt to solidify their positions by crying out for "peace" before they start getting their asses handed to them.
Exactly. The last paragraph of your comment couldn't have been said better. Acknowledging the difficulties and challenges faced by Ukraine does not mean a person is in favor of appeasing Russia or avoiding this conflict altogether.
Exactly. Russia can outproduce Ukraine. Russia can't outproduce Ukraine's allies. The question is does the political will match the industrial capacity.
Seriously. Those guys who fought off the hordes for 10 hours, watching their ammunition running out, down to the last grenade, only to be saved by a retreat at the last minute... no words for that. The fact that they are still in the fight is incredible.
USA prohibited the Ukranians the use of himars on russian territory and also is not providing their most long range ammo to not tempt them to do it, beyond "unconfirmed" partisan sabotages, drones and daring helicopter raids the west is prohibiting the use of their equipment on Russian soil, also part of the amassing mobilization is on the belarusian side.
I disagree. Russia has been increasing refurbishment and production of equipment, while Ukraine's industrial capacity is severely limited. If Ukraine does not receive continual, substantial, deliveries of material from allies Russia WILL regain initiative and begin taking more territory.
2. More important, Putin will just regroup and attack again when the time is right. That attack will be 10x worse after the Russians have had a chance to entrench and rebuild their capabilities.
