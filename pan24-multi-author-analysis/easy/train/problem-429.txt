That's a question I think I will have and a lot of other people will have of our retirement fund managers. Because I am a GreatWest Life customer and they use Blackrock as part of our retirement portfolio. Blackrock invested into FTX, so guess what happened to my retirement fund when news of FTX hit? No I didn't lose everything but my portfolio and how I set it up was quite risk-adverse for a person my age. I only had an allowance of 10% of my money to be in higher-risk investments 30% to be in medium-risk. My question to Blackrock is, how the fuck did they invest in FTX when you can't risk certify fucking cryptocurrency or crypto exchanges? Who the hell said this was even a high-risk investment? I'm 36 I'll bounce back but some people are out of runway time to bounce back and just took a pretty substantial hit. I can't believe I have to even be angry about this shit, stop fucking investing retirement funds into crypto and other dodgy shit.
Centralized exchanges definitely need regulation, absolutely. Fiat backed stablecoins ( see Tether / USDC ) also need regulation to ensure they actually are worth what they say they are.
Unsurprising. I've entertained myself with crypto-hoax videos and the one thing that keeps repeating is how fucking incompetent people who couldn't make it in real investing are regarded as geniuses when they come to the crypto scene and make big promises.
