Y don’t proud boys or maga have internet access?? If they care about saving kids from “grooming” y r they at drag shows here for centuries w no history of abuse unlike religious cults lobbying w 10’s of millions against LGBTQ to scapegoat the most common theme in Church’s child sex abuse - ffs maga mega Church’s just released a 700 pastor list & r under DOJ investigation FINALLY the Mormons & Catholics spend a fortune to keep loopholes open so they don’t have to report these vile crimes - this is all public knowledge so again Im asking Y they don’t have internet access?
