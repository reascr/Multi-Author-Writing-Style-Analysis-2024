I agree with everything in there - but also that it was a combination of federal and private channels that ultimately got it to work. Again, it's more of a Trump didn't fuck up all of OWS as much as he could have, which for him is impressive. They should have leveraged the previous experience of H1N1 - absolutely. It would have been smoother otherwise.
I will say trump really showed how bad the two party system is, the right will support him once he beats Ron in the primary just to own the Dems, on the flip side when he won the dems never gave him a chance , don’t get me wrong I hate trump but i think he’ll win in 2024, no COVID crisis, Biden has been shit and i think there will be more ppl staying home or at least not voting Biden to spite trump no way does he top 81 mill again.
And the US Air Force used to be the army. Doesn’t matter that it is derived from another branch. He created another branch of the armed forces that is going to expand the scope of their reach. It’s clear China and Russia are militarizing space and it was an important and necessary step. He gets credit for being the one that did it.
