It's a little more nuanced than that. The use of the court system by private parties to impose penalties/restrictions on other private parties still requires government action, because the courts are an arm of the government.

Private civil actions are still subject to the 1st Amendment, because the use of the court system by private parties to impose penalties/restrictions on other private parties still requires government action (the courts are an arm of the government). For instance, if the government passed a law allowing churches to sue anyone who said anything negative about Christianity, that law would (or should, rather) be struck down as unconstitutional.
