You know who protestants/evangelicals hate more than gays, POC, trans people and women? Catholics. You know who catholics hate more than those things? Protestants/evangelicals. It's harder to tell with the protestants because they're more decentralized, but you can see how it is with how the extreme catholics talk amongst themselves about Vatican II. They fucking hate that they ceded their claim to supreme authority in order to find common cause with other sects of Christianity and remain politically relevant. They fucking hate that they revoked blaming all Jews for the death of Jesus. Evangelicals hate that its Leonard Leo picking supreme court seats and Newt Gingrich and Sean Spicer and all those fucks make pilgrimages to the Vatican. Paul Gosar denounced the pope for "trendy socialist speak.".
Prosecuting a handful of the thugs involved in the Jan 6 terrorist attack while Trump and the rest of the Republicans that planned and executed it are actively attacking another election is bullshit.
OK. But when I do vote based on my family, you will come at me with hate for not caring about your family.
