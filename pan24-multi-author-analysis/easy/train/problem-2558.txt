I have some good news though. I am part of a small libertarian community and in 2022 most of us voted Democratic, I was my first time since obamas second election. Trust me I wasn’t happy about it at all but my love for America and democracy forced my hand. I viewed it as my civic duty.
A Russian funded grifter infiltrated our government at the highest possible level, made billions for his family, politicized a pandemic resulting in so many more deaths, stole Intel and sold it to our enemies, and now he's trying to break our woefully imperfect democracy to replace it with a Christo-Fascist Authoritarian government. Is it time to make jokes or do something about it?

It’s interesting. Arizona GOP spends 2 years making it harder for people to vote (especially early voting) and when people have trouble voting on election day, it’s automatically voter fraud.
