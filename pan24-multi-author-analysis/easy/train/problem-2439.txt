It's a shame Trump was president and Barr was running the DOJ AND Mueller said Hillary had clearly committed crimes, yet they never brought charges. That was their shot it seems, right? Obviously FBI was behind Trump because FBI publicly announced they were opening a new investigation into Hillary days before the election. Cards seemed stacked against her and easy win for Trump. It sucks too because even though Hillary thought she was under a political witch hunt (lol) she still testified hours under oath on live TV in front of the Republican house and they still couldn't nail her on anything? I wonder if Trump testified under oath too all of this would have gotten cleared up so much quicker!
Exactly. It's not a calculated evil genius 4D chess move. It's not even conscious behavior. Trump just has an instinctive need to dominate. It comes across a million ways: keeping people waiting, aggressive handshakes and body language, and, yes, paying no attention to things like protocol regarding secret classified documents. (Admittedly we fetishize "top secret" etc and by doing so elevate and give power to his casual disregard.).
