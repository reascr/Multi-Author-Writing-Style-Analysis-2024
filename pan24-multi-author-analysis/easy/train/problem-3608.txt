So his skepticism is based on the fact that Belarus and North Korea could also be supplying them? Well thatâ€™s something.
The only logical conclusion for why Russia is currently doing what it is doing is that continuing down this path is in Vladimir Putin's personal interest, but with the probable end-game in sight, I fail to see how the status quo of dragging out the war is really that advantageous to him personally.
Arty can easily be taken out by drones. This is why Ukraine is buying drones and gaining air superiority.
No, Russia has suicide drones, artillery isn't anti-air and drones are smaller targets. Russia definitely cannot refine steel and reproduce artillery cannons "as quickly as they are taken out". Russia is complete ass in logistics alone. This is why their front line fighters do not have enough small arms or ammo.
If all they have is artillery it really limits what targets they can hit. Their long range method is now iranian drones. If they can only shell the border, it isn't that useful. Ukraine can also re-establish air superiority then enemy arty's become an easy target.
