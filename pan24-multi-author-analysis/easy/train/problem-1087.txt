It's such an obviously good PR move to say "The money that was given to us was stolen, we're giving it back to his victims, and by the way, our opponents are in the same boat and aren't returning a penny, please vote D and give us $5" that I'm kind of surprised I'm being asked to be spell it out so explicitly.
The right thing to do? The money was given fair and square based on current campaign finance laws. Look, I'm not saying the DNC should be taking money from crooks or that money in politics is a good thing, but it's unrealistic for the DNC to be holding themselves to some arbitrary standard that a) the GOP isn't even pretending to care about and b) has zero political advantage. The DNC isn't a religious organization; it's a political organization. The goal is to win elections and use that political power to effect positive changes. If you say this move will positively affect political goals, then fine I'll stand corrected. But if they're just giving it back for warm and fuzzy feelings, it's dumb.
