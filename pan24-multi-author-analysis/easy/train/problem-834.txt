Lol tell me you didn't read the article without telling me you didn't read the article, the point of which is that even more infrastructure can be built/fixed/addressed if there is more flexibility for importing construction materials and investing money instead in more forward-thinking technologies and materials, which would also lower the cost of maintaining and building infrastructure in the future.
What are you doing here man? You don't have to guess what it "sounds" like, you can just read what was actually written. Start with the beginning of the article:
Bezos has the foresight to invest and make himself a rich man, 250,000 dollars of Google stock in 1998 which is worth billions today, but he seems to lack the sense to understand that the system which made him rich makes everything more expensive over time, plus the fact that bridges, unlike a digital ledger of stock ownership, exist in the real world, and hence are subject to aging due to something called physics, and become more expensive to repair the longer the repair is put off.
that you read. But, you didn't read the whole thing, which says money should have been invested in forward-thinking materials and technology that can build more infrastructure and maintain it cheaper, with minimal investment in common construction materials.
