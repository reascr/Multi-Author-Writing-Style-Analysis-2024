Any other course of action, and especially this one, where our government stated it is willing to bankroll this conflict and the senseless deaths of soldiers and civilians that will come with it, rather than doing anything at all to bring an immediate unconditional peace, is not just evil, it is morally heinous, and I dearly hope fate judges the soulless warmongers who've taken this path with the extreme severity they so desperately deserve when their time comes.
You ever play warhammer. I've started to realize warhammer is like real life. There are imperium people, and then are chaos worshippers. Now it doesent matter if the chaos lord is a nurgle festering beasty, that likes to rub shit all over itself, and turn people into zombies. Somebody out there will support them.
No, Russia's invasion is complete unacceptable and absolutely indefensible. I'm not absolving them of anything. But, in case you didn't notice, America is not the country being invaded or the victim. And regardless, Ukrainian sovereignty is not worth one single life lost and neither would America's sovereignty be if we were attacked, and nor would any other state's sovereignty be morally worth even one lost life in any other war, real or theorized.
