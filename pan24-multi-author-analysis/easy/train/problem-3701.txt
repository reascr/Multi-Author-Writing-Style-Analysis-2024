I mean “win for democracy” is pretty subjective, and journalists, at least the ones that know what they’re doing, avoid subjectivity whenever they can.
That’s not to say it’s not a win for democracy, IMO, it clearly is, but journalists ethically have to keep their biases out of it, even if their bias is pro-democracy.
If the reporter got a nice quote from a source mentioning how this is good for democracy, they could’ve used that quote for the headline potentially. Otherwise, it’s best to stick to hard facts and only hard facts.
Yep the Republican party gets treated as a serious political movement instead of an extremist voter suppression outfit controlled entirely by billionaires and corporate lobbyists.
True. But that’s not explicitly what the story is about. The story is about the legal battle that ended up favoring the Georgia Democratic Party, and also talks about how Raffensperger’s team plans to file an appeal.
