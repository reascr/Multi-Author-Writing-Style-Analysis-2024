The right to bear has been considered to an individual right by the Supreme court as far back as the 1850's, if not earlier. 1886, Presser v Illionois held that the second was an individual right, and that 2A didn't refer to a right of militias. Even earlier, 1857s Dred Scott where the court alluded to the right to bear arms applied to all free men (but denied that Scott was a free man), and thus was an individual right. This view point was reaffirmed multiple times since. US v Miller which acknowledged that the unorganized militia to be made up of the the common citizen, making the second an individual right. Again in Duncan v Luisiana, they referred to the first 8 ammendments, including the 2nd, as "personal right." And again in US vs Verduga-Urquidez which held that "the people" in the second ammendment, along with the first and fourth, referred to "persons who are a part of the national community" with this country, ie individual citizens.
No. Does anyone understand how our court system works? This is just a district court ruling. This will only affect California. Maybe it will go up to the 9th, but I think the AG said they wouldn't defend this turd of a law.
