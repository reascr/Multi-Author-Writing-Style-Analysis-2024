As shots echoed through the broken halls of the Kremlin, Capt. Anatoly Alekseev of the 31st Heavy Infantry Battalion of the Ukrainian Expeditionary Force paused behind a pile of rubble. His company was tasked with the highly dangerous but symbolically important task of capturing the Kremlin building. Most of the Putinist die hards were already slain or commited suicide but one more door remained barricaded. A captured injured Russian Major was brought forward and told to persuade the holed up defenders to surrender. He reluctantly agreed, not out of patriotism but fear of being shot as a traitor to Putin. The Major walked forward with a white piece of tablecoth that the late Putin himself might have eaten on. The defenders let him through and there was a heated argument. After half an hour, the Major returned, his sullen look betrayed what he was about to say.
