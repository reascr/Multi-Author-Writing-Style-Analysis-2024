Damn right it is. I don’t understand how when I was in school in the 90’s we had a Black History course. We learned of the barbarity of slavery, we learned about Jim Crowe and the Civil Rights Movement. There were no objections from anybody and it was a very important part of our curriculum. Nowadays politicians want to hide the ugly side of our history because it makes them uncomfortable. This should not be. I hope DeSantis loses this case.

Absolutely true. I read that in Texas the Republicans revised the voting districts to make voting difficult for black people to vote. In some cases they would need to drive over an hour to cast a vote. That’s difficult enough for people who have a car. What about people who don’t drive? The elderly and disabled people would be very hard pressed to get out and cast a vote there. Its wrong from any angle one would approach the issue, yet they still did it.
