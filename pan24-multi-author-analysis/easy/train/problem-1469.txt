Interesting you bring up 2010, as leading up to that election congress had a supermajority/near-supermajority Dems, and \still\ would not rid themselves of the filibuster to get a public option into the ACA. We did get the ACA that we have, but it's weak compared to what could have been with the tools at their disposal. If I had to guess, I'd expect to see more things like that with another couple years of that sort of congress. Claiming the rules hold them back, when said rules are non-binding and could easily be changed with the composition of congress they had. If it's not the filibuster it's the Parliamentarian. If not the Parliamentarian, then the PAYGO rule. There are so many layers of rules creating inertia that the less willing among the Dems can lean on to hold back progress without necessarily looking bad, all the while keeping donors happy.
Exactly. You don’t get to refer to yourself as a “republican, but not a crazy one” anymore. There are good guys and there are Republicans. That’s a venn diagram where the circles never meet.
