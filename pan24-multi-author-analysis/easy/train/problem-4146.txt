Canada’a MAID program is a mess and no longer only applies to people who are terminally ill. There have been many, many dubious cases over the last few years including a mentally I’ll man who was euthanised for hearing loss and numerous people who have sought euthanasia because of poverty/being unable to afford medical treatment to manage chronic pain. Also numerous cases of healthcare providers suggesting MAID in incredibly inappropriate circumstances. Most prominent case was a para-Olympian who came forward that a veterans affairs caseworker had suggested MAID after she complained about her struggles getting a wheelchair ramp installed at her home. It seems as if this is basically being treated as a cost saving measure at this point and given the current track record it is very disturbing that the option is being expanded to children.
I agree 100%. I work in healthcare and have never understood why we keep some people alive. We spend lots of money and manpower to make people suffer longer...
