>The pretense that Georgia’s white voters were conducting a good-faith exercise in democracy is laid bare by looking at the behavior of the those who self-describe as “white born-again or evangelical Christians”. Georgia’s white Christians faced – and still face – a choice between a man who has zero qualifications for the office and a mountain of unchristian immorality and scandal on the one hand, and an incumbent senator who is a Christian minister and the successor to Martin Luther King Jr.
It's both. People who are authoritarian, conservative, regressive, etc often gravitate towards external justifications for their bad beliefs and people who otherwise wouldn't be regressive, authoritarian, etc are molded over time into being that way by the religious teachings and those in the religious community around them.
Glad they’re saying it. White people are the problem, this needs to be said repeatedly. The hypocrisy and moral bankruptcy of so many white people is sickening and despicable. I am white by the way.
