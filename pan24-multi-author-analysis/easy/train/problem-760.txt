i'm less certain about an indictment for J6 itself, unless it can be shown that former guy was in on a plan to storm the Capital and stop the senate from confirming the election results. yeah, i know, he said "stop the steal" and all that but he's like a mobster, he's good at signaling his intent while stopping short of saying specific action ("fat eddie's a problem for me, we gotta take care of the problem somehow, capiche?").
and yet, it's been about 2 years since the National Archives formally requested he return the Super Secret documents and about 6 month since he was found to be lying in writing to a court subpoena ("I don't have any more documents") and we don't even a formal indictment much less a day in court.
Absolutely they do. Well, Kushner not so much (barring bribery charges), but Trump's value is heavily tied to his brand and his ongoing ability to do business. If the NY lawsuit goes through, he cannot do business there. That'd be a major blow to his empire. As I said, that's one court case of many, most of which are moving forward fairly rapidly.
