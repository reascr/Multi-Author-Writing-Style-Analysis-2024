While winter tends to destroy armies if you invade the region from a more temperate place like Germany and France, the locals are a lot more used to fighting in it. Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Norway, Sweden, etc. are all pretty decent at winter warfare. Ukraine had 6 years of fighting Russia at the trenches along the borders with the DNR/LNR through all seasons. They should be fine. Honestly, the tempo might pick up once the hard frost freezes the mud. This is why everyone got nervous in December 2021 when it looked like the invasion was about to start, before Russia had to go help Kazakhstan. It’s also why a lot of people couldn’t understand why Russia was starting in late February unless they were hoping for a swift victory as mud season was starting again.
Ukrainian company. Mostly tactical style clothing, but they have good underlayers, fleeces and jackets. I have some shoes and shirts from them. Zelensky is frequently seen wearing their stuff. They also have an Amazon store if that's more convenient to you, but I actually got better prices for the stuff I bought by ordering directly from their US website.
