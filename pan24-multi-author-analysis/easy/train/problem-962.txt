Heinlein was also accused of being a racist which is somewhat unfair - a large part of that rap is down to JW Campbell (who really was very racist indeed) which resulted in stuff like “sixth column”. Part of it was the time and place he was from doing him absolutely no favours. To his credit Heinlein actually did his best later to try come at race from what he thought was a progressive angle … but he wasn’t remotely well equipped or informed enough for the task and got it rather badly wrong on more than one occasion. Points for good intentions but then promptly loses most of them for execution.
Exactly. He has zero interest in the long-term consequences of any of his actions. He is propping himself up as a Trump-replacement by staging whatever sick stunt will land Florida in national headlines this week as an “anti-woke” sanctuary. He will leave Florida a wreck, but he does not give two shits.
