This isn’t a game. It doesn’t matter at all if your neighbor who never votes reports to hate Republicans and support all sorts of wonderful progressive policies. They are part of the problem not as much a part of the problem is people who actively vote against those things, but a smaller and very tangible part of the problem of politics in the country.
Of course, most non-voters do not fall into that category, and instead are simply uninformed, and or uninterested people in the issues of governance. They are also part of the problem.
If a state is seeing record tax revenues that far exceeds its needs, only to propose more taxes, while simultaneously using taxes and regulations to pick winners and losers, even when those winners, like the Californian rail system are needlessly bureaucratic and expensive, per mile of rail compared to most other first world nations, then I'd define that as a form of economic statism.
