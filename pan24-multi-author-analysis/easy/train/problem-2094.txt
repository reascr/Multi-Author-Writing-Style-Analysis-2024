The wealthy just monetize and traumatize. They lie and they take actions that go against the people they claim they are there to lead. If we weren't in a lose lose situation with voting (in just about every country) than maybe we could do things better. Not to mention the wealthy withhold resources. Mismanage land. Mismanage everything really. With purpose. They make everything just good enough that we don't ask questions. Just look at the justice system. We are given just enough wins that that isn't on everyone's minds everyday. Biden Vs Trump. Pick your poison they say. How about no. Not even voting independent will do any good. Just voting with your lifestyle and getting others to do the same. I don't know if we have it in us to stand up and make change whatsoever, it seems like we will continue to be lead astray. Slowly giving away more rights and experiencing more artificial problems. Create a problem (real or not), address it and have everyone do whatever you say to combat it. Plus we could lose many lives trying to say enough is enough. It's like telling a killer that we know they are a killer. What do you expect? Are they just gonna put themselves in a jail cell? No. These guys are dangerous and they can just about read our damn minds with these phones attached to us. I'm just a 22 year old dude who was thrown into this world like everyone else but i want to share what i think is important. Agorism is something i found that may be helpful. Just an alternative to Crony Capitalism, communism etc.
Irreverent?? I thought it was an invitation that you and I have kids together. You threw me into a panic. I don’t have any kids either. I’M SUPPOSED TO HAVE TEN BY NOW???
