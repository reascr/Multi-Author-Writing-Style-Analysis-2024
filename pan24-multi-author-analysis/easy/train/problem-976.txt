You know, as someone who travels and goes to museums, I just don’t care about statues. It’s not like Ukrainians are going to forget they were starved and forced to be Soviets.
Removing monuments isn't removing history. Museums and books are how we record and learn and teach about history.
Statues are celebratory. Taking them down doesn't "remove parts of history," it just acknowledges that those parts of history aren't worth celebrating anymore. This guy wasn't Ukrainian. Was born far in the north and spent most of his life in St. Petersburg. So he's not even part of their history.
It’s always museums, never art museums specifically. I don’t want tho go through a history museum and see a wing dedicated to the statues. It’s boring. Someone has to pay for the museum. As an American, I don’t want my tax dollars going towards maintaining traitor museums, I assume it’s the same in the former communist countries. Sure, private parties can pay for them, but they won’t pay forever. They’ll eventually be sold for scrap or stay in storage anyway.
