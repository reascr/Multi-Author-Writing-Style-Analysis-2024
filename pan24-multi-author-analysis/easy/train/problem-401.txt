Texas would turn into a dumpster fire as soon as it seceded. Yes, our economy is booming, but how much of that is companies with a nationwide presence who are based in Texas for the tax benefits?
Texas would be better off than some of the red states (Mississippi), but it would be nowhere near the economic powerhouse it is now. Especially once educated Texans started fleeing in droves out of concern for what kind of shenanigans our state government would get up to without the feds to slap them on the nose and say, "No!".
ANY and EVERY person knowing this, while not demanding her resignation has lost ALL credibility both patriotically and politically.
Texas would likely go out on their own. They don't like welfare programs and social safety nets. I can't imagine that they would increase their support to poorer states like Mississippi or Alabama. Florida would probably do the same. Most of Florida will be under water soon anyway. Georgia might stay in the US along with Arizona and possibly North Carolina. The rich red states wouldn't want to burden themselves with whatever is left. They will build a wall to keep it Mississippians.
