China is literally able to lock people inside for three years now (including forcing old people into quarantines), why can't the CCP force the olds to get a decent vaccine forcefully. Seems bizarre.
1) the Chinese public lack any natural immunity, 2) the SinoVac vaccine is not particularly effective 3) Even now when the Chinese have an mRNA vaccine, there is a deep-rooted distrust of that technology 4) the elderly are the least likely to get vaccinated as they don't trust the government and 5) the coronavirus has evolved mutants that are even more transmissible.
2. Xi Jingping spent the past 2 years loudly bragging to the Chinese people and the rest of the world that the CCP was the best government in the world because it was the only country that could sustain a Zero Covid policy. Now they have to keep Zero Covid going or else admit that they aren't any better than the governments they were criticizing before, and they have decided saving face is worth shutting down entire cities for months.
