Fortunately itâ€™s very unlikely to happen. And if it did, I think the society would eat itself in short order tbh (but not before doing immense damage to itself and everyone else).
Interesting! I think there's an important difference between now and then. I think with more international influence we could see a new era of states like the Soviet era, with some of them getting friendly with the west. So we could see the Soviet era repeated, but this time the breakaway states are inside of Russia (in a few decades).
Respectfully speaking...no. you bring in someone with a different vision when you need to refresh Applebee's or GameStop. You don't hire someone to be the secretary of defense when they have zero experience in anything relating to military affairs, hardware, acquisitions or foreign policy. Their job is to dictate the future of the department of defense, align acquisitions with the expected conflicts in the coming decades (or ideally prevent them altogether through soft power, and ensure the manufacturing base is kept stable. Arguably a car company would benefit from an executive who's had experience as a mechanism because they understand the bottom line of repairability and what consumers value. Your metaphor is something more like what if a car company hired an executive who doesn't drive.
