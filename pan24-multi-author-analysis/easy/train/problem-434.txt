It's really nice to see corruption starts to get uncovered. It's a long way to transparent and fair "democracy". There's this german former minister Sigmar Gabriel who makes similar comments on how the conditions of the foreign workers have changed so much for the better. Always sounds so fishy...
Disingenuous people like yourself know fully well that it's infinitely easier to list dozens of examples of corruption from conservative politicians, but you're always so gleefully pointing out the evil "socialism" whenever you get a chance.
Lol. I love all the downvotes. That's exactly the attitude Europeans have towards the US. But when something like this happens, the comments are all, "look how well our democracy and criminal justice systems are functioning We are rooting out all the corruption with this arrest1!".
If you lived in a truly ‘capitalist’ society, your employer, who inevitably absolutely controls his entire field of industry because he has bought up the competition, will make you work as much as humanly possible, fire you on the spot if there is a cheaper replacement, and charge you the absolute maximum for every necessity, like food, water and shelter. And there would be absolutely mo recourse for you, because stopping capitalists from doing this would be a very socialist thing to do.
