This is outrageous. Where are the armed men who come in to take the protestors away? Where are they? This kind of behavior is never tolerated in Baraqua. You shout like that they put you in jail. Right away. No trial, no nothing. Journalists, we have a special jail for journalists. You are stealing: right to jail. You are playing music too loud: right to jail, right away. Driving too fast: jail. Slow: jail. You are charging too high prices for sweaters, glasses: you right to jail. You undercook fish? Believe it or not, jail. You overcook chicken, also jail. Undercook, overcook. You make an appointment with the dentist and you don't show up, believe it or not, jail, right away. We have the best patients in the world because of jail.
It’s already unconstitutional… First Amendment protects expression. What else would performing in drag be considered if not expression?
This is BLATANTLY unconstitutional. If this ends up appealed at the Supreme Court and they don't rule that it's unconstitutional, then it will be time for the people to rise up. Enabling shit like this is basically using the constitution as toilet paper.
