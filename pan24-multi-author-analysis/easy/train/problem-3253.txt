Everything I said is still true, and the article is operating on the assumption that the most positive decisions will be guaranteed to be made and therefore we should stop worrying. When has humanity ever collectively made the best decisions on a global level? I’m not saying it’s impossible, but it sounds like a hell of a lot of coping in that article without any actual data backing it up, just “trust us, we’ll solve it. Don’t worry”, giving people an excuse to just not make any lifestyle changes because “all those smart scientists will solve all our problems for us. We’ll be fine....”.
Some so-called renewable energy isn't really renewable energy. Ethanol, for instance, is using corn to create. And growing corn for ethanol is in direct competition with food production for humans. Agricultural land usage has already pushed our ecosystem to the brink of unrecoverable destruction. Ethanol production will become a major cause of deforestation and desertification in the near future. The only solution is to use less energy. There is no way out.
