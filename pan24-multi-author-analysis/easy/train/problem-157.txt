Term limits can just as easily artificially shorten the time that good leaders are in power. The problem isn't a lack of term limits, it is an underlying problem with how Israelis are voting. If Bibi were removed there would be nothing stopping the existing government from remaining in power.
Exactly. Why would the US hate an organization it can veto whenever it wants and can use to push its agenda whenever it wants?
Literally. They want the biggest asshole they can find at the top. The more people he insults or kills and the more corrupt shit he gets away with, the better.
While the sentiment of the comment is reasonable, its not accurate, Zionists and world powers tried to promote a Jewish state decades before the UN vote, it just gained more urgency post ww2 (the British themselves tried very hard to prevent Jews from immigrating to England), Israel and many many other states were 'founded' around that time and the next 20 years, most of them simply gaining independence from their imperialistic owners or new rulers, the UN grew up to 190+ countries/territories in a short span of time (not everyone was a member at the UN even as states early on).
Israel declared independence on its own a little less than 1 year after the partition plan as soon as the British left (and the Arab League and Commission declared war), no Arab state attempted to declare independence, they just didn't want the Jews to rule over them and have one (at least there), the Palestinians declared independence with no real substance 40 years later, in post- war 48 Egypt and Jordan simply took whatever they conquered.
Technically, the country wasn't created by the UN, a partition plan (for 2 countries, one Jewish and one 'Arab' and an international zone [Jerusalem]) was approved by the general assembly (back then it was only about 50 countries or so).
