Funny enough it’s not like there haven’t been weirder, more regressive, or more isolated members of the UN. Cambodia under Pol Pot is the peak example. They would execute anyone with glasses because they were trying to reinstate a pre industrial agrarian society yet somehow they still had diplomats, even after they had been overthrown and were hiding in the jungle. Rhodesia is also up there as one of the weirdest and most isolated. Given what’s happened to Zimbabwe and the fact that racism is a thing they’re mostly only brought up by their defenders who are, racist, and idiots. But Rhodesia was a comically dysfunctional and isolated country. They were to racist for even the UK or the US to support at a time when South Africa was a darling, they put the queen on the currency but wouldn’t even be let in their common wealth. They tried to sell their outright race war as anti communism but even Cold War US didn’t buy it. Their currency and economy was an absolute joke, their military and government would make WW2 Italians look functional. They recruited and “paid” (in their funny money) foreign fighters but said foreign fighters would just straight up lie about their experience so they just got the worlds weirdos.
Domestic politics seldom informs geopolitics. The allies of one government typically remain the allies of the next government, no matter our sympathies. It’s why the US remains close to the Saudis and Israelis whether we have Republicans or Democrats in charge. Geopolitics is more about strategy and long term relationships than about ideological sympathies.
