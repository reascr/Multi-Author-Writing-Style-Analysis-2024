He’s got the moonface (bloating and rounding of the face) that is typical of prednisone treatment for cancer patients. At the very least he is on prednisone, but maybe it’s for something else. But also you can fight cancer for a long ass time if you have access to the top treatment in your country. It can go away and come back — pretty common for people who die of cancer to have previously recovered from cancer and then 5 years later get it again, only more aggressive and resistant to treatment. I’m skeptical of the “dying soon” part, because he hasn’t gotten extremely frail. Everyone I’ve seen die of cancer was very frail and gaunt looking for the last 6 months to a year of their life.
You can live multiple years with terminal cancer. I’ve heard of people with 4 month diagnoses go on for years, while others don’t make it 2 months. If he’s getting the top treatment available, as is likely of the head of state, he might be terminal for years.
Obviously. If you were hoping I'd link to biopsy results with Putin's signature on it, you need to lower your expectations.
Precisely. When it comes to claims about global (and even domestic) public figures, I have to assume they're disinformation until proven otherwise.
