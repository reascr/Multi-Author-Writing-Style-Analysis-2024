The Sheriff (type of Judge in the Scottish legal system) in that case was an absolute roaster (type of asshole in Scottish parlance) and had previously done such amazing things as convict someone of a firearms offence for having a neon plastic waterpistol because only kids have a "legitimate reason" to have toys.
Wow, I'm from Vietnam. Had seen people saying things about the party but never seen them actually get arrested. surprised it's not a high profile person like Mai Kh√¥i. I do think we're getting more free (we ain't going in China's direction haha). The media is (weirdly) told to not talk bad about the party and talk bad about the party at the same time, confusing.
Egalitarianism means eliminating racial disparities in society. Progressives' position is that the pervasive and often subtle systemic problems need to be addressed in order to accomplish this. AA is a controversial active measure to try and compensate for racial disparities in education (rather than trying to tackle the overwhelming societal issues), but by its own nature aids certain lagging ethnicities at the cost of others that previously enjoyed advantages, like Asian Americans. It's hotly debated among progressive leaders and is by no means given monolithic support- by anyone.
