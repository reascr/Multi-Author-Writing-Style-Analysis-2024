But the Arizona Court of Appeals on Friday declined to repeal the 1864 law, which carries a sentence of two to five years in prison for anyone who assists in an abortion and provides no exceptions for rape or incest.
“An Arizona court has ruled that abortion doctors cannot be prosecuted under a pre-statehood law that criminalizes nearly all abortions yet was barred from being enforced for decades.
Still, the court said doctors can’t be prosecuted for performing abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy because other Arizona laws passed over the years allow them to perform the procedure, though non-doctors are still subject to be charged under the old law.
Yes. Look at the real Taliban. They waited 20 years on exile to come roaring back to do the same thing, and the people forgot how awful they were and let them waltz into Kabul. The GOP will do the same thing. They’ll be the “we’re not crazy anymore™️” GOP until the moment they see the opportunity to go back to the fascist well to propel them into power. And we’ll go right back to the overt racism, unqualified candidates constantly blowing racist dog whistles and all the while every republican furiously lining their pockets.
