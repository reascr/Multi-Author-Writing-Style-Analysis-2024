In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I get ya. I feel better about most libertarians because I can mostly talk policy (unless they are the extreme anarchist flavor of libertarianism). Most debates boil down my argument to “Government cannot solve all our problems, and nor should it, but there are many problems that only government can solve”. What problems that can be better solved by government is the subject of debate. Examples are regulating economies, providing education, military, etc.
You would be suprised. The libertarian Party loves the attention he is getting them now but he got barely any support from the party. In fact the right wing tried to vote None Of The Above to him running. And something not a lot of people know : There was an of the Libertarian Party this year.

Libertarians have historically tended be liberal on social and conservative on economics. However, many current libertarians are republican's who like to smoke weed ore republicans who just don't want to officially be a republican on paper.
