Ya I’m more upset about forcing Brazil to change its alcohol laws 8 years ago, but now they’re completely fine with disposing of FIFA’s “long standing tradition” of alcohol sales at the pitch!
I don’t think it’s completely apples to apples, but FIFA was threatening to pull out of Brazil for that very reason and Brazil had it for a very important reason to combat rampant hooliganism! If it was that important to sell in the stadiums there, FIFA should’ve never even considered a viable host.
Respectfully, no. The world does not need this lesson. The Qatari's made a bid for the tournament and as part of that bid agreed to allow sales of alcohol. 2 days before the event, they reneged on the agreement and FIFA was stuck. You can't lie, expect everyone to accept your lie, and then criticize them for calling B.S. This is a western sporting event. If you don't like that, start your own tournament. The Qataris lied through their teeth. I guess they shouldn't be trusted with things of international significance. Might as well have given the Cup to N. Korea.
