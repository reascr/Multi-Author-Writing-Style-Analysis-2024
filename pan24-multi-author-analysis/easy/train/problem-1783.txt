In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
They didn't. If you watch the pole cam video carefully, after they've beaten him comatose, one of the cops spots the pole camera and blinds it with his flashlight for a second. They didn't know it was there until that.
edit: and 1 more point I forgot to mention, I think it's important that all police go through periodic "breaks" after x amount of days or if they go through x threshold-tbd where officers are given an opportunity to step outside of that daily life for a minute, evaluate their performances with a psych team or something....all with the goal to analyze performance, improve outcomes, and most importantly- snap out of any developing prejudices these cops are naturally going to start developing when drugs are still illegal (that hoods everywhere take because life sucks) and our legislatures have essentially tasked them to hunt the hood for this, which just creates more racism, dead cops, and dead young black people. The class warfare + racism is baked into the program.
