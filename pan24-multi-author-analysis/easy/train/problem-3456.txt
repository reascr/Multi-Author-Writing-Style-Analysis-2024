The jobs I suggested are in demand but there aren't enough people to fulfill them. Rural Doctors, Fire Fighters, Paramedics, and educators in poor communities are hard to find because working in these careers is very stressful even if it is rewarding. If we didn't have a shortage of people then they wouldn't be on this list. Extending lifelines to people to help them rejoin their communities is the best way to prevent recidivism. It also boost the economy. Think of this as a combination rehabilitation, parole, and community service. We already provide education services to prisoners. I'm just saying give them an option to train for high demand, Low Applicant, community oriented careers in exchange for a shorter sentence. I think this would help enrich the lives of convicts but also help them reintegrate into their communities which should be the ultimate goal of any type of criminal justice system. Separate them from society and then rehabilitate them so they can be reintroduced and be productive members. This isn't always possible but that is why we have life sentences without parole.
