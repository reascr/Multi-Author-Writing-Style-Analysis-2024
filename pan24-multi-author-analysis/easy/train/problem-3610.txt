I think many people still view climate change as a future threat. It was really clear in our reporting that this is something happening right now. Of course that's very apparent in the city of , where we did a lot of our reporting in Senegal. But even in the strawberry fields of , farmers told us that the harvest used to begin in February and it now begins in December. Sneak preview: I just interviewed the author Jake Bittle about his forthcoming book, "The Great Displacement," for All Things Considered. He documents the lives of people displaced by climate change in the United States. And he found them all over the country...from droughts in Arizona to floods in Houston. This isn't a future threat; it's happening right now.
This is after the bulk of the article refers to the economic welfare of the Senegalese being harmed by overfishing, and them going to Europe to support their families; which does genuinely sound like economic migration -- there's no evidence linking overfishing to climate change (rather than simply boilerplate corruption and poor stewardship that we expect from poorer nations); and the argument about crop harvesting durations doesn't explain whether a changed harvest period is harming the Spanish farms, or wether the season is now longer or shorter.
Hi Ari! As an African living in the US I appreciate you guys reporting on this subject given the disproportionate effect climate change and migration are having in Africa and other non-western countries who did little to contribute to the problem.
A tech nerd! I defer to my producer and engineer colleagues on this one. When I'm in the field on my own, I usually use an RE-50 mic...but this is mostly because it's what NPR gave me at the very beginning of my career (more than 20 years ago), and it is indestructible. Also because I fear change.
