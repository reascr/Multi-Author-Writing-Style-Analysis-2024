In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Got it. You are not in Fl. Glad you see the danger of this guy. Keep spreading the word, he’s built an army down here and has corrupted the courts and state congress. He gets to the Oval Office. Nothing will stop him with the corrupted Supreme Court Trump seated.

Exactly. It’s all to urge people to go to private schools, make public schools less competitive over time, and then once they’re trashed, raise the costs of school tuition to maximize profit for the private school barons. While the buzzworthy news talks about banning literature in libraries or outing students, it’s all a shock and awe approach to sneaking the death of public schools past you while you are too outraged by whatever MTG tweeted today to notice.
