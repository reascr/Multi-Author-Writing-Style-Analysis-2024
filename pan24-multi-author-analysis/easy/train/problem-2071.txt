Because for the last few decades they've been able to obstruct the progress of a lot while pointing the finger at Democrats as "do nothing". They get to bow down to their lobbies, they get to prevent Democrats from doing anything and get to pretend they aren't responsible for the majority of bad shit in the country. It's a proven formula. The only time it backfired was in 22 because they accidentally did something they were only ever really giving lip service for by caving to the religious nuts and actually overturning Roe v Wade. The backlash of that was enough to hurt them. They are evil not dumb and know that if the majority of democratic platforms were nationally voted for individually with no party affiliation they'd overwhelmingly pass over and over but there's so many people who'd vote for someone who murdered their family over someone of the opposite party even if the opposite party is trying to help.
What's the point? It's dead on arrival in the Senate. All this does is send the message they want to cheat on their taxes without obstruction. Idiots. ðŸ˜•.

Irrelevant. The clowns in Congress will be sideshowed to the three-ring circus that will be front and center of the Republican Presidential primary and the election.
