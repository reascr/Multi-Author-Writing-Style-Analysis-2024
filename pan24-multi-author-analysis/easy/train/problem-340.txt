When the Feds brinf someone to trial they come with everything, the public has no idea how many people are coorperating with the feds, how many orher people the feds are looking into other than Trump, etc. Sometimes they let criminals remain free for awhile because there is the chance of getting information on unknown operations and individuals.
Honestly? No it’s not… if any of this was serious they would have done ANYTHING months ago when they had basically all the info they have now. Shit…. Or maybe WHEN IT HAPPENED lol.
There is multiple ongoing investigations, some of which could possibly impact the other investigations, the feds have such a high conviction rate because they msoe sure there is an airtight case before taking someone to trial.
Agreed. But doing it this way makes them unequivocally wrong. There could be a construed as a gray area if the investigations were merged between the legislative and executive branches. They don't need a favorable congress anymore because the House investigation is complete. Now it's in the DOJ's hands and Congress can't do shit about it.
