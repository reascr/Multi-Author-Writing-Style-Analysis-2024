No, I think he invaded because biden is weak and we are overstretched. We have US troops being deployed in Poland and Eastern Europe, for Ukraine which is NOT a geopolitical priority of the U.S. We also botch our Afghan withdrawal, are being pressed by the Chinese in the South China Sea, have North Korea beginning to renew agression, have further alienated our Saudi Allie’s and have renewed deployments in Africa. That plus the economic basket case is all on Biden. Trump wouldn’t have pushed us into the Ukraine bullshit, and would have concentrated on fixing our economy and keeping our fuel prices as low as possible. We are in a situation where one misstep gets us into a major war. That’s all Biden.
Nuclear war is a whole different ballgame, but in terms of a conventional war, I don't see WW3 happening simply owing to the fact that it isn't clear how you could plausibly divide the world powers into two sides with military parity. With Russia's disaster in Ukraine, Iran's current state of instability, and the military investment happening in European NATO nations right now, I don't see any realistic alliance that could project power against the NATO-aligned world.
Why? Why are we defending Saudi Arabia when they funded 9/11 and increase oil prices to help Russia? Not to mention they murdered Jamal Khashoggi.
