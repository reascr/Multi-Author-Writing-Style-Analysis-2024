Who kept farting on live TV during the voter fraud hearings, tried to have sex with a girl he thought was 15, scheduled a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping where he had a very bizarre meltdown that not even South Park or Saturday Night Live could make up, has been divorced 3 times with one of those marriages being to his second cousin for 14 years and another ending after allegations that he was sleeping with a staffer (which he denied, and then married said staffer after the divorce was finalized), started all the weird Hunter Biden laptop conspiracy nonsense, made extremely bizarre references to the movie My Cousin Vinny at a press conference, and there's probably a ton that I've forgotten about because it all got very difficult to keep track of anymore...
Yes. If something actually comes of this, we really need to look into every single person who enabled him. Do not let Trump be the scapegoat here. He committed these crimes, yes, but he wasn't alone.
No, no, no, holding REPUBLICANS accountable is equivalent to authoritarianism. But Dems are so terrible they have to be held accountable for things they've never done but Republicans think they're doing! /s.
