It’s on them. Historically people have literally fought and died for the right to vote so shitty Americans can do nothing and not participate in the process. Then they have the audacity to walk out en masse. The highest level of voter REGISTRATION not votes in any Florida district for ages 18 is only 30 percent. They should be shamed and ashamed of themselves for allowing this to happen. It’s literally on them to vote. Who should we blame for 18 year olds who are mad that the old racists are in charge in Florida? It’s not like voting is a secret. It’s not like they didn’t have to take a civics class in school. What’s the excuse for 70 percent of them in the highest registered district in Florida to not participate. They are old enough to die for the country but too young to be held accountable to vote? That’s dumb. I joined the Army at 17 and voted at 18. I also can complaint about the shitty things done by those I did and didn’t elect because I vote. But do tell about how they are too young to participate….
