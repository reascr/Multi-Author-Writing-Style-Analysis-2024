The entire country overall claims mostly Christian, but even so— the point stands. Religion and sexual abuse go hand and hand. It’s a tale as old as time.
Probably the USA numbers of teen pregnancies are the entire population, whereas the Tanzania numbers are only people in primary or secondary school maybe even in particular areas only. In the USA, the number of children in schools is probably almost the same number as children at all, the number of children not in school is nonzero but small. In Tanzania, it might not be true. If most of their school-aged people are in fact NOT in school (as might be likely with country of PPP GDP \= $3300) that might explain the disparity in rates. There is probably a reporting disparity as well; in the US almost every single birth of this nature is going to be recorded, maybe not so much in Tanzania.
It's kind of hard to believe that USA teen pregnancy rate is astronomically higher than Tanzania, and you kind of know that Tanzania's population is going to skew younger than USA population which should further skew the numbers.
