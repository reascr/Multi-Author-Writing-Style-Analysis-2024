Not only is this part downright absurd, but claiming that alcoholism negatively affects women's fertility more is just ignorant. Sperm is ridiculously fragile compared to eggs. Thanks to sexism, science has focused so much on the effect age has on women's fertility while next to zero focus on what affects men's fertility until very recently, assuming that since men can pretty much pump out sperm 24/7, it can't be much of an issue. Turns out - nope... Sperm quality is much more affected by environmental factors. Men worldwide are experiencing massive reduction in testosterone levels and sperm quality while women have experienced no equivalent effects on their fertility (aside from conditions like PCOS that are increasing because of rising obesity). It's not women who have to worry about not taking hot baths or keeping a laptop on their lap before they start trying for kids, lol. If he's so concerned about health-related low fertility rates, maybe he should take a look at men first...
Also by selling religious-nationalistic bullshit to old people and by having shitty neoliberal opposition.
Same. I'd probably need to adopt but, that was always the way that I was leaning ever since hearing the words 'mucus plug' and not liking pain but who can afford THAT?!
