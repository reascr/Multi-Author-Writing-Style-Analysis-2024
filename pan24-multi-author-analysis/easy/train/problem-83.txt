You're probably not old enough to remember the the 1995 then. Over six thousand people died. Many of them trapped in or under their homes as large fires roared through the city. Buildings that had shifted off their foundations and collapsed ones blocked many roads preventing the fire trucks from getting through. A large segment of the expressway collapsed. Delaying aid from nearby Osaka, where I was, as well. A man made island in Kobe suffered liquefaction. The first time I'd ever heard the word and learned such a thing was possible.
Not saying this is related to this particular case, but climate change — melting polar ice, to be specific — has most likely an influence on volcanic and tectonic activities, due to all the redistributed pressure (high pressure from two points eases and the weight is evenly distributed when entering the sea).
No. That's the speed of the tsunami out at sea where it's height is only a few feet or even inches and it's wavelenh is dozens or hundreds of miles.
At shore it's compressed, slows, down, and grows in height as that wave that used to be a few inches tall but hundreds of miles long is now 1/100th the width, but 100x the height.
