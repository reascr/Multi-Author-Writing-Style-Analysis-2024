Well technically the Putin law never said anything about calling the armed conflict a war, since Russian media have called it this since 2014 but of course referring to it as a civil war, it merely prescribed not calling it a war between states and thus always referring to it as a special military operation within an already ongoing civil war. By this law Putin take away Russian guilt of starting it and also makes certain that the war is not a war against Ukraine, rather it's a military operation in order to help one side of the civil war against the (in their eyes) illegitimate regime in Kiev, much like various foreign interventions inside the Syrian civil war (Russia, Iran, Turkey, USA & NATO). During interventions inside Syria no party referred to their intervention as starting a war, rather it was a military intervention or a military operation against certain elements (ISIS, Assad, terrorists etc...) and it's in this light Putin is trying to frame the war in Ukraine.
Amen. Fuck Putin etc but I'm so sick and tired of these absolutely beaten to death "jokes". It's always the same variation between the same 4-5 words and they always have hundreds of upvotes. Like how...I feel like I'm going insane. All of this belongs in r/comedycemetery.
