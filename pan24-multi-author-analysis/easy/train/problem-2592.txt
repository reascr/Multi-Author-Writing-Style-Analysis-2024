I have no idea what kind of rabbit they are going to pull out of their hats to fix this, but there isn't enough right now to keep anyone worth a damn because who wants to work 15 hours days? "OH and hey, when you're done doing this here, you're going to have to go across town and work till 10 pm because they had 8 sick calls.".
If you live in Canada the plan is clearly to import hordes of third world immigrants, “temporary foreign workers”, and “international students”, pay them bare survival wages, house them 4 to a bedroom, and exploit them to death with the threat of deportation to keep them powerless.
I loved this job before covid. My station manager has basically tanked his own career because he has told his bosses to piss off and leave our station alone. (We are the only station that isn't under water right now.) I hope for the sake of this wonderful service that has been serving the public that they pull their heads out of their asses, but my hope is dwindling. Please, be patient with your delivery services. It's not just my company. It's all of us. Amazon can't even handle their volume and yet they expect us to do the impossible. God speed, everyone.
It sucks because I'm a son of 2 immigrant parents and they have some remnants of that type of attitude, luckily they immigrated during a time where Canada didn't take advantage of them as they do now and it was an actual country of opportunity.
