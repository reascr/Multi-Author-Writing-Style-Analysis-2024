border will be NATO. I guess they can try to bully azerbaijan, but, seem to be deterred from trying this in the last few years. If they go after Georgia it would get western weapons to defeat them. I doubt China would permit them to bully kazakhstan or north korea. So, they are outclassed by all neighbors.

But that isn't military funding, it's humanitarian funding. Rather big difference. Did you forget the floods and earthquakes?

Oh wait, no you didn't. In fact, you didn't even mention the words 'Mumbai' or the numbers '11' or '27'.
