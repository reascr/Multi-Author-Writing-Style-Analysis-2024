National popular vote determines nothing (I should have been clearer, I'll edit). State level popular vote numbers do, but looking at national totals is meaningless in the system we have in place today.
But it isn't based on the national popular vote, which is where that 3,000,000 number comes from, it's from a bunch of separate state-level popular votes. We can argue that the electoral college is unfair (no argument here), but our system of government is based on established laws and those say that Trump was the legitimate winner of the 2016 election. Yes it was a disaster and yes we as voters should do better selecting our government officials, but until we live in that world, or voter turnout isn't so dismal, thinking that the national numbers tell us anything meaningful is a mistake. The national numbers are the result of campaigns that don't care about the national numbers.
