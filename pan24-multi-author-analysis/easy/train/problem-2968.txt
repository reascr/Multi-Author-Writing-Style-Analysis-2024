There are far too many people that don't want to admit someone they admire(d) is actually problematic. Anyone who enjoys his music needs to learn to separate the art from the artist. I turn up Wango Tango every time it comes on the radio but I also acknowledge that Ted Nugent is a POS. I won't be buying his albums, I won't buy his shirts, I'm never going to attend one of his concerts, but I genuinely enjoy a few of his songs and I won't let him take that away from me. If we stopped enjoying art by every artist that's problematic so little of it would be left. Does Kevin Spacey's history make Se7en a bad movie?Does Edgar Allen Poe marrying his 13 year old cousin make his work less important? What about so many rock bands having teenage groupies? Despite Kanye's absolutely insane behavior his music was/is important to a lot of people and that won't change but he shouldn't get a pass either. Enjoy that album you already own, turn up the radio when your favorite song comes on, don't be afraid to rock that hoodie you've had since high school but his new music and merch? Let that shit rot in a dollar store bin before you give him another cent. Don't go to his shows. Don't give Kanye your attention now. Whatever he meant to someone 5, 10, 15 years ago he's not that guy anymore or at least not the guy he fooled people into thinking he was.
