Anyone who thinks I'm being remotely hyperbolic about this doesn't even stop to consider that we as a society have already accepted and glossed over that the cops keep a permanent record of innocent people who at one point or another may have been suspected of a crime. Anyone who's ever been a suspect, innocent or otherwise, who has their fingerprints and DNA in the system, is checked EVERY time they run crime scene prints and DNA. There is NO mechanism for a wrongly accused person to have their data removed from the system and there is NO national movement to prevent cops from holding onto people's data after they've been cleared of wrongdoing or after they've served their time in prison.
Republicans small government! Too small to regulate businesses from toxic waste and too small to stop school shootings..
Seriously! When I was young, my period cycle was about 90 days. Sometimes 120. I envisioned my ovaries being some sort of Chip and Dale characters who are politely waiting for the other ovary to ovulate first.
