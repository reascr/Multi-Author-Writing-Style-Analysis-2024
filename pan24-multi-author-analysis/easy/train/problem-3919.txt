Because, in 2016, Trump was something fresh and new. They same isn't really true this time. Human beings tend to get bored. Imagine a debate with DeSantis...Trump will spend like half the time talking about how he actually won in 2020; by then (4 years after the fact), even some Rs will probably be tired of this and want him to move on. You can already kind of see it happening with some of them and I think we'll see the R primary polls start to shift as we get closer (assuming DeSantis doesn't chicken out and bend the knee early on).
This is possible, but it seems like DeSantis is ambitious, and there are signs that he could actually win the primary if he runs (he's rising in the polls over time and appears to be seen by large portions of the R base as the future of the party); I'm sure he sees this himself and might want to take his chances. Also, for both parties, the person who's the front-runner years before the election usually isn't the nominee. DeSantis would be a fool not to take his chances; he'd probably have a better shot at winning in '24 than Trump would (since he doesn't have an age problem, hasn't already lost to Biden, has R donors itching to support him, and doesn't have a mountain of legal issues).
5. Either the conservative movement remains fractured and powerless, or they reform with at least some moderates making a conservative party that isn't 100% batshit insane.
