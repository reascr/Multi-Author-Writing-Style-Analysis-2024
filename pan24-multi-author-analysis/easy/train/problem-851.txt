Seems like you got to the point of an opioid crisis without it being legal, so it seems like the people who want to do these drugs are already finding them. The argument behind legalisation and increasing access in this manner is that the worst outcome from drug abuse is overdose deaths. The main cause of those deaths is drugs that are laced with another drug like fentanyl, or the fact that there is a no consistency in the purity of the drugs they consume so even if they take the same amount they usually use, there's always the risk that it's an especially pure batch that they got this time and they could still overdose from the same amount they normally consume. The model also assumes that people who aren't users of heroin or other hard drugs, aren't going to just start using because it's available. If you were walking down the street and could buy heroin, would you? I know I wouldn't knowing the facts about use, and that's likely true for the majority of the population. Anyways, there's no way to know yet how effective this model will be because no one has really tried it but I think it's safe to say there's a serious problem at this time in history, and if we keep trying the same solutions we've been trying for the last 50 years were just going to get the same results.
This is the same guy/people? Those shops were great! Always good quality and prices and usually a decent variety.
