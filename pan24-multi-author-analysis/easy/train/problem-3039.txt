Look at most democracy’s around the world. A 60% threshold doesn’t exist to pass most legislation. The bills that were passed this cycle were inconsequential. basic maintenance stuff. Nothing that actually solves the problems this country is facing. If a political party wins an election, they should be able to pass legislation they ran on like any other major country. This obsession this country has with “bipartisanship” is unheard of elsewhere. I voted for the democrats, they won, I don’t want republican legislation passed. just because something is called bipartisan doesn’t make it good, in fact the only things that get called bipartisan and pass are pro corporations. you’re obsession with bipartisanship shows me your age. No one under 50 cares about that shit. I want stuff to get solved. I don’t want to live in some fantasy land where you believe both parties are getting along while everything decays around us. im glad your life doesn’t rely on these issues being solved, others don’t have that luxury.
