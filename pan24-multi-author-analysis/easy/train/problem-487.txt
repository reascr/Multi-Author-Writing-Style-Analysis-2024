Sure, and this won't fix stuff like cumulative brain and lung damage. Silicon dioxide enters the lung and never leaves, eventually leading to lung cancer, and it's also possible that other stuff never leaves either. Eventually we'll need full lung transplants available. Head trauma is also cumulative, each concussion you have adds more damage to what you've already taken, dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases will need to be urgently addressed. These are just examples, simply not dying and having great skin is only the first step in a long process.
It's not hypothetical immortality, it's factual cellular replication. Your previous comment makes no sense.
It is no different than the boat scene in the dark knight, except that for every 20 years or so that you exist after your 20s or 30s, you are robbing of the possibility of life of 1 or more people who would have been born, and even if you are one of those "I don't wanna have children" type people, your existence alone consumes resources that won't be available for other peoples descendants, it's fine if your life is normal, but that quickly starts to stack up if suddenly everyone is like that.
