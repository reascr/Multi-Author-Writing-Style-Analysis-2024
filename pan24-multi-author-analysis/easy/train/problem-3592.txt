Except for him being in the line of succession, Trump as speaker would be a hoot. Unlike the office of the president where he was largely able to golf, sit in the residence and watch tv, or call into cable tv shows, and call it “work”; the speaker requires a knowledge of what is in the contents of bills, of parliamentary rules, and a level of being present to whip votes that Trump is utterly incapable of. Trump as speaker would even more expose him as the fraud he is. That being said, having him in the line of succession does scare the living daylights out of me - I firmly believe that if the speakership wasn’t held by a Democrat, the Jan 6 insurrection may well have succeeded by plan b of ensuring no one was certified and letting the presidency pass through the line of succession.
Sorry. This is the long term effects of that strategy. The group of Southern Dems who evolved into the modern Republican Party always had this internal friction. They've just been able to keep it leashed for almost six decades. After TFG, they've slipped the collar and dug under the fence.
