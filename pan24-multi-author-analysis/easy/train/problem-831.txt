In many cases, the assets are money, contracts, etc. The leases on facilities, the equipment owned is usually small potatoes. For those who own real estate assets, I don't believe that they have to sell or walk away from those, but the businesses they operate within them are expected to be shuttered until the sanctions are removed.
exactly. it's a British report primarily focused on British companies. it isn't that British companies are doing this more than other countries, it's that the other countries aren't even checking.
Exactly. Or, Putin also offers companies that defy the sanctions guarantees, lucrative contracts, the ability to monopolize a sector since all of their competitors left.
No. Wait. My annual compensation, but I can't say that. Hmmm...let me think. IT'S FOR THE CHILDREN! Yeah, that's the ticket.
Much of this is due to the consequences for staying being weak, lame fines or slaps on the wrist sanctions are easily outweighed by the continued revenues from operating, or Putin my offer incentives to counter penalties like lucrative contracts, or preventing the competition from returning if they stay, giving them a monopoly, and in some cases I suspect that these companies don't want to completely shut down and leave if their competitors aren't also going to do so as it leaves them at a huge disadvantage once they're able to operate in country again.
