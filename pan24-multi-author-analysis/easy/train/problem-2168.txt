Oh I'm not talking about Scotland leaving the UK. I'm talking about Scotland potentially joining the EU.
Spain will never allow Scotland to join the EU unless the process is completed in full accordance with UK law. They're quite clear and on the record with this stance.
> After the rejection of independence in the 1987 referendum and the subsequent Ouvéa cave hostage taking in April and May 1988, the Matignon Agreements signed in June 1988 (and approved in a France-wide referendum) provided for another referendum in the territory in 1998. The Nouméa Accord was subsequently agreed on 5 May 1998. Under the accord, two more referendum votes, on whether to remain a special collectivity of France or become an independent state, have been held. One was held in 2018, and the second was held in 2020. In both votes a majority chose to remain French. The Nouméa Accord permitted a final referendum to be held, voted for by the Congress of New Caledonia. It was held December 2021 and overwhelmingly rejected independence.
This is just made up. If anything member states like Spain will veto Scotland’s application as it would mean they’ll face the breakup of their country. Secondly, the notion that Scotland would be able to leave the union with all of the resources you’re talking about is just ridiculous; this country as a union has made plans and decisions based on the current situation so in what fantasy land would the UK give that up and cripple itself?! Lastly, what happens when pro-uk places like Skye want to stay British? Are they forced to leave?
