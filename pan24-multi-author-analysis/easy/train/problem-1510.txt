Perhaps it was entertaining to some, but I suspect it would be described a little differently by those who were being snatched off the streets by ICE, or having roving gangs of white supremacists attacking their downtowns (among a multitude of other heinous acts perpetrated or otherwise encouraged by Trump).
Wait. This is news? Witness the inanity of our free press that could cover what happened to cause the Saudis to give Jared Kushner $2b and pay millions of dollars to Trump golf courses. No, let’s use this sacred right to monitor a school yard name calling contest. Shame.
DeSantis is an authoritarian. He’s Deloris Umbridge trying to expel you from school, and he’s a party-pooper because authoritarians are no fun. But Trump? He’s an entertainer, and he’s good at it. His rallies are experiences. You go for the vibe, and you stay because you like him.
