^1 Rant for the cognoscenti: It's not like I'm opposed to vote splitting much less mixed member proportional voting, I'm even in favour of it, but you need to rectify the mathematical problems that arise when you combine it with per-state electoral lists. This whole "depending on how the results are your vote can act contrary to your intent" thing needs to be abolished in principle, not some wishy-washy "As long as the chance of it happening aren't wide-spread it's fine" thing. Some drastic change is going to be needed (also when it comes to size-explosion of the parliament), either by abolishing split voting, per-state lists, or the guarantee that a FPTP win actually nets you a seat. All in all the last one is actually the sanest IMO because, \drumroll\, depending on how the results are it won't ever happen, and if it happens, the seat can go to a very marginal constitutent's 2nd placed. It's a bit of a gamble but coin flips already exist in the case of candidates getting exactly the same number of votes, this isn't much off, and the ultimately more important proportional vote is unaffected.
Good start. I would also really like to see the responsibility of voting on SCOTUS stripped from Congress and moved to the people. That and expansion.
