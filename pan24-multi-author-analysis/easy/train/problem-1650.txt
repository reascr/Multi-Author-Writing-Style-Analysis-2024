A while back it was litter boxes in schools, then when I told him it was made up it was crt, which I then told doesn't get taught anywhere except for certain programs in college. Then it was smut books in libraries, which I told him libraries being attacked aren't even carrying those books. Then it was trans kids wanting to play sports, and I asked him if he knows of any example of a trans kid playing sports and beating everyone else and he couldn't come up with a si gle instance. Then it was the FBI raiding Mar a Lago. Which I reminded him republicans have been chanting lock her up for 5 years. Then it was FTX donating money to Democrats, but when I showed him FTX also donated to Republicans, he never brought it up again. Now, a man who said he wanted to retire and move to Trump Tower, hates Trump. Coincidentally the day after Fox News criticized Trump for picking on Ron DeSantis.
Exactly. People always bring up his bipolar but it’s literally nothing to do with his actions. He is responsible for everything he does and says. Bipolar doesn’t make you a piece of shit.
