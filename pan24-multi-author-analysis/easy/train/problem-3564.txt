If you want some examples of purges--a young John Boehner helped reverse-lobby the US Chamber of Commerce to oppose Clinton's health care reform legislation in the 1990's, George W. Bush spread racist and despicable lies about John McCain's non-White adopted child in the 2000 GOP Presidential primaries, Olympia Snowe & Richard Lugar retired or were primaries for being bipartisan in the Obama era, and during the Trump or post-Trump era Jeff Flake, Liz Cheney, and Adam Kinzinger were purged by Trump or his cronies.
Yes. And they will. After the RBG mess, on the heels of grinding Obamas appointment to a halt, its just time to assume the GOP will already take any steps necessary. We should be doing the exact same thing.
I think the strategy of the right is to disregard federal law, divide the US into feifdoms, brand it as "freedom", while operating as anything but, and just kind of making such a mess of things that we only bother with federalism insomuch as it largely preserves our influence on the world stage, but disregards the constitution by sacrificing individual rights at the alter of "state's rights"...
