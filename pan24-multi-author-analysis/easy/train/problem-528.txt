AND because like you put it "something Russians call you before stabbing you" to paraphrase it.... I am not ashamed to be a Slav, I thrived and welcomed how with other Slavic people's I could find a common ground and experiences (not knowing their specific language). In many ways I am glad and happy for the progress OTHER Slavs than Russia s made and I like to celebrate them.
(Being a Slav supporter in the sense that I want us all to prosper and cooperate, the Baltics feel like cousins).
It diverged because I mentioned Romania and Moldova's relationship becoming as strong as the Baltics have.
At the very least it's not unlikely Romania and Moldova would become more tied just on the basis on mutual cooperation besides on that EU countries do to one another.. bit like how the Baltics support one another more closely.
Fascinating. I speak some French and Spanish, and looking at the words, they “look” Latin-ish but I’m getting tripped up on some of the accents on the letters. Might be easier for me to get by listening instead of reading.
