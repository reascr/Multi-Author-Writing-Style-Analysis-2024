Fortunately? Are you on the pipe?? These people are pure evil. Effective? AT what, exactly? 45 never did a blessed thing to improve the lives of any, but he certainly made life difficult for thousands. He's just a little Hitler. He should end up the same way, with the trophy wife right along side. They disgust me, the entire 45-crime family.

Republicans love DeSantis. He's easily the second most popular Republican next to Trump and he has the support of the establishment and the Trump wing of the party although going against Trump might change that.
