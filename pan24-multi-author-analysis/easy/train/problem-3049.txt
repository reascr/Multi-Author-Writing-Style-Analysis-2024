In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Unforgivable. Well Unless you gain power again. Then its "please let me ride your coattails daddy Trump!".
How very convenient that the limit for individual purchases was set just below the IRS threshold for mandatory reporting and that he took payment in crypto circumventing the government's ability to identify the buyers.
Went to a bar last night in Northwest Phx. And the band actually played the National Anthem on violin (not sung) and the whole bar (probably 1000 people) stopped, except me, to stare at a flag. Dude stopped me from talking to tell me that I need to (must) salute the flag. Felt like something straight out of NKorea. Fucking bizarre. When did we “have to” stop socializing and having fun to “salute” the flag? This getting out of fucking hand.
