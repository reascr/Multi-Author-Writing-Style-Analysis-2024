Really there's only two positions one can have on this debate. One is an extremist level stance of religious faith to a point where you are willing to unilaterally oppress an nation, or state of that nation, to your own, skewed perception of religious faith. This is bad, really bad, and something even the founding fathers specifically fought against. The other is taking the position of a small, immature child and playing the opposites game. This is also really bad. You basically defecate on the health and safety of your represented public for petty, personal goals.

Absolutely. Just like how we see many younger gens making plans to avoid certain states like Texas and Florida, I'm sure if we see policies like this stick then South Dakota will be added to the list. I know I take into consideration the political environment of a state before even considering job opportunities.
