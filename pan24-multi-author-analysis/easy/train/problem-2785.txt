I hate to agree with Mike Lindell but how did this happen? Like how did he win in Miami-Dade county? Is there any good articles breaking down why this is so much more lopsided than in 2018. It was close in 2018 and the Dem challenger Andrew Gillum is a black candidate with little name recognition. Dems had the former governor running with huge name recognition in 2022. But he gets smashed. I also read that the Demmings/Rubio race might be tight a couple weeks before the election and Little Marco decimated her. And then trump claims he sent down the DOJ in 2018 to help DeSantis. Dems in the state should be talking about this every day and there should be subpoenas flying and start the process of bringing DeSantis to justice now for all the shady shit you know he's doing. His legal challenges based on bussing migrants and the COVID coverup should be a top priority now for Dems because the only way we get accountability is by holding these idiots to the fire early and often. Dems really seem rudderless in Florida and it's so shocking how quickly it's gone to shit down there. They were a solid purple state in 04 and 08. That's not that long ago and DeSantis has national juice but he must be really doing something alright in the state of he gets those numbers.

Seriously. I think it's all just a scam. Just watch any video where he is giving an interview. It's surrounded by banner ads for his pillows. It's just a commercial pretending to be a news segment.
