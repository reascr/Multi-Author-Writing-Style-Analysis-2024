Maybe I'm being uncharitable, but I'm pretty sure that the Taliban insurgency wouldn't have succeeded with the support of only 3% of the male population and 2% of the female population.
Like what? Realistically? They legitimately had 20 years to make a decision that they no longer wanted these Taliban fucks to rule them. Yes, there were some corrupt officials, but guess what? Ukraine had corrupt officials too, working in tandem with Russia. They have been consistently rooted out and exposed over the past couple of years. Some since 2014 but many in just this 1 year of partial occupation by Russia. It wasn't just the military pushing out Russia from it's initial attacks to topple their country. It was civilians with moltovs and a fuckload of volunteers. Ukraine is just our most recent example of people being fed up and doing something about oppression. They fought hard in 2012-2013 to topple the puppet regime that Russia had installed, they fought hard when invaded in 2014, and they're fighting even harder now with western assistance.
