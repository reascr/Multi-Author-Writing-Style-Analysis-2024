If police reform is successful and efforts to root out domestic terrorism bear fruit first, thats one thing. But dismissing the inherent contradiction of passing off the decision of who is permitted to bear arms to the police beforehandâ€¦ that is beyond foolish.
Factually incorrect. Back in the 1930s, you could mail order machine guns straight to your house for only a couple hundred dollars. To suggest that firearms manufacturers lobbied for the machine gun ban is a ridiculous. The origins of gun control are racist in nature. Recently NY even cited such recist laws as justification of their unconstitutional carry bill they passed in retaliation of the Bruen decision.
How is it dumb? Saying that doesnt make it so. The problem with may issue systems is that you are entirely reliant on the discretion of a deeply flawed organization which is entirely designed to avoid accountability. This isnt a minor point.
