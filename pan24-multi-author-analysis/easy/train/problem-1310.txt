Actually, apart from the occupation, Germany was treated very forgivingly. Even a lot of politicians who did bad shit during their nazi times remained for decades in politics, simply because there were no immediate replacements available. And there were no programs to confront People with what they did apart from school. Were there sometimes where still questionable teachers around, so that worked more so and so. A lot of it comes rather down to Information becoming Public knowledge. Most People had only vague knowledge about what happened in the concentration camps for example. So it was mostly Free flow of Information afterwards. Also the US footed the bill for us, including basically reparations as well. So Germany got a really mild Deal. We were pretty much mostly forgiven and almost treated as a Victim.
Exactly. No more trades and reparations sounds fair from a neutral perspective. But the Russian population won't just sit around while they live in misery because "their country deserves it".
