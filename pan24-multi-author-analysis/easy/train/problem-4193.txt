So in theory the government could ban every single type of armament except say knives, and you'd still have the right to bear arms. Nothing in there prevents the government from determining the scope or range of weapons we can own. So far most guns are within the goalposts, but nothing stops a future liberal court from narrowing those goalposts further leaving guns on the outside. Like any of our rights that are not explicitly spelled out in the Constitution, which few are since the world has changed a little bit in the last 250 years, they are up for grabs so long as you stack the court in the way your agenda dictates. SCOTUS has said as much when they ruled on the Dobbs.
The second Militia Act provided for conscription and the self-provided arms and equipment requirements, and it wasn't until the 1808 Act that that requirement was dropped in lieu of government provided equipment, and by the last Militia Act 100 years later which established the National Guard, actual militias had practically disappeared, with what was left of them folding into the NG or local police departments.
Yep. I just did a full text search on the Constitution and neither guns nor firearms were in there. Who knew guns were in the Constitution as much as abortions?
