So ignorant…. Here I thought women got the right to vote by simultaneously working with state legislatures to grant suffrage whilst also campaigning for a National amendment… apparently they broke a bunch of things and got their way.
3.) It is fairly well-known that the ultra wealthy use expensive fine art to obfuscate, launder, and transfer wealth. It's especially useful for moving money from one country to another without paying currency exchange fees. Want to spend $100M on a chateau in France but they only accept Euros? Why transfer $100M, pay a huge fee, then pay taxes on the real estate sale when you can buy a painting for USD, carry the certificate of provenance across the border while the painting never leaves the museum it's on loan to, then sell it in France for enough Euros to buy the chateau. Presumably your accountant will take care of those taxes but you avoided the exchange fee. Oh but what about taxes on the sale of the artwork? Your accountant will handle that too. Why wouldn't your accountant handle the exchange fees? Because the banks want their cut.
