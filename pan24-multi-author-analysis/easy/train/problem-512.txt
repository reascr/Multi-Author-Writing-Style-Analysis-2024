I know you said rhetorical question, but his base of voters are the easier marks. They are being offered to buy a "Golden Ticket" from something they most likely don't understand in the first place, and when 2-3 weeks goes by and they don't receive the physical trading card, that they most likely thought they were getting, to show their family and friends, there will be a mass amount of phone calls to the company looking for them.
And there it is. There are like 5+ highly upvoted threads laughing at how stupid these NFTs are, but they clearly fulfilled their intended purpose. Within a few hours.
I'm hoping beyond hope, that someone at the NFT company got lucky enough to get in Trump's ear, sold him a bunch magic bean stories about how important and valuable NFT's are, how he should enter the market and they will help him, and at the end of the day fuck him out of a bunch of money, and Trump who is so stubborn and prideful will not have the balls to admit to himself or anybody else that he got conned.
