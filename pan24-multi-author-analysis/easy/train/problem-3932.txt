The value in Twitter is getting info or communication directly from the smartest people alive instead of having it filtered through media or governments. Want to know what the worlds top economists personal opinions on the recession are? Do you want to know facts from climate scientists themselves or have it filtered through Newsweek? Do you want to know what's happening inside your state legislature as it happens, well your local news reporter is there and you can follow along as it happens. These things don't happen on other social media sites and they are important. I don't really care of your personal opinion about Twitter, but it seems disingenuous to dismiss the entire site as a cesspool, especially since the value of such an important social tool is plummeting.
