I don't disagree that CNN has a heavy lean often these days and I dislike biased media coverage, but that video is itself HILARIOUSLY biased and full of lean and misinformation. For starters, the viewership stat is completely cherry picked (the same day on the calender can have completely different levels of news depending on the year) CNN viewership has declined massively, but not by 90%. Nor are they at 50k\ viewers, they're at about 639k viewers during prime time hours (again, still massively down, but not to the level he's pretending). The worst part is the segment on Trump, he talks about Trump being anti big business and I just couldnt help but break out fucking laughing. Trump IS big business and one of his only actual notable policy changes while in charge was corporate tax cuts, seriously what sort of ridiculously biased video are you linking?

To be clear, I hate it a lot... But I think it's happening and we're going to have to live with it until it's normal.
Delusional? Every Tibetan knows about the government in exile…You probably don’t know what the government even does….
