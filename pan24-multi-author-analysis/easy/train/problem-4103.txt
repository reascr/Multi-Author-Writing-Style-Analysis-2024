The Romanian authorities applied all standard procedures from the moment the target was detected until the situation was fully clarified. In addition, at 10.38 am, two MiG-21 LanceR aircraft of the Romanian Air Force of the NATO-led Air Police combat service, which were on an exercise flight at the time, were diverted to the northern part of Romania to supplement the response options.
