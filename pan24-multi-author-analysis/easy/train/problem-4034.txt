I always thought that was a particularly annoying pathetic thing that the right liked to do but in light of last week's absolute blowout and the 2 election blowouts before that and I think by now even they have to realize for the first time how it's always sounded to us: ineffectual insignificant detritus.
There are 400 seats in the house. At least 1 2% victory is practically guaranteed. The polls were off but honestly, not by that much this year (at least the MSM aggregates weren’t, with a toss up victory + slight Republican edge being the most commonly predicted by far) but most aggregates overcompensated for republicans because the previous 3 elections they undercompensated for republicans by a couple %. It turns out the anomaly wasn’t polling error those years but the influence of trump, so of course we’re off by about 5 points in the other direction now. It’s not a particularly odd thing and it’s certainly not some predictor that polls are useless. They did a reasonable job with what they were given.
