Also, I would be willing to bet that you are saying that 2/3 of white men who voted, voted Republican. That's a very different thing than saying, "2/3 of white men voted Republican". Only about 46% of registered voters even voted in the midterm. There are about 258 million voting age citizens in America. About 21% of voting age citizens aren't even registered to vote. That leaves about 203 million registered voters. 46% of that is about 94 million voters. To keep it simple let's say that half of those voters are male (though women outvoted men in recent elections), so that is about 47 million men who voted. White people are almost 76% of the population... so now we're down a little less than 36 million white male voters voted in the election. The says that about 58% of whites voted Republican so that would make the total of white males who actually voted Republican in this election somewhere around 20 million. Support for Trump himself and the more rabid Republicans is down as well (about 60%). So let's just say that ALL of the more hardcore Trump fans are white supremacists (they are not all white supremacists)... that's about 12 million white men and roughly the same number of women. Let's be generous and say that it rounds out to an even 25 million white voters are white supremacists. There are about 332 million Americans. 25 million is about 7.5%.
As to Hillary's comments about the 2016 election, the same report details an "aggressive, multi-faceted effort" by Russia to "harm the Clinton Campaign, tarnish an expected Clinton presidential administration, help the Trump Campaign after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, and undermine the U.S. democratic process." Again, that's a report written by Senate Republicans.
