I would believe that if you had to put it into 3 categories, it would be medium. Now, with that being said 3 categories is ridiculous. We don't know what defines them. I imagine without knowing the limits from one to another, this could be like someone higher up rolling their eyes when having to decide to investigate this and will but they know it's dumb but it will get them off their back if they do because if they do its going to low because it has to fall into a category. If they investigated if King Kong would actually attack NYC and it would have to fall into one of the three categories which is low. Without knowing what the limits are it's kind of pointless, say if they had to do an investigation if the moon was made of cheese and their policy is it has to fall into 1 of three it would also be low.
