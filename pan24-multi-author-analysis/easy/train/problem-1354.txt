The head of the immunology society in Australia, when an Australian Scientist proposed a new function of lymphocytes, and claimed there were two groups, B cells and T cells, said (wrongly, it turns out), that the only significance of the B and T cell theory was that they were the first and last letters of the word “bullshit”.
Hey! I work at a State museum (not in New York though), and I can confirm that literally every museum has there own mess of stuff that needs to be catalogued. They did a count at my work, and said if they stopped taking in new artifacts and new pieces and worked on digitizing everything they currently had, it'd take about 30 years to get through it all. That enormous amount coupled with underfunding and multiply that by at least the other 49 state museums (but I'm willing to bet the other thousands of museums each have their own) and you can really start to see the big picture.
Right?? The first thing I thought when I saw this post is how long it's gonna be before I can't get a pet Thylacine: granted it'll probably be available after I'm dead but dammit if we can't have pet dinosaurs I at least want a mini-mammoth lol.
