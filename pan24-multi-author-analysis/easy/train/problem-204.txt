There's some reason to believe that they were authorized to pull 900,000 but discovered relatively early in the process that they didn't have the institutions or infrastructure to do so. The 300,000 publicly announced was supposed to be recall of reservists only. The rest were supposed to be fresh conscripts. But, it appears that they didn't have up to date records on where the reservists were or what they were doing. So, rather than use the already trained reservists to hold the line while they cycled off the units that had been fighting continuously since March to accept reinforcements and train the new conscripts they had to throw whomever they happened to have in hand into the front lines to buy time to scrounge up the rest. The high attrition of putting completely untrained people on the front line means that they don't really have a choice but to toss more fresh recruits on the front to fill the gaps caused by the deaths of the previous batch.
Exactly. If I were in charge, my plan for defectors would be to make them “casualties” and just slide them right into the forces without comment under a fake identity. They’re dead to Putin, your force has mysterious extra power, and it’s a good incentive to defect.
