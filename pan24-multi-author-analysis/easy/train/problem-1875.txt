In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Ahh. Another imbecile who thinks being critical of Brandon, who has done nothing for this country but lie, cheat and steal, MUST mean I support Trump. No I despise all of you who think this country is actually in good hands if it's a Democrat or a republican. You are the problem with this partisan idiocy. They're both bad and you're worse for actually taking a side that still doesn't care about anything but power and control. Doing their dirty work for them like a good little sheep. ðŸ¤·.
If the only two choices are between a white nationalist far right wing party whoâ€™s last president attempted a coup and itâ€™s followers participated in a violent insurrection against our democracy or a party composed of spineless cowards who sold their souls for corporate money I would have to choose the spineless prostitutes.
