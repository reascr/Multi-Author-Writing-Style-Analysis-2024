It's not even a hassle to get consent. Just stop if your partner says no, if they are unconscious or heavily inebriated (inb4 some incel tries to nitpick what constitutes "heavily inebriated", it's pretty obvious when a sloppy drunk chick is just drunk-horny and will not be happy if she wakes up and realizes what you did), if they seem uncomfortable or otherwise hesitant, or (and this is the real game changer) if she even seems like she was reluctant but gives in to your incessant pestering. IOW, if you had to pester her for sex, that's problematic. In order to acquire positive consent, I just make sure none of the above (and some other) criteria are met, and then I let her pull my stuff out and do with it what she wants (that I consent to). Pretty good sign of consent when your partner is the one initiating intercourse.
Exactly. Dick picks. Menstrual data from teenage girls. Hyper-insistence on legislating based on genitalia instead of identity in the case of trans folks. Heartbeat bills. They’re obsessed with people’s junk. It’s so creepy.
