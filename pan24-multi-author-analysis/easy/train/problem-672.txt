My view: this act is purely for domestic consumption in Russia. Even if Ukraine has such long-range capability, there is no way they are gonna start firing rockets toward the Kremlin. It serves no military purpose and would be rotten PR. It would play directly into Russia's hands.. These are being installed publicly to give the Russian people the impression that they are under siege, rather than the ugly truth: they are the brutal aggressors in an unjustifiable war against a smaller neighbor that did not pose a threat to them.
