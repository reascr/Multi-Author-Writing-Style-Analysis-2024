I was in Italy when the virus started getting out of control that country (February). I went to Colombia (February) and within weeks (March), and with fewer than 100 cases, the country issued a nationwide quarantine that forbid you from leaving your home 9 out of every 10 days (dependent on the last number on your ID). They had roadblocks setup and every store was checking IDs. The supermarkets had FLIR cameras and TVs at the entrance that showed your temperature as you approached. By May (or June), they were in the top 10 of most cases in the world (per worldometer). Iâ€™m not saying anything other than I think they broke the glass early and it had little effect on controlling the spread in the major cities. It absolutely prevented the virus from migrating to the smaller towns though.
