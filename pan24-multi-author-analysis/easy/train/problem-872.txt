Conservatism is ideologically dead. Thus they're embracing fascism to present some kind of ideological identity to members who are honestly just religion, gun supporting liberals. They create this myth of America and then say if someone is trans (or gay, black, asian, hispanic, liberal, female...) doesn't belong in 'Their America.' This phantasmic land that doesn't and couldn't exist lives only in their longing for a place where they don't have to work hard for a wife and house and good job. But the reality is that if they did somehow eradicate all trans, gays, non-whites, and made women into chattel slaves it would do NOTHING to improve their situation. They would still be exploited, just as whites were for generations by men who were their 'betters.'.
Estrogen injections are $47/month before insurance (amazon pharmacy). It's much cheaper with oral tablets. No one is getting rich off us, and the primary market for these medications are not trans-related.. it's cis women, people with blood pressure issues, etc.
