Rabbis are not priests. Judaism hasn't had priests for nearly 2000 years. Rabbi means teacher and they are advisors to observant Jews on how to follow the Law of Moses. So, a rabbi advising the Jews in his community that "doing this thing that is normally forbidden on Shabbos is both allowed and a Good Thing" is his job, even if it would be obvious to observant Jews.
what is normally forbidden on Shabbos is working, and work in the context of Jewish observance of the sabbath includes a lot of stuff that non-Jews wouldn't expect, and happens to be a lot of stuff you need to do in an emergency. Stuff like: moving rocks, driving, leaving your community, building shelter, cooking, handling money, and operating any kind of mechanical or electrical equipment. The rabbi was simply reminding people that these laws only apply when things are going smoothly, and any law of Moses can be violated to save a life.
aforementioned "superman". The superman makes his own existence worthwhile, although I'm gonna be honest and say I don't know if Nietzsche would consider that "filling the religious hole with something else" or simply removing said "hole" altogether.
b. Irrelevant to the point I was making. Obviously that not practicing Jews do not care and obviously that rabi was addressing those who are.
