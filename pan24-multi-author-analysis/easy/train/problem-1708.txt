Looks like history is going to repeat itself with Russia losing again. If their loss in war in Afghanistan was one of the catalysts that lead to the collapse of the USSR - with their forces in Ukraine having already well surpassed the losses that they had in Afghanistan - with the modern Russia having only a fraction of the resources, manpower, and wealth of the 1980s USSR and, unlike the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, fighting against an organized military being trained and equipped at massive scale by NATO… yeah, no, they don’t have a chance in hell of winning.
This is a stupid take. Confirmed losses have clearly shown Russia is deploying older and older combat systems as the war goes on. They have 64 confirmed losses of T-62s since the beginning of Fall.
Do not underestimate your opponent capabilities. Russia still have a lot of older tech, and a lot of people. It had enormous advantage at the start of the war, and while it diminished with losses, russian army still enjoying strong 2-5x numerical advantage (in tech) over Ukraine.
