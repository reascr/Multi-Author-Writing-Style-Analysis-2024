Netyahoo has proven to be a far right war hawk zealot before so Israelis voted him out, now he magically reappears, another trump piece of trash, come on Israel if Americans can evict wannabe dictator criminal Trump from office, the good Israeli can oust criminal Net, if the system is fairly working, and if the system isnâ€™t working, fix it Israel before you drag others in to a war nobody wants.
For example. Alberta invoked the notwithstanding clause to try to strike down same sex marriage. But the court ruled they never had the power to do this in the first place, that's a federal issue. So it didn't matter that they invoked the notwithstanding clause, the Supreme Court killed their law as unconstitutional.
The Canadian government cannot override anything the Supreme Court says with the notwithstanding clause. It's limited to Sections 2, 7 through 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That's a lot. But by no means everything! It cannot be used to interfere with voting, with mobility, with the structure of parliament, with the structure of the courts, or change the basic powers of the government.
