(Skipping over a lot and oversimplifying now...) The Democrats (I would argue) grew complacent with their influence over the working class, unions and working poor to the point that they did not speak to their concerns and worries as jobs began to be sent overseas and their opportunities dwindled. (Yes... the republicans sent the jobs overseas... that's not the point.) Around the same time, Newt Gingrich (invoking Reagan as Patron Saint), his "Republican Revolution" and the likes of Rush Limbaugh began a very well thought out and coordinated attack aimed directly at the working class. The Democrats shrugged. The Democrats continued their efforts on very worthy and righteous causes... but they did not offer enough vocal support or legislative effort to address the concerns of the blue-collar working class. Gingrich's plan was very successful. The republicans did "the impossible" and made serious in-roads to the working class. They have yet to lose ground.

Absolutely. Perfect example is Mike Pence: Never once said anything bad about Trump wanting to have him murdered UNTIL the GOP suffered in the midterms. And even then Pence only spoke up because he had a book coming out. Theyâ€™re all opportunists and cowards.
