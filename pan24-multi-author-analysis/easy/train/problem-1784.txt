Bullshit. Do not give these guys credit where it is not to. Everyone knows that Israel has the full backing of the United States. This is some shit that I'm saying they're worried about their security situation. If they're so worried about their security situation, either way, maybe we should stop sending tons of funding their way. If it apparently isn't helping them feel secure.

I'm not so sure. Assad doesn't really poke the Israeli bear, but many of the Islamist militias fighting against him would gladly do so.
