You might think it’s nonsense but I think this is an important nuance for most of The Hill’s readers who don’t know it already. They have a certain demographic that isn’t you and realistically you’re never gonna be able to persuade the people who usually read The Hill to vote one way or another. Some of their readers probably fancy themselves being “fiscally conservative Republicans” and these people might be more persuaded to vote for a reasonable sounding Democrat than these crazy politically performative and sensational Republican candidates. To the right people this message will read as “this isn’t liberal propaganda, we need to stop enabling the crazier Republicans.” There definitely is a difference between someone like Liz Cheney and MTG. Maybe you don’t recognize it but The Hills reader’s might.

Another nonsense thehill article. The fact is, the GOP is MAGA and there is zero distinction. 74 million+ republicans voted for trump in 2020. That's history and a voting record which cannot be changed due to it now being inconvenient.
