But I submit to you that we are in a right now, and during political realignments the old rules suddenly go hang because politicians’ and voters’ incentive structures become rearranged by some event — such as, well, everything that’s happened over the past six years and especially Dobbs — and simply for the purpose of pursuing self interest (if nothing else — I assume politicians are selfish machiavellians and go from there), individual actors find themselves in positions where unusual decisions are clearly and obviously beneficial to them.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Maybe. I make ads, the 180 most Rs turned by 2018 is whiplash inducing because the people there are smitten with the exclusivity and power. Regardless of Trump's dropping ratings, they're all worried about being primaried. And in the past 4 years as opposed to the 10 before it, they aren't moving to the center (campaign wise) to get a bigger base. Making people mad enough to vote or inspiring apathy is the only play they're running for the most part.
