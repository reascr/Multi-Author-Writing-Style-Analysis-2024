Basically, I think there's a very large fraction of the population that has no real desire to bear/raise children. It's uncomfortable, stressful, time-consuming, and hideously expensive. On the other hand, there's also a small fraction of the population that is just naturally good at parenting, but whose talents are sadly under-utilized because parenting is treated as an essentially private matter, rather than as a skilled profession. It seems like technology could (a) maintain a stable birthrate, while (b) reducing distracted/half-hearted/inept parenting by "filthy casuals.".
If the authorities provided proper resources to parents to make it not expensive, ensured proper protections for prospective parents from having their careers damaged, having kids would be much more appealing to more people. And our society needs to shift from the idea of the “nuclear family” which makes child-raising not the sole difficult responsibility of 1 or 2 parents, to embracing the idea of “it takes a village to raise a child,” as our ancestors raised children in large communities that distributed the stress and responsibility of kids among a large amount of people.
Not surprised. It's well known that all of these chemicals disrupt peoples' hormones. Take a look at someone's testosterones level back on the day compared to now. If you look at the reference ranges for labs, it is drastically shrinking over time.
