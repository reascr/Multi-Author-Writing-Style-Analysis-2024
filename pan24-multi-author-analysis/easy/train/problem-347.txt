Also, just amazing so many minions will fight for the interests of a few powerful moneyed elites. Such fools but so common. Always happens.
Fun fact spin-off: Runescape currency sellers have a huge basis in Venezuela due to cheap labor that’s viewed well in the current economy’s context and embargoes further destabilizing the country and driving prices for human necessities of survival to extremes, exactly how you punish a country’s leaders - by making much of their general population nutritionally deprived and emaciated so they have the strenh spirit to rebel.

The capital of our country is under the firm command of loyal Bolsonaro's supporters, the governor is a Bolsonaro supporter, the security secretary is a former minister of justice of Bolsonaro, and as Minister of justice he was very much willing to let Bolsonaro's tugs off the hook in their violent uprisings against the state in the run up, during and after the election. So it was not at all surprising to see that the security of our capital was utterly inadequate, and one could very well ague to have been fully cooperative with the traitors.
