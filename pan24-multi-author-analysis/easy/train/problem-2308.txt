My point is that if we outlaw 80% lowers they'll just sell 79% lowers (or whatever), or they'll sell "technical models" of an AR lower that are non functional unless you replace some easily manufactured part, or a "hydraulic manifold" that can be easily modified to be a lower, etc. its incredibly hard (and in my opinion impossible) to close all the loopholes in what is and is not a gun while keeping guns legal. At least without arbitrary and extremely easily abusable regulations. A gun is a fairly simple mechanical device, you can build a machine gun with hand tools and stuff you can find in any hardware store if you have a moderate amount of technical know how. Hell if 3d printing gets good enough you won't even need that much technical know how. There is even that sells a desktop cnc machine specially made to mill gun parts out or raw aluminum stock, and it's only $2500.
Not necessarily. If we are talking about AR-15 style rifles, while you may need to have certain machinist tooling (or access to it) to finish, the cost can be cheaper than buying one.
