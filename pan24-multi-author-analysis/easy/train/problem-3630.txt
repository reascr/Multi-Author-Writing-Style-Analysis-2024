I think anyone who is terminally ill, severely clinically depressed (like beyond any help type stuff) or over a certain minimum age if they're otherwise physically and mentally healthy (I'd say 35 or older, not overly old but not too young) should have the legally protected right to end their life.
Fair! I doubt it would go far though. The view of life is so damn warped. Likely someone on the right will claim doctors are going to come after "your parents and grandparents" and murder them... some stupid shit like that without giving any context or of the mind to keep a person alive despite being in terrible condition because it makes the caretaker feel some sort of way. -.-.
If you think allowing a terminally ill or completely broken person to painlessly end their own life willingly and knowingly is "morally wrong", you also probably think abortion is for murderers, getting a vasectomy takes away your manhood, or something similarly ridiculous.
You can call me hardline for saying this, but I believe that you cannot honestly support euthanasia unless you also support anything else that relates to bodily autonomy (such as abortion, vasectomies, etc).
