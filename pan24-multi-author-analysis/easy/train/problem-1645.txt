But they know we wouldn’t attack, so why would they allocate resources to watching our troops? The only way to do that is to make it credible that we would attack Belarus or Russia and that is where the chances of accidental escalation would come from.
If Russia had to respond by redeploying a proportionate amount of troops to the NATO borders then your idea would be effective, still incredibly risky that an accidental escalation would happen, but it would work.
Can you say the chances of an accidental escalation are worth taking over just giving Ukraine more weapons or sending NATO special forces in as “volunteers” the same way Russia sent their special forces on “vacation” to Crimea?
Let’s keep giving weapons to Ukraine, whatever they need, but for fuck sake don’t put troops on Russia’s borders, if nothing else that is what Putin wants, it makes him right. He’ll get to talk about NATO threatening Russia and provoking him and how we’re trying to destroy the Russian way of life. Can we just make him look like an idiot like we are now rather than a genius?
Belarus is an authoritarian state, not totalitarian. North Korea is totalitarian. Lets not confuse these two.
