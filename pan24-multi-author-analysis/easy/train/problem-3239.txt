This is true, and it's a fallacy created by their culture of toxic hyper masculinity. Russian culture has always had a poisonous machismo about it, and now that they've been pushing hard right, it's only become worse. Turns out, training your special forces to throw tomahawks while backflipping nude in single-digit weather has absolutely nothing to do with your ability as a modern fighting force. It's why their military strategy for the past 100+yrs has been "barrage everything with cheap, inaccurate artillery, then slowly advance, scorched earth." Then combine it with their outright refusal to change or progress anything similarly to the West because it's seen as practically a betrayal, the absolute rot that is institutionalized corruption (both of these things plague China as well, BTW), and you have this huge interconnected mass of obstacles, ones that are so fully integrated into their culture that they will take literally generations to fix, even if they put all their resources into it.
"Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet . . . they will be the luckiest of all.".
Military objectives, insofar as objects are concerned, include “any object which by its nature, location, purpose or use makes an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”.
