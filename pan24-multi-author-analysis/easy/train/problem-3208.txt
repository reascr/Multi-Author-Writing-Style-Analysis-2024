Even if you could purchase a car and somehow get it to your house without a license, it’d still be effectively useless to you. There’s a very good reason that you need a license to operate a car: bad drivers can pose a serious hazard to public safety.

Gun ownership should be allowed, but it should be regulated to protect public safety.
