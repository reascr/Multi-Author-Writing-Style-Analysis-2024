At this point trusting anything russians say is just stupid, since they lie 99.9% of the time. But i would not trust our data as well, because there were also countless manipulations of facts to "keep the morale up". So it's "one said, other denied" game. I just assume that all politics are natural born liars, and everything they say is lie by default. Trusting any of them is possible only after solid proofs are presented.
Yesterday I got into an argument in an "anti-war" sub (ie: pro-war, and even pro-genocide, as long as it isn't done by the West) with a guy who claimed that Ukraine was slaughtering people in Donbass (even if only around 300 civilians from both sides had died since 2016, after the end of the high intensity conflict, up to the February invasion, with the number of fatalities getting smaller with each year) and that the Army was filled with Nazis (even if Ukraine itself is, depending on the study, way less anti-semitic than Russia or downright the least anti-semitic country in Eastern Europe, and that the far-right parties only have one single seat in the Parliament).
