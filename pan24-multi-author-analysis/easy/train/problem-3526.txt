Joking aside, Madison is legit fun (boo, Badgers), Milwaukee is a hidden gem, and the state itself has a pretty close cultural thruline with MN, and I think we dont talk about that enough, because sports has so thoroughly poisoned parts of how we interact (FTP, btw).
Yes it did. US steel had a heavy presence there. They literally built communities just for the workers. Duluth lost several thousand steel workers over the years. Duluth economically struggled just like other rust belt cities. Taconite mining fueled the US steel industry as well as west Virginia coal.
There’s a lot of great food (especially southeast Asian food due to the amount of refugees Minnesota has historically taken in), access to outdoor amenities is insane (seriously I live in one of the most dense neighborhoods in the city and I’m still only one block away from a bike path that connects within a mile to a chain of lakes that are surrounded by city parks and bike paths - and that’s not to mention things like easy access to the North Shore of Lake Superior), and you get the advantages of a huge city with relatively tame COL. The latter is probably due to the cold… but we have some of the best summertime weather of anywhere in the US on the flip side.
