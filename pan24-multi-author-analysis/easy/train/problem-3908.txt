I disagree for several reasons: 1) the processing power limitations may drop due to things like AI advancements, Moore's law, etc; 2) even if the invasive spyware doesn't harm the average person directly, it harms them by e.g. getting a journalist killed (the 4th Estate becoming less effective as a counterbalance against worsening human rights) or by getting blackmail on a senator (state authority being hijacked by a foreign entity); 3) imagine you're an "average person" but also an expat from China, and China wants to force you to go back. Will such a convenient surveillance tool be helpful to them, if/when they decide to use it?
I'm actually serious... I get ads about smart lightbulbs with built in cameras, wifi, motion sensing, microphones, etc, for like... I want to say $20? Something like that?
Are we really comparing private western enterprises individually attempting to track you to sell ads vs semi-private Chinese companies beholden to the largest authoritarian state in history spying on domestic and international citizens/residents?
