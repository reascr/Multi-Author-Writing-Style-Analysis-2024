That’s my understanding. I think it is important to point out though that it could be enforced through the shipping insurance ships are typically required to have to dock at a port and unload their oil. This is at least what some other articles I’ve read / videos I’ve watched are saying. Who is in the business of supplying shipping insurance? Apparently, it’s generally western countries (like potentially up to 90%). If this is all true (I assume it generally is, but would like to read more about it), these insurance companies could forbid their insured customers from shipping oil over $30. Of course, I’m sure it is more complicated than that.
Hello MrJenzie. Sorry to bother you, but I just saw the green circle on your avatar appear for a moment, and then disappear. What you doing over there, buddy? Everything okay?
It's like i cannot even comprehend their thinking, even if you had adequate supply, even if you had mature battery technology to cover baseload for Renewables, even if there was a trillion dollar fund to cover economies that would be affected by higher oil price and even if there was not an OPEC cartel you still would need some kind of world government to make unilateral decisions to countries being greedy and exploiting the situation.
