The fact that the law makes no distinction between "tops" and "bottoms" is also further evidence of this, and your point about it being difficult to hold someone legally responsible for having had gay sex does not prove anything. Of course it's going to be more difficult to find because it's much easier to convince people that you're not in a relationship, especially because homosexual relationships are seen as very unlikely and uncommon, and everyone is presumed to be straight.
I would have loved to see entire teams boycott. Especially right before the tournament so backfilling would be difficult. But that would only happen if a group of high ranked teams decided to do it together. And even then, fifa would sanction them, preventing players of the future from playing in world cups hosted in non-oppressive countries. Shitty situation. Just tear down fifa already.
Does anyone actually believe this misinformation? It really blows my mind how something so lacking in evidence can convince so many people. Talk about "the blind leading the blind"!
