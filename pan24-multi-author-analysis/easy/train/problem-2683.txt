It's literally stopping government entities from VERY unfree countries like Russia and China from putting out propaganda that would convince people like you who actually think the west is unfree into thinking that Russia or China, nations currently committing genocide, are better options to be hedgemons.

the amount of money that actually gets back to them is miniscule, you're basically saying that you're going to cut off the money those people make which they kinda need to buy food and pay rent and utilities possibly resulting in them starving to death is a small price to pay for russia's political leaders to get slightly less money, the only money that russia can get from those funds would be in taxes, or the slight amount of money that they get from purchases of like fucking bread at the local market run by political leaders in their own country, thats so miniscule. and the whole reason we're doing this is because somebody had a slightly political view on a war. let people have their opinions without having funds cut from them.
