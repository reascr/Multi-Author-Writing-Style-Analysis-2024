British military intelligence believes the conditions of the battlefield are quickly turning against the Russians’ favor, as forecasts of warmer weather in the Donbas mean snows will melt and the ground will soften, making the swift movement of troops and heavy vehicles near impossible.
This is funny. All spy drones and satellites are pointed at this region, and even experts look at it and can only say "It's... beginning? I think?".
While Ukrainian GBAD units were electronically degraded and trying to reorganise and recover from physical strikes, Russian GBAD units inside Ukraine were also suffering from major limitations. Mobile air-defence assets, such as the short-range SA-15 ‘Tor’ and medium-range SA-17 ‘Buk’, had been sent into Ukraine with no functional communications plan. They were also advancing out of sequence and often separated from the formations that they were supposed to protect; and they were operating under very restrictive rules of engagement which instructed them to assume anything flying was Russian. 16 The inability of radar-guided SAMs on either side to perform as anticipated during the first week and a half meant that fixed-wing aircraft on both sides had remarkable freedom to penetrate significant distances across the rapidly changing frontlines. This would quickly cease to be the case from early March, when both sides’ GBAD reorganised and became far more effective.
