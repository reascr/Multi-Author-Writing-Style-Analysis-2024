What has actually happened though, is that the legislature has basically engineered it to funnel those local property taxes into the state budget, and so instead of paying for education, it is going to other state priorities. Because the state has also been curbing its outlays to public education in general, and hasn’t been properly adjusting the formula for determining a district’s liability, more districts are paying out more money, and districts set to receive money are steadily receiving proportionally less.
