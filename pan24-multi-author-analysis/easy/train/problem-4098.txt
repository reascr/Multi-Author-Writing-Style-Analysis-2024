I basically don't believe that humanity is progressing towards anything, and that progress itself is a myth. It's true that humans have been improving their application of the natural sciences, but that is in some sense a mistake and a distraction from things that really matter, which I believe were taken into account for better in pre-modern and non-European societies.
