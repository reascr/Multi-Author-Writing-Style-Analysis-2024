Logically.. the risk outweigh the reward. Preemptive strike capability is essentially irrelative since the introduction of ballistic missile submarines. Thereâ€™s always going to be a retaliatory strike so what does it matter where you park your nukes?
This inconsistency is intentional. Nixon actually was known for doing this during the cold war. The idea is that it is preferable to be unpredictable because if the other side thinks they know what you will do then they may think that MAD no longer applies. Putin is also known to employ this type of rhetoric.
Really? Then what is holding them back? Why haven't they done it until this point? IIRC the only military base Russia has, outside of possibly former Soviet republics, is in Syria. What makes you think anything has changed?
Also consider the geopolitical ramifications. How would China feel about Russia parking nukes in NK? It would clearly cause the US, Australia, SK and Japan to beef up their deterrence measures which is the exact opposite of what China wants.
