I had the privilege of traveling in France some years ago. While there, I had what remains the best sandwich of my life. It was only three ingredients -- locally made butter from Normandy, some ham, and a baguette made the same morning I got the sandwich. And though the butter was fantastic and the ham was quite good, the baguette was the star of that show. I know it seems like it's just bread, but that's like saying that Matisse was just an artist. UNESCO got this one right.
To meet this demand, and because daily trips to the bakery only make sense if the bakery is nearby, France has a dense network of tens of thousands of small bakeries all over its territory, thanks to which almost every french person has access to several different bakeries. In big cities, it is normal to have access to 3 or 4 bakeries within a 15 minutes walk radius. Furthermore, each bakery has a day off (sunday or monday typically). On the baker's day off, the clients will sample one of the alternative bakeries in the neighbourhood, and if it is better, the alternative bakery will become the main bakery. This leads to extremely intense competition, due to which every baker in France has to strive for perfection at their craft, or they risk losing their clients.
