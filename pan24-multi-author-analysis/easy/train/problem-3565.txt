Would it not be better if they won the House also. What I see in general media so far, it seems that "traditionally" the House are won by opposition party during midterms (regardless which party is governing), what interest me is why the incumbent party never manage to win a second term also.
I see what you mean. Yes of course holding both the House and the Senate would have been a better outcome, but these kinds of holds for the incumbent party are very unusual, only happening a handful of times in the last century. As to why the incumbent party normally loses in the midterms, we can only guess. Maybe Americans are just generally an unhappy people and they blame their unhappiness on whoever is in power, or maybe because of the way the U.S. government functions, even wildly successful policy takes a few years to show an effect, leading voters to believe that nothing ever gets done.
