Is it really though? AZ was a red state in presidental elections with the exception of Biden and Clinton they voted mostly Republican since the 50s. Their governors have been 50/50. The fact its shifting blue in general is a good thing even if it's just slight margins for now. It's even better considering that this was supposed to be a Red Wave with how our economy is doing and inflation yet it did not happen. Republicans had every single election state and national that weren't heavily Democrat leaning handed to them on a Sliver platter for the taking and they fumbled that bag wanting a turd on a golden Trump plate.
Yeah but not Kari. She used to call herself a Buddhist. In the past few years she converted to Christianity, convenient. She flip flops whenever it suits her. Republican until literally the day after Obama won Iowa and the winds were moving in his direction. Back to republican in 2012. Sheâ€™s vile and just a grifter like the rest of maga.
Religion. They are brainwashed from a young age that denying evidence makes you a better Christian, a TRUE believer. So, rational thought= I'm bad, not a true believer.
