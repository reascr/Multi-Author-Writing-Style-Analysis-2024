Culturally speaking I'd say Greeks and Turks are more friendlier than ever. Erdogan is trying to get the nationalist votes, which he depends on if he wants to get reelected. (He does, he wants that since he wants to avoid a lot of prison time).
The Greek genocide[4][5][6][7][8][9][A 1] (Greek: Γενοκτονία των Ελλήνων, Genoktonia ton Ellinon), which included the Pontic genocide, was the systematic killing of the Christian Ottoman Greek population of Anatolia which was carried out mainly during World War I and its aftermath (1914–1922) on the basis of their religion and ethnicity.[15] It was perpetrated by the government of the Ottoman Empire led by the Three Pashas and by the Government of the Grand National Assembly led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,[1] against the indigenous Greek population of the Empire. The genocide included massacres, forced deportations involving death marches through the Syrian Desert,[16] expulsions, summary executions, and the destruction of Eastern Orthodox cultural, historical, and religious monuments.[17] Several hundred thousand Ottoman Greeks died during this period.[18] Most of the refugees and survivors fled to Greece (adding over a quarter to the prior population of Greece).[19] Some, especially those in Eastern provinces, took refuge in the neighbouring Russian Empire.
