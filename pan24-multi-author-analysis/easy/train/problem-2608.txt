Cuban missile Crisis notably. Under Trudeau Sr. Canada was one of if not THE first western country to form relations with Communist China. Canada despite the US embargo on Cuba, was personal friends with Castro and made many visits to Cuba as well as friendly relations between the two country.

Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes, presiding over the extradition proceedings, posed the question, "Isn't it unusual that one would see a fraud case with no actual harm many years later and one in which the alleged victim, a large institution, appears to have numerous people within the institution who had all that facts that are now said to have been misrepresented?".
The reason is that Meng, the CFO who was charged, entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ last year and the DOJ agreed to dismiss the charges against her in December 2022 if she committed no further crimes (and in response to the agreement and the US dropping its extradition request, allowing her to leave Canada and return to China, China immediately released the two Canadians they arrested in retaliation for her detention in 2018). She didn't commit any further crimes, so the US attorney prosecutor for the case followed through with the agreement and filed for a dismissal of the charges and the court granted the dismissal; pretty straightforward.
Fucking America. Canada honours the extraditions, tanks Sino-Canadian relations and we get two of our own citizens kidnapped by the CCP and the Huawei bitch gets off? Tf man. “USA is best ally of Canada” my ass. Time to add that to the list of reasons I hate Biden and the USA. It was literally for nothing except the whims of a deranged Cheeto.
