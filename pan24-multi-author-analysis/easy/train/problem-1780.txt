Yes! As someone who's had to be on the receiving end of gov assistance, there's an insane amount of administrators and programs. You spend so much time filling out paperwork and being "administered" that you don't have time to go out and actually improve your life. SNAP/EBT, Disability, SSI, there's probably over 100 different federal level assistance programs that could be streamlined and made so so so much simpler. Don't even get me started on the state level programs...
Exactly. I don't trust any other countries. From time to time another crazy blood thirsty dictator will pop up and try and take over the world. It happened again and again throughout history. The US only spends 3.3% of its wealth on GDP. I am totally fine with that. 1 real war and the country will lose way more than 3.3% of its GDP. Wars are so damaging to society in so many ways. If we have to spend an extra percent or 2 of our wealth to ensure no one will mess with us its money well spent.

Propaganda? Where's the propaganda in blaming Biden in the headline for a budget Congress sets and often does so at higher levels than is even requested?
