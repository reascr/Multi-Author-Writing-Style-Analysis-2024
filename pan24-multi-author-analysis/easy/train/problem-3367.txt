I would argue these are not the same.. lots of crap went down in Afghanistan, agreed. But America was not trying to extinguish the people in general, didnâ€™t target civilians on purpose, etc. Russia is targeting civilians on purpose, wants to eliminate the people. It does seem different?
Russian government should be held accountable for the actions commited by Wagner group, similarly American government should be held accountable for actions commited by the various Mujahideen groups.
Oh please. The CIA destabilized an entire region and you still support them. You forget that the British did the same to India, no one gave a fuck. This is life. You play the cards you're dealt.
