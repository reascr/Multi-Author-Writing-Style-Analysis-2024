(i) For the first year the taxpayer is not a resident, the numerator shall be a fraction between zero and one, based on the percentage of days in the year the taxpayer was present in the state, plus the years of residence over the three previous taxable years.
(3) (A) For a taxpayer who was subject to the Wealth Tax in one of the preceding four years and is no longer a resident, and does not have the reasonable expectation to return to the state, the calculation of the numerator under paragraph (1) shall be as follows:
I don't care how much or how little you make. You work for a paycheck and pay an income tax. Then you put that money in the bank. The government has no right to tax it again just because you have it. California should cut their deficit by spending less.
It looks to somewhat mirror the situation that already occurs if a high net worth person renounces their US citizenship or non-citizen residency - they can stop accruing new US tax obligations by doing that, but first they have to pay taxes on the appreciation in value that occurred while they were a citizen or resident (in effect the taxes that would be due if they sold the assets they day they left the US tax system). There's a high minimum before that kicks in though.
