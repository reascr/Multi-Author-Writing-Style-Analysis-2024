Honestly this is beyond just Putin, beyond just his cronies, this is a deeply entrenched cultural problem. Everyone lies about everything, it was a survival skill in the USSR, and it continues. You have to somehow make people care enough to put in and make that change and find people to run the place that actually do care to make changes. You can't just put Russia in time out and expect the behavior to change, like tbh I think the only thing that will solve a major problem like that is doing what the Allies did to Germans at the end of WW2 - make them clean up the mess their leaders created and that they've ignored by just pretending everything is fine because they don't care. Until people can be assured that they're not going to be shipped off to a gulag, they can't and won't care, and that is unfortunately a process that's hard and ugly.
Interesting. Yes, it is common for a waiter to take your card when you are paying at a restaurant in America. I always love hearing about the little differences in life between different countries. ðŸ˜Œ Thank you for sharing that.
