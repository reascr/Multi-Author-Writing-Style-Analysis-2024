Common. A preflight task involves reviewing the maintenance status of the last few weeks. Inspections, repairs, deferred broken parts, regular service (like air in the tires, oil, etc). My airline would often take spare parts off older parked planes, buy them from parked aircraft (like buying salvaged spare parts for car repair in a junkyard). But even just the plane sitting over across the ramp if you need a quick temporary party. If a plane isn’t flying, perhaps down for a few weeks for inspections anyway. I’ve seen write ups like “robbed coffee maker 2 from aircraft 12345 to use in aircraft 98765 on XX/XX/XX date.” Since that plane isn’t flying for a few days, anther active plane needs it for a while. Then it gets swapped back a little while later.
Ultimately the Russian domestic market is dominated by regional carriers though, and while those fleets are still majority western aircraft, Sukhoi has a huge presence there, other Russian companies are starting to make an entrance to that market as well.
really? it's Russia. this level of theft is exactly in line with their previous actions. They literally stole oil facilities from private foreign investors after all the hard stuf had been paid for and the wells were ready to start being paid off by their use.
