I've been saying this and sounding the alarm ever since that "diplomacy" Tweet that's basically just Aleksandr Dugin and Vladimir Putin talking points. Musk runs SpaceX and SpaceX launches A LOT of classified and secret satellites and payloads for the DoD, NSA, CIA, Space Force, Air Force and Navy. StarLink is heavily involved with communication connections for Dragon launches and orbital guidance. SpaceX also supplies Dragon missions and will soon supply Starship and Dragon-XL missions for the Artemis Program and the Lunar Gateway station. The Kremlin and Putin could have kompromat on Musk and force him to turn over proprietary blueprints and schematics and/or software for Dragon and StarShip and/or the Falcon rocket family. Or tell them about what those secret payloads and satellites that SpaceX launches are and what they can do. Or let the Kremlin use StarLink to steal telemetry from Dragon, Starship and American satellites. Or just flat-out help them sabotage the Artemis Program while giving Roscosmos' lunar program a leg up through SpaceX stolen tech.
Seriously. Biden gave a very direct speech about the threat of Trump style authoritarianism in the US and the main thing all those idiots talked about was the color of the background.
