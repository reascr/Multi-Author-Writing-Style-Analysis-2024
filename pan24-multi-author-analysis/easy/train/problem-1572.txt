I vote Democrat but never liked HC. When her husband was in office and the day before he admitted to having an affair with an inter HC went on the today show to say that rumors of her husbands infidelity was a "Vast right-wing conspiracy" That proved to me that shes either a liar or stupid, either way her being so confidently incorrect greatly soured my opinion of her. Later, when she was a senator she blamed video games for making kids violent. Again, her being so confidently incorrect made me dislike her even more, funny enough its the same thing I hate about Trump but HC is just better at disguising her opinions as fact. Finally, when she was Secretary of State she did an interview overseas (I believe in Africa) and took questions from the audience. One question came from a person who did not speak great English that she mistook as a question about Bill Clinton and went off on the person, losing her temper and making the US look bad especially when the question wasnt about Bill Clinton at all. At this point had to ask myself, why the hell was this person in any office? By the time she was being investigated I had already made my mind up about her.
