In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. That falls into the "extreme" and "commercial" category. A voting machine company lives and dies by their reputation for accuracy and reliability. Publicly lying about that is the kind of thing a company kind of has to take to court. You'd have to be a real idiot to lie about that.

NEVER FORGET: Every accusation conservatives make is actually a confession. Conservatives are the real groomers. They put guns in their kids hands as soon as they're old enough to hold one, they brainwash their kids with the batshit crazy nonsense in the bible, and all over MAGA country white Christian conservative moms are dressing their toddler girls like hookers and plastering them in inch thick rinds of hooker makeup and teaching them to walk "sexy" on stage at pedo groomer child pageants for the benefit of pedo men in the audience.
