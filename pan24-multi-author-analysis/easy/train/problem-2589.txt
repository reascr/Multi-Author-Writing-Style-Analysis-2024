You're right, but too polite. WHY do Democrats struggle while in power? BECAUSE THEY'RE FREE-THINKERS, and insist on protecting their freedoms. The Republican symbiosis is between the RULERS (GOPerLords) and THE RULED (elected vassals and voters). It's the difference between the proto-typical American Way of Life and a Fascist State. Lots of German's thought Hitler was WONDERFUL and his Germany First, Arian Supremacy stance was "heroic" as he Made Germany Great Again.
Gerrymandering? Give me a break. The reason the Democrats lost the house is because they failed to connect with voters and offer a compelling message that resonated with the American people. It's not about some grand conspiracy to manipulate district boundaries for political gain. Both parties engage in this practice, so it's disingenuous to single out one side.
Aka GERRYMANDERING. NYS pointlessly lost seats in US Congress this year because of it! The new districts make no sense (splitting counties in half and literally skipping others) only to make more GOP districts.
