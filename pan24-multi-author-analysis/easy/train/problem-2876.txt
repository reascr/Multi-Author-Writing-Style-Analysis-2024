Sent to prison for child porn, released after four months and heads to Cambodia where he gets kicked out for diddling kids, goes to Vietnam and spends 2 /2 years in a Vietnamese prison for diddling more kids, then returns home to the UK and does it to three more girls. He gets 16 years for that, but they let him out after 8. Why? So he can have one last diddle of an innocent child before he dies of old age? Lock his ass back up.
In North America, "Part 2" became popularly associated with sports, as a number of professional teams adopted the song for use during games, primarily to signify scores and victories, or to otherwise invigorate the crowd. It is often referred to as "The 'Hey' Song," as the only intelligible word in Part 2 is the exclamation of "Hey," punctuating the end of several instrumental phrases and repeated three times at the song's chorus. It was played first in a sport setting in 1974 at games for the Kalamazoo Wings of the high-minor International Hockey League by Kevin O'Brien, the team's public relations and marketing director.[4] When he went to work for the NHL's Colorado Rockies in 1976, he brought the song with him. After the Rockies moved to New Jersey as the New Jersey Devils in 1982, the Denver Nuggets and Denver Broncos picked up the tradition and were the first NBA and NFL teams to play the song during games.[4] At sporting events, fans often insert their own "Hey," or sometimes other chanted syllables (such as "you suck!"—which controversially led to a decision by the Devils to switch to a song by New Jersey-native Bon Jovi instead).[5].
Exactly! It's not even a deal, it's pretty much automatic now to do half your sentence unless you get into more trouble in prison. Too expensive to keep monsters behind bars where they should be apparently.
Fabulous. Now he’ll have access to money he’s made from royalties and can still live a better financial life than most Brits.
