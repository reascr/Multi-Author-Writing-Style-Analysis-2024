I live in a small mountain town that gets millions of tourists every year, and the Chinese tourists (ie people from china, not Chinese Americans) are widely loathed for their behavior, because it is mostly viewed as rude, crude, dangerous or annoying much of the time. From making a mess of toilets b/c they literally stand on the seats and get shit and pee everywhere (we now have picture signs instructing Chinese people how to use them, but they still shit everywhere), to not observing smoking laws, littering, to walking in the middle of streets and causing traffic problems, not giving people personal space, getting too close to wildlife, feeding wildlife, not respecting private property (ie trespassing because they wanted to take photos), being terrible at driving and parking (ie blocking roads, ignoring signs), etc etc.
What? The same people that kept borders open when they knew they had a problem in 2020 so global economies would suffer equally would fuck with the rest of the world again? Iâ€™m shocked SHOCKED.
