Not even a plan on what to do about that, just that they can agree with majority of the public that this isn't a good thing. Talk about low hanging fruit.
We rely pretty heavily on automation - which generally works pretty well (and, to be clear, automation here only enforces decisions made on posts by moderators, it's not running wild on it's own) but in this case it was an unintended interaction between the rules for one post per article, link shorteners, and whether or not a removal is for a curable reason or not.
Read what I wrote. Republicans aren’t providing any solutions, they are only making people feel heard because their concerns about basic public safety things is being dismissed out right because a very small number of people have decided to push for things that seem to only hurt democrats.
Dems can’t be the party of progress if they keep saying look how bad things used to be, the things that happened in the law since that time about getting tough on crime were bad, racist, and didn’t work, and now that we dialed it back it’s not related btw. Don’t look at the policies of two most populated Blue States that outnumber most red states combined in terms of GDP and people, that’s not the party.
Think about how shitty the perception of Democrats is on crime that the republicans were able to make progress in blue states?
