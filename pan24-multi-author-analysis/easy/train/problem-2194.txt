Southern Conservatives (i.e. the GOP base) voted in nearly 100 years of Jim Crow before the left forced them to stop. The same way they were forced to stop discriminating against gay people and forced to follow all the other civil rights that have happened. If they ever had a fig leaf at all, it's the one we gave them when they started calling themselves Republicans. It's like we practically gave them a 'do-over' for rebranding themselves and we had to relearn all over again that "Wow, these really are some racist treasonous assholes." Well, like, yeah. They don't keep their Confederate flags around for nothing.
Republicans attack democracy by attacking the pillars of democracy: robust public education, independent journalism, safe elections, equality and human rights - and justice. Everything Republicans do is an attack on one of the pillars of democracy. Everything. They are sworn dedicated enemies of democracy - they cannot allow, nor will they ever accept majority rule. In this case they are attacking equality and public education. Rise up good people and defend democracy.
