Yep, a russian guy i follow on YouTube just got released from the detention center in el paso after making his way to Mexico then to the border to request asylum in the US. He did a livestream today and sounds and looks very relieved.
More misinformation. You’re under the assumption those nurses brain drain to the US, no, they simply don’t work in the profession any longer. They live in Canada and work a different job. Ontario can afford to pay nurses more, but we choose not to as we want to collapse our system. There are many great arguments for the privatization of medicine, this is not one of them. Short staffing combined with a stagnant wage which has the budget to be increased is the recipe for a collapse which they want to happen to privatize the industry. Doug ford has already proved he will sell Ontario off to the highest bidder with the green belt.
It's good that asylum and resettlement is being offered to some people in need, but the US (and the world at large) definitely has a long way to go - and with upwards of potentially a billion or more people displaced by projected climate changes and disasters over the next few decades, we're really going to have to revisit those international definitions (the good news is that we already are - the Biden administration has made the US the first G20 nation to formally propose expanding the definition of refugees to include 'climate migrants.').
