Maybe by reading what the fuck it actually says? I said nothing about personally supporting the “may issue” law in NY. I’ve always been against it, not that you would know that because I’ve never discussed it on here. All I did in the above quote was state facts about the current state of the SCOTUS and what their likely ruling on this Oregon law will be. Take your straw-manning bullshit somewhere else.
I’m concerned about the direction of society when people get together and decide a certain end is so necessary, for instance a reduction in gun violence (which almost all of the gun violence in America that skews our statistics away from other modern western countries takes place in a handful of crime ridden cities in impoverished neighborhoods, but that’s another rant) that suppression of some peoples rights is warranted to achieve that outcome. Historically, this type of thinking has been wrong every single time, and often not just wrong, but actively harmful and usually racist(consider suppression of Asian rights via internment and enslavement of American Japanese during WWII and after because of the threat of the war, for instance). If your start listing societies that have determined that their supposed path to a better society involved suppression and limitation of certain groups rights instead of maximizing everyone’s rights, it gets dark very quickly. This is just not the way to go.
