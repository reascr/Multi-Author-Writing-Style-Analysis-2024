If CBS did correct reporting like they did a couple days ago, the election. (Studies show would of been a 15% swing which would of changed election and Jan 6th). Hmmmm. Who are the cheaters?
My problem with this is multiple fold here - first he actually did weigh in on this particular issue, and second he's mentioned before these problems and defended them but ignored that he has a specific methodology for disregarding pollsters with such a history.
I don't care. It is all hearsay. So what the laptop belongs to Hunter. So what it isn't "tampered". Who cares.
I'd take the other side of this - I was disappointed in Silvers for not emphasizing things like the probability of a Democratic underestimation being slightly higher than the opposite due to the combination of cyclical changes in partisan misses and the preponderance of Republican leaning junk polls. And his Trafalgar thing was just weird. I do think Silvers has an impressive track record, but I was disappointed in his coverage.
