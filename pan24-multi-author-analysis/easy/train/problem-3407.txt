This is the problem with having a society that constantly lies for personal gain as one of its core values.
Not necessarily. It might be a deliberate sacrifice of untrained and badly armed mobiks to saturate defenses, and then more deliberate pushes by troops with increasingly more training until something breaks, or Putin croaks or nukes. Which is the scenario everyone else must prepare for, just in case.
It's the fundamental problem when you deliberately disengage your population from politics. Sure, as a ruler you now can do anything you want with little accountability. However the core purpose or motivation that should exist within your citizens and government agents is just absent. Everything has a cost.
That’s an interesting perspective. Unfortunately and as an example I don’t think that the Russian assault on airport failed because weather and muddy conditions. After all, the crack Russian airborne troops who lead the assault on Hostomel were helicoptered in. And mud + weather does not have an effect on a deployment like that.
So the answer must be something different than simply mud and weather. Different than Russian commanders unfortunately just gosh-darn unable to deploy in proper battle formation due to atmospheric conditions.
