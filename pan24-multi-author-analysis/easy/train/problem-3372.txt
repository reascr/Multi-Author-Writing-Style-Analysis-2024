Which is why this kind of lawsuit usually doesn't go anywhere. Most countries don't have mandated legislation that the parliament is required to pass by the Constitution. Generally speaking, it's usually not illegal to fail to enact policy, no matter how dire the consequences.
Indirectly. The court's premise is that if temperatures keep rising (which may happen no matter what Germany does), the government should enact "severe" or "comprehensive" losses of freedom. Government is removing current freedoms to slightly increase the probability of saving future freedoms--from the government.
Good. More people should sue their own governments for the criminal negligence of ignoring climate change. More people should be protesting too, and blocking fossil fuel business entrances. It's time to really put massive pressure on our institutions to take climate change seriously or WE ARE FUCKED.
Seems contradictory. If you have more regulations to control for climate change it will disadvantage poor people, which would in turn hurt the environment..
