As long as something remains a wedge issue (marijuana, abortion, etc) you’re not going to see any meaningful attempt to change it. Because then you cannot run on that wedge issue next election season. Name of the game is milking shit for as long as you can, unfortunately. If democrats actually gave a fuck about abortion, they’d have protected it federally 10 years ago. If republicans actually gave a fuck about gun rights, they’d be serious about de stigmatizing suppressors. On a federal level it’s all a racketeering scheme where you run based on “other side is going to take X away” and don’t do anything to protect it once you win so you can rinse and repeat later on in your career.
Great, I was 8. Joe Biden on the other hand was 54 when he decided that gay people don't deserve equal rights. Maybe his views changed or maybe the political calculus did, or maybe it doesn't matter if you've already decided that bigotry is okay as long as there's a D next to it.
