Ironically, I don't even think they will get to the point of overthrowing the Taliban. Support for radical Islam in Pakistan is high, and Imran Khan's very popular movement is pretty pro Taliban. The Taliban might actually overthrow the Pakistani Government via a Sri - Lanka style revolution by local sympathizers. Then the world will be in deep shit, with a massive Jihadi state with nukes ruling over 250 million people (Pakistan is already a nuclear state). With Russia so focused in Ukraine, this they could just sweep the weak militaries of Central Asia through their army (which probably will be their main means of gaining revenue now that aid groups are no longer bringing money into the country) - and no country would stop them.
No. There have always been bad actors and the government wants to sweep things under the rug for the most part, but terrorism as a tool of international policy is not used. The US does not purposefully bomb hospitals and schools to scare other governments into submission.
