Yes, it's possible that someone finished their education (or parts of it) and went into the military at an older age. This, however, is rare, since most of the population goes to the military when they're 18 years old. Good examples are doctors. If you've already studied medicine, you will most likely go to the medical reserve officer school and their reservist role will be a wartime doctor. At the same time they can (due to their own or the militarys motivation) become "simple infantrymen" just like everyone else. Same with engineers or any other civilian education. Everyone wins if they get put into positions where their education/experience can be used, but if they go through the military service, whatever their role, they will become soldiers.
2. You dont forget 6 months to a year of training completely in one or two years. If this was true, society could not function since people would be really bad at retaining information.
Interesting! I thought it was all tied into the same programs. Don't you even have Engineers etc in part of the Finnish military? Due to the professional life and also how to transfer over into military life.
