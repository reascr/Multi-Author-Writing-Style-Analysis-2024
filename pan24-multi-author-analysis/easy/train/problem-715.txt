I know nothing about Herschel Walker, but it remains untrue that every Black person has agency; exactly like how not every White person has agency. Whether by a whip, or a con, or systemic pressure, coercion, or disability, brain injury, by Walker's own greed or a combination of untold factors, this author is telling me that it hurts to watch the GOP parade Walker around like a prize goose. And I believe her.
You see they picked a black guy because first off he’s black (that will get black votes) This just isn’t any black guy though, he’s a black guy that played football at UGA (football good that gets black and white votes), played in the NFL (football gooder), name recognition (get votes), seems dumb possible CTE (gets more white votes cause easily manipulated).
“Is he in on the joke? Does he know they picked him to save money on boot black and burnt cork, this man who made his name by bringing the master glory on the master’s field, who got comfortable eating from the master’s table?”.
