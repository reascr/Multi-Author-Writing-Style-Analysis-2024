In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
No, it isn't. Correlation doesn't equal causation. Please don't cite non peer-reviewed articles from a google search as "proof". There have also been as many useless studies that say tall men are more aggressive.

So this man single handedly controls the Florida legislature which has passed laws to control how a business can operate and train their staff and punishes them for not supporting his ideology, how schools can teach and what they can teach and punishes them for not following his ideology, took away rights away from women over their bodies, controlled what kind of health precautions Floridians can take, allowing the insurance market to collapse in the state forcing everyone into the state controlled insurer, took voting rights away from ex-felons even though the state constitution permits it, ignored voter approved ballot measures, and controls what kind of entertainment Floridians are allowed to see . Is Florida even part of the United States anymore? Every day it just resembles a south american banana republic. Like a proto-dictatorship or communist state.
