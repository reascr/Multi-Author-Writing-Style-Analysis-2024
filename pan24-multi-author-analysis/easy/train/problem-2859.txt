Cool. I lived in a blue state where democrats won 70-30 every election and just moved to a red state where republicans win 70-30 every election. Love living in a society where my vote gets to affect policy...
Really? Odd, how was college paid for in the 80's? I don't remember my parents leaving school with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands in loans, and my mom even went to a private college. Surely they weren't funding themselves off a few hundred bucks per student per semester with no alternative state funding.
Republicans are obviously awful. But pretending "just vote Democrat" will fix our issues is naive and unhelpful. Our system of government is fundamentally broken. Manchin and Sinema were part of my point. The comment above made it seem like Republicans were stopping everything and just blindly voting for Dems would save us.

The interest of federal loans is not automatically capitalized and added to the principal except in specific situations, usually status change-related (e.g. you have a forbearance ending, deferment ending, etc). So the interest is accruing on whatever the current principal balance is, not automatically the principal + previous monthâ€™s interest amount.
Fair. Democrats didn't have full control over the legislature. But they likely will not have an opportunity like they did those two years again any time soon. The previous two years were the best chance the Democrats had to enact progressive policy. I don't see why being disappointed that they passed so little is a problem.
