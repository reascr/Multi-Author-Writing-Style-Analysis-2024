Forget wind and nuclear and other expensive initiatives that fill a small gap in the energy market, solar will mean the end of oil and gas for electricity generation, and only be used for other things and even then those can be developed from plants eventually.
Solar has been shown to be more than capable of replacing oil and gas powered energy plants very quickly no doubts no arguments can ignore the many examples where solar on home roofs alone have enabled countries to generate more energy than they use time and again.
Oil is not necessary in any way it is just the will of the people to force government to install solar that is lacking due to propaganda saying it is not good enough or too expensive, yes the energy created from solar on every roof would give more electricity than all oil and gas power plants combined.
No it's not. Solar requires the destruction of thousands of acres of land and habitat and the strip mining and poisoning of thousands of more acres just to match one nuclear plant using readily available materials and sitting on 100 acres of land.
