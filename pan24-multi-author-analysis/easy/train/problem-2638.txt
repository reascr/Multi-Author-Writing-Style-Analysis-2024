I mean at what point Putin will end his madness? 500k? 1 mil? 2 mil? and still try to cover it up in Russia as nothing?? Is he just planning to try outnumber the Ukranians 10 to 1, until his factories deliver more weapons and missiles? then say Look I give your widdow anf familys all new jobs, you should be happy to die for youe mother russia... Im guessing Putin took 1984 as a blueprint how to run a country??
Ukraine flipped the bird because it was clear from the outset that putain was lying, like he lied when he said he’d allow humanitarian convoys in or out of key towns, like he lied when he said he wouldn’t interfere with grain movements, like he lied when he said he was de-nazifying Ukraine, like he lies when he denies having anything to do with the deaths of his critics, like he lied when he invaded and annexed Crimea, like he lied when he said troop build-ups were ‘exercises’ just before the invasion of Ukraine, like he lied about his army’s behaviour when hundreds of bodies were found in Bucha after weeks of Russian occupation.
