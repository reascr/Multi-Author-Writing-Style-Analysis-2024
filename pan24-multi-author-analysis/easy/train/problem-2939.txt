Nah thats true but not true committee participation has tons of lucrqtive perks: insider trading, big companies owing you favors for helping, etc. His congressional pay is unchanged yes but nobody is in politics for their measly state given salary, they want powerful connections and the ability to insider trade with impunity.
Big deal! Recuse himself from committees how noble of him. Why not recuse himself from office completely. Don't think that will matter now he has been sworn in because I believe will retain his lifetime benefits. Amazing he is going to focus on serving his 22% who support verse the 78% who believe he should resign.
Probably. Recent reporting has shown that he hasn't even been in contact with his own district and people there are reaching out to other nearby Congressmen to get things done. Dude's just collecting a paycheck as long as he can before he gets booted the fuck out.
