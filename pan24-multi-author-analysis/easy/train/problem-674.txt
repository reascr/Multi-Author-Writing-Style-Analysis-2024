Jokes on you Russia captured the super top secret underground biolabs and reverse engineered the super soldier serum to create an army of super chickens They are three times the size of a Lada and trained by Steven Segal himself!
I disagree. Putin is that desperate and most definitely that stupid. He wouldn't be in Ukraine at all if he was smart. He'll do it, just watch. He will order an attack on Kyiv through Belarus, which is 100 km away. It will be a gift to Ukraine. A column of 50,000 soldiers requires over 2,000 vehicles just to transport soldiers. They'll have to travel on a single road, M01, that can be blocked with the greatest of ease by blowing bridges and laying mines. If the Ukrainians are smart (and they are), they'll let the Russians advance about 50 km, then destroy the entire column. Block the front, block the rear, and everyone in between either dies or surrenders. The poor fucks who take part will know that they're dead meat. Mass mobilization is meaningless without the ability to train, equip, transport, and supply. It's extra meaningless if the soldiers lack the will to fight.
