It hasn't even been a YEAR yet. Only a short while ago, I couldn't fathom how quickly Germany went from the 1920s to 1939 just like that, and these days, that feels slow compared to the breakneck pace of 2020, 21, 22, and now 23. I don't want to see 24.
Eventually. They got Roe overturned. This is clearly an effort to challenge Obergefell. If that's successful, Lawrence and/or Griswold will be next. After that, who knows?

Even if they're forced to recognize out-of-state marriages, I guarantee you they'll force people married out of state to provide a certified copy of their marriage license (which can usually only be requested either from the state itself, or from the local municipality where the marriage was performed, and usually at a cost per copy) every single time they need to do anything that makes their marriage relevant. Spouse dying in the hospital? No visitations without a certified copy of the marriage license. Filing taxes jointly? Submit a certified copy of the license.
