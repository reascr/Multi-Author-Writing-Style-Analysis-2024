Who said gangs run Jamaica? You just made that up and tried to pass that off on me. Every country in the world has a criminal underbelly. Try to insult my country for no reason and don't think I'm going to clap back. Fuck out of here.
Haiti is begging for international intervention. And even if most of your points revolve around us not putting any boots on the ground then at least back a group within Haiti and give them support to regain control of their country. But no, the only thing redditors on this sub do is claim itâ€™s a lost cause crap country while simultaneously rabidly asking for the western worlds entire arsenal for Ukraine. Not Palestine or Yemen or South Sudan get any sort of acknowledgment or support.
What's Central America's overall military capabilities? Could they try to form some kind of coalition effort?
Chaos basically. Something like half of the country is controlled by gangs that do anything they want so the government asked for other countries to invade and stabilize the situation.
