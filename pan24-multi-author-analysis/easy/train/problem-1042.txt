Reality is when these laws were made it wouldn’t have even been questioned why they were needed. That was just how it was and the conception of gender identity and what being trans means would have been far more simplistic and set in the ideas of a gender binary, which would have involved a trans person having already gone through as full a transition as medically possible at that time. And women can’t be allowed to have the equipment to biologically “father”(for lack of a better term) children.
That’s interesting. Since I assume that doesn’t mean Finnish people aren’t aware of the distinction between “sex” being the biological fact based (somewhat arbitrarily) on DNA and hormones and “gender” being the behavior/appearance/etc. independent of DNA, I’m curious how that distinction is expressed in Finnish. A lot of conversations I’ve had in English kind of break down when we use them interchangeably, so I assume there’s some kind of phrasing that makes it clear which one a Finnish speaker is referring to?
