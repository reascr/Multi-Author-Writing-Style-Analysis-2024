The world was being divided up a long long time ago. I don't know if you noticed or not but the previous empires that did that (like England, France, Spain) ended up losing control. This is just another round but hopefully an influx of industry will help these African nations rally and really grow past their constant wars with their neighbors. shrug.
There were photos of some of the people using the cans as makeshift milling stones to grind up grains that were also delivered to them (I forget the grain in question but the issue was the people were unfamiliar with how to cook/prepare it and or didn't have access to clean water to cook it) so they milled it into a powder and ate it raw.
I wasn't missing that point at all. I was responding to comment that said the industrialization of Africa via this method would be a good thing. I don't think Africans have a choice but lets not ptrend this is being done for alturstic reasons or without massive strings attached. The PR will not match remotely the reality of what will unfold. I think you and I agree mostly agree, given the examples you listed employed the same tactics.
