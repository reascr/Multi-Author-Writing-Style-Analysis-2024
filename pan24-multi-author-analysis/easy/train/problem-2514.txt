You'll be surprised on how much killing senior leadership affects an organization. I mean AL Qaeda is no longer the big threat it used to be to the US (its what happens when you kill the guy who had the resources and connections to pull off global attacks), shit they were almost completely wiped out in Afghanistan after Osamas death and their numbers dwindle again after Zawahiris death. I say keep killing them.
Let's not forget Russia is happy to send troops into combat with no training (learn as you go) no gear or ammunition (pick up whatever the guy who just got shot in front of you was using) no money (dead soldiers family receive - at best- potatoes and a loaf of bread If I recall) and literally no morale (fight or be shot as a deserter) lovely place to live that Russia.
Lol what did you want to do with Lindh? He didn't fight Americans and didn't really do anything but get trained by an evil organization.
interesting idea. however, as we can see in the URL of this reddit post and the original source, usually _all_ punctuation is stripped of, soâ€¦ I kinda doubt this is the reason.
