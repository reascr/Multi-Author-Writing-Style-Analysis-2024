In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Ok. I have a career in politics that tells me otherwise. Voting for or against the continued existence of democracy is a little more serious than buying a 6-pack of Pepsi because youâ€™re sick of Coke ads. But we can leave this here.
Related info: voting is mandatory in Australia (you get a small fine if you fail to vote, meaning we get 95% voter turnout, it works), it's a time honoured tradition that once you vote, you buy a sausage wrapped in bread from one of the local volunteers next to the voting station, which is usually a local public school or town hall. We call it our Democracy Sausage. The event of cooking up heaps of sausages is often called a Sausage Sizzle because that's what it sounds like. We don't complicate things.
Polling is terribly unreliable in this particular political climate. Polsters survey "likely voters." And what we saw in the midterms was that there are a lot more unlikely voters showing up than polls would suggest.
