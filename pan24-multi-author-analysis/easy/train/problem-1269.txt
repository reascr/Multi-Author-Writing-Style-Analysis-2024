Honestly, before the news story had you ever heard of New College. I live in Florida and toured it two years ago with my daughter. Its tiny in a state that has enormous (and pretty good too) universities like UCF (sometimes biggest in country), FIU (Also always listed in that biggest list) and UF and FSU. Despite their size they are still selective and 80% of students come from Florida. This means we have a shortage despite enormous ongoing growth in higher ed. During my tour the admissions officer actually whined about the legislature wanting them to grow to 1200 students from their current 800. He made it sound like the legislature was imposing an overwhelming burden. Had New College been a good community member they would have figured that like all other universities in Florida they would need to grow to meet the demands of the growing population. They didn't come of as members of the state system but as an entitled exclusive club. Most residents had never heard of them either so don't be embarrassed to admit you hadn't. Their claims to fame is as a stand honors college. They don't have grades and students develop their own course of study guided by professors. To be fair its a cool model and some graduates have gone on to to do great things. You don't hear much about that now though. If you look at graduates starting media salary they are below other state schools. Their grad school admissions rates are higher but higher than the honors college at UCF, UF or FSU. They had been an ignored novelty for a long time and as a resident, some new purpose was probably needed. I will note my daughter was offered a fully funded slot but went to FSU anyway.
