Great. Thanks for the answer. I appreciate you taking the time to explain more too me. A shame I get downvoted just for asking but that’s Reddit I guess. Cheers.
Terrible ! I grew up in Cochise County and the house I lived in looked out across the San Pedro Valley. It is an absolutely beautiful area. Please take this abomination down.

Republican leaders love illegal immigrants. It's cheap labor without any worker protections, practically slaves.
Yeah interesting. That was along what I sensed as well. I’m sure border security is important, especially in certain areas, but a massive wall didn’t work in medieval time and would be less effective now.
Serious question from a non-America… why is it so bad to just build a continuous wall to help enforce the border? Would it not help at all? How much would it really cost? Politically, couldn’t agreeing to build a wall help reach a political consensus that includes an improved immigration policy?
