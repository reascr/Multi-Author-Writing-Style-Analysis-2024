"Sixteen Michigan Republicans who posed as presidential electors and falsely declared that Donald Trump won the 2020 election are in legal trouble again.
Three of the stateâ€™s presidential electors who cast ballots for Joe Biden filed a lawsuit against the Republicans and are asking a judge to declare that the 'fake elector scheme was illegal under Michigan law.'".
the republican national committee supports sending fake electors to misrepresent the votes of the people in individual states. they support the violent overthrow of the government. and they support trump who has committed a dozen felonies. if they didnt they would denounce all of these things and reject candidates and office holders who do. instead they actively endorse candidates who have actively participated in and/or enthusiastically support everything i've listed. they should have kicked trump and his racist base to the curb years ago. instead they build fake jail cells at cpac for the faithful to step inside, kneel down and pray to an actor representing a violent insurrectionist who beat police officers and threatened the lives of government officials. GOP is the party of hang mike pence. if they're not - where is the outrage? if i sent fake electors to dc i'd be in jail. where's trump? golfing? bullshit.
