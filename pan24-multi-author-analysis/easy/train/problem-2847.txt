I wonder what kind of citizens we will see coming through with such a decrease in socialising etc that they have experienced due to COVID(?).
A part of this that a lot of people might not know, is that teachers were given a 5% pay rise but schools weren't given any additional funding to pay for it - So many teaching assistants are leaving because their pay and conditions suck and schools can barely afford to hire new ones. It's pretty fucked.
Inflation/cost of living. It makes for a good time to strike as support will be high and sympathy will be high. These sectors have been neglected for sometime so they are striking to increase pay. The only problem is a lot of these unions are asking for obscene pay rises (borderline ridiculous) which puts the government in a bit of a bind.
The government is playing hardball (they have to and can afford to as the unions don't give financial contributions to them) but what some of these unions have asked for is utterly ridiculous. Ironically the ones that lose out are the workers.
