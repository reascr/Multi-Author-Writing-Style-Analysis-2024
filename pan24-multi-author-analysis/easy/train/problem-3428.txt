I feel for you. I'm originally from Louisiana and I always felt outnumbered when discussing politics. I have a friend who felt the same. He was always the smartest person in the room. And while I'm not a genius, I'm extremely well read, a history geek. Plus I'm fluent in a couple of difficult foreign languages. Believe me, I'm not trying to brag, it's just disheartening to be considered an idiot when discussing politics. Don't these people realize that I research my political positions? I do my best to get all the facts. I don't have a problem when people disagree, but please be armed with the facts. Instead I have people with faint knowledge of issues calling me stupid.

She's just a loudspeaker broadcasting propaganda and conspiracy theories. The more power she's given, the more obvious it becomes.
