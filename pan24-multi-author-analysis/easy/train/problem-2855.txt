They tried that for a while before the 1st intifada. Hamas, the PLO, and Islamic Jihad all renounced violence and Israel went about a year with zero attacks, other than a Molotov attack by a random teenage girl against an armored truck (don't worry the IDF shot her immediately after). Israel responded with the "Iron Fist" policy of violently dispersing protests, arresting Arabs who boycotted Israeli businesses, bulldozing houses of suspected "terrorists" (remember there were zero attacks in this period) usually without even putting them on trial, mass deportations of Arabs, and raids against occupied Palestinian villages when they refused to pay taxes to the state of Israel. This got the major Arab terror groups into launching attacks again and within about 5 years they got Israel to recognize the PLO and begin the peace process.
Semantics matter. If words don't matter, then why not describe the truth accurately? And semantics is the argument here. a statement calling Palestine a country was made. I called it out for being false. You many not like it, but it is true nonetheless.
