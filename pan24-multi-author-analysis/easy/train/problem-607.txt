(Only loosely related, but on the Ukraine conflict, I'm generally in favor of working out peace terms as soon as practical, before either country really hits a hard limit on something, which I'm kind of amazed neither one has already. I'm on the side of all the territory seized since 2014 being UKR's by right, but my hot-take here is that Kiev & the West should remain loose on the final status of at least parts of Crimea, and in particular Sevastopol: for long-standing reasons both commercial & military, I think Russia really would fight to the proverbial last man before it gave up that city, knowing that there's no returning to the prewar status quo of leasing it from Kiev; not now.^).
Well itâ€™s not like blind. Almost everyone in Ukraine has someone executed or starved to death, or hardly survived from starvation by Russia in their family. And now many will have story about someone being murdered, raped, with house destroyed, died from booms or at war or displaced in their family or friends circle on top of generational trauma. Really hard to close your eyes on these even if you really want.
