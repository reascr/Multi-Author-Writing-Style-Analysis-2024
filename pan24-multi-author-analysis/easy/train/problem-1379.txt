Vaccinated people DO have antibodies towards covid. I know because, despite never having covid, I got all three vaccines and the Red Cross has told me that the antibodies I made are present in my blood when I donate it. But those who receive my blood in a transfusion do not have the ability to make those antibodies themselves simply because they got mine. They would need to have the vaccine or have fought the covid virus.
No, it is it not a form of vaccination. The mRNA vaccines create a biological code that allows your body to artificially create the spike proteins that the coronaviruses have. Your body mass produces these spike proteins to simulate an infection. Then your body learns how to fight the real coronavirus effectively because it fought the artificial spike proteins.
Anti-vaxxers... While they are free to not take covid vaccinations themselves (being protected by everyone else who did take the vaccine), to deliberately cause or support the death of a baby because of this irrational belief is criminal.
