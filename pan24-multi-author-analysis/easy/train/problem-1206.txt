Not necessarily sure that's true. Most of the other alternatives are not China-based, and the ones that are don't quite match TSMC's capabilities (and so long as the ASML export restrictions are in place they won't have the tooling to do so for a while). Right now the primary alternatives to TSMC are Samsung (S. Korea) and Intel (USA), with several other suppliers like GlobalFoundries and Toshiba (I think) providing capacity for less cutting edge chips. If anything I think it would open up an opportunity for one of the latter to move in. You can be damn sure that if China goes through with an attack on Taiwan they will get sanctioned to hell and back at best and no Chinese firm would be able to take advantage of that opening as a result. They would lose almost all of their Western customers overnight and be severely limited in procuring new business.
Caterpillar? That mining equipment that you're about to ship out to that iron mine in Australia? Nope, sorry. That equipment is going to this new rare earths mine. Tell the Aussies their shipment is delayed. Don't like it? If you ever want to see a contract from the Defense Department again, you better start liking it.
