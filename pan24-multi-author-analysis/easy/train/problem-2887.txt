In my dream, I wasn't very big, maybe the size of an X-Wing. Physiologically, I remember being fleshy and not metallic. It was a super short dream, but I remember my homeworld was being destroyed so myself and a bunch of other rocket-people were fleeing when we got swarmed and cut down from behind. I immediately had another dream where I was a starship captain in the Federation doing something really boring out by Saturn, but it was really vivid so I was enjoying the shit out of it. This was a long time ago, though. Saturn imploded in my dream world a couple of years ago. I was on the Moon when it happened, and it was pretty terrifying. We knew it was coming, but it was surprising af all the same. I think we all died, but we respawned. AFAIK, Saturn's still gone.
Totally different. Remember, COVID was faceless, we couldn’t stop it with weapons of mass destruction, and we blamed another country for its origin. An xenomorph attack from out of this world? It’s like a rallying cry for humanity!
