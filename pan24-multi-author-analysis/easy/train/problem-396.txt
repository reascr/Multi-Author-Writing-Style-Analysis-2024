Most conservatives i know, myself included, are not opposed to aiding Ukraine, we're wondering why Europe isn't footing most of the bill or at least a larger portion. Everyone is all for toppling Putin, it's just that were the ones spending most that money. Meanwhile, I have Canadian and European friends who only a few years ago criticized American military spending and advocated for the whole healthcare arguement in its stead. Only know they're ok with how much our military spends, but they still wonder why we don't have universal health care or other social programs.
