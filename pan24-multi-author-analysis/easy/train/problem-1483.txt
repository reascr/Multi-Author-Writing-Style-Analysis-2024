Does anyone really think we will be able to stay under 1.5C warming ? I am starting to think even 2C is a big long-shot. A good example of this is what happened in the US. People were stressing about high gas prices, so the US Gov releases its reserve to lower the price to help the party in power. This alone proves we are on the "highway to hell" so to speak. And yes, the "other party" would have done the same.
Boron is already being used in a number of different applications, including aerospace engineering, metalworking, and glassmaking. In the future, boron could also be used to create more efficient batteries and storage devices for renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Thanks to FEAM's efforts, we may soon see boron becoming an even more integral part of our clean energy future.
FEAM is helping to provide a clean source of energy by mining boron. Boron is a uniquely valuable resource because it has the ability to store and release energy repeatedly without degradation, meaning that it can be used as both a fuel and an energy storage medium.
No. And that means that all other targets are at best a "maybe", cause once we pass 1.5 several amplifying feedback loops will be triggered and we have yet no idea how severe the results will be. Once that threshold is past, there is the possibility that even if humans stopped all emissions immediately, climate change would just keep going until all current ecosystems are destroyed.
