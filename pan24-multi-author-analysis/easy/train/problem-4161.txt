Walmart has the highest number of workers receiving assistance. While not well known, a friend actually received assistance applications in her welcome packet. Walmart is well aware that they don't pay living wages and literally provide the documentation to subsidize by using Federal and state benefit programs. People in America aren't angry enough. Many are in the "fear" mode where they fear losing everything if they take to the streets. People need to start talking to one another and find the commonalities where everyone stands up together. Wage theft is a huge issue. It's why companies often don't want you to talk to about your pay with your co-workers. When people doing the labor start talking, then you get people ready to take action. Until people can work through their fear of losing everything to foment change, the corporations and billionaires and stockholders win.
