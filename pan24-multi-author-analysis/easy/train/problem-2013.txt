Bit of a rant here: because of how fractured the system is there is so much waste. For instance healthcare administration cost is ridiculous. Needing to order duplicate tests (especially when it’s urgent and you can’t wait for records to get to you) drive up costs. There are also certain treatments that decrease cost overall, but are not properly funded because the entity that would save money is not the entity that pays for it. The lack of access to good preventative care is also a problem. If there was a single payer, then there will be much greater emphasis on prevention of illness. Also how certain treatments are reimbursed needs to change. If conservative management of a problem (for instance a medication) is just as helpful as a procedure (such as surgery) then the treatment should be reimbursed the same. There is not much incentive for surgeons not to do surgery when it pays so much better. There are also many other non-ethical reasons but these are just a few of the cost related reasons.

Social security? Republicans have been gunning for it for almost a century now, looks like they might finally be able to kill it once and for all.
Given current reimbursements. What administrative burdens either completely removed or tweaked would allow you to take on more Medicaid patients today?
