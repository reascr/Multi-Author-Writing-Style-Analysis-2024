One of their favorite phrases throughout Trump’s presidency and after (if you’re able to get past their “ThAt’S jUsT fAkE nEwS1” reflexive and also learned first response, that is) in response to any news related to “Trump did X” was/is “Allegedly, Trump did X, allegedly…” and is usually paired with “Has he been charged and convicted for X ? If not, then that’s just more reason this is just fAkE nEwS” the implication being that no amount of evidence would convince them that Dear Leader committed X until he’s convicted for X. So until he’s actually charged and convicted, he’s innocent until proven guilty in a court of law and so he’s innocent—he’s done nothing wrong but he’s being subjected to a witch hunt by fAkE nEwS Allegedly allegedly aLlEgEdLy!1,” without any indication of them being aware of the irony in that statement.

Not necessarily. Look at the Aussies. They used a voluntary buy back program and it was largely effective. They aren't a shooting dumpster fire.
