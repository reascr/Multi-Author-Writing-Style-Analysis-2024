Ironically, with the Russian Army being ground to bits in Ukraine and the Europeans re-arming it becomes much easier for the US to pivot to the Pacific. Thanks Putin?
If the United States prioritizes its economy, sure, that can improve, but at the cost of the independence of a country with tens and tens of millions of people, and if Ukraine falls to Russia, Russia will enforce its laws, including the ability to illegalize political rivals and a ban on any positive depiction of homosexuality, upon Ukrainians. Basically, if Ukraine falls, Putin will presumably be ruler until he dies and Ukrainian homosexuals won't be legally allowed to express their homosexuality. Moreover, if the Russian military can conquer Ukraine easily enough, Putin will potentially decide he wants even more countries to be under Russian control, and the cycle of Russian invasions will repeat itself.
If the United States prioritizes Ukraine, the American economy will remain in less than perfect shape for a while, but at least the people of Ukraine, and by extension, Eastern European countries that Putin might invade if Ukraine falls, can resist the iron fist of Putin.
