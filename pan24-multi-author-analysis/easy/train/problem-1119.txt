this proactive crossing the center straight line activity happens soooo many times regularly or even daily basis, I think the majority of Chinese and Taiwanese people are really immune to it, unless something much more severe happens like actions when Pelosi landed, compared to westurn audiences who are not exposed to these news much, who think this is a very big deal and war signal.
Lol. If the west didn’t “allow” China in, the west would’ve suffered economically and China would’ve formed their own trade bloc. But sure, make it sound like an act of charity from the west. The KMT were mainly supported for fighting Japanese and communists, which you strangely left out. The US even supported Apartheid South Africa in fighting communism when it threatened to spread to Southern Africa. Ideology, repressive regimes ,tyrants….it all didn’t matter as long as your enemy was their enemy.
Seriously. COVID is tearing their country apart. There's discord in the country. Economy is started to get much worse. People had started to rebel and had a slight uprising. This leads to decreased morale from citizens and inefficient soldiers. Threats won't work, beatings won't work, their social credit system is leading to inequality within the middle class and their employment rates are tanked. What you see from their media is obviously not what is happening there. Poverty stricken areas are only going to get worse. Like Russia. All bark, no bite.
