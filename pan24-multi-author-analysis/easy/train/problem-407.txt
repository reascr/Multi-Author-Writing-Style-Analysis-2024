That would be falling victim a major shift in the Overton window. Do not forget that the last time we had a republican controlled government they lied us into a decades long unnecessary war, illegally surveilled American citizens, fired attorney generals to kill investigations into their wrongdoings, locked people up with no trials, conducted torture programs, and along with a long list of other crimes and offenses, damn near crashed the world economy on top of everything else. I don't see how settling for that would be a win at all.

Romney agrees with the Republican party on practically everything except for partisanship taking a priority over acknowledging reality. He's not even remotely a Democrat. He is more like what Republicans should be; no big change in policy positions, but just not willing to slander the military, overlook obvious corruption and lies, etc.
