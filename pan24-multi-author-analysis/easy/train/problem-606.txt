We'd be lying if we told trans children that. They don't have to just make it to 18 and cope with the emotional/psychological and potentially psychiatric damages already incurred by then, they also have to live the rest of their lives with the life long biological implications - they'll never be free of the consequences these people want to subject them to.
It is. Every single second, dysphoria is always in the back of my mind. The times where I feel wholly content are extremely rare bursts of when someone goes above and beyond to affirm my gender and even still they do not last for more than a moment. My body is like a prison to me that I cannot escape out of. I came out at 14 and started hormones at 16 and even still I face so much damage that I will need to work so hard to undo. And I am one of the extremely lucky ones. Every day I reflect and am thankful that I was given the opportunity to transition, because not everybody is. Every day, I count my lucky stars that people in my life have been accepting of me. But that has not fully solved the deep and internal wrong that has been placed within the deepest depths of my body. Only medically, and eventually surgically transitioning will reach the final step.
