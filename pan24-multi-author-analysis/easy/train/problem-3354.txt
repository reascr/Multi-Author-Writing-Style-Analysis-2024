Well, that's not good. Without that line, the US and the Soviet Union would collapsed into nuclear war over simple misunderstandings about fifty times during the Cold War. I really feel like people don't take the possibility of nuclear annihilation as seriously as we used to. It's that thing where, if something hasn't actually happened yet, then everyone just assumes that it never will. That's a really bad thing to assume.

Exactly. Why wasn't that the headline news item for a week or more? I mean, I read about it briefly, but in no way did it consume the news cycle in the way that the threat of our civilization exploding should have.
