So I read a really good article about her a few years back. In summation.She grew up in the toney ATL suburbs. She graduated from UGA &went to work for her dads construction company. Her dad “ sold” it to her and her husband 20 years ago. She had an “on paper” CFO position at said construction company. She popped out 3 Kids. Made a whole buncha 💰 She got bored and restless. She Simultaneously found religion and CrossFit in her mid 30’s. She founded her own CrossFit “ box” and had multiple extra- marital affairs🤢 🤮 She started getting active politically on Facebook circa 2017 or so. Started posting lives of her harassing drag queens at libraries etc. She finally found her true identity/ assumed her final form as a hateful/bigoted/ irrational GQP troll. She’s essentially a wealthy, bored housewife with more money than sense, who’s finally gotten the attention that her ugly, troglodyte ass has craved for all of her life.
