We should also ban water as 100% of all people that have died every year drunk water! Absolutely dangerous shit.
Give the police more money. That is what happens here. The police in america have military grade weapons thanks to Obama ( it might have been bush after 9/11 but I think Obama continued it ) I believe. Theyâ€™ve just been collecting and collecting military style weaponry and vehicles for almost two decades now. I wonder what for ? Hmmmmm.
Saying guns were made to injure and kill is not a straw man at all. It is 100% fact. The first guns were made and used to defend the great wall of China. They were made for a military purpose to hurt or kill attackers.
Guns are made to injure or kill living things. Cars are not, cars are actually getting more and more safe as time goes by. Gun get more and more effective at injuring or killing.
Guns are designed and made to injure and kill. I am not against guns. I even said I have no issue with people owning them. But they use them to hunt. Guns are made to KILL living things. People choose what living things they point them at.
i dont think making as barrel is a simple as machining a rod of steel, you need the right alloy, this rod of steel needs to be forged into form rather than just cast, probably after machining it requires some prost processing, probably some kynd of hardening, you may make a gun barrel out of your garage, but probably not one that would be a durable one.
