They would not see it on radar, they would have to be in visual range and looking in the right direction. The best part is, the new F15EX was designed to use the F22 and F35 as forward observers. The F15 can carry 30,000 lbs of air to air missiles (The f22 can only carry 4 air to air missiles internally, external spots would make it not stealth). So the F15EX sits back while the F22 remains stealth and approaches the enemy, sends back the targeting data and the F15 launches missiles from well beyond visual range to get the kill, all while the F22 is remaining in stealth mode and undetected.
Well... Yes and no. China keeps them around because it's preferable to having a US ally on their border, and because they don't want to have to deal with the huge humanitarian/refugee crisis that the collapse of the Kim regime would probably lead to. China doesn't want to give them everything they need, and in fact is quite keen to make sure that they don't/can't start a war. A war on the Korean peninsula would be very unlikely to really benefit China, and could end up being very costly for them.
