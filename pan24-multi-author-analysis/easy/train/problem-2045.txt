Instead of all this incoherent thinking upon thinking you could actually go, read and learn how different and unique people in each country are, how cultures differ, traditions, mentality and religion. There are many sects in Islam. Due to the absence of khalif since the fall of Ottoman empire there is no central theological person to provide the homogenous spiritual guidance, and thus Muslims kinda agreed that each country has the right to proceed with their own religious jurisprudence. Sharia in one country may be different from another, while in others there may be no sharia at all, but a civil law. Everyone tries different shit with plethora of outcomes. With all your uses of a word "reasonable", you unreasonably want to justify generalization of people, how nice of you. Just because of the stupid shit Taliban says it doesn't mean that Turkish people will do it too, even though they are Muslims. Muslims means being a believer of a single one God, that's it, literal translation, but the stuff around it may vary.
Sustainable development cannot handle a population doubling each generation indefinitely. This will obviously contribute to the famine and unemployment that has already hit a nation now dependent on drying up foreign aid.
