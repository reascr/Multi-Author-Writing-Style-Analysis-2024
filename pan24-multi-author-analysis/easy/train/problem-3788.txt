I seen it and yeah I agree that his invincibility is gone. I've heard similar anecdotes and seen the same in the conservatives I know who voted Trump twice and went to bat for him in the past. I think of it exactly like domestic abuse and assume he will assert himself, they will tell their friends they are getting out, but then they'll stick around. Until an alternative challenges him out loud and the party joins them, he is the party front runner. Nobody wants to square up and most likely add themselves to the rest of the republican careers he ended. I do think there would be others in a hypothetical primary. My crystal ball says that because of his narcissism, he will make it clear on his own that they are his hostage, which will likely cause these challengers (not DeSantis) to appear, but they will be so incomprehensibly unelectable or afraid of him/maga that he still gets the nom. I don't think we've seen the dumbest/most vile GOP personalities yet.

"Real MAGA will never support McCarthy," wrote Anthony Sabatini, another former congressional candidate. "Fake MAGA supports McCarthy.".
Mid term elections are historically terrible. I don't think that means anything during a presidential election.
