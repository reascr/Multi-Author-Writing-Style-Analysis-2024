I'll never support a Republican. But I feel so politically isolated nowadays. We can't afford to be so extreme anymore. Everybody is on the limitless funds for Ukraine train now. And if you question it, you're just a heartless bastard. What about all the other countries at war, the brown ones without oil & natural gas? How much should we spend on them?
A few billion to offload old munitions and systems and test new ones in an actual war scenario (compared to an insurgency scenario or training scenario), plus help put an opposing country decades behind in military strenh, strenhen ties with a large grain producing country and send a message to other geopolitical opponents that a war is basically just an affordable meme to the US is incredible ROI.
Yes. Both Russia and China are really testing their limits right now. To be fair, they're not doing anything we haven't done for the last 80 years. But yes, I believe we need air defense on our borders, as well as the borders between our allies and adversaries.
Does the U.S. government need to be defending innocent lives within our borders? Is that what you're asking?
