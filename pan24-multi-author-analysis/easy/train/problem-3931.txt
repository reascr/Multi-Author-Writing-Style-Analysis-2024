Well it was initially going to be about COVID mandates, but then they found out Canada is a confederacy and the federal government has even less power than the US government, and almost every COVID mandate from masks to curfews to lockdowns was put in place by the provincial Premiers. Well they found one that wasn't - the requirement that people crossing the border be vaccinated. Mostly because the US had the same requirement going the other way.

Eh. Canada like a lot of countries thought there was a balance between what scientists were saying and what business was saying. We did not shut down airports or other transport anywhere near fast enough.
The most idiotic and uneducated people in Canada not understanding mandates. When asked, they couldn’t give you a coherent response as to what they actually were protesting. Still seen driving around rural areas with trump stickers on their lifted trucks. Extremely embarrassing to be sharing the same air as them.
