I'm tired of this idiocy. Look we can go on and on about which party colludes with Russia and how they interfere with US elections.. but there is a trove of information publicly available, and for a long time now, on the Clinton Presidential Archive. Transcripts between Clinton and Yeltsin DECIDING over the phone who would succeed Yeltsin. That's right, the US didn't "possibly tamper" with Russian elections in the 90s.. we flat out rigged their democratic process bc, as the transcripts between the leaders show, we thought Putin was strong but would play ball with US goals. Once again, we installed a government, and when the country we sidelined democracy in doesn't want to capitulate any longer, we jump up and down screaming how they are evil and we need to bring them democracy with some bombs. Putin has obviously gone off the deep end, but it's disgusting how much people will regurgitate propaganda without even a modicum of critical analysis or an iota of allowing for our own culpability.
That's feels about right. And feelings are evidence these days so those pedophile elites creating a war to distract and also export Ukraine kids feels like concrete evidence to me.
