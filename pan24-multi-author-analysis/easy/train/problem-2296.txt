as if you had some knowledge of what, exactly, was remarkable about his performance. You have nothing to back up that claim. For all we know the midterm elections might have gone even better with someone else in that position. That is all.
You don't even know what you're asking for, going from "sourced examples of specific actions" to "public accolades", so I will assume you don't know what the DCCC/NRCC/NRSC/DSCC or their leaders do, or of any way to argue against the results of the campaign as the assessment of a campaign leader lmao.
Because of how he lost. First he inserts himself into a district he hasn't lived in where popular progressive Democrat Mondaire Jones has a seat. Mondaire Jones is then forced to compete in a district he never has lived in or competed in and loses. Then in the primary against another candidate to his left he amplifies the "crime is out of control" narratives amplifying messaging that is damaging his party in the state. And then just refuse to campaign on the ground in your district and give up a district Biden won by 10 points to the Republicans.
