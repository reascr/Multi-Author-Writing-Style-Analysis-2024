Why would any developer put up with his demand for, if I remember right, 70 hours of work per week? As a dev, I know how easy it is to find a shit ton of jobs, especially with a big name like Twitter in your employment history. Why he expected them to put up with this is beyond me. Maybe you can push people who don't have many options, but in this case he's pushing people who generally have a lot of options and would be rehired in less than a week.
Seriously. What a dumb idea, telling a bunch of software engineers, “Click this button and commit to working 70+ hour weeks, or else you’ll be given 3 months of pay.”.
Absolutely. Worst case he tells you to fuck off, and you do, right into another job that'll pay the same as your current salary or more. Best case, he actually gives it to you, and then you're rich.
Apparently some of those microservices he had the engineers disable were responsible for authentication, specifically 2FA. There are a number of people on Twitter itself and /r/Twitter that were having issues with new logins.
