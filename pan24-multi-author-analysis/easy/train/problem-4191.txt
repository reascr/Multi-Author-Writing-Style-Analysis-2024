They didn't. It was filibustered by Republicans because it couldn't pass the 60 vote threshold. Instead of letting it all die, they passed a modified version with a 24% raise and the ability to take time off for medical appointments without being penalized. Your argument is the same garbage peddled during the Obamacare debates like Democrats are at fault for Republicans being shitty.
This is some straight Republican messaging bullshit. Let's be clear, Republicans and Manchin voted against the paid sick days. Blaming it on Democrats is just straight fucking lying.

That’s disingenuous. House Democrats put forth a bill to give them paid sick leave. Passed it. Republican senators refused to sign on. Stop “both side!s” When the majority of demarcates voted for it and republicans killed it. FFS.
