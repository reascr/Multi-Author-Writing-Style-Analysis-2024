The questions I pose are to highlight how unnecessary those concerns are. So, here's some answers. They're reconnaissance balloons. Variations of them have been used since WWI. It's cheaper and easier than using satellites, and they can be directed easily or stay in place for a period of time, whereas satellites have a narrow effective window as they constantly circle the globe and the cost of changing their trajectory is high, given the limited fuel. Geosynchronous orbits are too far away for spy satellites, and even if there was some crazy amazing camera where they could still be useful, it's still stuck looking at the same thing forever, which is great for communications but awful for general reconnaissance at that cost.
Exactly. The US military spent a ton of time and resources recovering the spy balloon debris from the ocean. Doubt they did all that just to see how good Chinaâ€™s cameras are. The assumption is this balloon had more capabilities than just photos.
Exactly. What we do know is if the pentagon assessed these balloons to be a serious threat, they would have no problem shooting them down before they got close to anything sensitive. Now that they have one in their possession, they can more easily determine the purpose and determine if they actually do pose a threat.
