Outstanding! President is in country without any US military support and travels 10 hours each way by train from Poland to Kiev. Dinner, Church visit with wreath laying to remember Ukrainian military losses, US even let Putin know in advance Biden would be in Ukraine. Ballsy move man.

Yes actually. I am a democrat. I live in the city. I generally don't have a lot of contact with the republicans in the country side. I vote. Don't know what to say about that. Democratic leadership isn't doing itself many favors though. They've largely abandoned the labor class in favor of corporate donors. The only reason Joe is doing any of the half measure new deal shit he is because Bernie ran for president.
