I do agree with his sentiments it's just I don't think I know enough about the other facts he presented other than how our currency started. It made me feel there was something fishy about it.
Because millionaires that didnt need it, got many mulitple hunderds of thousands or millions in loans and had their debts entirely forgiven, yet asshole republicans are fighting tooth and nail to prevent me from having $10,000 of my student loan debt be simply erased when after all is said and done I still pay back my entire principle?
I have a small business. I got some PPP funds for keeping my employee employed through covid, that was nice. They were also offering me additional loans, but I didn't specifically need them - we do computer service & were able to stay open and kept plenty busy. I did strange things like read the loan terms & deduced that I wouldn't/shouldn't qualify for them, as my spending wouldn't have been on anything forced by COVID, so I didn't take out any PPP loans. Apparently I should've for the free money...
