Sad to say so many people just want the title. Then are in the position and it eats them up. Remember a coworker years ago. Made crew leader position which you know you have to: train, do inventory and report status to an assistant manager and then that goes to the general manager. Also requires to know multiple positions. She only knew how to run a cash register, couldn’t clean worth a damn but was a very good people person. A month later she went on a break and didn’t come back. Couldn’t take staying later for reports and hated doing Friday inventory checks. She enjoyed going out those nights. I stepped up going. I have the same experience stepped up saying I do the job and be more than happy to take the responsibility since I had “no life” at that time. They gave it to the biggest asshole imagine and he was fired a week later for stealing money once he got an access key and ended up going to court. They finally gave me the position and we did not have one person quit for almost 8 months.

Anyone who likes republicans is undereducated, hateful or delusional. Not all people who support conservative ideas are though. Some are just ignorant or oblivious to anything outside their world.
