And besides, ultimately who at CNN or MSNBC would be equivalent to someone like a Brian Kilmeade, Sean Hannity, Kayleigh McEnamy , Ainsley Earnhardt, Jesse Watters, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Greg Gutfeld, Jeanine Pirro, Mark Levin, Harris Faulkner, Lisa Kennedy, Lara Trump, Dan Bongino, George Murdoch, Maria Bartiromo, or Emily Compagno?
Idk. I think there might be another category. The true believers care whether it’s true or not, and the power/money people care whether it’s true or not because that changes how you have to push it. The second one survives entirely off the first one, and so it works to increase the first one. I’m sometimes more afraid of the ones that couldn’t care less what’s true or not about the activities of either side so long as they very particular thing they want will be moved forward. I haven’t fully developed this theory yet. Just a thought I was having.
