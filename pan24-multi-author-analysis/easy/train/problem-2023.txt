Russia's and Iran's mutual arms deals plus Israel's aid to Ukraine are definitely putting a strain on Israeli-Russian relations, but it would take a lot more than that to sever their ties.
Israel and Russia are not friends, more like "we're enemies, but we have other things to focus on". Unlike Europe-Russia dynamics, there are many factors at play that decide how Israel-Russia relations progress. For both, it's impossible to just shut everything off and say "we're done talking". Europe can certainly afford such an approach.
This is because Israel can't really just be resumed, on a geopolitical level, to the Palestinian conflict - like most countries, it's a complex country with a multi-faceted society, and complicated relations with the other (also complex) countries surrounding them; and in Israel's case specifically, those relations tend to be even more complicated than the average, due to their unique history in the region.
Of course you know. We all fucking know. He takes care of his lieutenants, and they wanted him back. They wanted their money train to get back on the tracks and moving.
