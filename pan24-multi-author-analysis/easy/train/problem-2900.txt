Tschaikovsky shunned and threatend because he was gay, Shostakovitch constantly in fear of Stalin, Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky escaped and composed in the US, Dostoyevsky mock executed, Achmatovas husband died in the Gulags, the list goes on and on.
No. I can give a reluctant pass to Ukrainians doing so in their public arenas, as long as they aren't punitive about it, only a) because Russia used that as one of its excuses to invade them and hasn't backed off that line of thinking, and b) massive widespread trauma which could understandably be triggered by unexpected encounters with Russian symbolism, but there's no reason for supporting nations to do so. If anything, it just feeds into Putin's latest attempts to frame this as a grand culture war.
Exactly. Speaking as someone with Ukrainian roots who supports Ukraine with all my heart, this is silly. Many of the great historical Russian artists, writers, and composers were just as much victims of their country as anyone else-- especially those who, for instance, found themselves threatened and censored during the time of Stalin. Russia has oppressed its own citizens every bit as much as it has its neighbors, and treating the country as a monolith ignores that.
