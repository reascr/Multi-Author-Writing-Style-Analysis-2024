The US killed the nuclear deal. Why should Iran think they wouldn't kill the next one? Fool me once ....... Also Biden had the chance to resurrect the original deal when he got into office. He refused to do it, opting to push for more concessions. That's how we got here Trump, followed by Biden.
There’s potentially a change of a small tactical nuke being used on some non-urban battlefield if there were ever literal waves of soldiers and tanks being thrown at one another but otherwise, it’s unlikely that any civilian population on earth would stand for the offensive use of nukes against another civilian population. Any government that uses nukes as a last resort will likely end up having some sort of mutiny by its own military shortly after or full scale protests considering that use of nuclear weapons opens the gates for the other side to effectively use them indiscriminately.
