I'm pretty sure that's what they're doing, this article is just about them no longer keeping track of asymptomatic cases because Asymptomatic people don't usually get checked for COVID. Functionality the same policy as every other developed country.
Yup. The majority of the worlds' reporting services sort of just stopped releasing the stats when finally most of the world realized the COVID numbers are completely inaccurate and next to useless anyways, due to the flawed methodology of how they are collected, and the fact the numbers are collected to fit premade political narratives, not to measure COVID, or for better knowledge of how it spreads.
Okay and? They're easing up on it, which is exactly what the Chinese People want and what Western Media has been freaking out over for nearly two years. This is a "Damned if they do damned if they don't" situation. China is either bad for going for Zero Covid or they're bad for getting rid of that program and adopting similar measures to western countries. There's no winning with people who do not argue in good faith.
