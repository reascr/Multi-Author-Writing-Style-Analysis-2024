I wonder if they’re ever going to pay Benedict Arnold’s family the fuckton of money he lent the Revolution? A good part of the reason he never got the promotions he richly deserved is because they didn’t want to have to pay him back even though he was a legit badass battlefield commander and very much a hero of the revolutionary war. He got fucked like the kid that died in Lord of the Flies.
On a side note, acting like this could never be true and people are liars degrades the fact that through the genocide of stealing Indigenous children from their families and placing them in "Indian Schools" and doing other things to "Europeanize" created a multitude of generational gaps of people being raised in whiteness and thinking they had to marry white and then teach their children to do the same. It's easy enough to learn the history of colonization and genocide of Indigenous culture to not perpetuate ignorance and honor the tragedy that has been and continues to be.
