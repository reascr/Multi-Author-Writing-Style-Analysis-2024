Peter Zeihan talked about how stupid these balloons are today. He is a well respected foreign policy analyst. He said its just a dumb decision by the chinese. He explained why they did it. They are trying to learn how to scale up their nuclear deterant by seeing what the US does. Good Satellites can see all this.
Cost, maneuvering, and optical resolution. Satellites are expensive and have predictable orbits - you can just hide your assets at the right time. Optical resolution is limited by diffraction and atmospheric disturbance. Balloons can adjust altitude to hit air currents as a crude steering mechanism.
Plausible deniability. The potential ability to jettison the payload in the ocean if you're found out (or from anywhere and hope it doesn't survive the 60,000ft fall).
The instinctual prioritization of direct experience is an evolutionary problem. We have to fight our need to prefer a single data point (our own) vs a statistical truth. Notice how people prefer antivax anecdotes instead of the data from billions of prior shots.
