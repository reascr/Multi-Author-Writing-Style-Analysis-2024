I just don’t see how this is a win at all for Republican states. It is going to cause a massive brain drain as doctors (OBGYNs) and their spouses leave for states they can practice proper medicine. Young professionals will also want to move to states that align more closely with their progressive ideas. The rate of single mothers requiring welfare will rise, creating a further drain on the state social resources. Arguably crime will go up as unstable homes cause higher crime rates.
It also was an explicitly religious institution, my opinion is that it's because understood as that Christianity was very interested in scholarship at the time and was asserting it's control over scholarship rather than opposing learning.
I’m 28. Even among my age group, the Republican Party is just increasingly toxic with each passing year. Sure, there is that 30% who are still Republicans, but they are in the minority in a lot of places, even a lot of sparsely populated areas. And among those younger it’s even stronger. Every year another few million people turn 18 and these elections have shown they are determined to vote.
