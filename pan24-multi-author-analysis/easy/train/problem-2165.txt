Not the commentor, but the 20% number appears to be a rough estimate. The sources for that are VERY hard to compile because such a statistic, at a surface level glance, is not centralized...compounded by the retention policies of the states themselves, plus the federal government. Organizations like the Death Penalty Information Center and the Equal Justice Initiative, among others, have been trying to compile that data; but it faces the same headwinds that attorneys face when trying to convince judges to reopen death penalty cases: witnesses, law enforcement, evidence, and time.
Why is that, though? Until the actual death sentence is passed, they are “normal” (in the sense of eating, sleeping, guards) prisoners, so the cost should be the same as a life sentence; at some point that sentence gets carried out, so the daily cost is cut short and gets replaced by a “one time payment” for the execution itself.
Thank you. I wasn't convinced that I was correct in my assumptions, but after you laid out the facts like that, well, you have definitely changed my mind.
