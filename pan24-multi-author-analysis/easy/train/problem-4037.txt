One might be tempted, in fact, to compare it to Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana, and that would be somewhat of a fair comparison now, but those states are actually beginning to grow and move ahead of where Ohio is behavioriorally, economically, and culturally.
Woman's right to choose. Well, there is another choice that nobody wants to mention. How about the choice to have unprotected sex. All this talk about A womans right to choose. I sure wish there were more attention given to the initial choice. We have a very immoral society. Sex is glorified in our music and tv. People just want to pleasure themselves and they have no moral compass. Before I get blasted, men also have the responsibility to protect themselves. Yes, there are cases ie... rape. Where Abortion makes sense. I'm sorry, I guess it is too much to ask that people actually take responsibility for their actions.
