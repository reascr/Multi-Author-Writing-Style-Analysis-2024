So why has Russia gone for missiles? Well, two reasons. One, Russian vehicles being more self-sufficient is important for their doctrine, which assumes they'll be on a defensive stance against a much larger foe. That means less assets coming to help out your tank, so if you can't do it you might be screwed. The U.S. obviously has a unified doctrine, with all assets covering each other. The second reason is propaganda. A tank firing missiles sounds super scary, but on closer analysis its just kinda meh. And personally, I think the first reason is the official justification, while the second one is the real justification. I mean, the T-14 Armata is Russia's new modern scary tank, and it literally has yet to see combat for a laundry list of reasons. At present, their new tank is propaganda, so a lot of their stuff needs to be looked at very critically.
Who helped Indians post-independence with their agricultural, scientific, economic, military and nuclear ambitions? It wasnâ€™t the U.S, UK, France or Germany. It was the fucking Soviets. India has a lot to be grateful for and they are giving that back by staying neutral and not aligning against them.
