I do fear the Republicans’ desire to install another psychopathic fascist, one not as stupid as their last one. And DeSantis certainly fits the bill. But last time, everyone was talking about Jeb Bush two years out. So this article is really just jerking off.
Just for some context I'm a 47 yo lifetime Independent who doesn't like things about both parties and though I can't stand how far right the republicans are currently and the fact that they don't have any policies but only try to get votes by stoking culture wars, I know there's lots of us Independents who want fresh candidates for both sides and given a choice of a new face or Biden, the majority of independents (definitely not me though) will go with the new person.
This is the NY Post. It’s owned and operated by Rupert Murdoch and is hardly a reliable source for, well, anything lol. I wouldn’t trust it, personally. They also said November would be a huge blowout for Republicans… oops lol.
