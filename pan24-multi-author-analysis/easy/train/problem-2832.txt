Exactly. This is a problem that can be solved by technology. Amazon and Facebook already know how many children you have, whether you rent or pay a mortgage, hell, they know your underwear size. The data is out there, it's just a matter of correlating it properly. The IRS already had most of the information they need; hell, so does the state franchise board. One time I forgot to file my state taxes, and the state thoughtfully sent me a letter telling me what they thought I owed. And they were right. The bastards ðŸ˜›.
