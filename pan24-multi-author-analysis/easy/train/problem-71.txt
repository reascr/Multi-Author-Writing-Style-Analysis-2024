The problem is also that whilst we here look at the loss of human lives as a tragedy, in Russia they do not. Anything - and I mean nearly ANYTHING - is fine as a course of action if it means they get the end result they seek. So if their end result is fractured Ukraine or parts of Ukraine or Ukraine out of NATO/EU, or whatever - if they get something, allllll the horrible war crimes and crimes against humanity has been okay. It justifies the invasion and it justifies having an invasion in the future as well. It literally proves to them that it was alright, okay, perfectly acceptable to invade another country because they will have - in the end - still gotten something.
Security guarantees? Russia laid them out before they marched into Ukraine, and it basically boiled down to what I said above. To add to what you said, for Russia it isn't just NATO, it's also the whole "Western liberal democratic order", like the EU. The Euromaidan protests of 2014 didn't occur because Yanukovych turned down NATO, it was because he turned down an EU agreement.
