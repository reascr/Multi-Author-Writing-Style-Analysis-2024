And your follow-up questions are irrelevant. Maybe the Chinese thought they can make the port a commercial success under their administration and any leverage doesn't change the fact China had nothing to do with Sri Lanka deciding to lease it.
Both Sri Lankan central bank govenors from 2 gov administration's involved at the time of the port lease catgorically said the port was leased to gain funds to service more expensive non Chinese debt (IMF debt).
Firstly at the time of the port lease, Chinese loans there were not the biggest nor the most expensive and Hambantota port that everyone cite as repayment for a loan default isn't actually true.
They literally said Chinese loans weren't the biggest nor the most expensive (those were the IMF loans and Canadian advisers to the SL gov suggested to lease the port to relieve IMF DEBT) yet somehow you do the mental gymnastics that it is China debt traps.
Such as...? There are a few well developed parts of cities like Lagos and Addis, but the cities are overwhelmingly composed of slums.
