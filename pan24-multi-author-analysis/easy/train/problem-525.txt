I think Russia have their hands a bit too tied up at the moment to be playing the provocation game with the US and Canada. It would be an extremely foolish decision on their part to be doing as badly as they are in Ukraine, partly due to lack of funding and terrible logistics networks, and be wasting resources on flying balloons over the North American mainland, possibly further provoking the American and Canadian populace.
Closing it would open a can of worms. Then everyone would do the same. Turkey wont allow anyone through to the black sea but turkey vessels. Japan would not allow anyone go in between their two biggest islands. Etc. Etc.
The Trump administration seems to have allowed Chinese balloons to fly over our country freely, and the precedent of the previous administration may have carried over as standard operating procedure until the recent big one. It could be that it finally came to Bidenâ€™s attention and he has changed the policy, and is sharing that recon information with Canada.
