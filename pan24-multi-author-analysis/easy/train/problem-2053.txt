It’s amazing to me that the GOP is able to consistently convince their base that things like this are somehow good for them, even though a large portion of their base would actually suffer the most from the fallout. Just like the idea of abolishing the IRS. They have managed to convince their base that the IRS wants to come after their return on their 40k a year job where the claimed the standard deduction.
