She was just sued for court costs today. I think it’s the county and Hobbs as a co-plaintiff have filed suit. It’s just over $25,000 though. They can’t sue for more than the actual costs. Which kind of stinks. I’m sure that won’t effect her much, if at all. What she is doing is far more damaging. Her base is rabid. I have read some of their comments and they are completely delusion. I saw some guys “theory,” of what happened. His theory was based around what “they,” would have to do to steal the election considering Lake, in his world, got around 80 percent of the vote. Despite the actual vote totals and polling data, these people still believe 4/5 people voted for lake. I am sure their bubbles are very small and probably voted for her at that rate or greater. But they can’t even fathom that there are others that don’t vote that way. I mean, I have some friends from high school and some family members who vote for republicans. But other than that everyone I know votes democrat. I am not even close to delusional enough to believe that means the vote isn’t going to be very close. I am just ranting now, but my god I hate what these people are doing to our country.
