Since neither the Congress nor the President can do anything about inflation or do much useful with the economy they best thing they can do is not destabilize it with nonsense. Unfortunately game playing with the economy on issues like the debt ceiling and continuing resolutions instead of year long budgets have destabilized the government periodically for decades.
Oh for sure. 95% of the House races are predictable, having been so gerrymandered they either lean heavily blue or red. As a result, control of the House in any given cycle typically comes down to a dozen seats or so, and NY Dem's handed Republicans abt half a dozen seats as a result of the redistricting fiasco. But that's ok, we'll survive because Dem's control both the Senate and WH, so they can mitigate the damage. And I think the voters come '24 will look poorly on the GQP clown show in the House.
