I used to work for a company that made safety instrumentation for oil and gas, ie pressure, temperature, flow, and level sensors. Most of which are used around the world in refineries and transportation systems like pipelines and terminals. Most of these refineries are automated so having working sensors is extremely important in the safety feedback loop.
Calculations that involve Thermodynamics equations. Like think interest formula, but a little tougher.
Absolutely. If you ever want some shockingly well produced, poorly voiced (outside of the narrator), but incredibly interesting videos, take a look at the US Chemical Safety Board's videos on Youtube. The VAST majority of them are caused by faulty maintenance, faulty sensors, and the 'that's good enough' culture that having to rig or ignore faulty equipment fosters. Almost every single one of their investigation reports lists 'Maintenance Program' as one of the major factors and recommendations.
Suspicious? what make it suspicious? the oil refinery was obviously depressed and shot itself in the back, fall out of a building then exploded, sure the corpse is mildly radioactive but could be from mass consumption of banana, nothing suspicious, typical oil refinery suicide, case close.
