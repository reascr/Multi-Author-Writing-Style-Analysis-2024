Yep but also the fact that Trump hasn’t been charged in his case despite literally obstructing and lying about it is what makes this even worse. Obvious crimes were committed in Trump case but the lack of charges allows the right to essentially ignore it. Biden situation should have an investigation but in both cases they need to be very transparent and inform the public what they find and if they do find crimes in either case charge them. The public trust in the DOJ is at an all time low because we are onto their shit and realize they don’t have any interest in holding the ruling class accountable.
Exactly. Punishing someone for willingly returning forgotten/lost documents without even being asked to do so, as if they intentionally kept or even stole them, only incentivizes one to knowingly keep them hidden away to avoid being punished. And that causes greater risk for such documents to fall into the wrong hands.
Realistically? He was brought hundreds of documents all the time during his 8 years as VP to review regularly. It wasn't his job to make sure his staff was filing every single thing correctly. Is this different than Trump hoarding state secrets at his home? Of course it is. Will the media make that clear? Of course the won't. This is too close to maybe being a thing, and therefore it is 1000% the biggest deal in history. Trump squeaks by, miraculously, once again. Because this country is a fucking nightmare.
