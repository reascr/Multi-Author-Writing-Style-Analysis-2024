Biden is far from perfect, and i do wish the Afghan government had been a bit less “wet tissue paper” but Biden is on track to claim the lowest numbers of American soldiers killed in the Middle East for a long time.
3. Marijuana deregulation: would you look at that? Stuff happened only a couple of months ago on that front. It's a step in the right direction.
It's exactly why you don't elect someone like Trump, as Trump would have us all dead by now in a similar situation (notwithstanding the possibility that he is a direct collaborator with Russia, where Trump likely would have left NATO, possibly leading to direct conflict between Europe and Russia, as I mean in any possible foreign policy scenario with potential dire consequences).
1. Student Loan Debt was literally addressed via executive order, after having a dedicated team research his ability to do that. Was stopped by - who was it again? Oh yes, a Republican Judge. And it's going to be seen by... who? Oh, right, the Supreme Court. Who is made up of... conservative judges. How is that Biden's fault?
Biden is struggling to get some of these things done when he's promised them. The reason for that is Republican obstruction, when he's previously been able to work with them. Remember that Biden's got a long history of bipartisan work. It wasn't unreasonable to think he might be able to keep that up.
