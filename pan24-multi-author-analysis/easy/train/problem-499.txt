The terminal speeds of the weapons are also often not hypersonic. Aegis air-defense has also come a long way and even IRBM RVs like the DF-21 can be countered with the SM-6 in the terminal phase with reasonable capability.
Exactly. On top of that, Russia still has the same command structure. They have decisions made on a macro level, not at the unit level, which is what the US and other effective militaries do. A general says "take that ridge," so battalions try to take the ridge, not adapting to what they're seeing on the ground. They wasted their best men with that kind of stupidity and still do.
We need an ability to sprint with a "light" ship to deliver helos (manned and drone) to hound subs with or enforce freedom of navigation (anti-piracy, anti-small craft), to detect subs and chase them and light scout craft away from surface groups without sending Flight IIIs, and still integrate that ship with the AEGIS-run CEC defense grid for the CSG when necessary - hence the AMDR and NGSSR's aboard and the SLQ-32 Mk 6 (or later), as well as a bunch of directed energy options. Can't really fit that into a Perry-sized ship, hence the significant volume increase... so looking at the classic definition of a Frigate as an escort or light attack ship "built for speed and maneuverability, intended to be used in scouting, escort and patrol roles" the Constellation class will certainly fit that description.
Tritium is 12 years. The explode bits are about 700 million years. Not sure how 'shelf stable' it is after the tritium is gone but I'm not sure I'd care to find out.
