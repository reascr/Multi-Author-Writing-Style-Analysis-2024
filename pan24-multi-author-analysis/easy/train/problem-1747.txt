That said… it’s not like they couldn’t do that before. The idea that they need footage to craft a narrative seems weird since they’ve already convinced their viewers it was a sham _already without footage_… only reason theyd need this is if they needed ratings (which in itself is a pathetic thing for a politician to help them with) or they have enough people doubting their narrative.
Don't get me wrong. I'm an independent. I don't trust either party. The only thing they care about is their own power. In politics you are nothing without power. Both parties will do or say ANYTHING to get your vote.
Articles in the Constitution are, in practice, not the foundation of our Justice system that they have been held up as for the past couple of centuries and instead are just guidelines that can be ignored without consequence as the Constitution itself typically does not state a punishment for breaking such guidelines, nor does it provide a method of enforcement. And in a post-Trump political landscape, everybody has now learned that the answer to the question of "So? What are you going to do about it" is pretty much "Nothing.".
