The only way that works is if only one of Trump or the Republican is on the ballot in most states. Otherwise, they split the vote and the Democrat wins in places they wouldn't otherwise win. That would have to take coordination between the Republicans and the Trump campaign. A Trump independent run kind of implies he's trying to get revenge on the Republicans so I don't see him partaking in a scheme like this and even if he were to, the odds of the vote going exactly that way are far less than 1 in 3.
The optics. It has caused him to be a laughingstock, and even most of the conservatives are cringing over this. If you're looking to be a serious contender, turning yourself into a punchline isn't generally considered a wise opening move.
Oh, 100%. It's a laughing stock. And I bet it'll be out of the news cycle within two weeks. But Trump still got his $4.5M+ of clean money. He can probably see the headwinds and know that he will never win the next presidency.
