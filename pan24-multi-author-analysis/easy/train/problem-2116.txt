If China so much as load a few tanks on a battle ship , the Taiwanese and Americans will know about it . We will not have a case of hundreds of thousands of troops preparing to invade like the case w Ukraine. One CCP tank gets loaded on a ship on china coast , immediately one Himars get load on a US navy destroyer in Japan bond for Taiwan . Long are the days when stuff needs to travel weeks or months on the open ocean to get to a place . The US military have assets parked all over the world and can deploy at a moments notice . And as we have seen , US likes to test their gear .
More a question, if the world has such Hardline anti-pollution laws, environmental laws, then shouldn't puton,and the likes of him , anyone starting an environmentally damaging gameplay like this, be a wanted Man, just for the pollution and environmental damage he has done with this so called war , I mean the cleanup bill would be billions of dollars not to mention some sites would be completely uninhabitable for years , just putting it out there..
