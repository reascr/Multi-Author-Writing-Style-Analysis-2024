This is by far most generalized and ignorant comments I have ever seen. I know many Russian young people does not support this war. You get fined + abused + expelled for protesting. You cant say this without living under oppression dude. I am sure its easy for other nation to say protest and overthrow the current regime. But Russian police force is huge, and Putin knows this and is the reason why he implemented this big police force. At this point, most of the people who oppose this war either gave up trying or left the country. Do you know how many north koreans try to escape poverty to move to south korea? How come North Koreans did not overthrew when everyone is starving to death??? Again, its not easy as it sounds unless you lived in these country so please be more respectful.
Ukranian war propaganda ? You mean news of Russian atrocities right ? You do understand that Russia invaded a sovereign country, in fact did that already in 2014 at which point "the west" made the mistake of appeasing Putin. Mistake which Ukraine is paying with blood, the world with economic downturn and Russia with the future of their younger generation.
