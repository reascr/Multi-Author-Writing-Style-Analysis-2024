In my 5th grade school, 60 years ago, we received a Learning TV, an MLK speech aired, I went home and told my parents about MLK, he's my hero! I said, my racist-drunk father jumped up out of his chair and yelled at me, if you talk like that again in this house, I'll throw you out in the alley, he was all wound-up, I didn't have the guts to say to him: dad? we don't have an alley behind the house. And I mumbled to myself, MLK is still my hero..
It's hard to show results for your policies long-term if you enact a policy, see some problems, and cannot address those problems with updated legislation without having to prove that Hunter Biden's laptop wasn't involved in the calculation of the statistics that made you reconsider some aspects of the original bill. You really cannot address those problems if you also have to have an oversight panel consisting of Donald Trump, Ted Nugent and Rupert Murdoch review any request to have a conversation about the new policy; and all three have to be present. The meeting will be convened within the next 6 years at the discretion of the required attendees. You will get a gift basket if they go past this and you will have to reapply.
