Well, Trump was the apotheosis of that, stripping away the last shred of the illusion that Republicans were more interested in governing than winning. They were for small government and personal freedoms, well, except for when it involved women and their reproductive freedoms…or when it involved businesspeople who wanted their religious practices to overrule the law and the needs of their employees…I think you get the picture. That, coupled with Turtle McForeskin’s utter hypocrisy with regards to the rules of Congress and the Supreme Court, demonstrated how utterly in bad faith the GOP have been conducting themselves.
Exactly. People are about to see what happens when a cult leader falls - the cult disintegrates. None of the copycats will take his place - they don’t have his charisma. Say what you will about Trump (and we all should), but he was funny. Funny in a frat-boy bully kind of way - but still funny to many, many people. And DeSantis is a bore. He comes off angry and humorless. Without Trump on the ticket, the GOP loses a huge part of their base.
