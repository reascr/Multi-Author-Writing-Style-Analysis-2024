And China as an entity, government and institution is a different beast than Russia is (and was pre-invasion of 2022), for a layman like myself: Russia has a bulk power at the top, around Putin and very little in the 'outside of Moscow' regions, it seems this is true for the military too. China has a huge power bubble around Yi too, especially after 2022, but the local party sections are also really strong.. but then China seems to have a lot more 'struggle at the people, not really supporting, but not revolting' vs Russia, where the people seem to be a lot more stuck in the single flow of info and years of indoctrination. Somewhat un-expectantly.
The conflict would not be won over Taiwan. It would be won in the Straight of Hormuz. US 2nd Carrier Group simply moves to interdict oil shipments to China, and its entire grid goes dark in three months. Game over. Maybe the CCP surrenders, maybe they have another bloody civil war from the billions of now starving Chinese who were counting on the CCP to protect them and instead screwed them over. Either way, China has no means of projecting force over that distance, and no way of protecting themselves from such a move.
Heck, China has no means of projecting enough force to try and occupy Taiwan. They simply don't have enough boats, much less a way to protect the boats in the face of 6th carrier group's opposition. A single thermobaric bomb dropped in the seaway between Taiwan and China and all of China's hopes and dreams of invasion vanish in a ball of light.
