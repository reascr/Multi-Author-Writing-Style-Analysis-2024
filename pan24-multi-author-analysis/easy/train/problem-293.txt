In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
That is great news. So NDA as part of hiring process, then harassment claim, so harassment voids NDA? Then nee NDA can be part of subsequent settlement? If that is the case, you have done the impossible kind stranger: you have changed someone’s mind on the internet. Thanks!

Exactly. Having everything stay private and confidential is a huge incentive to these assholes to settle. They don’t want word out and so that brings them to the table to reach a fair settlement. If word will get out anyways, they may very well think it’s more worth it to deny everything and force a trial that they very much could win, or more likely, that their victim doesn’t have the money to afford. Legislation like this sounds good at first glance but it will be terrible in practice for a lot of victims.
