Title 42 expelled asylum seekers as a policy, stating that it was required because of the emergency state of Covid-19 created a great risk upon the citizens of the United States. Meaning that asylum seekers could carry the virus, and variants into the US and the expose US citizens to that. We developed several vaccines that have diminished this risk significantly. The emergency was the virus itself.
Because if a GOP president issued an executive order that was blocked by a court, National Review would be going on about "liberal activist overreach in the judiciary against our Constitution", but if a Dem president's executive order gets blocked they go on about "Tyranny against our Constitution".
It's more than just tradition. The Senate and the House are broken. They cannot get anything done. This has put more pressure on Presidents to use executives orders and even worse it has put more pressure on unelected bureaucrats to pick up the slack.
