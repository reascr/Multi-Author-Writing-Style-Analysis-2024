Interesting, and I assume some high level military official is about to have a conversation with SpaxeX about this.
“Suddenly”? Musk has been adamant about his support of Russia. He talked about Ukraine going to the negotiating table with Russia when there is literally zero negotiations to be had. Musk threatened to pull access to Starlink months ago. In America, he publicly sided with those who said Russia was warranted in their actions of invasion. After buying Twitter, he has had a narrative that democrats who support Ukraine, violated laws by contacting Twitter to violate free speech when what happened is the White House were the ones who violated the first amendment when Trump was in office and he’s been spreading false information and propaganda about Ukraine. And as the CEO of Twitter, he has allowed false information to be spread on Twitter some of which was sensitive to the war efforts in Ukraine.
Remember. When they did the electric vehicle tax credit they made sure to exclude Tesla's from being eligible.
Seriously. I love the people who are pissed that Starlink tried to get the Pentagon to pay for the devices/service and yet don’t have a problem with the billions the Pentagon is paying for literally every other thing we send over there….
