I'm not sure what you mean here - biological sex is the result of a sex chromosome in the egg (always X) and a sex chromosome in the sperm (X or Y), so the biological sex of the fetus is differentiated by the sperm produced by the man (and sperm, being constantly produced by men, could conceivably be dependent on external factors like war). Women do carry the fetus obviously, and at least one of the references indicate that stressed women have increased likelihood of miscarrying male fetuses, so is that what you're referring to? But as with all things, it seems to be more complicated than that and it seems no one has really looked at the mechanisms behind the "Returning Soldier Effect"; the papers listed are really just (minimal) statistics run on (relatively narrow) historical populations with some speculative "here's why" added.
No it isn't. After your death, your widow just lost half her household income, and now you want her to be a single mother? Are you shitting me? Nah, any intelligent woman is going to move on with her life.
