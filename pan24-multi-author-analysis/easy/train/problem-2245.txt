I'm not sure Biden would have launched a withdrawal himself to be honest. Unlike Trump, he would have some empathy for the civilians - particularly women and girls - who would have been and were impacted. It's hard to make that kind of decision. But in the long run, Biden is benefitting from Trump's madness in this instance. He's probably secretly on some level relieved (if not emotionally, than at least logistically) that he doesn't have to spend so much focus on another military situation on top of Ukraine _and_ Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea.
I knew. I was like 12 when 9/11 happened and even then I knew that the War on Terror was imperialism and that the GOP were the party that was going to confuse, upset and polarize the public with social issues (“the gay agenda”) so that they could scheme to steal money and create war machines. It has only gotten worse over the past 25ish years. They have gotten exceedingly good at it, to the point it’s at critical mass.
