There are a few choice targets that they're ideal for that Ukraine doesn't currently have any way to take out. The Kerch bridge, for example, too beefy to take out with GMLRS (taking out the Kherson bridge with them required a huge number to pockmark the thing to the point that it was impassable without ever having caused major structural damage), would be a prime target for a saturation attack with ATACMS. But there are other longer range options on the horizon. The GLSDB proposal and the ER GMLRS will both roughly double the range of GMLRS while having a comparable size, both might be available at some point in 2023, and may end up making up the bulk of long-range rocket capabilities for Ukraine. GLSDB is in particular quite interesting, because not only does it offer a significantly extended range, but it's largely made out of re-used components and is expected to cost on the order of $40,000 in comparison to the $1 million ATACMS.
Yes, I do. Russia has everything it needs to make missiles, drones, bombs and shells domestically. They can produce and fire them as long as they want to.
