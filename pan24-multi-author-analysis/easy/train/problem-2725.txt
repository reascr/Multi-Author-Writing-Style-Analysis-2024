I don't know about that, but if we're positing fantasies that never existed and will never exist, could we have a conservative party that wasn't a collection of racist, homophobic, ultra-religious anti-science anti-democracy nut-jobs and thieves? Oh, and handed out unicorns too.
We should be conservative in not over-spending on unnecessary industries like the Health Insurance industry, instead we should dismantle the insurance side of it and prioritize true health CARE for all. Look at that, a “fiscal conservative” plan that could benefit people.

Fiscal conservatism isn’t frugality. Fiscal conservatism is using the power of the purse to enforce and perpetuate a social status quo in which their preferred hierarchy remains unchanged. Everyone likes the idea of frugality, that’s why conservatives put so much effort into perpetuating the myth that they are the same thing.
