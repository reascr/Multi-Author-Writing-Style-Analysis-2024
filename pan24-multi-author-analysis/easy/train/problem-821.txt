I'm so torn. Assuming enough moderate Republicans would still never vote for Jeffrey's and the fact that I find it hilarious if McCarthy doesn't get it... I still find him to be the best option for Democrats as speaker because he is so inept at leading.

Exactly. The GOP might eventually break down and offer some kind of bipartisanship if dems will help, but republicans have proven over and over again that they can not be trusted.
Exactly. The only practical difference between what we have now and a Republican-majority business as usual is that there is no way to spin this as anything other than Republican ineptitude and disorganization.
I'm confused. What do you mean why is this just accepted? Dems aren't changing their votes. If Dems have the choice to split leadership positions while in the minority and get the speaker they would take it 100%. That's winning for the Democrats. Most likely Republicans are going to figure something out to avoid having a Democrat as speaker. That's just my perception from the state of the Republican party.
