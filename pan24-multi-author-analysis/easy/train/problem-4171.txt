My parents want to buy electric - but only if it has the Toyota/Lexus badge on it. However, Toyota laughed off Tesla, bet big on fuel cells(which aren’t go beyond buses in California and Vancouver, Canada) and they had to call off their electric car back to the drawing board. If Toyota is good at one thing, it’s resting on their laurels. Just kill the Prius/Mirai and sell the fuel cell IP to both Ballard Systems and New Flyer who will use it in a bus. Then engineer a better BEV. “Toyota Quality” is a myth these days - cars are built better these days - even Detroit and Seoul’s products. Toyota just has the basic tenets of treating the human on the assembly line with respect, empowering them to improve the product, egalitarian operations(management and the rank and file work together, eat in the same cafeteria and even play for the same company rec teams) and lean inventory.
Afrikaners are African. It formed in Africa, it wasn't imported. They just aren't black. The identity formed over hundreds of years and is just as unique as Zulu or Xhosa.
