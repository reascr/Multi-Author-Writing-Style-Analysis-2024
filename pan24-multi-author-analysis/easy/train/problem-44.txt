The only thing I would remind you about the corruption is the source of that money that drives it, much of it is America corporations. CIA was the 70s and 80s face of it, it’s still major American corporations owning the mines that drive urban politics that keep resources from the locals, that allow toxic environmental damage in those communities. Ok it’s a bit disingenuous to say all companies are American. I seem to remember some are Canadian. I’m sure there are others, like Chinese or Japanese operating there, but I don’t know for certain. The villages I visited had American and Canadian owned mines. Such beauty corrupted and laid waste. Hell, the American mines in Utah are barely better and if it’s weren’t for the EPA signed by Nixon there’s probably be as bad.
Favoring the Ayatollah? That's.. I mean, there was an attempt at diplomacy after the Shah was f'cked to try and make the best of a bad situation, but favoring the Ayatollah is so wrong it hurts to know those words will be archived forever.
