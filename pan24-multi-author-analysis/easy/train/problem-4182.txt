I am guessing the reality is these announcements are coming as soon as they have the Ukrainian's trained. Until they trained tank crews, sending western tanks practically wouldn't work. Yes they labor in public about should we send or shouldn't we? But that is just for political and public consumption. With this in mind, "no jets" are being sent because the Ukrainians are not likely trained yet and might take a year (which may be close to finishing). THEN the planes will be announced (but first Germany will labor over it for public show before finally saying yes). Not criticizing Germany in this, this sort of internal preening happens in the U.S. too. I would bet a dollar that the U.S. wanted Ukraine to hold back major offensives for the spring not just for tanks, but for air cover too. That would be NATO combined arms style offensive.
More Russian infighting: Girkin is having a spat with Prigozhin, apparently Girkin criticized Prigozhin for his political ambitions and one of Prigozhin's commanders has recorded a video accusing Girkin of insulting Wagner officers while being a coward and a couch warrior, to which Girkin replied that he never criticized Wagner fighters but he does have a word or two to say about Prigozhin, and challenged him to have a face-to-face public conversation instead of hiding behind his commanders.
