This isn't an argument about hate speech laws, it's an argument about speech that is legal and protected until someone sees it and then happens to commit a crime.
Assuming criminal incitement is already illegal and not the target of this proposal, this bill makes it illegal for someone to say something hateful that otherwise is legally protected speech, if someone else sees or reads it and then goes on to commit a hate crime. I'm neither white nor conservative, but I think this law sets a very dangerous precedent that criminalizes otherwise legal speech based on what other people go on and do after - especially if it becomes an acceptable legal mechanism to criminalize other speech that happens to be heard by a criminal.
Why would you say that? What has he ever done to indicate he doesn't want people to kill gay or trans people?
What DeSantis is doing is hoping that one of his followers kills gay or trans people. He is working very hard to make that happen by constantly using his free speech to demonise those people.
