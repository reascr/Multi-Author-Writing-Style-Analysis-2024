With Russia it's something else since there are so many nukes that even if most will not follow order there probably be someone who will and that's all it needs for all the pieces to come in motion.
Obviously not. but then, what part of the failed Jan 6th coup in the USA do you ascribe to Putin? He and his agents were sowing violent strife for years.
Russian nationalists absolutely love "Kiev". If you don't know that then you aren't paying attention. In their eyes it's the mother of Russian cities. Wiping out Ukraines government is a stated goal of their operation. Biden just stopped by and gave them a hug.
People who follow the non-conspiracy side of the JFK assassination think this is the most likely explanation for what happened to Kennedy and why everything surrounding his death was so crazy--congress's report on it basically says a Soviet asset went rogue and killed Kennedy, and everyone on both the US and Soviet side was scrambling to avoid it becoming public and causing a war.
Hitler himself? Yeah probably yes. But he had many people actually trying to NOT build the bomb (probably couldn't have done it anyways but still).
