Ok, think about what you just said, those missiles still work. You have no idea if the nukes didn't, you are hoping they didn't work to support your narrative. At the end of the day, Russia has more than enough nukes to make the UK cease to exist (A fucking big island) the rest of Europe uninhabitable, and cripple the US to the point of barely existing. Come on man, whether you like it or not, Russia can fuck up everyone if it so chose to. That doesn't mean it's without consequences of course.
I think they speculate on exhausting the ukrainian general public over the winter with power outages, cold and high casualties at the front lines to a point where public pressure forces the ukrainian government to react on russia's coincidentally increasing efforts on negotiations, where russia then hopes to secure those territorial gains in exchange for peace, giving Putin a land bridge to crimea and allowing him to pretend everything went according to plan.
What movie is that from? Because as it stands, there is a reason why no one can do anything other than what they are doing right now, and it's not because the west doesn't want to.
