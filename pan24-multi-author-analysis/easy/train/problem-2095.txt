Young millennial and Gen Z voters now outnumber voters over age 65. They can have all the power if they vote in high enough numbers. In this election, only 27% of voters under age 30 voted, but they voted 65% Democrat. Look at the result. Imagine if even half of them voted.

Exactly. It sounds so mindful and inviting when you’re learning about our parties in your civics or history class, but seeing the reality of it is very different - seems very much so that the same party’s idea of small government, getting things done, and fiscal responsibility is actually burning and breaking everything down in a temper tantrum while helping our oligarch overlords rake in all the money that could help others.
Spot on. The GOP is not known for their introspection. Their only solution to losing elections is to change the rules, gerrymander, and suppress votes. It's never their shitty policy ideas.
