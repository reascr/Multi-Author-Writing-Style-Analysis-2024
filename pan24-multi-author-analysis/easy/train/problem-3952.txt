i stopped going there for a long time, popped in when Roe was over turned for a bit, and spent a couple hours after the midterms reading comments. i think it's a combination of his candidates general poor showing in the election and a lack of ideas the youth can get behind. i can't count how many Gen Z's or whoever (i'm 57 and have no idea what the generation labels mean) decrying the GOP policies, or lack there of, for issues that matter to them. some want tax cuts of course, but the cost of education, home ownership, climate change, income disparity are things that matter to them as well. and the parties active anti-LGBTQ hysteria really puts them off. the dems have worked very hard to get the youth vote, and the GOP seems stuck in the 1950's. they have another big problem besides the youth, because trump is someone who will control a large percentage of their base as long as he is still active.
