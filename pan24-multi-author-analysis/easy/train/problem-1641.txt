Hey, thank you for caring about her She's on medication, she is depressed but she is also aware of it and we're working on it. As I mentioned, I'm her sister-in-law, but we have a pretty great relationship because I wanted to make sure she had "an adult" to talk to if she needed that isn't immediate family. I'm 30 ftr, and she's called a few times Being away from home is a first for her, so we're trying to give her space and freedom while also making it clear that we love her and are around and will help. My husband (her big brother) and my best friend/other SIL also live in the same town so she has a safety net here. (:
Apparently kids who were never taught life is full of disappointment,decided that, voting under one president who for 80%of his presidency was kneecapped by Republicans , was enough for them to give up on their future.
3.) the national democratic party refuses to move left, or compromise with the few progressives who managed to win despite all the resistance from the national party, in order to sway the youth to turn out for them.
So again, if the party refuses to move left, then donâ€™t get mad when they lose elections bc they refuse to represent a significant swath of the voters they need.
