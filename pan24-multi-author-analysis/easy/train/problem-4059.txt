Russia is listed as the 7th largest grain producer at 81 million metric tons. In 2021, Ukraine produced 74 million metric tons.
As a person who live Iran which is heavily sanctioned although the regime brag about that they are not effective and we are growing in truth it made the whole country's economy broken fully and they are struggling in mud and they lost support of a lot of groups in different countries and can't fund any more groups, lobbyists and terrorist around of the world in a way they mostly send people with death penalties to attack with knives to other countries China left them Russia is using them to just throw them under the bus of us military to breath a lil which in conclusion it would be effective in time.
Production cost are low yes. But Russia is a petrostate and needs oil revenues to fund the govt. Especially during wartime. They need 80$ oil to fund the govt without a war going on. They have already entered into a deficit with the sharp drop in oil prices.
When only the countries like Russia are the only ones that can directly conquer territory and resources in today's world and the best the "West" can do is prop up dictatorships because they are more reliable than democracies that shift towards national concerns and foreign propaganda , the trend is clear even if Ukraine wins back territory. The whole premise our countries have is to act impregnable in contrast to the damage incurred by Ukraine, but they are not, specially when they continue suckling on Russia's and China's resources. It's great that people still praise Greek democracy and all, but it still fell.
