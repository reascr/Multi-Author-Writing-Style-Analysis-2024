I just spent $5 on a taco. It was only four years ago my friends and I were shocked when they sell for $3.50. It had to be a really fucking good taco to justify $3.50. Now $5 is sorta expected. Meanwhile I still can only get a job that pays around $12 and my rent went up by a hundred dollars a month. Nah, my pay hasn't changed by my expenses sure have, I feel like this isn't an unsual thing to say either, I don't think my case is uncommon. I feel like this data generously padded itself with taking into account the social elite that was able to buy shares at a discount.
Absolutely. We get inflation slowing down a bit for 1-2 months, and suddenly the fear of inflation is gone? Gas prices are down for now, but they can always come roaring back as oil companies manipulate the market. Grocery prices are still through the roof. My natural gas use last month declined by 30% y/y, but my bill was only down 5% due to natural gas price increases.
