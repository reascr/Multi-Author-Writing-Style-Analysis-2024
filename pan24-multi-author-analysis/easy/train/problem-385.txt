yea. Some people just vote straight R when they vote in a multi-people election but are they will to take time out of their day to just Vote for Walker.
Seriously. Go look at a map of ANY U.S House election in the 1860s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 1910s, or 20s. The sheer density of districts in spite of the RURAL population will surprise you.

Republicans vote republican, not exactly an earth shattering revelation. The point is that women in general tend to vote democrat more than republican, so the fact that they are showing up is likely benefitting democrats. Obviously they could vote for Walker in droves but despite what you think about Georgia it would be pretty unlikely for women voters to swing the vote in Walker's favor. If that happens it would likely be a mix of every demographic voting more red than anticipated and not just women.
