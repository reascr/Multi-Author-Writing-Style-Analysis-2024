Vasily: "This morning, February 24th 2022 at 6:42 a nuclear incident occurred in the Russian oblast of Donbas. More news to come".
After some bitching about the stupidity of previous governments and anger towards the British military that deceived them, the Aus gov went to great expense to collect as much of the radioactive materials as the could find, bury it, then glassed it with millions of volts of electricity, putting it into a hardened and mostly inert state; while it still emitted some level of alpha radiation, it was not reaching the surface to cause irradiated dust to be carried into the lung of unsuspecting Australians.
Sure. I’m just stating they aren’t the only ones to have melted down nuclear reactors. There have been other, smaller meltdowns in the US than three mile island. That’s just the worst one.
In the 1960s, the British tested multiple nuclear bombs in inland South Australia, many of which were extremely dirty in terms of radiation, but the bomb designs were not so efficient back then, and this was a side effect of such; much of the radioactive material did not fissile at maximum efficiency, and so irratiated and bonded with much of the surrounding materials, i.e dirt, creating literally tonnes of radioactive material, as well as irradiated material(the two after different things, Google it).
