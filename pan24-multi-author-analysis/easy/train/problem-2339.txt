The US isn’t some outlier in electing right wing loons into office. Brazil just finished with Jair Bolsonaro, aka Brazil’s Trump and to beat him, they needed to nominate a previous president who spent time in prison for corruption. The Philippines recently voted the Marcos family back into power even though they ran a military dictatorship and stole tax money to support a very lavish lifestyle a generation ago. And the previous guy was someone who ran on creating death squads to kill drug dealers and users without trial- and he did create the death squads and it was a popular policy. And then take a look at the new government Italy just elected.
Exactly! I don’t talk about it to many people. I even stopped going to my church. Parking behind a car with "Women for Trump” bumper sticker was the last straw.
Excellent. Keep it up my dudes. Never forget that the republicans tried to suppress your vote by restricting early voting. Make them pay for their insolence.
