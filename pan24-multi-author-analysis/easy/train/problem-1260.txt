Oh yeah? Let's discuss this then. There are some 500 million + surveillance cameras in China, for a population of over 1 billion. How many surveillance cameras are in the US? China has been developing advanced AI facial recognition to track as many individuals that they can, and use that to their effect whenever it is necessary to remove dissidents. This has been so prevalent that recently there have been students who designed T-shirts to confuse the camera's facial-tracking ability. Have you heard of We-Chat, the native Chinese app that citizens use for everything from text conversations and buying groceries, etc? This app makes some things more convenient, but it tracks everything. Everyone you are in contact with, the locations you visit and all your messages and calls. If you say anything that disapproves of the leadership you are arrested and interrogated. Do you think the protestors from last year, who were caught on the many cameras in the cities they were in, what do you think the authorities simply had to use to find them?
