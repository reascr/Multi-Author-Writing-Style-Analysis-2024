It‚Äôs sad how many people, including some educated people like doctors, fall for this propaganda It‚Äôs also an indictment of media that these types of Republican hacks are simply quoted without any fact checking Media should be running headline that FL attorney general lies about crime , instead of just quoting her. We have lost all lessons of Watergate & simply let Republicans spew their lies & propaganda & force Democrats to be fact checkers. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Jacksonville,the current murder capital of Florida, just elected the Republican who ran the major crime division as the sheriff (police chief). He ran a campaign based on the fact that Democrats are soft on crime. So the guy who organized the major crime unit that saw the numbers get much worse convinced the electorate that it was a Democrat problem!
