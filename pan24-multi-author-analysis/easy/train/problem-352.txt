I think the 2 might stand for Two-Spirit. It’s an Indigenous thing that’s sort of similar to being trans I think? I’m far from an expert though so consider looking it up if you’re interested.
Really? Theres more hate for gays now then there was in 1950? In 1950 nobody publicly supported gay rights. I bet 95% of people support gay rights now.
Seriously stop. My wife's father fled Iran during the Islamic revolution. Her and I are both very liberal on social issues, and she's said multiple times that when she hears liberal politicians talk like this as if Republicans are in any way similar to those who literally wanted to murder her father for his religion, and would do the exact same thing to anyone lgbt or who even wanted gender equality, she doesn't trust those people with power. And I don't blame her. Lots of Republicans are problematic with their social views and deserve to be voted out of office. Comparing them to Islamic extremists in the middle east makes a mockery of the brutality of these extremists. Many Republicans want to force lgbt teachers to hide their identity, relegate same sex couples to second-class legal status, and not teach children that transgenderism is a thing. Those are all bad. Islamic extremists want to execute everyone who's lgbt and murder women who seek an education or want to leave their house without their husband's permission. The two are not the same, even if they're both bad.
Social attitudes can change, especially with a concentrated propaganda campaign and constant misinformation. It may only work on a minority of people but those people are getting a lot more intense in their hatred of people who are different to them.
