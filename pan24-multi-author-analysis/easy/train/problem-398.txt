[1] Take a guess, did Fukushima make nuclear's reputation drop? Nope. But rising gas pump prices makes it go up.
Instead of a reactor designed for the specific conduction site, I now have to get my construction site to conform to the reactor site (and there's evidence that some of the increasing cost to build reactors in the US is due to trying to get standardized designs to work in new locations, I can find the report when I'm home if you're interested). And where I only needed 1 shift leader and 2 janitors to make 2.3GW if power before, I need the same staff to make only 800MW (or whatever). Instead of one permit to use water from one river, I need 4 permits in 4 jurisdictions which will all have different requirements. Etc.
There's no inherent reason building nuclear power plants has to be as expensive as it's been in the US in recent years, and it looks like it might very well be a disease of the construction industry-- with SMRs you can move a lot of the fabrication from "construction" to "manufacturing".
No. Theoretically you might be able to build that reactor the size of a house and power of house for 30 years. But a portable generator is way too small to fit in all the components and the fuel for 30 years of operation. Best you could do in the size of a generator is an RTG like they use on Mars rovers which will decrease in output over time and will at best output a few hundred watts.
