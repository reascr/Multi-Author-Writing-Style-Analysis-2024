It was "stolen" because of the lost popular vote. If that's the word that was used by some, it was used contextually different, though I don't think the word stolen was effectively codified in Dem slogans as much as it has in Rep ones. The loss of the popular vote raises into question how citizens of smaller states are better represented federally than larger ones. Same thing happened with Gore-Bush vote, except this time around online rhetoric has amplified these sorts of arguments into unreasonable apples to oranges comparisons. It did not lead to storming of the capital or refusing to step down. Trump and family was being shown around the white house with the Obamas as tradition, weeks before the peaceful transition of power. Rhetoric claiming the 2020 election was "stolen" because of unverified claims of voter fraud is a whole different animal. The comparison is disingenuous.
I work for the Navy. Like all other Navy we made our oath to uphold the constitution. This includes the peaceful transfer of power. There are a few idiots I know of in my cohort but its a small minority.
