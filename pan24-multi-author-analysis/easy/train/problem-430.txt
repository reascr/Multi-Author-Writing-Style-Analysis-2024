North Korea has to keep everything hidden from people. It isn't just ideas about freedom it's the entire context. Imagine you were watching Star Trek and it was supposed to be what America is like right now, today, and you said, "ok, look, I get that the transporters and warp drives, and force fields are BS. That's just the government tooting it's own horn with secret technology. But did you notice how everyone on the crew has a hobby? They're supposed to be elite military people but they're not working 20 hours a day, they can write poetry, read, listen to music. They even go and listen to other crew when they do bad poetry readings. Can you imagine having so much free time? Doesn't that strike people as unbelievable?".
The stupid shit hasn't bothered to factor in the potential destructive effect this would have on the citizens of NK, as they would be swamped with world representatives, and could be put to a firing squad for talking to, or otherwise interacting with those representatives.
