It's quite a hairy matter. 48 states have laws banning car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. Tesla appears to have taken the novel approach of... completely ignoring these laws and doing it anyway. They're being sued in quite a few states over this, and that litigation is still ongoing. Other manufacturers aren't eager to test those laws in the same way that Tesla is.
Seriously. Make a good point with new information or at least pointing to a source. In response you question why the previous comment didn't include a source? Good. Ask for a source, but don't patronise others with bullshit italics.
In theory, manufacturer-authorized service centers provide a guaranteed level of support from the manufacturer. Third-party shops can also get certified which is good. Iâ€™m uncertain how Tesla is doing their service centers.
It actually is a mutually beneficial relationship. China knows that it will be transitioning to all EV's in the future, and tesla gains access to their major battery productions.
