I see it from a more universalist perspective, its all human history and culture and so its of global interest to preserve it. I don't think a current government or insititutions in any country have automatic given right to it just because the artefact originated in the same location a long time ago. They would have a good claim but not an absolute one.
Damn just saw this, I meant South America not south Africa, there's this book: Open Veins of Latin America by Eduardo Galeano and there's the math done for all the actual value of the stuff that was stolen, in fact when adjusted for all the centuries of inflation it was of course much more than the 7 trillion, was a couple of times the world's GDP, and it was at that time instrumental to the development of the contintent until the end of the colonies shortly after the French revolution. My comment, obviously captious, was targeting the fact that Europe has never manifested to return the lovely precolumbine art pieces of which you can barely find a few in South American museums, mainly well, cus they were made of gold and certainly they're lost forever.
The video is good. But although I can agree with him on the general principle, he deals very dismissively with the point about how the other countries will care for the artefacts. This would vary on case by case basis and I dont think it should be ignored.
