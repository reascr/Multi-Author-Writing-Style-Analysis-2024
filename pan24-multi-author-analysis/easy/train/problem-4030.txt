In 1900, 0.3% of the population of Oregon was Black. Let's compare that to other western states which never had those anti-Black laws: in California, their share of the population in 1900 was 0.7%; in Washinon, 0.5%; in Nevada, 0.3%; in Idaho, 0.2%; in Alaska, 0.3%. So some of those states are a bit higher than Oregon, but not much. Some of those states, like Washinon, Idaho, and Montana, continue to have very small Black populations today. Of the western states that have larger Black population percentages than Oregon today, such as California and Nevada, those populations really started growing in the period after 1940. I have a hard time believing that the reason that Los Angeles or Las Vegas saw larger Black population growth in the 1940s-50s than Portland did, is because of a law from the the 1860s that had never been enforced and had been constitutionally invalid since 1868. So that's my opinion on this question.
