First of all, no respectful expert will say so. If you open any books about any major conflict, there are always will be several reasons listed. Such things are complex and can not be explained by one factor.

Nato training… it’s very hard to send troops to nato training when Russian strategy during the entire war has focused on splitting Ukrainian resources so they never truly have a real reserve force that can be train (Ukraine was able to do this when they first mobilized… with their nato trained troops being those who launched the Kharkiv and Kherson offensives) how ever things have changed. Ukraine is on their 9th conscription wave… mainly because of battles like bakhmut and Kherson draining the reserve pool thanks to the high casualties rates… and the Belarusian border where a large number of troops still have to be stationed in case of an attack (these troops could be vital somewhere else).
