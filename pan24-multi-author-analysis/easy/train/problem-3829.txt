So you're saying that every single soldier has committed a war crime or what? Because that's what no one means.
Perun did a great video analysis recently on 'vranyo', the culture of lying to save face and make yourself look better even when everyone knows it's a lie, and specifically how it has seriously damaged the Russian military's ability to operate effectively because every level of the operation is exaggerating their success and minimizing their failures.
I dunno man. I loved the games and was all excited to read the books but I got maybe halfway through the first one and just… stopped. I know it was originally in Russian and translated, but it feels like it’s written so strangely and is kind of hard to follow. Same with the Witcher novel, I stopped halfway through that one too. I wanted to like them both, but for some reason just had trouble with it.
Probably. Lot's of people left the country within the first few months of the conflict, especially once conscription of ordinary Russian citizens ramped up.
