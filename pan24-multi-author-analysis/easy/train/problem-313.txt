political and economic powers are heavily shared and fragmented among all stake holders. We don't have any prime ministers, presidents, governors nor mayors. Executive government is instead shared by elected ministers from the 3-5 biggest parties (not a coalition government of the willing, but simply the biggest ones, even if they hate each other), together representing at least 2/3 of voters. So each minister is responsible of his department, like normal ministers. But for overall decisions and big responsibilities normally made/carried by presidents, prime ministers, etc., these ministers come together, debate, vote, and then stand as one man behind that decision, and implement it as if it were an order given by a president, prime minister, governor, mayor, For example, our federal government is led by seven ministers, two from each of the three biggest parties, and one from the fourth biggest party. All elected by parliament.
