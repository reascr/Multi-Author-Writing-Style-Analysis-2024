Which is why Elon is currently spreading the conspiracy theory that he's somehow, overnight, solved twitters problem of child exploitation material when all he's actually done is start pushing LGBTQ people off the platform. It's a prebunking of a problem he knows is coming since twitters content moderation capabilities are collapsing due to his downsizing of staff. People are already uploading entire shows and movies that previously would have been auto blocked by copyright tools. It also feeds into a Qanon style narrative which equates child abusers with gay and trans people, allowing Elon to shift the blame for his inability to remove illegal materials towards a group he has repeatedly shown open hostility towards.
Like who cares. If it falls, something will replace it. And maybe Twitter has been needing to die for a while.
Literally this. These guys forget that content moderation is also a business decision, and not just because mean ol’ brands are going woke or whatever. If you create a miserable experience for your customer, they’re not coming back.
