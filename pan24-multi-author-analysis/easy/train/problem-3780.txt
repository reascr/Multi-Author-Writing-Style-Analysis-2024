Especially when that book also promotes slavery, genocide, the victimization and enslavement of women, torture, child abuse, gaslighting, intolerance of people of different belief systems, expiation of personal guilt in a process which involves no consequences or repercussions (I have prayed and God has forgiven me!), the inheritability of guilt (from father to son unto the 10th generation), collective guilt (i.e. the Great Flood), the fundamental evil of humanity and specifically of women (because we have all inherited the guilt for the original sin), sexual intolerance and the suppression of human nature as a 'sin', promotion of the death penalty, colonialism, the 'flat earth' problem (God didn't actually create anything), and finally the fundamental issue that a supposedly purely good and omnipotent creator allows evil and even participates (i.e. Job).
