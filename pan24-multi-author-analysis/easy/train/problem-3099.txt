Yeah, I was shocked to find out that tons of 16oz energy drinks have 325mg in them. A few years ago, I decided to take a break from energy drinks because I was tired of being dependent on them. One day after work I needed a little boost to get through the rest of the day, so I figured I'd grab one, and saw some Bang flavors that caught my eye (never tried them before, it ended up tasting disgusting.) I figured they were about the same as a Monster or Red Bull which typically have around 100mg of caffeine in them. I drank the Bang on the way home, and an hour later my heart felt like it was about to pound out of my chest. I checked the can and I was shocked to see 325mg.
Issue isn't regular consumption. Nobody is harmed by an occasional energy drink, including kids. The issue is, that due to taste and marketing, energy drinks promote massive overconsumption. And _that_ causes problems. Not only from the caffeeine but also from the ridiculous amounts of sugar in there.
And if coffee was filled with insane amounts of sugar and marketed by their favourite streamers to teens as a cool drink, I too would support the same thing there.
