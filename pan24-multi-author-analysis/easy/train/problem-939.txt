Conservatives don’t like it here and hang out exclusively in /r/conservative, where you can’t post unless you can prove you are a conservative. No such rule exists in /r/liberal or /r/politics. They choose to live in a bubble. Read /r/moderatepolitics if you want more back and forth, but since 2020, most actual moderates or third party voters I know have just switched to Democrat voting out of desperation for sanity.
Instead of seeing current republicans talking points echoed here, you will often see pushback on false claims or exaggerations from these folks who see “both sides” but are effectively done with the current iteration of the R party (like myself). You see those sorts of comments here all the time. “There’s no need to exaggerate or mislead on this”, “This headline is misleading (or inaccurate)”, etc.
Constantly projecting. They cannot imagine it ever being smart to not weaponize the government, so they assume their opponents must be trying to do it all the time just like them.
