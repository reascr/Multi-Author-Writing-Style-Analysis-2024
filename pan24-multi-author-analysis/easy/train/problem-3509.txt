You're right but because these countries don't face such problems they don't understand or can't get what you mean. But this is why i am against any country intervening in another country's internal affairs. At the end everyone supports people that meet their interests but the western countries talk like they are the judge and the police of the world that can enforce what other countries have to do. But they only do it when it aligns with their interests. And it ultimately harms the people of condenmed or sanctioned countries and not the leader or governmenr unlike what western countries are intending or saying. Iranian people don't hate their government because of u.s and eu sanctions and it doesn't help when governments show those countries as enemies. Erdogan first got a lot of support from eu which helped his image brought him secular supporters. And after that because of the way eu treated turkey he again got more votes because countries like france became sort of like an outside force that wants to remove erdogan which made him a symbol of turkey for some people made him a leader. Why do or say anything about turkey's internal affairs. You're not going to be changing anything turkey withstood a whole u.s embargo in the 70s and came out stronger with an lot worse economy before the embargo then it has today. Turkey will always be there. it's not like turkey is going to lose its military power by western policies it is too big and powerful for that to ever happen. Why bother with sanctions condemnations you're practically helping erdogan and reducing your trade and losing your market. Just don't do anything man.
And so, Turkey's military leadership was made to answer to Erdogan, who promptly engaged in not one, but TWO sham investigations that forced almost the entire existing leadership of the military out, leaving no one to challenge him as he slowly dragged the country toward political Islam.
