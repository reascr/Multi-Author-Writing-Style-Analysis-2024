All that said, nuclear war still wouldn’t be the end of the world. According to publicly available nuclear treaty info, there really aren’t any more city buster sized warheads left. Most nukes are 800kt or smaller now, and intended for tactical and not strategic use. What’s more, in the 90’s nuclear strategy evolved away from targeting population centers and is focused on military strategic targets (read; ports, airports, mil bases, resources).
I agree. I can imagine some Colonel somewhere just pocketing all the maintenance money and thinking "We aren't ever using these, at most we'll have to destroy them in some treaty negotiation...why shouldn't I have this money?" and then further thinking "Hey, I might be saving the world by stealing this money!".
There are plenty of wars for which there is a valid argument the US were warmongers, but the idea that the US would be responsible for nuclear armageddon tied to the current conflict initiated with zero provocation by Putin’s Russia is the dumbest thing I’ve read on Reddit today.
