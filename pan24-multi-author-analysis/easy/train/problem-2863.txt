Ok? Winner/Loser of the popular vote is a meaningless statistic that has never been the criteria to selecting a President. Every Justice on the SC has been appointed by a President who won the Electoral College, meaning the SC is democratic.
Billionaires are inherently unethical. I don't give a fuck about the fact that there are super wealthy people out there, I do care that there are people who are dying because they have to ration insulin while Jeff Bezos builds megayachts. You can have an upper class while still acknowledging that having a billion dollars is obscene.

I think in the short term: this flat out results in waaaay less people going to college for things that are not literally nursing, teacher, dr, engineer because the fact is that people are realizing that a lot of the statistics about how much richer people become, is a phenomenon in which the salaries and economic health of people who come from a lot of money are being statistically lumped with people who have to take out loans because THEY HAVE TO (yes there is another demographic that can afford it and rather pay the loans for their kids), the results of people who come from wealth and have always gone to college really skewed the reality of the story. Yes cats out of the bag, lots of people go to the all holy college and 10k is still a big deal to them. I think it will be a decade before the system itself is changed. In the short term, much less people will go. It’s an admission that this isn’t a smart financial decision for most people.
