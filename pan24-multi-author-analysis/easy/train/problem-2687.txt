Well one doesn’t do anything for the country as he is a state governor. The other is an ex president so they don’t do anything really at all. My utility bills went down 81% from where I used to live. Gas has been between $1-3 cheaper a gallon from where I came from. Rent and housing is cheaper. Hell even my car insurance was less. I also don’t give the state I’m from 10% of my income before I get paid. I also don’t have a couple dozen micro taxes like paying for transients to ride the bus, or creating a multimillion dollar fund to house them- yet no one knows where the money went. Consumables are about the same but all in all I’m making a hell of a lot more money under one of those guys- more than I’ve made over the last 31 years. So yeah, one of them is doing alright by me. Will he make a good presidential candidate? No idea. Politics at that level these day is a complete crap show. I honestly could care less who gets elected to that position because the last two decades have been a laughing joke. I’d prefer to just deal with the state I live in and keep enjoying life without wasting my time on fretting who is President .
