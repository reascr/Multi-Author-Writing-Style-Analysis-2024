Principled Republicans went extinct in the 1960's when they began the southern (racist) strategy that they continue to use to this day. Any pretense of "principles" was just window dressing. Their real core principles are racism, fascism. Trump just made it "ok" to say their deeply held ideas out loud. Hate is their most cherished virtue.
Well, you don't expect them to change, what you do is recognize that they're a minority, and a minority that's actually been shrinking a bit, and they're vastly out-numbered by independents and democrats (not to mention libertarians and greens), and they're increasingly hanging on to power by their fingernails, with increasingly sleazy and desperate moves that are getting so obvious it's only going to get harder for them.
Did that happen? Or where people that normally wouldnt have voted went and casted a ballot? And yes i imagine some reps did switch their vote but prob those are now not republicans anymore either .. am brainstorming here and actually curious what happenned.
