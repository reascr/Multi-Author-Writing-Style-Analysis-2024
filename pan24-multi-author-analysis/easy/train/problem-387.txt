There is ton of articles and studies from non government institutions that found a lot of this fighters are very extremists and a lot of them were fighting for isis and other terrorist groups they aren't "affiliated" with isis or any other group for now but many were.
I didn't mentioned the majority of them are affiliated with isis or Al qaida or that they went to Libya to fight for isis and Al qaida I said they went for money like what most isis fighters join isis for.
And I will repeat it again most isis fighters join isis for money especially in beginning when isis had huge income from oil fields and royalties, and those fighters after isis lost all their territories in iraq and syria they found better offer from Turkey to fight for government having huge connections with Muslim brotherhoods or atleast what they believe.
I mean these guys aren't there for no reason. They are there to protect Russian financial investments and expand Russian political reach. The tactical losses of these extra forces being relocated to positions in Ukraine would pale in comparison to the strategic gains of Russia losing whatever assets they are overseeing in Africa.
