Follow the money, who benefits most from Biden being gone? Considering that Biden was NOT going to cut Social Security or Medicare and was going to help ALL AMERICANS with huge critical costs (healthcare, childcare, our infrastructure's future, etc.) with the savings from ending the 40% plus corporate tax cuts. Also was going to focus on transitioning to a more green future which will help us all (including kids/grandkids) live to a ripe old age and have tons more decent paying jobs/opportunities for American Dream with so many more with disposable income. So, of course the big corporations have been pissing off the unions while holding back stock, raising prices; maintaining the anti-green stance which has held up climate change reductions and kept crop yields down; allowing so much in crazy that can't switch tariffs on China products (maintaining inflation) to another, more damaging punishment to China for their grave civil rights violations too. Amazingly, stock levels are back in time for the Holidays, gas prices have dropped huge too. Right after the election and no one is complaining as much about inflation. Hmmmmm. Follow the $$$. Everything is still messed up with effects of Citizens United, but some really crazy stuff going on right now, right? Thoughts?
Of course none of this is possible unless the Republican party up and fucking dies, at least in national politics, because they will never support reforms and can step into party divisions to cleave off supporters in a first-past-the-post system. The solution is electoral reform, but in order to get electoral reform progressives either need to win or convince centrists to vote for it. It's a sucky catch 22.
