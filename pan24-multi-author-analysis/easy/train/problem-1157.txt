I bought a small used solar panel, MSR gasoline stove, 2 laterns, 4 flashlights on ebay/amazon 3 weeks ago, still waiting for delivery. Planes can't land in Ukraine, so they have to land in Europe and unload there. Can't imagine what people that a waiting for a complete blackout gonna do. Shops are already out of stoves and propane canisters (thanks to AliExpress that sells $1 adapter that allows to refuel them). Other camping gear is out of stock or 2-3x price. No 70+Ah car batteries, power stations like ecoflow are $1000+, I can sell my 10yo 300w car inverter for crazy money. So yeah, any gear can be helpful, but make sure that it will be delivered, there are many cases when people donate to a scammers and gear/money just disappears. Find trusted source that have proven record of successful work.
It's very similar in Slovakia, particularly with Bratislava, mainly for the same issue you've described - actually changing your "permanent residence" officially is a bureaucratic hassle that most don't want to go through with unless absolutely necessary.
