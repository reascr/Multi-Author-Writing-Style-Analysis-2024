Ok, there’s a thing about Ukrainians, our sense of humour has been pointed out as early as 500 years ago by some French historian whose name I don’t remember. Hell, there’s even a whole category pf of Ukrainian family names as “funny cossack family names” such as Nepyipyvo (Don’tdrinkbeer). God damn, one of my friend’s family name is Mandiuk, which can be roughly translated as Cuntson (try and guess what his nickname in school was, lol). We are perfectly aware that those “donations” from Russia are not voluntary, but it’s not like it will stop us from joking that Russia is our biggest weapon donor.
Industrialization and manufacturing still win wars. It’s exactly what we saw with SpaceX and the Boeing/Lockheed partnership. For decades we operated under the assumption that space was fundamentally hard and that we needed these bloated contracts to operate. Then Elon Musk and SpaceX came around and absolutely crushed the old school players in the market. Every other space company is obsolete because of what Falcon 9 can do in terms of cost and reliability. Even the next generation vehicles like SLS are basically dead on arrival due to program costs. It’s absolutely insane the stagnation that industry caused in the space business.
