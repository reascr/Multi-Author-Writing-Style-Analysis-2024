There are different people in leadership, and also ordinary people in Ukraine have fundamentally changed their attitudes. It takes time, but the change was visible even visually already a year ago, when the cities and villages looked better: the roads were better, the infrastructure was better, children's playgrounds, city administration buildings and so much more were better: because bit by bit, attitudes have changed and people started demanding that their local governments function for the benefit of the people and if not, many corrupt officials have gotten voted out.

He lost the elections partially due to corruption allegations, had a trial for corrupt dealing in the Donbass that was put on hold because of the war, used terrible divisive and inflamatory rhetoric against the 73% of voters that voted for Ze and his people run some form of troll farm that only causes problem among people, getting them riled up, spreading bs, heck his trollfarm even attacked Birdie from Azov for praising Ze (and the Azov of Mariupol are like national heroes in Ukraine, you don't attack them).
Was it perfect? Of course not. But so much better! Ironically, that didn't diminish people's fears of corruption -- to the point of almost conspiracy theories. But still, the prevailing attitude really did change substantially. I would say the major changing point was the Orange revolution and ousting of Yanukovich.
Gargantuan task. Especially during wartime, needs a systematic approach. Corruption in Ukraine was always at the second place after Belarus and Russia.
