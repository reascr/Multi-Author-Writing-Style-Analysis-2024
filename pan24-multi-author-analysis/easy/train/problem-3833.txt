Don't be mistaken, the Qing empire was still pretty fucking brutal. I won't post it here because it might violate sub rules but just search up "Qing brutal punishment" or something along those lines. Some of that stuff is straight up fucked.
Alternate headline: "227 parliament members just made themselves prime targets for revolutionary assassin's, while simultaneously giving up the deantological protection of the Innocent and becoming legitimate targets.".
Not only does the government have the political willpower and capital to violently crack down, there is little historical evidence that, unless the secular military forces start to mass mutiny to support the protestors, that the protesting demographic that has a big chunk from the more comfortable part of the socio-economic ladder will fold. That's how it's almost always worked. People living in any semblance of comfort are not likely to meet violence with violence unless they are shown that considerable military force will defect to them or that the government is heavily split and unwilling ot match it's rhetoric.
