The previous Kims used to do the same saber rattling about developing weapons but didn't actually follow through for the most part, or would offer concessions on what they had done in exchange for aid. The current Kim just keeps pushing forward with weapons development and the international community has not quite responded in kind to it yet.
Fatty Kim the Third however is developing weapons regardless of consequences. Perhaps the time has come to end all aid. I believe that at some point this regime must be allowed to just collapse entirely.
Hahaha! Yeah until the UN offers them ANOTHER aid package, and they accept it saying they’ll make concessions. Those concessions will fail to materialize. And the whole cycle will start again.
No one in power wants it to collapse: Kim Jong-un knows he will go from absolute power to executed for crimes against humanity if he loses China doesn’t want South Korea and this the US on its border South Korea doesn’t want to deal with having to bring millions of people to the present as the money needed would destroy their economy The US doesn’t want to deal with the fighting and economic devastation.
