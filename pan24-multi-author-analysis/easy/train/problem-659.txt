cut to Yuri in front of 50 smartphones he is controlling with his mind, saying "Almost had him!" and then it shows he is playing pokemon go.
Not even in the top 10, and plummeting given sanctions and their manufacturing/farming/logistics equipment likely starting to have maintenance/replacement issues.
It is. Term is "boyar". Basically the head of state is always right and the "boyar"s who are in charge of implementing everything are not. So in typical discussion forum we have these boyars who say their problems to the head of state (e.g our people are starving) then the head of state says: "Why? Fix it." and the boyar says "Right. Thank you lord." Boyars are not allowed to say anything else during this forum. Their job is to be yes men and shut up and let the glorious leader solve everything with his infinite wisdom. Everyone claps and discussion is moved to another subject. The head of state said to fix it and boyar failed to do it so boyar is in the wrong here. This theatre continues down the rank until some grunt is given an impossible task.
Precisely. Imagine looking at your country where they don’t have running water or indoor toilets, etc., and thinking you’re doing a good job and then thinking you should actually expand and spend resources on a genocidal invasion instead of actually trying to make the place you already have any better. Fucking idiotic. These people aren’t leaders, they’re middle management that have strong-armed themselves into a promotion outside of their abilities.
