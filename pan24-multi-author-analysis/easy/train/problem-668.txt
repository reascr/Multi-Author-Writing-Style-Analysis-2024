Go hang out with your local LGBTQ and gay straight alliance type groups and see how you can help locally. Learn how to identify homophobic language and learn the little old grandma slurs like “I hope Satan loosens his grip on your heart” “I can’t believe your grandmother allowed your parents to raise you like this” and the anti homophobic talking points to go with it, and push back against it. If you truly are an old lady, like wrinkled with grey hair, you are one of the most powerful warriors for kindness, love, tolerance, and forgiveness. You fill the surrogate role of grandma in the hearts and minds of those who have lost a grandma, and you have the power of causing shame through a deep emotional wound; “my grandma is ashamed of me” feelings. I know I live my life by 2 simple thoughts “would my grandma be ashamed of me for doing this?” And “would she be mad at me for doing this” I always try to choose the answer leading to “no, it would not make her feel like that about me” and I’m not special, so other people can easily be swayed by you being a kind caring older lady.
