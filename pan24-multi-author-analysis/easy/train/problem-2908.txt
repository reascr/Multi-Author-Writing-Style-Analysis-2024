I still advocate hedging our bets with the molten salt reactors. The difficulty with those designs come down to material science, and proving corrosion of chemically stable salts won't break a pipe in 30 years of operation, and such like that. Far more approachable. They've run those reactors constantly to great effect for years, in the past. We can produce the massive energy fusion produces, dispose of nuclear waste and warheads, go a long way to producing hydrocarbon fuels from the atmosphere or ocean, and all the medical isotopes and spacecraft fuel we'd ever need. Also, if ever fusion does come, someone's got to be able to produce the Tritium for the fuel supply. Currently Fusion gets gobs of funding, but molten salts get almost nothing in comparison. We have this backwards.
Obviously there are other costs , installation and maintenance and failing panels replacement etc but i seriously think this is doable and would benefit the UK like no other project ever has( well other than the government upgrading homes to all have indoor plumbing and the existing electric grid and the phone system and roads, well yeah ), to not only become a green energy country but to enable advancements in the technology that could be sold to other countries as i am sure many would be looking at doing the same when they saw the UK gain almost zero fossil fuel use for energy.
