Heh, great story! So he'd be all over free cookies and yet pay millions in fines for bribery charges and millions more for a presidential pardon. Seems there's much less drama in behaving yourself and rewarding that with a $4 box of cookies (no oak tree lurch, either).

Absolutely true. People are seriously mistaken if they think the doctor down the street who makes $800,000 a year is not paying taxes, after they read a report that Elon Musk or Bezos paid no taxes last year. Those two filers are not at all the same, and hitting up the doctor for a greater percent of his income in taxes will do nothing to make the billionaire class pay a single cent of taxes. The problems with the tax code are deep and structural, and increasing top marginal rates wonâ€™t fix those problems. You could make the top marginal rate start at $100,000 a year and capture 100% of income earned above that, and billionaires could happily continue to pay absolutely nothing.
