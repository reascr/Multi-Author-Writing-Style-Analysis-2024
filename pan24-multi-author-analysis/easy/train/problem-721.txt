No case is airtight. If the DOJ with all it’s resources can’t consume enough evidence to indict anyone after two years,including Trump or Hillary Clinton (about those silly emails) the investigation needs to end. We use to call the claims by cowardly government officials that wouldn’t indict the powerful “paralysis by analysis”. I don’t know what is happening at the federal level, but Pomerantz who resigned from the Manhattan DA’s office claims the delays in indicting Trump were due to so much legal discussions that it paralyzed proceeding with a case. I suspect the same thing is happening with DOJ.
The power to pardon and to remove disabilities is vested in the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, although it may be prohibited from issuing a pardon or superseded by the legislature in cases involving recidivists and persons serving life sentences. Ga. Const. art. IV, § 2, para. II; see generally Ga. Peace Officer Standards & Training Council v. Mullis, supra. The governor is expressly precluded from exercising power over of granting of pardons or paroles. Ga. Code Ann. § 42-9-56.
