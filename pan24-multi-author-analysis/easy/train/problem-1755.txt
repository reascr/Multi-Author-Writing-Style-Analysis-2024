Month later: "...it doesn't represent the full picture of T-14 Armata. It was still being worked on and some important protective components were absent.".
Almost like fascist states can't help but overestimate themselves and their capabilities due to the ideology of domination and submission, and that the obligatory presence of the strongman surrounded by yes men at the very top leads to bad decisions that no one underneath dares question, which causes the fascist state's military to focus on building worthless wunderwaffe instead of actually useful shit.
I heard it as well. I heard the background is that their "all round protection system" is not active if a hatch is open. The T-14 has/had no AC ... so the personnel always have a hatch open in hot desert environments -.
Precisely. They also have a tendency to underestimate democracies and they see the argument and division within democracies as a weakness rather than a strenh. The truth is that in heirarchical systems based around control it’s actually much easier for corruption and incompetence to go unchecked because no one is allowed to question poor decision making from people in power. In democracies journalists and ambitious politicians absolutely love to expose the other sides incompetence and corruption which makes it much easier to then fix these problems. “Strongman” governance regularly leads to weaker nations because the true strenh of a country has very little to do with the personality of the head of state but rather with the nation as a whole.
