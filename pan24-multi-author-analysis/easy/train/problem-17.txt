Almost all the prominent cases of an elected Democrat in a red state/vice versa are for those state offices (Jon Bel Edwards in Louisiana, Beshear in Kentucky, Scott in Vermont, Sununu in New Hampshire, and until this month Baker in Massachusetts and Hogan in Maryland). For Senate the only examples are Manchin in West Virginia and Tester in Montana.
Wait, seriously? Strom Thurmond was still a senator in 2000?? I thought he was from the history books.
I wish that I could argue that having an older political voice in office helps to keep the older demographic relevant because they would fight to keep them afloat through Social Security and welfare programs, but these old assholes In office have shown that they couldn't give a single iota of a fuck for their generation, so I say fuck it, and convince the older generation to embrace the new blood that may actually care about them.
Light blue states (cobalt?) do exist and those can still elect Republicans under certain circumstances. Consider virginia's governorship flipping to the Republicans in 2021 (in a wave style environment for Republicans and a good GOP nominee). But California has a bigger Democratic lead that should withstand red waves, and to be frank the Republican party in California is dysfunctional. They nominate extremists at the state level instead of moderates like they used to (see Arnold Schwarzenegger).
