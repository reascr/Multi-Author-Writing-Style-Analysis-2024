Fungi and moss are some of the oldest forms of life on the planet, having diverged about 1.5 billion years ago. They flourished and thrived during a vast span of hot and cold cycles within that time frame.
Exactly. I don’t know why people don’t understand the message. I understand it’s art. But people have been trying everything to get attention on climate change. Like it’s getting to a point that people are deciding to do crazy shit like this. Also let’s not act like most art pieces arent owned by super wealthy individuals whom just use art as clout… There’s more art pieces out there than Elephants, Tigers, and Lions combined. What’s more important? Life or art?
I have done a considerable amount of work in environmental engineering, developing cutting edge remediation technologies.
