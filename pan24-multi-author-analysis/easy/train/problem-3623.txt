Yes, as for me, the title sounds horrible. It was re-reported. The bottom line is that Zaluzhny received 1 million from a former Microsoft software engineer, then he transferred money to a special military account on Jan 5. The actual story sounds legit. It has names and dates.
The only thing "war time law" has done is expanded the office of the presidency to exert more authority in global policing via the military, and domestically, with national security. We used to call that manifest destiny. Now it's the unitary executive theory. I can always tell when someone doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about because all they do is double down on their talking points. It's like you learned how to argue by watching two goldfish struggle to consume food.
Exactly. Money does nothing for you when you're dead and gone. Plus, 1 million won't last a long time in the states. The places where you can live like a king are either 1) desolate / boring or 2) expensive to the point you'd run out fast.
