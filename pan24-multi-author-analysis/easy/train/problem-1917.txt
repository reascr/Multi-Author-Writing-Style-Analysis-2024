That said I expect (and hope) that Mariupol accounts for the lion's share of casualties. For instance as I recall only around 1,000 civilians died in Kyiv oblast, and it's likely similar in Chernigiv/Kharkiv/Kherson oblasts.
Exactly. I’m Belgian, my housekeeper is Russian. Not your typical housekeeper. She’s an educated lady, with a licence in chemistry for which no equivalent is recogniseD. She married a Belgian engineer in the 90ies and her husband died a few years later. She stayed for her daughter who was now in school.
