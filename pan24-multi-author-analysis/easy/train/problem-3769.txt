That comment wasnâ€™t directed towards you BNL, sorry if it sounded that way, just a comment about the situation in general (edited for clarification). I agree w your statement.
These are people raised in adject fear of being beaten, imprisoned, raped, tortured, and killed for just THINKING questions about what is an obviously ridiculous book of very badly written and plagiarized mythology by a pedophile barbarian warmongering charlatan from fourteen centuries ago.
Thanks. For the record, although I'm a Muslim, in recent years I've been having an increasingly worsening crisis of faith over... well, too many things of complexity to talk about. But it still pisses me off when people misinterpret modern Muslims' failure to properly apply certain aspects of their religion (such as, in this case, the unfortunate prevalence of sexism and misogyny - and I'm using the terms as Islamic teachings define them, because the Western interpretation considers those teachings to be still "sexist"/"misogynistic") as actually indicative of what said religion teachs.
