That’s part of it. Republicans love to use Christianity because it gives them an instant win morally. They can look at any situation and claim whatever they did as the right and moral thing because they’re Christians and walk with god! By default they feel special and better than anyone else.
Prior to the Reagan administration, Christian churches typically voted Democrat. The strategy for Republicans to embrace evangelicals for the vote started in that time. Ever heard of Kennedy Catholics?
First off, obviously most of them don't really believe this nonsense at all, but for sake of argument, what they will say is that while the election was fraudulent, the ceremony of swearing in the president and legal handover of power was all legitimate and conducted according to the rule of law, so they will admit that Biden is the president, just not the duly-elected president. It's really the fringe of the fringe who claim that his predecessor is actually still secret crypto-president hiding in his bunker in Florida.
