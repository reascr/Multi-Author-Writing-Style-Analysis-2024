I agree with this, BJP is getting loose because there's no actual chance of them losing the center. A competent opposition should tighten them up but Congress can't do that with the Clown Prince .
I never said it was the poorest state but a poor state which rather lagged behind much in terms of its capacity due to losing influential and wealthy individuals to neighboring states and migration abroad, these was checked by providing decent infrastructure by Modi led BJP government, there were highways and ports built to provide ease of business which mattered to core to the heart of Gujarati, I am from the neighboring state and most richest city which has seen a noticable decline in its own propensity compared to a rising and developed Gujarat. I am not challenging your facts, but they don't win election, public sentiment wins elections, or else there wouldn't be a Trump. You are clearly the type of redditor who thinks throwing fact invalidates any debate, no wonder you don't have voice in the real world, where people just walk past your without listening to your crap.
