At least the phasing cloak was inherently Federation in origin. Meaning it was engineered by people employing principles and techniques familiar to Data, Geordie, and the rest of the team. Not to mention they had the ship's computer which would be able to quickly and accurately map the circuits and pathways and materials to provide an in-depth schematic that any Federation engineer would probably understand.
Sort of. The wind is not always cooperative nor is shear guaranteed. For example getting an unpowered balloon across the tropics would be a major challenge. Not only that, it is a balloon. If you were to try to bring it down into the troposphere where the most substantial wind and shear could exist, it could be subject to loss due to small scale weather events. Like hail.
Once you move past the assumption Data is a literal database of knowledge, Geordie is somehow a phenomenal engineer, and the two of them have several hours to solve the puzzle whilst having access to a crack team of engineers and one of the most advanced computers in the fleet -- it starts to look reasonable in science fiction terms.
