Yeah but the somalis have scared the Chinese away lol. They tried doing some drilling in the Self declared Somaliland region awhile back. I think it may have been confusion on their end maybe. So the Chinese got the Ok from the Somaliland government and not the actual SOMALI GOVERNMENT. So when the real government found out about the new contract they ran to China and asked why are they doing this, to which china replied with an apology. Eventually the self declared state of Somaliland in the north got pissed off at the actual federal government of somalia. When china saw this, they just decided it was better to leave them be.
Who's warmongering? The US and its Western allies are the ones who created the mess in Syria and Iraq. We're the ones cleaning them up.
The irony here is the same author and his liberal buddies were the biggest supporters of Erdogan back in 2002, when lots of Turkish Secularists warned the ‘west’ about his movement being disingenious about democratic values. In fact, as they correctly warned, turns out political islam just used democracy as a tool to grab absolute power.
