Unlikely. His biggest opponent is the gun lobby since his political career literally started when his wife was shot in the head in a mass shooting (she lived, but did have major brain trauma).
No idea. All the rural red areas of the state outnumber the urban blue areas. I expected a close race, not for Ryan to get hammered the way he did. Surprisingly he didn't even win his home county.
I dunno if they will as it may set a weird precedent, again, about Congress deciding stuff into the future, and there are situations where it can backfire from a purely practical standpoint: say they pass a bill rasing the ceiling and stipulating not to touch it until after next election cycle to "protect it" from fuckery, but something happens and US runs out of runway, at which point they may not be able to raise it even if they all agreed to, causing a shutdown and financial Armageddon as us defaults on it's debt obligation.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
