Nationalizing industries and defaulting on debt are two VERY different situations. Nationalizing industries are done by buying all the assets of that company, not stealing them. By contracts, these states would not be able to afford to buy those assets back since they are valued at the cost of the original investment (essentially collateral). Also Pakistan holds a lot of investments in China. What do you think happens to these positions if Pakistan says oops not paying you sorry. Countries do not do that. No one has ever said in regards to a trade deal “nah I don’t wanna do this anymore thanks I’ll keep ur money and all the collateral too”. The world doesn’t work that way.
>Economists and behavioral scientists use a related term, sunk-cost fallacy, to describe the justification of increased investment of money or effort in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment ("sunk cost") despite new evidence suggesting that the future cost of continuing the behavior outweighs the expected benefit.
Seize land? How? There really isn’t anything China can do if countries don’t pay back except cutting ties or going to war - not happening in the US’s backyard.
