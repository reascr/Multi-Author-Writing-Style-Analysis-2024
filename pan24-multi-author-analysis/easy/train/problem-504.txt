There are two ways to "solve" this problem: you abolish social healthcare and fully liberalize it, meaning the rich are healthier and the poor are not - which leads to the rich getting poorer because they will eventually run out of people to sell their services at a premium; or you strive for a better-funded social healthcare by not having budget taken from it, from scrutinizing abuse and fraud more, such as that emanating from traffic of influences by those who are friends or family of healthcare workers skipping the queue, but most importantly, from eliminating liberalistic practices in social healthcare since a LOT of the burden of social healthcare is usually due to relying on private companies for expensive, often overpriced exams that the state ends up paying triple of what they would cost in-house.
