In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Dude. Do conservatives really like what Duchesantis has done with Florida? Seems to be antithetical to traditional conservative values. He’s destroyed free speech, passes big government policies, and seems to be the opposite of freedom loving.
Seriously. I know there’s a lot of fun talk around GOP tearing themselves apart, but god I am SO scared DeSantis wins. I’m too stressed thinking about that possibility, and too scarred from the Trump win, that it has me in geniune fear.
Exactly. He won in 2016, and almost won in 2020. 2024 will still be very competitive. Trump voters aren't going to switch to Biden. Millions more people will probably vote for Biden in 2024, but the same goes for Trump. Unless we all trust the American electorate all of a sudden.
