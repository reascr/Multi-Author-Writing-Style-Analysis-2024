In the last Australian census, the biggest growth of a religious group was 'No Religion' and it's been widely hypothesised that this wasn't because a record number of Australians had suddenly lost their faith in the last 5 years, but because people who were identifying as 'Catholic', 'Anglican' or other 'Christian' were usually just cultural Christians who were now identifying more accurately with their general beliefs than with the cultural identity that they traditionally held and had inherited from their ancestors.
At least keralites have a job. Not like you people who spread hatred for menial or no fee. For all those lies you spewed here, everyone knows how bad the people you represent are in reality. Anything that says is bad in India can be traced down to your worthless kind.
Thats an astonishingly blinkered/un-selfaware position. 'Normal' is obviously just that, not a historically or culturally subjective definition based on geography, ethnicity, and religious actions and activities.
