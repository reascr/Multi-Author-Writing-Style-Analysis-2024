In situations like Iraq or Afghanistan, the reasoning was offensive and far more about natural resources and looting than anything else. As a result, after the initial successful military intervention, the west didn't want stability or order or anything of the sort. They didn't want allies in the region. They didn't care about the people. They wanted loot and the way to get it would be unstable countries. That's why those military interventions went to shit. They were meant to.
Like do they genuinely think (for example) "I must kill this gay man for he is an affront to god" or are they actually thinking "i hate gay guys cause I spotted a dude with a cracking ass when I was 20 and now I'm scared I want a bit of it so let's use that religion chat everyone loves round here to have him killed before I get drunk and try to kiss him"?
Good! burn it to the fucking ground. Now start targetting those other clerics houses. If they think they can murder innocent children in the streets they need to know there will be repercussions.
