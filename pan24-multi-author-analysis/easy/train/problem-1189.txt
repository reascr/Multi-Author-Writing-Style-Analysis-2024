You’ve created a false dichotomy where any attempt to forcibly oust Maduro isn’t a coup attempt because he is illegitimate. I don’t know why you’d do this other than to deflect from criticism of US involvement in Latin America (as you derisively say “like if we are still in the cold war”), even though ousting him is supported by much of the world, or you don’t think the attempts to remove him should be marred by a word with seemingly negative connotations. Guaido himself called for an armed political uprising to oust him, and we supported his claim to the presidency—that’s what you’d call a coup.
Market Socialism absolutely includes economic planning. It just allows limited private markets but most industries and natural resources are owned by the state. The best example of a Market Socialist State was Yugoslavia and they absolutely had a planned Economy. Cuba, which has adopted certain Market Socialist policies, allows a limited private market of good but still heavily uses state planning. State planning is quite literally the hall mark of a socialist economy.
