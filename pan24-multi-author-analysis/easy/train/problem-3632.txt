With how successful the Ukrainian special forces have been inside Russia, if they wanted to kill Putin they probably could pull it off. But that doesnâ€™t necessarily end the war. It might make it worse.
Biggest issue with this idea is it would not stop the war (as things are now, the only things that could are either a new Russian constitution or kicking them out of every last square meter of Ukrainian soil) but would give them justification for stronger aggression against Ukraine (for example, full mobilisation, which the population doesn't support right now).
How? Russia is already trying to assassinate Ukraines leaders. So how would Ukraine attempting it themselves make it worse?
Unlikely honestly. There's a massive difference between being able to bomb Dugin's daughter straight into hell or blowing up some factories to assassinating head of state. Especially when said head of state only shows up in public when surrounded by dozens of snipers and bulletproof glass AND they have a private royal guard on top.
