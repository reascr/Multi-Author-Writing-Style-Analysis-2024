Let me add that people are getting fined just for putting a LIKE on anything that is perceived "unpatriotic". Teachers getting ratted out by pupils and parents, students getting ratted out by their fellow students, people getting disowned by their family for not supporting the "spetzoperaciya", it's Orwellian levels of dystopia. And that's before all the shell-shocked Wagnerites and amnestied murderers and rapists start coming back from the war (well, the minority that make it), in fact it's already happening, several criminal cases being reported, incidents involving demobbed soldiers. I talk to some of the many Russians who fled to my country, they are all the normal ones as far as I can see: IT people, English teachers, they don't see how they can ever go back to living there. Anything up to a million of Russia's intelligentsia gone, left the country, many of them for good, all of this seems very very bad for Russia.
We were anticipating autonomous Amazon drones delivering packages. We got remotely piloted drones dropping hand grenades.
