Hate to be pedantic, but in the case of the North Carolina Supreme Court, those partisan hacks were elected.
North Carolina had two seats on the Supreme Court up for election at midterms. North Carolina had an opportunity to maintain its Democratic majority on the NC Supreme Court.
The GOP flipped two seats on the state Supreme Court to get a majority and they picked up four seats in the NC General Assembly so they are now one seat shy of a veto proof supermajority.
Our state Supreme Court overturned a partisan gerrymandered map and actually enabled a fair map to be used for the US House at midterms.
And if anyone was paying attention, the previous NC Supreme Court threw out a partisan gerrymandered map for the US House races (see Moore v Harper). We actually had a FAIR map, for once. The old map would have likely resulted in 10 Republican victories and only 4 Democratic victories. The fair map we used resulted in 7/7 representation, an even split, basically exactly as it should be in a purple state.
