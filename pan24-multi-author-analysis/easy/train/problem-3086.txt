Posted this because Peru's starting to make the mainstream news for bad reasons. Can anyone give a more detailed rundown of what's happening? Well, besides:
Now my two cents on this, Castillo's government has been a disaster, ministers kept on resigning, he's embarassed us in the international landscape (Look up the CNN interview he gave, his speech in front of the United Nations, his usual speeches) and obviously there's the links to terrorism and corruption (Latter being the usual for every politician here) and the fact that his ideas almost did severe damage to our economy (Tried to nationalize private sectors like mining, which is one of our biggest exports, momentarily led to a lot of controversy until he decided not to), and the political instability that the government alongside congress was bringing. I don't honestly know why Castillo is getting much support from the rural parts of the country, he might have presentend himself as a president for the rural people but he hasn't really done anything in favor of them. He's only been busy with filling his pockets (The usual with every politician here). Those calling for new elections don't realize that it's the same shit always getting into congress (As hopeful as you might believe that the next congress will be better).
