If you think about it, it seems like that for many stories doesn't it? Is it financially/profit driven? Politically driven? Combination? Really makes me wonder but I do notice this about a lot of significant stories. Covid was another. One day they announced that federal restrictions were officially lifted and we are not tracking cases like we did. And immediately the story and reporting of numbers was swept under the rug where it stays. Seems like this happens to many stories that are long, drawn out and perhaps don't have resolution yet. I don't hear much about Syria at all these days either. Other parts of the world have very extreme events like genocide, famine, civil war, etc. happening daily and most people don't know anything current about those events at all. They aren't being reported anymore and the reason isn't clear to me. Is there too much to focus on ? Too much news? Would be good to know exactly what drives this.
I think these people who defending all these terrible things because "American imperialism is bad" are mostly tankies and very authoritarian leftist who hate anything US because US is the the most powerful country and is capitalist (so even 'capitalist' Russia is okay because its enemy of the US), come from a country currently at odds with the US (China, Russia, etc) or just have personal issues and want to see the world suffer.
