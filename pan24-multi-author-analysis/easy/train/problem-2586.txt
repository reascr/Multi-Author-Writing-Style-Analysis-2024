Education and healthcare are two things that could cause the Democrats to lose my vote. I vote for them as the lesser evil because there is no other party for actual leftists, Green is a joke and with first past the post elections are irrelevant like the American (Rightwing) Libertarians.
I have voted Democrat for a long time and I oppose this of course they already know we will vote for the lesser evil so they don't have to do anything but be better than the Republicans even if it means shitting on things like school teachers. This guy will help move in the privatization of schools and funneling of tax money to private schools not accountable to the same laws and line the pockets of rich people pushing their agenda under the guise of Christianity.
Revisionist history. Is there a group more cancerous to our party than the Squad? Remember that time AOC delivered legislation, oh wait, that never happened.
