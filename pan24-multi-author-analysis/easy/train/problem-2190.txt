Massively overpaid compared to who? Lithuanians? The Polish? In fact German engineers move further north, because they get underpaid in Germany. It's not their fault these companies are run by people who give conservative estimates on EVs. Better that than having a Tesla that might go up in flames. But you know, Musk heads finna jerk it.
Lol, In your own little EU bubble, your workers are massively overpaid compared to the workers in other non-EU nations and its unfair to those nations when their rich import German made cars instead of German cars made or assembled locally, it protects the workers abroad and increasing many nations like US, China and India are building up barriers to protect its own car industries.
The real fun will begin when German car industry gets nationalized to protect its overpaid and over-socialized workers making crappy gas guzzling cars with ICE engines which are increasing forced to be produced locally where they are sold unlike the previous decade where they were built in Germany using cheap Russian gas.
