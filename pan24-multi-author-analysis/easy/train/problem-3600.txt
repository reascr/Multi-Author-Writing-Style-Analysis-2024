So, they both had classified documents. In both cases some were "top secret." They both shouldn't have had the documents. They both had them stored in a manner that is not consistent with secure and lawful storage of classified documents. Trump had more documents and likely intentionally took at least a good portion of them (assuming we aren't going to keep hearing about more and more documents being found at Biden properties). With Trump, however, the national archives and DOJ seemed to know right away that important documents were missing so they were working on clawing them back right away. There was a more limited time where the documents could have been seen by people without clearance. With Biden's documents, they were missing for over 5 years without anyone coming across them (apparently). That's assuming nobody in the shared office or some contractor doing work at Biden's house didn't come across them and snap any pictures or anything.
