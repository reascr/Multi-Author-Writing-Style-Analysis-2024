There is a court order to not build the turbines. Energy company wants to ignore the court order. Thunberg and court are on the same side in this.
The problem is that the Wind farm is fully developed, the problem for the government is that they have to clean up the mess the last government made (kinda funny nobody mention that detail ) they also have to take inconsideration the economic conditions for both the owner's of the wind park(they stand to lose about 300 million €) and the reindeer herds ( there really isn't an option for the government to let the Samí loose this one). My take on this one is to put the brakes (stopping them) on the wind farm during winter pasture and see what happens as the reindeers apparently don't like the sound of the windmills (after all we do shut down our hydrodynamic power plants when the rivers run low and to allow more water in the rivers so the ecosystem aren't hindered.
True. So just offer the handful of impacted Sami reindeer herders 1M Euro each to relent. They'll in fact be stampeding over each other to take the deal.
