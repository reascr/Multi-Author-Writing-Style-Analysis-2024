What? They got their loan forgiveness, climate spending, and saw RvW overturned, yet still were only 10-12% of the vote share this election.

Educational debt forgiveness is thievery! We need that money so every single year the entire US population can subsidize Florida, the pan handle and the east coast for hurricane damage…. it’s not their fault where choose they choose to live and Florida has no state income tax…so they deserve our help. F the future of American youth. F education…. if you educate future leaders, they might see through MAGA lies. If you don’t force parents to give up their retirement to educate their kids, then they won’t have to depend on social security to keep them enslaved. Stop complaining and get back to work socialist scum.
