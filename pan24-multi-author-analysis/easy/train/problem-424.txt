Priests sign up to be priests sign the requirement to be celibate. If a priest doesn’t want to be celibate and have a family, he should not be a priest in the first place and has only himself to blame. It’s like the president being mad he actually has to deal with congress instead of just passing executive orders all day or a kid being mad they have to go to school instead of playing video games all day (literally 1984). It’s a huge sacrifice he makes and to say it’s not fair he has to stick with his responsibilities is absurd. The pope likewise for the same reasons above, you don’t want to be tempted by flesh, yadda yadda. Same with being a woman (at least in Catholic Churches) it’s quite literally “it’s just the way it is”. In the end, it’s not fair to change the rules for everyone just because they inconvenience you, that’s self centered at best and selfish at worst.
Powerful, hierarchical nonprofit organization + frequent interaction with kids = den of organized paedophilia. Most religions, many school systems, and the Boy Scouts.
