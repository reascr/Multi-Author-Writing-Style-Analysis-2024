Come spend a night or ten in Atlanta Rice St intake and tell me it's racial, where black guards force black accused to pile 20+ people into an 8x12 shit-filthy room, so overcrowded that people sleep under the toilet to lay down because there's no room to move, lights blaring at all hours, where the guards play a game of "we'll crack the door and let oxygen into your room if you keep the ones that lose it from banging on the glass," where they purposefully delay processing people for court and bail, saying that we should write politicians for more money for them if they want it to improve, where you have to collapse and convulse if you want medical care because things like saying you're diabetic and need insulin aren't enough, where they put you in the cold cell near the open door in winter for acting up with your hands tied behind your back so you can't huddle for warmth, where COVID spreads to entire cell blocks and they simply don't count the dead, so it's not real. It's 2023, fascism can be black now, all it ever needed was an out-group, never mattered which one.
