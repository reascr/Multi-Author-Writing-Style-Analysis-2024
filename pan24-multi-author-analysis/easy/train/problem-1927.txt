Some have talked about how retreating from Kherson will free up Russian forces to fight in the east, the issue with that is it frees up most of the Ukranian forces that were fighting them as well. Some also worry about how Russia has held some of the recently mobilized back for more extensive training instead of feeding them all untrained into the meat grinder and so worry about a surge in more skilled Russian forces in a few months. That might make it tougher on Ukraine but by mobilizing more forces first and many receiving NATO training they will still have more troops trained to a better standard than Russia in a few months anyway. Plus one has to wonder if the Russian army still has the capacity to train troops to been a decent standard and what these troops will be equipped with and what heavy weapons they'll have, meanwhile Ukraine continues to receive equipment and supplies from their allies.
Officer. It is completely unreasonable that I should have to return all of my stolen goods. I like some of the stuff I stole very much. We will have to come up with a middle ground here.
