I agree but most of these idiots have no real idea why they are mad or enraged and at who...you see it over and over again in interviews when these folks are asked about whatever the current rage is about their answers make no sense or contradict themselves. This is because they haven't actually considered it themselves and are just part of the mob. Same reason they wear the shirts and hats and deck out their homes, boats vehicles...It is being part of the group and nothing more. It is the adult equivalent of pointing at your sibling when in trouble and guiltily saying..."Well, he/she told me to!".
Meanwhile, in real life (for a person in pharmacy), he oversaw HIV go from a death sentence to a manageable disease, Ebola never hit this country in any major way, the spread and improvement of flu vaccines, the management of a true worldwide pandemic with vaccine rollouts and specific antivirals. Sure many mistakes and confusion over all these decades but as a person in pharmacy, his influence makes up a daily part of my work life.
