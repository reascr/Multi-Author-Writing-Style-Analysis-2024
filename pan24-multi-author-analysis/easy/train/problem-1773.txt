With Supermax being so insanely secure do you think the cartel even attempted to come up with a break out plan? Would love to see that one sketched out on a napkin.
Definitely. That said, having a guy who who spent a big part of his life ordering the killing of children to send a message or hanging the mutilated bodies of his rivals off of bridges, or whatever else he did, having to spend the rest of his life there doesn't cause me to lose sleep at night.
Bingo. There's a reason he's petitioning to be returned to Mexico and not just moved to another facility in the US.
Interesting. I once talked to a guard from Florence, Colorado. She didn't work at Supermax but a lower security prison there. She said that every escapee always runs toward the mountains where they are ill equipped to survive. If an escapee hid in the city they might be able to blend in and laylow but in the mountains thay suffer from exposure and are found in bad shape and are rescued and reimprisioned almost glad to for the "three hots and a cot".
