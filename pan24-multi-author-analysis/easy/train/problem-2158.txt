We still have a use for Japan and Korea. They make great Allie’s and help us box in China and NK. I think they will be fine.
Regardless if it was done for elections or not, it isn’t surprising that Saudi Arabia cut oil production after the US government has acted unfavorably towards Saudi Arabia every chance they got, it is only natural that Saudi Arabia reciprocates this hostility.

Are you okay? Where I live, the price of gas has been rapidly lowering. At this rate, it'll hit below the $3 mark for the first time in a while. What does the president do to control gas prices, by the way? Enlighten me.
Saudi Arabia didn’t cut oil production to side with Russia, it did because your president vowed to make Saudi Arabia an international pariah (threatening economic devastation), removed the Houthis from the terrorist list (they were actively launching missiles to the country), and threatened to halt arms shipments.
As I mentioned. It doesn’t matter if it’s true of false. Americans were planning on invading Saudi Arabia because they refused to sell Americans oil. When Americans threaten to starve the saudi. Starvation if Americans favored weapons. Just ask the Iraqi. 500000 child were starved to death by the Americans. King Faisal said “ we lived on date and milk”.
