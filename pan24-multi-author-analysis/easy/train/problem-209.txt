To be fair, he's probably asked his chiefs if they still have loads of rockets, and they've slowly moved away from the window and gone, "Oh, sure... Rockets? Oh man, yeah, them, LOADS of them, God, we can't move for rockets we've got so many, isn't that right Dimitri?".
It makes more sense to attribute the ultimate surrender to the Soviet intervention considering the Supreme Council didn't meet to discuss surrender until after the Soviet Invasion of Manchuria, which was several days after the first atomic bomb, with the 2nd atomic bomb dropping during the meeting.
ha! They actually did that one year back in the 50s. Formation of 6 bombers flew over the Red Square parade. Over the horizon, 3 dropped out and 2 others joined. Flew over again. Repeated this about 10 times, using all 12 of their bombers. But it backfired on them. The Naval Attache' to the American Embassy, after crapping his pants, reported to Washinon that the Soviets had 50 bombers, he'd seen and counted them. So America went to work built 400 bombers.
