They'll just do what they did after Crimea. Lay low for a while, try and influence world politics through propaganda, blackmail and coercion, all while building up their military capabilities until they're ready again be it in 5 years or 15.
Optimistic. I suspect they won't do anything so sensible and will instead go looking for a much smaller, less well-defended nation to invade in order to 'restore Russian pride'.
Exactly. The best move would be to wind down the military into a smaller force with more professionals and less corruption. Except not being a global power, focus on territorial defense and treated partnerships. Move the annual conscripts into a part-timeTDF style force with oversize from the National Guard to prevent abuse within the ranks. Have your reservists act as the NCOs and warrant officers for the TDF. And only keep up enough jets and tanks to discourage invasion from the West and South long enough for China or Nato to come to your rescue depending on whichever side wasn't the one invading you.
