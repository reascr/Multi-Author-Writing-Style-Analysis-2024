I agree with both you and u/DrunkInSpace that his comments would suggest some is going on there. When I saw the tweet about Crimea, I literally said “there’s no way he believes that shit,right?!”.
I will say this: everyone says that there are very strong fortifications in Crimea, but in fact it is already clear that there is practically no equipment, and the local population is offered to dig trenches on the border for 60-100 dollars per day, (which is a lot of money for locals), but the trenches are mostly dug by not locals- that is Russians from other regions.
Not gonna happen. America is calling for Ukraine to have serious negotiations. They want the war to stop. They are not giving Ukraine the F16s and will pussy foot out of this. Russia will keep Crimea as planned from the beginning. Ukraine is a buffer zone between the NATO and Russia. Russia knows that and will take bits on the side which will be fine for US and NATO.
A country that is not NATO not Russia and lies between both. Is a buffer zone country. NATO and Russia both will never take it on terms of agitating each other. This is the whole point of NATO. A clear line on who is not protected in war games of east and west.
