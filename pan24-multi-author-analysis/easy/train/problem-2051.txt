Interesting stat is that the number of kids married couples have is actually pretty stable. The number that keeps going down and down is the marriage rate, and itâ€™s not just in Japan. You have as the biggest impact the positive development associated with the rapid rise in social status and freedom for women, where as previously they were married off as soon as they graduate mandatory education, versus now where the majority pursue higher education or employment. The second biggest impact is that we also have far more entertainment options for single people. No one is spending their saturdays going out to bars to meet single people and have sex when they can curl up indoors and watch a good tv show or movie from their laptop. They can even get sexual gratification from just a single push of the button.
Immigration. Easy. Problem Solved. Certainly no lack of people on this overpopulated earth. We already wiped out 70% of all land mammals by taking over their habitats in the last 30 years. But I guess people will not be satisifed until every forest on earth has been replaced by fields, roads or houses.
Everyone's experience is different. I was never really interested in raising kids but after having two I can't imagine life without them. My life is very different now but also better.
