A bit more about me: My scholarship has been cited in landmark Supreme Court cases on the First and Second Amendments (Citizens United v. FEC and McDonald v. City of Chicago). Just over a decade ago, I looked at the history of America's conflict over gun control in my book, Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America. My most recent book, which came out in 2018, is called We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights and was a finalist for the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and other awards.

"It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the States, and in view of this prerogative of the general government, as well as of its general powers, the States cannot, even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security, and disable the people from performing their duty to the general government.".
