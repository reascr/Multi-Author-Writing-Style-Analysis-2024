The exception is at times with sensitive leaks when prosecutors go after them they make arguments about how such attacks chill the press which we rely in so heavily to inform us. In this case the fact that the recipient is publishing to many readers matters a lot and some states have actually codified that in law — commonly referred to as “the reporter’s privilege.” (Theoretically, anyone could make the same argument on First Amendment grounds without a statutory privilege, and in old days, they did. You still can).
I wish the media would highlight the fact that Carlson has argued in court that he is an opinion journalist and no reasonable person would believe the things he says, and that he purposely pushed the false narrative of bad election integrity specifically because he knew it was what his viewers wanted to hear, even if it wasn’t the truth.
Holy shit! Those people are interfering with our ideologically-based narrative with their ideologically-based narrative. Let’s stoke some outrage from our crazies.
