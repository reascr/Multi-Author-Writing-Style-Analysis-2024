Because if my assumption that they were scared off by the check boxes he listed, then the Dems need to rework their framework for deciding which house races to invest in. You can't just see that the republicans are running a gay latin jew and decide against spending even the most basic amount of money necessary. As of right now, we only have confirmation that he's Brazilian. So much confirmation that we aren't sure if he's actually allowed to be seated in congress. We now know he isn't Jewish and his sexuality is now up for debate.
Society? If you can fraudulently put credentials forward with no repercussions or consequences it is not society at fault. This is simply cause and effect. He was caught now what? The fact nothing is happening now points to a very broken system as people will always lie in attempts to get money or power. This got this pathological liar and fraud both.
