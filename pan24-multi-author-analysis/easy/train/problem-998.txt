This dilemma was solved back in the Roman era. In the late years of the republic period a senator named Catilina tried to overthrow the sitting consuls with a private army. He was found out before he could put the plan into action and his accomplices holding public office were arrested. At the time there were two positions: Cicero who said that the prisoners should be sentenced through the senate, skipping a normal trial entirely (without a right to appeal), because these men where still a danger and if their plan somehow succeeded there wouldn’t be an entity to hold them accountable anymore, and Caesar, at the time a young senator, who brought forward the “but they didn’t commit the crime yet” argument (and also said that they should be prosecuted by a normal court in multiple sessions and not by the senate in a night). Guess what happened? The accomplices were found guilty and that has always been the approach through history if you have charges of sedition. The main organizer of the plot fled and joined his army of insurgents, which was then obliterated by the regular army.
