Ahh but their mental fitness made them the fittest in that scenario. Humans arenâ€™t extremely brawny even for apes, we dominate through communication and tool making, which requires intelligence- ergo I would argue that intelligence has always meant been a prerequisite for survival.
Lol no. It'll take at least 18 years for the 'cannon fodder' to become ripe to be shoved into a cannon. This is for attempting to prevent the catastrophic collapse of the Russian demographics. It's not the economic devastation caused by the sanctions that's fucking Russians for years to come. It's the fact that scarce few youth will be saddled with holding all of the old and infirm on their shoulders. And they're not gonna do that. They're just going to leave, and might return after several decades when the huge swathes of old people have died off so they can actually live in their ancestral homeland without being suffocated and broken by the weight of the numerous old (and the dysfunction of the government and economy and so on).
