Thank you! I tried to research what happened and found very little. The son of the last president reported that all board members were actively working to destroy the company, (probably a major crime) and all the president could do was keep a good shareholder payout.
It was warmer than it is now during the medieval warm period. People grew grapes in England and the ice caps receded enough for the Vikings to cross into Canada and grow crops in Greenland. This period led to a boom in agriculture and civilization known as the high Middle Ages, during which the great gothic cathedrals were built. This period of growth was ended by the little ice age and the second great bubonic plague. I’m not a climate denier or anything, I just think it’s important for people to understand that warmer doesn’t necessarily mean worse. The thing that makes rising temperatures bad this time is that we have used modern technology to sustain an unnaturally high population, many living in places people shouldn’t be living in that can’t take these climate fluctuations.
