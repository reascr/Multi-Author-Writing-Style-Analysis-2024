Oh the narrative is quite clear. The Kremlin places exactly zero value on people. Not just Ukrainian either, Russian too. If you told Putin right now that he could have Ukraine if he executed a million Russians, he'd take in a heartbeat. But what it boils down to is this, if they can't have it, no one can. So they'll either take it or destroy it.
Russia has no plans to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine that is under annexation assessment as per the directive of the supreme leadership, in light of the ongoing special military operation's activated objectives and subsequent performance, which necessitate the territorial acknowledgement of a Ukrainian entity which is contingent on negotiated territorial boundaries to be considered, reviewed, and approved by the necessary officials whom are granted constitutional authority to establish markers of permanence, at which point territorial assessments and delineating markers may be accurately described through geographic representations published through the appropriate channels.
