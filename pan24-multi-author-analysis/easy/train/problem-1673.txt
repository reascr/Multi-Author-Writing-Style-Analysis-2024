Me too bro. The only good thing that came out of religion is morals, you know like don’t kill your neighbour or screw his wife. Everything else is just capitalistic bullshit, it’s all money. I became agnostic because I realized that I’m just a grain of rice on this enormous plant, like the birds and the fish and the trees that dot it, or even the mountains. So tiny in the grand scheme of a planet that keeps on spinning, and will keep on spinning long after it spits us out. So why then could I think I know what a god is, even the very definition is impossible to me. It’s just a thing that created the universe that I will never be able to understand or define. So rather than waste my time pondering the impossible, I just live. I wish others could do that, I wish agnosticism was more popular… the biggest flaw we have is that we need both an answer and a solution to everything.
It was absolutely disrespectful. Part of living in a free society is putting up with things that are completely disrespectful and offensive, while at the same time those who put up such demonstrations should be prepared when people exercise their own free speech in response.
Always. Across the board. The common traits in mythology and creationism led me to pantheism and deeper scientific theory.
Weak. They should have burned another instead of bending over like that. You can burn 10000 bibles and there will be no issue. Yeah some religious people will get mad, but big deal.
