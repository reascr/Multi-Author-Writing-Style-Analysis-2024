"at which Republican senators discussed why they fell short of expectations in the midterm election." Perhaps on a biological level the younger generations (those under 45 I guess) have moved on from the ways of the older generations (those 46 and over I guess I don't know). The older generations just can't grasp that reality/morality has changed, and technology has outpaced what they thought was possible. Sooner or later a good majority of rational Americans will become fed up literally and become more politically active. If you take notice of social science reports society is getting better with the bumps on the road included. Every generation gets better then the last right? Humanity as come a long way from our worst. These old people like McConnell as out of date as they are play more a remembrance of what we once were but not who we are now. Each of those people like McConnell Graham and younger politicians all bear the stamp of their generations influences.
Ohhhhhh scary. I guess itâ€™s unwise to vote against the lead barnacle of the Kentucky Foghorn Leghorn mob.
