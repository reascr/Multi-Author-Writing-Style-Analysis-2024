I thought this was public knowledge, propping up dictators and conservativism to stop popular movements that could turn communist was in fashion during the cold war.

Again while Jefferson self-identified as a Christian in the sense that he valued Jesus's teachings and morals he didn't believe Jesus was the literal or adopted Son of God which is kind of a prerequisite for being Christian (because if valuing Jesus's is teachings is enough then all Muslims of the world are also Christians because the Quran considers Jesus a prophet and actually says his name more often than the Bible) so by any reasonable categorical definition that doesn't include self-identification he is not a Christian or if he is then the entire Islamic world is Christian too which you do apparently think is a separate religion from Christianity.
