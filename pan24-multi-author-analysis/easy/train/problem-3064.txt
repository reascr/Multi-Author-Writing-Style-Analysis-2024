That soured my view of our alliance with the US quite a bit, made me feel pretty shit to know that an American official could come over here, potentially kill me or a loved one out of stupidity or incompetence, and just skip off back to the US with no legal recourse for us to take whatsoever.
No, you didn't. You traded it for strategic military bases, and then a loan that would continue for about.. until 2008, I think the last payment was? UK National Debt exceeded 200% of GDP by the end of WW2.
Ever since the election day bolominions have been trying to make something happen, so the movement lost a lot of steam just by people losing faith, losing hearth, or just waking the fuck up, the only reason they succeeded is because the local police escorted them in, and the security forces at the 3 palaces were criminally understaffed (the security minister of the capital has already been fired and there are several calls from big names for his immediate arrest, he also just happens to bevacationing in florida right now, the same US state bolsonaro is living).
I disagree. Everyone of any consequence knew about the buildup and in fact had been planning for it since 2014 at the latest. It was way too late in the game for the news cycle to affect the outcome and Putin knew that, Canada already had a warship patrolling the black sea, which is very possibly what triggered the protests. The Canadian government has taken a consistently aggressive posture with Russia for many years (as much as Canada can be aggressive) and Putin particularly hates deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland. The protests were an act of war/terrorism.
