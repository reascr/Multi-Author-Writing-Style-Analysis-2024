Which you base on what? You need to take into consideration everything that goes into developing a modern, powerful Air Force, such as the cost, the technical know how, the time, the quality of training, and the fact China has no history of Air Force superiority to draw from and is playing against a massive game of catch up against an armed forces with a budget not only larger than its own, but also larger than its budget combined with India, UK, Russia, Germany, Saudi, France, Japan, and South Korea.
That is not true. According to the most commonly accepted definitions, including those used in the Geneva Convention, soldiers fighting as part of a nation’s armed forces are explicitly not considered mercenaries, regardless of their nationality.
What? A lot of Russians are protesting the war. Most have hated Putin for years, before you or anyone else even cared in the slightest about him. There's literally protests going on in Russia right now in multiple cities against the war.
The economy won’t necessarily implode. Japan has been in a similar situation for decades. Growth may stall but it won’t collapse imo.
Honestly probably yes. But Russia seems to be paying them a pretty good price, and many of the Chinese soldiers have at least some frontline experience. If it works out well for Russia it could be a very bad thing for Ukraine because it means a drastic increase in manpower against them and China absolutely does need to protect its interests in Russia.
