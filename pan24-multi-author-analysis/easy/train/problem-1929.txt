Is it weird that I don't care about ES6? Every game they've released since Skyrim has been progressively worse in quality to the point where they shat the bed with Fallout 76. I see no reason why any future games From Bethesda will not be any different.
Vladmir lied to his people about the scope of the "special military operation", sent tens of thousands of hapless soldiers to their deaths, destroyed his country's economy, made Russia a pariah country on the international stage, killed scores of civilians and children, is running out of ammo and is now being questioned and plotted against by his own inner circle. At least the American GOP loves him.
Your reasoning that he isn't afraid is directly tied to how much fear propaganda you believe about Putin it seems, KGB training won't be doing him any good here, and again as far as nukes if he could escalate any further he would, he clearly has been lying about his nuclear capabilities, or more appropriately has no way to successfully deliver them through modern anti missile systems otherwise Ukraine would barely exist and the US wouldn't.
Picked one up in store at jb hifi last week. The disc drive was doa and went back the next day and swapped it out for the last one in stock. So some stores are getting stock slowly trickling in finally.
