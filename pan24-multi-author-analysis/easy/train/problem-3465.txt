To the bold: This is another standard GOP talking point about "abuse of power", they'll argue everything has to go through Congress no matter how small. This ignores the fact that entities like the FCC, FTC, IRS were created by Congress to manage specific forms of governing (Communications, Trade, Taxes) so Congress isn't bogged down with every little detail. They act as extensions of Congress and the Executive branches. Additionally because of how the House and Senate are currently split right now, any potential new legislation on a bill to get rid of Non-competes which benefits Republicans and big business because the rules will remain the same.
What? But I thought TV was already regulated! No....only broadcast over-the-air channels are regulated (because the government owns the wavelenh). Anything cable (and satellite and streaming), is not. Which is why NBC, CBS and ABC have to be careful not to show too much bias, but Fox and OAN and Newsmax can lie their asses off with impunity. Which is why the GQP will never support changing this.
