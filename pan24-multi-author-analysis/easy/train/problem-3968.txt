Having your army act as "separatist forces," hiding them amongst civilians, and then screaming about "atrocities" committed against Russians by the defending army is not legitimate. Maybe if we didn't see Russian army AA guns shoot down a passenger jet we might have ... no, no we wouldn't. Everyone sees what Russia did. No one wants this "move your army in and pretend they're local volunteers" to become a legitimate way to seize territory. No one but your own population buys this "self-defense" garbage, and I bet most of them don't even buy it around the kitchen table. There it's "our country, right or wrong," and "for the love of God, keep your head down.".
"Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not address the Makiivka strike in his nightly speech on Monday".
That's all that needs to be said. Such a common Russian attitude dating back to the tsars. It's never Father Tsar's fault. It must be the corrupt people around him. It's never Putin's fault. It's the people around him.
