I actually work in Jordan’s district, but live in another. Voting Republican and hating Democrats is part of the culture around here. If you talk policy with people most hold positions ranging from center left to Scandinavian social democracy. These people vote based on the R next to the name, but couldn’t tell you anything our representatives are actually doing. Those that are “informed” are mostly by disinformation from right wing media infrastructure like Fox News, OAN, Newsmax, radio, and Facebook before it spreads by word of mouth and they base their vote on fabricated cultural issues. Democrats and other groups of the left are terrible at messaging. Most people are on the left ideologically, but they need to find a way to compete with the bubble that Republican voters are trapped in.
Exactly. Zero bills put forth by GOP to help inflation or ANYTHING. Constant “no” voting on Dem bills to.
Propaganda. Tune in to Fox, oan, Newsmax... or any conservative radio program and listen for an hour or so. You will be amazed at how crazy it is. Then realize that this is all that the right listens to. They believe all of it.
