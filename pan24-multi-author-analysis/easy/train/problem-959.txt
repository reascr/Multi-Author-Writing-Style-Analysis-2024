Depends on the political environment of Nov 2024, 2 real life years is like 50 in politics times so it's impossible to say. Maybe the Dems should get ahead and try to prevent her from getting 45k signatures to get on the ballot but republicans would end up signing it. If moderate Biden really got behind Gallego and the republican brand continues to become more and more toxic to moderate voters they could scrape up most all the sinema votes. Americans hate 3rd party voting and the most tactical voters are usually moderates. If they think splitting their vote for sinema would throw the race to the republican that is toxic to them I don't think they'd do it, it takes an extreme kind of voter to do that say green or libertarian. The Arizona GOP is one of the most right wing, they ran McSally, Masters, Kari Lake, we'd have to see but we don't have any indication that the average az GOP primary voter is going to pick anything different.
Absolutely. I think she's one of the most insightful, intelligent members of Congress. Have you seen her in Committee? She is so well informed, she's fully researched the issues...brilliant lady. NYC is lucky to have her.
