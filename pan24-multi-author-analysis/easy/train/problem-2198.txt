What Biden should have said, "Ukraine will be victorious over Russia." This is what gets me...why won't any Western leader commit to Ukraine actually winning the war by pushing Russia all way back to pre-2014 Ukrainian-Russo borders?
But then I don't understand...if Zelenskyy can say that Ukraine wants victory, why would it be hard for Biden to say that we want the same for Ukraine? So far, I haven't heard from Western leaders touting the same line as Zelenskyy. I don't know, to me this is very clear and black and white. Is the West only supporting Ukraine to return to its status after 2014 and before Feb. 24, 2022? Or is the goal to actually push Russia back to pre-2014 borders and weaken Russia, so that it isn't a threat to Europe any more? What is the goal?
China wouldn’t need to help with the insurgence, china’s support would deter western military intervention, allowing Russia to use draconian measures to put down the insurgency. Measures that would bring western military intervention if not for the threat of Chinese nukes.
