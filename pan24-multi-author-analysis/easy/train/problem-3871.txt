I don't think that's what he was trying to say. Russia perceives having de jure power over their neighbours, meaning it thinks it has the legal right (as opposed to the power) to intervene. If you look at their arguments for invading this makes sense. Among the justifications we can see "thesr territories were ours since time immemorial", "we have the right to protect Russians" and "the right to self - determination", among others. These are inherently attempts at legally justifying their invasions.
lol no. the “coup” in montenegro was literally the mafia regime (that holds the power for over 30 years) did a false flag to pin it on the political opponents. the whole thing is a joke. a couple of people with literal slingshots tried to take over the government.
Authoritarian leftist. People who think Stalin wasn't problematic and think it's a-ok for the state to work people to death. Named "tankies" because of the tanks the Red Army sent in to crush separatist demonstrations in the SSRs.
Don't underestimate their stupidity. A tankie would say it's not a coup but the current government that is not aligned with Russia is somerhow 'illigitimate' and a puppet of the west.
