The Organizations propose that the Carriers provide employees with 15 days of paid sick leave annually where no sick leave is currently provided and increase the number of days of paid sick leave annually to 15 days where less than 15 days of paid annual sick leave is provided. Additionally, the proposal would allow annual carryover of any unused days of sick leave without limit. A savings provision is included that would not replace any more generous sick leave agreements in place. Finally, the Organizations propose that employees will not accrue any penalty points under any Carriersâ€™ attendance policies for taking sick leave and that days requested may be taken on demand and cannot be denied.
Oh for sure! I think the biggest reason we don't is because business owners only care about making more money and eventually that trickles down to every worker. Most people just work to make a wage. I can't blame them when its so hard to earn basic respect and compassion from most employers. I truly believe that if workers feel respected and appreciated, they are a lot more likely to always give their best.
