I think we’re in uncharted territory and have been for some time now so that no one can necessarily make any real predictions as we’re so far removed from the world of normal politics. Trump supporting republicans did mostly lose in the midterms which I agree is good but at the same time that hasn’t really had that much effect on the party itself tho. Especially with the base. Shit like this should be a career killer for one person’s poor judgment. But this is the third day of 20 of them still reliving what’s supposed to be their first day? That’s the party as a whole changing in front of us. That they still have supporters despite whatever they’re saying now shows an uncomfortably large amount of us have also radically changed. Republicans attempted a coup, defended Trump stealing government documents, and are trying to dismantle oversight against themselves. Anyone still left supporting them isn’t a moderate waiting for something to finally be too low for them.
