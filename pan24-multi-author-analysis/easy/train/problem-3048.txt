Realistically, the protests had absolutely nothing to do with the cyclist's death. Traffic jams in Berlin are normal, the equipment was never actually needed and the cyclist probably wouldn't have survived anyway. However, the entire right wing/conservative media apparatus tried to frame this as "the protesters killed the cyclist". Complete BS, but it helped to de-legitimize the protests.
This isn't at all helped when the opposition consists of a rapidly radicalizing Conservative party who are obvious crooks hell bent on privatizing every single thing they can get their grubby little mitts on; an increasingly ineffectual Workers party, the New Democratic Party (NDP) who are more concerned with social media and IDPOL rather than actual labor issues; the now defunct Green party, home of the loony lefties, ecoextremists, and literal antisemites; and a comedically disinterested Quebec nationalist party who ironically enough seem to be the most aware and rational bunch there while the rest of the parties holler like school children.
