The true counter to this has already been found. We already have this problem - in space. The distance traveled between the earth and Mars for example means that there is a considerable delay in when you send a signal and when it is recieved. If you send a stop command when it is about to hit an object, the delay means it might hit the object before the command is recieved. This problem already has multiple solutions that are tried and tested. They include: basic mapping software using on board sensors and auxiliary systems, pre-planned commands, check point based commands, semi decision making programs (as in rudimentary A.I. - think 1998 enemies in video games), and direct feedback based commands (you set a point or value and on board sensors update feedback commands on the device on what to do). That being said, these require more processing power, more electronics, and more weight.
