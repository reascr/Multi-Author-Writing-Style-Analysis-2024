The ‘righteousness’ is just the excuse to fool the indoctrinated believers. Same as everywhere else (even where it does not result in torture). Only very rarely, I think, are they so conceited to believe that what they are doing is actually right, in the name of their faith. As far as I can tell are two extremes in this ‘ecosystem’. Those who are ‘in’ on it, who obviously and sometimes fervently, do not truly follow or believe the tenets of their claimed faith. These people are ‘together’ in whatever their goals are. Then there is the somewhat ignorant believers who blindly follow the aforementioned, because that’s what they were taught to be supposed to do. And of course there are plenty of flavours in between.
Unfortunately sanctions will only hurt the population. Look at what sanctions did to Iraq... and another western invasion is definitely not what the middle east needs. As awful as it sounds, a massive popular revolt and Iranians themselves sabotaging their government and economy might be the only way out of this mess.
