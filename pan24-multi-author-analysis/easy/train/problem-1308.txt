I hope the EPA were able to track all of the contaminated waste that was already shipped to other states, and follow up on every gram of dirt. Because "scatter it all and make the situation unmanageable" seemed to be the railroad's first approach to avoiding having to deal with it. They should have evacuated the town, contained the contamination, and ultimately have to buy the entire town at normal prices so the residents can start over again somewhere else instead of die in obscurity after a hasty cover-up.
I would love for this to work. Here's what's likely to happen based on recent history. They will do nothing. EPA will clean it up via taxpayer funds. EPA will seek to sue Norfolk for three times damages, gop judge will throw it out on a technicality. We pay for disaster caused by corruption. Again.
TFW you remember that half a century of conservative legal strategy has left the EPA an impotent and toothless agency and Norfolk is only one Federal Judge away from totally escaping responsibility.
