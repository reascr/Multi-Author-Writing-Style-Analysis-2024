In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Seriously? That's just ridiculous. Oklahoma could really use the revenue from taxes on recreational marijuana. Not to mention the potential jobs it would create. It's a no-brainer - and if they don't see that, then I guess money talks louder than sense. Unless there's something shady going on behind the scenes...

It's hypocritical for Republicans to claim they champion personal freedom and responsibility while simultaneously waging a war on marijuana and preventing its legalization. If they truly believed in personal freedom, they would support the right of individuals to make their own choices about what they put into their bodies. If they truly believed in personal responsibility, they would acknowledge that the criminalization of marijuana has had devastating effects on communities and disproportionately impacts marginalized groups.
