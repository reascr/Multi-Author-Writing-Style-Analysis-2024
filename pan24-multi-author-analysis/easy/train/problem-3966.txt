Yeah np , historically it’s the sons of the founding king - and the priority is for the most senior brother between them ( he had many sons and daughters 80+) though a lot of them didn’t survive . But then it slowly became about which brothers had more political power - they would become kings. To find a successor to the king this time it was going to change because they were running out of sons of the founder - so they had to go to the next generation- the grand sons of the founder.There were 2 sons of the founder still alive so they had priority over grandsons but they had 0 political power so despite that they decided to skip a generation. There were many options but MBS did a coup and got power using his father ( the king ). MBS was a nobody in Saudi politics until his father became king. His father (the king ) is not in a good mental state so MBS is basically king. It’s not about heredity or popularity it’s about who has the most political power that gets to be the next king.
Actually significantly less. The footprint is massively, enormously lower than a traditional city. And it was planned to be a completely carbon neutral city. I can’t remember the proposed “population” but certainly in the millions.
