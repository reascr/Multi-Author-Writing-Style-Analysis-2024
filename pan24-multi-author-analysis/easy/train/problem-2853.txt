In the week 49, 2022, or from December 12 to December 18, 2022, the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) received the largest volume of natural gas from Russia via the Ukraine transit route, at 311 million cubic meters. The imports are falling but not as much as predicted.
I'm legitimately confused. Isn't Putin the wealthiest man in the world or one of them? Wouldn't that mean he'd have lots of resources? Or is his wealth on paper? I thought he hoarded lots of cash and gold etc.
Unfortunately some European countries cannot replace Russia as a supplier. Gas pipelines take years to build. The EU made the somewhat vague claim that “phasing out our dependence on fossil fuels from Russia can be done well before 2030.”.
Hungary, one of the European Union's most-reliant members on Russian energy, aims to eliminate Russian gas imports by 2050. Currently (Dec 2022) it gets gets around 85% of its gas from Russia. Indeed their foreign minister said that Budapest will not have to notify or consult with the European Commission if it wants to modify its long-term gas contract with Russia.
