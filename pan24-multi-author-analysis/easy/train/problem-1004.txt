I still think it’s Newsom, despite his baggage, possible Pete, but there is an unknown bullpen most of us plebes don’t know about. Either way Biden will say he’s going to run until he says he’s not. If he says he’s not going to run, it will only happen when there is someone ready and waiting. I think it’s 75% Biden runs, 25% he passes the torch to someone who has tested well, been vetted. Then again, you are listening to someone who thought there was no chance they would cancel Roe. So essentially I don’t know shit.
I don’t envy any GOP candidates strategy for 2024, I mean how exactly do you contend with trump literally owning the base while actively courting his cult while simultaneously kissing his ass and trying to make the case that you are the better option for the presidency? All the while being paranoid that Trump says fuck it and poisons the well or splits off to his own party.
