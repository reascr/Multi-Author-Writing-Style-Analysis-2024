Imagine having a husband/father/son/brother die in the year of our lord 2022 (!) building a stadium/hotel/road in abhorrent working conditions for a sports tournament that awards a little golden trophy and then seeing the head of the organization that enabled your tragedy compare your indescribable loss to the bullying he received as a kid because of his hair color and complexion.

Things like a world funding program to help countries dealing with climate catastophes, just to name one thing.
