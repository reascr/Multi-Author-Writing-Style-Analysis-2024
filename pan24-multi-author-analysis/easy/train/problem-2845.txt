I will read more on what he has advocated but I have not seen him (so far) suggest something that would make it across the board affordable, especially for people above traditional financial assistance levels or who have insurance but can’t afford to use it. I will also look to see if they will have some mechanisms to make sure everyone gets covered. From my standpoint if all he does is introduce a public option there are still a lot of people who will forego insurance because of cost. Also does that mean they will all offer the same excellence coverage? I’m not saying there isn’t room for private insurance but I had t seen a plan rise to the level of universal. If he has, I will concede that point. If they could give an actual source where the policy he supports says that, it would be helpful. His site says something about doing it through tax credits but not really what that means in practice. Introducing a public option to the current system for example will be more of the same, with probably a bit of cost savings from my standpoint. Also I used Germany as an example which is one of several countries that use private supplements.
Exactly. I do understand why people make that mistake since less than 10% of diabetics are Type 1 but it's still frustrating. No amount of diet and exercise can bring those beta cells back to life.
