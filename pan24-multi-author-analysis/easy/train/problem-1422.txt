If you don't know what you're looking at and haven't handled that specific style of ordnance before, but feel otherwise comfortable around firearms especially other belt-fed weapons, you could open the feed and look inside and may not even recognize a live round as being a live round, especially as many grenade cartridges have brown or black or green cases.
Nothing about this makes sense. "Hey Ukraine, I'm drunk, can I have a grenade launcher for a christmas present? I feel like it would be fucking epic at the christmas party." "Fuck yea, we're drunk too, we got you. Agree your homies will go ape shit over this thing... boom boom! One is a loudspeaker, the other is real. They look identical. Be careful." "Not to hurt my ears?" "Yuppp".
It’s not uncommon for spent fire and discard weapons to be given out or sold to civilians that want them, you can buy a at4 tube pretty easily and because of how they are constructed they cannot be reloaded, I assume this is similar but we don’t know for sure because without the actual name of the weapon.
