Napoleon was a genius military commander, perhaps the greatest ever considering his immense number of wins on the battlefield, making him feared by all the great nations and empires of Europe at the time, who ended up greatly benefitting a number of these European countries by contributing to many of our positive current ideas on social policy. Putin is a mafiaboss who stays at home while sending unwitting children to their pitiful deaths. Do not compare the two.
I just really can't see that Russia outweighs Ukraine a hundred times I feel like Putin could have just bombed them and would have been done with it I don't understand why he's wasting countless lives and people and making Russia look weak and stupid I don't understand he has the capabilities to destroy Ukraine with ease but he's not doing it I mean look at Russia's military they have one point something million nukes chemical warfare what does Ukraine have funding that can only take you so far this should have been long over long ago.
