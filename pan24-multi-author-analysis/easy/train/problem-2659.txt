Trump sent Rudy to Ukraine to find someone who would provide dirt about Biden. Somehow, about the time Rudy got home, he had this laptop that he claimed was Hunter Biden’s, the President’s son. Supposedly, Hunter left a broken laptop in a computer shop run by an almost blind (!) guy to,be fixed and never when back to pick it up. The shop owner then gave it to Rudy, as every computer shop owner does with lost equipment. Magically, the laptop contained all sorts of info on Hunter Biden, including dick pics, porn, email, and who knows what all. Rudy made copies of the data, and those copies ended up in all sorts of unexpected places. There’s no way to tell whether the copies have been altered. At least some of the emails appear to be real, but since they could have been the product of hacking, some may have been altered, deleted, or created out of thin air. Some say the emails show that both Hunter and his dad were involved in shady business deals, but allegations are all they have. Some of the data was clearly added after Rudy got the laptop, and that makes all of the data suspicious. The porn is gratuitous; it’s probably there because the weirdos that put this together like watching porn. Anyway, Trump supporters claim this laptop proves that Joe Biden is Satan incarnate; normal people realize the odds of this laptop being legitimate are nil. The FBI has had the actual laptop for months; there’s no indication that they’re doing anything with it. The FBI is investigating Hunter, primarily for income tax issues, plus some weird issue over a gun; there’s no indication the investigation has anything to do with the laptop.
Jesus. If they found nuclear secrets at Mar-Lago, just go ahead and cuff him and prosecute him on that alone. Pursue the other documents as a backup plan.
