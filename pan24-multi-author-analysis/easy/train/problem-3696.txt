Unions can do a lot of good. They provide training, regulation of trades, mutual aid, insurance, pensions, etc. They help ensure that older workers continue to work and are not as susceptible to ageism.

Constructive closure. It's harder to do so legally in the case of single employees - they make up a reason (to treat this employee differently) and hope you won't sue or don't have the resources to do so. Closing a workplace due to unprofitability, or lack of sufficient profitability is legal and they are allowed to consider reasonably estimated increased future labor costs in profit projections.
Yes, I do. "Them" is important define in your question though. Does Starbucks, the company, see a "profit"? No. Do the shareholders and execs (whom are also share holders) see a "Profit"? Yes, they do. Incidentally, that can cause investors to further invest in Starbucks, which would give it more cashflow to offset the stock buyback (but that is not profit, either) effect on liquid assets.
