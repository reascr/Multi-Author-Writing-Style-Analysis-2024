officially it was the Austro-Hungarian empire, a dual monarchy. The Emperor was Emperor of both Austria and Hungary. Within this system the Hungarian nobility had immense power and the Emperor had to constantly appease them. If Austria gained anything Hungary had to gain something equal. At this time Hungary was also much larger than today, It held current day Slovakia, the Transylvania region of Romania as well as northern Serbia and a large part of current Croatia. In fact Hungary had sea access. They saw a lot of their territory lost at the treaty of Trianon after WWI but in most of the areas lost the hungarians were a minority population. Still ended up with some majority Hungarian towns ending up as part of other countries. This is the greater Hungary they miss and want back. They were a powerful partner in a powerful empire where they were too powerful for the Emperor to ignore.
Really? Sorry, I had no idea. In any case facts don’t mean a thing to anyone here when hate has to be strong. I gave you a context of why Orban will veto. You don’t have to like his reasoning, but it’s still a fact. This is why Reddit sucks.
