True enough in this case, but it does drive me crazy when people refer to anti-vaxxers being examples of “Darwinism” or “Darwin Award Winners”. Like no dude, most of these idiots dying for no reason have already bred as much as they were ever going to. Their genes are still very much in the pool.
Man you are just confidently incorrect at this point, despite all the controversies Modi has been a very effective leader and Indians voted him into power twice already because he was damn effective sure the Hindutva fanatics are there but how large of a population do you imagine them to be you can't just conveniently assume everyone who voted for Modi is a dumbass or a religious fanatic, the only other political party that can perhaps compete with Modi is the AAP which we will see how effective they are in the next few decades, and Congress the third major power and the actual rival to the BJP government in the recent past is a hecking dynastic party like the Sri Lankan one, ain't nobody want a Dynasty Government.
