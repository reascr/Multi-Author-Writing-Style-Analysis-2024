In the situation with Ukraine, Ukraine was not firing back at Russia; they were simply trying to intercept and shoot down the missle that was part of a bombardment of civilians.
Ukraine accidently killing Poles whilst they defend themselves can be twisted into an argument as to why Ukraine shouldn't defend themselves.
They have a lot to lose by admitting culpability, and nothing really to gain, as the only people with any respect for truth or decency are firmly in Ukraine's corner over Russias blatant land grab. So it isn't too surprising tha they're just going to deny all knowledge until the dust settles and then probably make an admission of responsibility and apology a few years down the line when the consequences of doing so are less immediate.
Dude why. Why are you simping so hard for Russia? They are actively murdering innocent people who just want to live. I'll also point you to the fact there is NO way all of Russia's nuclear warheads are credibly ready to employ, nor are France's. But a few hundred? That's enough to wipe out a country. There is a reason they are considered a last resort weapon.
