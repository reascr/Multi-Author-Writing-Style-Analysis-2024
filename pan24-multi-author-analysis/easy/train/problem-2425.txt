If you want to research, the amount of facilities and available positions is very little. Most research on Spain depend on public funding, which is to be honest quite deficient.
It's a major industrial undertaking. After the Chicago Pile, the US built the X-10 reactor and the Hanford site. where already slightly enroched uranium was enriched further via gaseous diffusion prior to being further enriched by a kind of mass spectrometer at another facility.
Yeah. A big theory is that Heisenberg was the reason Germany lost world war 2 because he led their nuclear research team and he deliberately focused on heavy water reactions knowing it will never lead to enough criticality to create a bomb.
They were called . The idea is that you want to separate the U-235 atoms from other uranium atoms and that the ionised uranium will have the same charge but the isotopes will have slightly different masses (due to some having more or less neutrons). Hence, when these ions are accelerated and deflected by magnetic fields they deflect slightly differently by mass allowing certain isotopes to be separated.
