Coming to ur other point, india imported around 2% before invasion and after invasion Russia discounts and its only natural for a country which accounts to 1/5 of the world to buy the cheap oil. Sadly india isn't a rich country which can afford to buy from other sources when there's cheaper oil available. Again morality has no place in intl relations can I blame the whole of Europe for not cutting of their gas imports after what Russia annexed Crimea? If eu and usa would have completely stopped importing gas I bet they wouldn't even had a economy stable and wouldn't even have thought about invading Ukraine. So since 2014 eu has been buying constantly from Russia whicj enabled them to invade Ukraine eu funded the war indirectly, how does this argument feel ;( just reducing ur imports by a bit and condemning Russia doesn't give u any moral high ground as your money still buys the gas which funds the war. Also stop expecting developing countries to take a moral stance in every other issues they've just tasted independence after centuries of oppression let them take care of their people, they don't have looted wealth upon which they can depend while abiding to the sanctions placed.
1. Maintaining relations with Russia will give India some leverage over US. (Playing one against the other. That's what smaller powers do against the bigger ones.).
