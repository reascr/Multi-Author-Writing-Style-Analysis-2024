England was invaded/ruled by the vikings at points in history. English was classified as a West Germanic Langages, but recently many linguist have been arguing it's a Scandinavian language. "New" really doesn't represent in English either. Nyiueu is probably closer, maybe? At least in my accent. Maybe others it's more like Noo.
Soooo, the country that persecutes or hates jews, homosexuals, other religions, Christians outside of their own Orthodox church, the mentally handicapped, the physically handicapped, foreigners, and I could go on if I took the time to look it all up or think of it all, is comparing other people to Hitler. Idiot.
Russia tried to spread their system via force and subjugation not by economic growth and prosperity they invaded their own allies under the Warsaw Pact , please explain how and why should us from their "area of influence" be interested in their system ? They literally have nothing to offer us , if it wouldn't be an alliance with the US then it will be the next logical best thing , creating their own nukes as NK dose against US.
Their inability to understand this is what will push neighboring countries to arm themselves to the teeth , form alliances with their Rivals or build our own nukes.
If they are unable to offer something equal or better than what the west offers then they will always have hostile countries on their borders whether under an alliance or via nukes , us from their "area of influence" have had enough of them for 2 centuries now.
