I am certainly not defending CCP numbers but that is a video of many people in critical care, but a single room and no bodies. There were worst videos out of many places including China during the worst of covid. China will face massive spikes but omicrom is not as deadly. The truth will be somewhere between CCP lies and doomsayers.
Indian media…. Isn’t really most trustworthy but why are we suprised I thought it was to be expected of deaths and hospital overload when zero covid is gone. I guess the speed of infection is unexpected.
lol bullshit I kind of find that hard to believe, given that the Chinese have a history of conquering, colonizing and imperialising their surrounding lands and successful/attempted assimilation of the myriad of different ethnic minority groups for the past 5000 years, I mean, how did you think the borders of China came to be as big as it is?
It is kinda sad. China honestly did much better than the rest of the world initially on containing it and protecting folks. But then they made some severe missteps including bashing vaccines initially when they didn’t have enough and only wanted the working people to get them now resulting in the elderly who arguably need it most not getting it. This and a few other missteps will potentially cancel out the good job they did initially.
