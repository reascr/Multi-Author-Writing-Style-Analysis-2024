Neptune’s first launch—just revealed—was actually Feb 25-26: Three Neptunes were launched from south of Odessa at three ships attempting an amphibious landing in Mykolaiv. All three were shot down by Russia. But a startled Russian Navy went back to Crimea.
Exactly. I'm concerned about... Well, everything for my country but the foreign policy seems basically a Draghi 2.0.
Hahaha beautiful! They're totally just goading the russians into more stupid wasteful attacks. My theory is that Ukraine is absolutely egging russia on to continue throwing meat into the grinder, but has no intention at all of "stand and fight to the last man" nonsense. Ukraine has shown great skill at bloodying russia to the maximum possible, without letting egos cost lives. So I totally read this as Ukraine saying we stand here until you send enough human waves to finally overcome us, and russia is absolutely drooling over the idea of that huge "propaganda win" - when in reality Ukraine will reinforce just enough to slaughter those human waves until they stop, or that balance changes and it reaches a point where it is wiser to fall back. They have no intention whatsoever of throwing away soldiers on this if it is not strategically important, but they know russia absolutely will, especially if it is a patriotic pissing contest.
