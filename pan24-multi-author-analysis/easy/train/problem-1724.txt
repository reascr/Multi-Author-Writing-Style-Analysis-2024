Of course, most of the reason we've given up even considering that is because nobody has any faith in the typical American to apply themselves. It's accepted that their vote is all they're good for, however axiomatically they make it, however little they try to inform their own decisions and however little they care about anyone else but themselves. This won't be fixed by "civics test for politicans" and a culture devoid of civics is in no position to test someone's aptitude for civics anyway.
Voters have an unforgivable disregard for civics and too many of them want politicians that don't either. This is ultimately why civic minded politicians lose American elections. Trump and everything his victory normalized was the consequence of a problem that started from the bottom up, not the cause of it.
Absolutely! To fit our media addiction, the presidential primaries should be a game show. The first round would include questions of general knowledge like the Constitution, world history, geography, and science. Fail that round, you are out.
