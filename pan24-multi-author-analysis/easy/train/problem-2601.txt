Russia doesn't have control of the skies in Ukraine RIGHT NOW. Are you actually arguing that deploying MORE air defenses to Ukraine is suddenly going to result in Russia being able to use fixed wing aircraft to counter them?
Russia has been hesitant to send aircraft deep into Ukraine (where these batteries would be deployed), leaving them using stand-off weapons to attack them, the very weapons that Patriot is built to take out.
I get the arguments that Patriot is vulnerable because it is, but I think the reality is that the fact that Ukraine STILL retain enough anti-air to deny Russians free reign over the country puts lie to the notion that these are going to be sitting ducks. The Patriot system is HIGHLY effective against ballistic missiles, drones, and cruise missiles, which to date are all that Russia has been able to actually field in Ukraine in any significant number.
Sweet. Please feel free to show us these “consequences”. I’m sure they’re capable of them and not just talking out their asses. It’s not like all of Russia’s actual soldiers are rotting corpses and all they have left are random conscripts with 5 minutes of training and a toy gun. Oh wait.
A single payer system would cost less, and allow us the option to redeploy economic capacity toward great power competition.
Right? Oh No, Please don't demonstrate the real world capability of your (probably) tiny stock of "advanced" weapons against our systems that are designed specifically to counter them. Especially don't use your (probably made up) hypersonic weapons that you say are specifically intended to counter these very systems.
