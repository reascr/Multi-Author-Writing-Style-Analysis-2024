It only requires the English, Italians, Spanish Germans and maybe the French to bring the whole lot down. They're the four/ five big paying leagues of Europe. The two South American 'giants' needn't be a factor, because for 4 years every cycle it's the European clubs who pay players the wages. If the top South Americans had to choose between the untold riches of playing for their European clubs, or playing for their country every now and then, 90% of them will choose their clubs. The players are contracted to their clubs by way of employment. The clubs only release them because of 'FIFA rules'. If the big clubs of Europe pulled out of FIFA then it would be game over.
If the clubs bandied together, (and as events of the last year or so showed, they'd need the backing of their supporters) they could reorganise the game outside of FIFA (and UEFA for that matter too).
You'd probably see a different type of corruption as the top clubs creamed off the deals for themselves, and ultimately football being what it is, this would work its way down into players wages, but even this tawdry scenario would be better than the FIFA executive Committee coining it for themselves.
This. Little protests are all fine and we'll, but no one cares. You want FIFA to care? Keep your team at home. Make it clear why your team refuses to play. Get other teams to do the same. Ruin their fucking event by hitting them in the only place that matters, their pocket book.
