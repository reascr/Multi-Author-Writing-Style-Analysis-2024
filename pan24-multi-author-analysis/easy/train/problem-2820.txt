Now that the reserve has essentially run out the price of helium has increased dramatically, this makes it economical for natural gas companies to actually liquefy the natural gas and siphon off the helium. That's right, helium is trapped in the same reserve that trap natural gas. Some natural gas fields have more helium others have less so only the most economical ones will have the additional step needed to mine the helium. When that field runs out, as most natural gas fields do in 6 to 18 months, they have to open a new one. The price will continue to rise until this reaches an equilibrium of what the market will use at that price versus what we can produce just like it was prior to the 90s.
