Any time anyone from either party introduces legislation on either abortion, gun rights, anything to do with gender identity, or immigration it’s controversial to one side or the other.
This guy looks like he has to practice smiling. I love how he interprets what he thinks the founding fathers would have wanted. I am honestly sick of hearing about the founding fathers. Those guys made rules for what worked best for them, why do we continually refer back to them, it’s been almost 250 years since that document was signed. It’s time to start considering what people living today need in this country and stop with this archaic bullshit.

Dems have certainly shifted way more conservative, especially economically. I'm not sure banning guns or allowing all guns are particularly conservative or liberal positions either way. Reagan was very afraid of the Black Panthers. I personally want more gun restrictions because societies that restrict guns are much safer, not because I'm racist.
