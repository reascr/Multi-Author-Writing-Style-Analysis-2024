Yeltsin? The drunk? Lol That was a blip on an otherwise communist timeline. Putin the Soviet KGB member. The father of modern communism took the country back to its former “glory.” The vast majority of companies are owned by loyal oligarchs. They do the governments bidding. That’s how you have government owning the means of production without actually owning them. That’s the slight of hand with modern communism. Same thing on China. Oh and most of the oligarchs are from the communist Soviet Union. Russia re wrote their constitution in the 2000s giving putin unlimited power and getting rid of those pesky freedoms they had gotten. They did so by going full blast of culture wars gay bashing public school bashing and changing libel laws. If you had a problem with it they called you a pedo. Well if that doesn’t exactly describe what the republicans are doing I don’t know what does. I’ve been saying it for years and they keep on following Russia playbook to a T. Just last week little Ron Desantis wants to change libel laws in Florida. Calling them fascists turn an eye to the danger and what their future actions will be. If they want to ally themselves with Russia I will call them a communist cult. They call us commies for wanting affordable healthcare.
