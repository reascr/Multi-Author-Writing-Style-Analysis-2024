In the 70s and 80s the British government locked up hundreds of innocent Irish men, sometimes for years. All it served to do was deepen the hatred. "For every man they took away they dressed one thousand more".
I am not justifying that , I am just saying the US is a hypocrite if they want to ride the morally superior horse after doing all kinds of shit , they should first look at themselves before accusing/blaming china for their gain , let’s admit it the US doesn’t want china to develop further as if would threaten their hegemony and compromise their empire which itself is propped up on wars , every single time there is a disaster at home , the US goes on a war killing innocents in Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan twice (first when Afghanistan was ruled by socialists and then they propped up terrorist to defeat the soviet ideology and then they went back to fight the same terrorists they grew in the first place all the while killing innocent civilians in the name of greater good) , they literally saved nazi scientists as long as they could be used for their benefit , staged coups all across the world , destabilize democratic governments and replaced them with dictators or instability to protect cooperate interests and extract resources for cheap and benefit the military establishment , they knew the Saudi royal family was responsible for 9/11 but they stayed silent becuz they didn’t want their petrodollar to be threatened again when kashoggi was openly killed by the Saudis , Biden goes and dies fist bumps with the Saudi crown prince and did discriminate drone attacks on civilians which caused them to join Islamic Extremists in anger and further increased instability and religious extremism in the Middle East and much more , i am not supporting what China has done with the camps but the US calling out china while being a shameless hypocritical cunt sounds disgusting.
