Don't kid yourself. In their view, a child that doesn't believe in Jesus is as unwanted and unwelcomed as a trans child or a gay child. So is the kid who is gutsy enough to speak up for those kids. The kids that don't conform would kicked from school to school and it would be part of their permanent record that they're "troublemakers.".
