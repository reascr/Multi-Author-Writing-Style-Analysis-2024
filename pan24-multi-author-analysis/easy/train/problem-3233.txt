While it is not state-owned, Yandex has built a close relationship with the Russian government. Yandex in 2019 agreed to give the state a greater say in its operational decisions in a bid to ward off legislation limiting foreign ownership of Russian tech companies.
By cutting ties with Russia, Yandex hopes to protect its newer ventures, such as self-driving cars, cloud computing, and education technology, from being connected to the Russian market. Western partners have canceled tie-ups with Yandex after Russia’s war in Ukraine, including food delivery company Grubhub, which ended its robot delivery initiative with Yandex days after Russia’s invasion. New export controls also limit the sale of advanced technology components to Russia.
Exactly. I can’t stress enough how unparalleled Yandex Image reverse search is, there is literally no competition that gets close. And it’s not just image search that’s really good, idk if Yandex doesn’t give a fuck about copyright or western privacy laws, but what Google would normally censor, such as streams of a live event or what not, Yandex shows.
