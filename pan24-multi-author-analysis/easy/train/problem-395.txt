That's why they prattle on so much about "free speech". That's their whole defense for this stuff, but as SMN noted, it's still a bloody defense of some fucked up fascist stuff. While the left can defend its views with various social theories, actual data, and coherent argument, the far right has descended into frothing at the mouth... While their personalities and media enablers say it's "not unreasonable" and that the left telling fascists to fuck off is "against free speech.".
Much of the resistance to and limitations on the New Deal in the 30s and 40s had to do with racism specifically, and a lot of the justification for tearing down the regulations and safety net has been either explicitly racist or dogwhistled; I occasionally run across old stories of people justifying a vote 'against their interests' (where their interests are implicitly assumed to be economic) by saying it'd hurt "them" more (where them clearly refers to minorities or black people in particular).
Thank you for that. It's been forever, and I've read so many books on contemporary economics over the years that they kind of blend together. But your summary refreshed my memory.
