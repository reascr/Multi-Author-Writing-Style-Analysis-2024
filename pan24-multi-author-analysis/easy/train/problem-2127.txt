"A Pacific aircraft carrier enters a time warp and finds itself transported from 1980 to 1941 - just before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The captain is forced to decide whether to strike at the approaching Japanese fleet and change the entire course of the World War II.".
Poor dialogue, Kirk Douglas wasn’t believable as a serious captain and Martin Sheen’s consultant character was almost entirely irrelevant to the plot, and the aging makeup at the end was an absolute trainwreck.
We have a phrase here in Slovenia for one being lucky. We say you have potatoes. This phrase was born from the time when Slovenia was under Austro-Hungarian empire. To combat famine the monarch introduced potatoes from the new world. The local farmers were wary about it though and would not trust the monarch so at night they went out and burned the potatoes fields. To prevent this, the monarch assigned some soldiers that would otherwise be on the front to guard the fields. And the phrase was born.
I remember how much the Kremlin screamed whenever NATO ships entered, sailed and went on exercises in the Black Sea, including near the (universally unrecognized outside of Russia) Russian-controlled Crimean peninsula.
