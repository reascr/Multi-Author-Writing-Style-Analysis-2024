I live in a tiny village on the coast of Lake Huron. We spent a few days on Mackinac Island a couple years ago and I found a car decal in a shop that said Michiganders Get Shit Done. I had to have it just to have it. Spent some fretful days being embarrassed of the state when Snyder's gang poisoned citizens, then the gop trump ball sucking jamboree, storming the Capitol because Tim wanted to go fishing, plotting to kidnap Whitmer, meeting to overturn the election, and frankly more....but I digress. Dems will run the legislature after 40 years of nada as well. The majority of my family is racist repugs who cry about hillary, obama, biden, and any squirrels they suspect might be democrats. The local rednecks got together to soothe each other's rashes by declaring this a sanctuary city for......GUNS. I'm not kidding, it made the news. Yes, lots of gangs of gun grabbers up here roaming the streets like packs of wild dogsðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„/s. The cultish lifestyle is strong, still see 2020 flags for -45 since they can't get over that either.
