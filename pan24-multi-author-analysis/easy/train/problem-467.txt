I don't think anyone understands or appreciates what Bernie has pulled off here. The senate needs unanimous consent to put these bills on the floor in time to pass them before the strike deadline. Bernie has leveraged that for the 7 days of sick leave and first got Pelosi to agree to sending over 2 bills. Now, im sure you're like "oh that was for show they'll just pass the one" but Bernie still has the same leverage. He can block both bills from the floor unless the votes are there for both bills. So he's called out Republicans and Democrats and surprisingly he's getting support from both. There's 2 pathways: a UC for a simple majority vote,  or Bernie gets 10 GOP senators on board. But if not he just refuses to let the UC through for a vote and dies on this hill for the workers who then strike, which I'm sure he's more than willing to do. Its pretty fucking well played.
Ontario recently tried legislating an unwanted agreement on its education workers. They too would have been striking illegally and could lose their jobs. They said OK, let’s do it, it would be easy for us to find new jobs in this economy, and impossible for the employer to find and train replacements for us. The Province/employer backed down and they returned to the bargaining table.
