Palestine and Israel were formed by Britain and the US out of Palestine after WWII, in order to create an independent nation for the Jewish diaspora. For reasons that are obvious in retrospect, they immediately went to war and have remained in a state of “just having been at war” for the past >70 years. But that war established the “1948 borders” that many consider the “real borders.” So the simple answer is that a lot of modern Israel was taken from Palestine post-1948, but actually all of Israel was formed from Palestine in the immediate aftermath of Europe, albeit due to foreign meddling/post-colonialism and not Israeli annexation.
