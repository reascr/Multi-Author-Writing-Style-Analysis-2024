Yes, that has been theorized for a near peer conflict, however that assumes that the combatants all have high quality night vision, which also negates the use of IR light (only visible under night vision) for tactical purposes as the enemy would be able to see it just as friendlies. If Russian troops do not have access to this equipment, however (and assuming Ukraine does) they can exploit their night-fighting capability to great success just as the US has against unconventional armies.
