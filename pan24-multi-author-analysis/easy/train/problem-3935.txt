In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Sort of. Your take is premised that the Republican fan base are even willing to recognize this. Hint, they won't.
One of the issues of Republicans gaining control at the local (including school board, Sheriff, judges) county, and state levels, and using that control to pass bills like this, is that A), it invigorates their base to get out and vote, and B), allows them to manipulate elections, including federal, by changing polling locations, banning mail-in voting, often changing and confusing ID requirements, voter roll purges, etc.
I'm so tired of this crap. GOP's platform is just to waste time, stoke division, and mislead people. How do people not see that the only reason for this stream of inhuman behavior is that they are BOUGHT. If you make a politician rich, and tell them what to advocate for, they will advocate for it. Why do you think every single one of the GOP members so adamant about gun rights have a documented donation of $1.2 million from the NRA? Give me $1.2 million and a microphone and I'll say whatever the fuck you want me to say. All of the GOP agenda just serves to enrich themselves and their donors and install systems of government that perpetuate the goals of their donors. If their base had half a brain cell they would notice, but that's why their base is their base. They are either too dumb to think for themselves or ignorant enough to be riled into a frenzy with rhetoric. Yeah, the Democrats are bought too, but at least their platform recognizes things like human rights.
