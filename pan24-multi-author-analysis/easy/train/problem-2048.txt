They only got a 5 vote majority during a midterm with an unpopular sitting president. A presidential election cycle should be a clean up for democrats unless the GOP actually finds someone who is generally electable. As much as they love DeSantis he isn’t actually popular. He has a 38% national approval rating and a 35% disapproval with 26% saying they don’t know. The I don’t knows are probably more likely to disapprove since if you’re the kind of person who would like him you already know who he is. Republicans are looking for ANYONE other than trump who could win a primary where their real concern should be who will win a general election. We’ve already seen that their current messaging is unpopular so unless they change it or find a great candidate they’re gonna get crushed in 2024, especially as more boomers pass away with time and more Zoomers become eligible to vote.
Thank you! The infighting is not good for anyone. So McCarthy is a Rino, but MAGA MTG supports him? I guess he's giving her some power that she wants, but I thought Gaetz and her were allies, but not anymore?
