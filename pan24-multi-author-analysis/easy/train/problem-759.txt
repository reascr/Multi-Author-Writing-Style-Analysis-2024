Being admitted requires unanimous consent. There is, in a way, a process to kick out a member. If all of the other members give unanimous consent that they dont want a particular member in, they can basically just say "NATO is dead, but we are announcing the New Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATOv2), which coincidentally includes everyone but that one guy we dont like.".
With the fact that the Koran burning was a STAGED event paied for by a Russian news reporter likely a Russian FSB or kgb operative what ever thay call them Erdogan is being played by the Russians yes its deplorable the book was burned but it's still bad to be played the fool by the true perpetrator the person pulling the strings the others are just puppets on strings it might be different if the string puller had no agenda but how can anyone say a Russian that paied for this has no agenda when it comes to Finland and Sweden joining NATO.
Yes please. Everything the west does and says can and will be used by Erdogan as a propaganda material. Erdogan is a very cunning troll and the west keeps feeding him.
