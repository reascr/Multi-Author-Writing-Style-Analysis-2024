Weddings = money. This is a clever way to allow states to ban gay marriage if they really, really want to, but the consequence is that LBGT couples are able to spend their wedding dollars in blue states while maintaining residency (and voting) in red states where they already live, and the state still has to recognize their marriage anyway. Kind of a Catch-22 for red states that have gotten pretty good at crafting legislation to do the opposite (drive out blue voters or force them to implicitly normalize bigotry by staying and abiding by red state rules). A blanket marriage equality bill would of course have been better, but this is a smart play.
Disingenuous??? It's a serious question. The democrats don't have the votes to put through a perfect plan, the republicans won't go along with it. What do you suggest the Democrats do if they can't get the votes to pass a bill requiring all states to officiate and sign same sex marriage certificates? Should they do nothing and let the Supreme Court overturn Obergefell because there is a strong likelihood that will happen.
