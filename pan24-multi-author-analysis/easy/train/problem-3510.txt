the Federal Bureau of Investigation has, "under the guise of engaging in counterterrorism since 9/11, built a network of more than 15,000 informants to infiltrate Muslim communities and ferret out would-be terrorists. The Bureau then provides the means necessary for these would-be terrorists to move forward with a terrorist plot—in some cases even planting specific ideas for attacks.".
Idk about these dudes in particular but isn’t it usually one undercover FBI agent, an undercover ATF agent, an undercover homeland security officer and one mentally handicapped person in an online chat room all trying to entrap each other while the MR dude thinks he finally has friends?
“The F.B.I. deployed at least 12 informants, as well as several undercover agents, according to defense filings. On the nighttime surveillance operation of the governor’s cottage, for example, the defense described “Big Dan” as the main organizer. Stephen Robeson, with a long history of both past crimes and work as an informant, was there too. The “explosives expert” who could topple the bridge was actually an undercover F.B.I. agent, as was a man in another vehicle.”.
