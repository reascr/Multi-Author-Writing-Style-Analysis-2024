This obsession is pathetic, you can see where their true priorities lie. While these Republicans go on to justify their obsession with the notion that "they did it first!" (Democrats) whenever you criticize or question their objectionable behavior. Which is how a child responds to being reprimanded, a child... You can boil down most Republican talking points to childspeak.

They don't seem to understand the difference between seeking to hold a corrupt, lying, justice-obstructing, coup-facilitating narcissist accountable (who's lived a life evading accountability), and a fanatical fixation with a president's son (along with all the propaganda centered around him), who unlike the former president's family, isn't serving as an "advisor" or directly within the current president's administration as a result of nepotism while mired in conflicts of interest and fulfilling the underhanded, political and self serving schemes of daddy/father in law Trump.
