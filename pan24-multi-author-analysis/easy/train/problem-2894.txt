Much different in the US. In the northeast part of the US, property taxes are levied exclusively by the municipality to support local public services, mostly schools. The State doesn’t get any of the levy.
I’m not an electrical engineer so I’m sure there are complexities to any solution but there are places doing HVDC transmission over hundreds and even thousands of KM, so having solar/wind/wave energy capture systems where they’re feasible and using transmission lines (either HVDC or “regular” HVAC) to get to areas where they aren’t seems like a smarter solution than trying to build an expensive nuke plant that has a 50 year productive life and makes the land unusable for twice that long.
This article seems like FUD to me. Wind isn’t the only source of electricity in the US. Even if it was, we’d just put these turbines somewhere else if people don’t want them in their town. Offshore wind farms are a thing.
