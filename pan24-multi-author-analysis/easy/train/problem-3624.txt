Yeah but the hate for Justin Trudeau is bipartisan, albeit for different reasons. A lot of the left sees him as an empty suit that does a lot of performative progressive stuff simply because it gets him brownie points. He's a very corrupt politician who means nothing that he says.
In case of religion, main monotheistic religions such as Christianity/Catholicism and Islam directly forbid homosexuality and call it a sin. And pretty much most of the opposition to homosexuality in the Western and Islamic worlds stem from this.
On the other hand, there are other countries where main religions don't necessarily forbid it, but are looked down upon due to cultural reasons. Some of that is bred during the British colonial occupation in those countries, as the Brits back in the day were pretty anti-gay. And even without British intervention, since heterosexuality is the 'default setting' if you will, a lot of cultures may perceive it as unusual and may not regard it being worthy of same regards as heterosexuality.
Lol. I mis-read that as Siri will decriminalize homosexuality. As in the Apple AI assistant would just go ahead and solve that problem for the whole planet.
Exactly. If you asked Sri Lankans 99 of the things they would want to improve about the country, this would still not come up.
