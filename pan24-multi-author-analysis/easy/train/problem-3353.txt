There are Russian troops already in their country; it's really just a political question as to HOW Putin takes it over. Does he just keep the useful idiot in charge? If Luka got deposed, Putin would just park some assholes at the top like he tried doing before Maidan. So they have some hard choices to make and would want an EU kind of group to help push back or ease that pressure via a safety agreement etc. But of course, Luka cannot be trusted so they have to figure it out without a government in place to do the negotiating. A weird issue for sure.
The victory at Khalkhin Gol and subsequent border skirmishes led to the signing of the Neutrality Pact, which allowed the Soviets to re-deploy Siberian Troops to the western border to participate in the Battle of Moscow, a very crucial moment in WW2.
Asked by whom? Even the article doesn't answer: "It was not immediately clear from his comments whether Ukraine itself or the West had made the alleged offer.".
Also, the Soviets were taking on the brunt of Germany and its armed forces for the entirety of the war with millions of troops and thousands of aircraft and tanks involved, opening up a new front against Japan in '42, '43 would be one of the worst decisions ever made.
