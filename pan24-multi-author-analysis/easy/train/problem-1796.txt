I am a little skeptical of this. Like no country besides like India, Pakistan, and North Korea have been actively improving their nuclear arsenals since the '80s. Also with how bad corruption is, I wouldn't be surprised If large amounts of fuel in their nuclear missiles have been siphoned off and sold for cigarettes and vodka. Also, some nuclear weapons use tritium, which has a half life of 12.3 years. Without technical and exact nuclear science is, I'm imagining that even after just a year that probably wouldn't work unless that's changed out or reprocessed. That also doesn't even include electrical components. The US nuclear arsenal still uses floppy disks. It wouldn't Surprise me if The Russian nuclear arsenal largely still uses magnetic tape and Nixie tubes, And those things break down over time.
Posturing. Putin is not stupid enough to pre-announce a chemical weapons attack and if he mobilizes his nuclear forces (which are separate from the current mobilized forces) the US will respond immediately. To speculate it's probably in regards to the Baltic Sea and a new military maneuver planned there ie monitoring of Swedish and Finnish shipping which is the next obvious front.
