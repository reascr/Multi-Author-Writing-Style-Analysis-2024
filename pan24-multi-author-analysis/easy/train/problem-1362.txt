That's my dad also but I use facts to shame him. No laughter afterward. Ain't no heaaaven in the future of a racist hate filled christian, at least not what I learned from reading the bible every Sunday in church group for 3 hours from 4 to 18 years old. Then it was an hour of church and afterward I had to go with my dad to Catholic mass for 45 minutes. Im well versed in religion, enough to know hate is a one way ticket to a really warm place where (if you believe in Christianity) they'll be a DisneyLand sized theme park of torturous rides (ie: loved one just out of reach tormenting you) designed just for you for all eternity. That's a long time so you might want to think about trying to undo all the damage that you have done to your chances of being welcomed into the gates of heaven.

Exactly. He's such a narcissist that he isn't. He hates everyone but himself. Trump doesn't give a damn about the "white race" or about "white replacement".
