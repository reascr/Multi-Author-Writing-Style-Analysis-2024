By Reddit standards I would probably be considered conservative but the last few years have shown me just how cultish the republican party has become. I do not have TV and have avoided online sites (from both sides) where pundits spout their nonsense but good god I followed a link to Breitbart and read some of the comments on a couple different anti Ukraine screeds (not going to link to breitbart) and the commenters were not only batshit crazy with conspiracies; their pro russian comments looked like they were lifted directly from the kremlin.
Yeah but the problem is he needs to believe it. He needs to see then all bend the knee. The fact that this has backfired so badly that NATO is growing even larger while members of his own CSTO are now directly snubbing him to his face during international meetings show exactly how far things have gone in the other direction.
Yep. That was his hail mary. Listen to mtg her buddy matt g. talk about cutting off Ukraine $$. Putin was hoping for enough of a midterm win to make that noise a reality.
