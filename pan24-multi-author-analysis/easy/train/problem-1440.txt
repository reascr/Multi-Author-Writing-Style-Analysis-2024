Orwell was a socialist whose major themes were about the evils of colonialism and criticism of the racism that enabled that oppression (like in Burmese Days). He fought in the Spanish Civil War in the Marxist POUM militia (see Homage to Catalonia). He was opposed to totalitarianism and oppression and fought and wrote against it all his life, it's the major theme of his work. As for antisemitism, here's a link article on the matter from the Jerusalem post. It seems to me that he was anti-zionist, but not particularly anti-semitic, especially in the context of his place and time. His list helped the government know who to hire when trying to counter tankies, but he was by no means a right wing figure.
Oh, definitely. Extremism from both sides of the spectrum is bad. I was just pointing out that those on the right will say it shows the failings communism and those on the left will will say it does the same for fascism, when really it's both and shows how much in common the two ideologies really have.
