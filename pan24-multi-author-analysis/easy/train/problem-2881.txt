I feel for you. It must be tough living in a Red state. I'm in California so we don't have to deal with the BS that you guys do. You are correct, the descent into fascism our country is taking is frightening. It does not happen over night, it takes time. The fascist Republicans have been pushing this for years. They hate this country. I can't help but think we are on a very bad path from which there is no return. I hope that I am wrong, but I can see us living in a post-Constitution USA in the near future. I am 61, so maybe I will not be alive to see that, but I am really scared about what is happening. I have never really felt that before.
If they wanted to increase their chances of convicting you for slippery crimes like this one, they could roll it into a wider conspiracy case, building a foundation from the hundreds of people who violently obstructed Congress on your behalf, and working their way upwards to your inner circle, establishing a pattern of coordinated criminal behavior with evidence and testimony that puts you at the center of a wide-ranging conspiracy. This kind of racketeering/conspiracy investigation is particularly effective at taking down mafioso types who get lackeys to do most of their criminal behavior.
