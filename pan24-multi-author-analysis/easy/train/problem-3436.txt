Dont tell me with a straight face it is wrong to shoplift from massive corporations that dont pay their employees a high enough wage to live on (so we the tax payer have to subsidize their crap wages with social support systems), systematically destroy local businesses and communities, dodge paying their fair share of taxes and walk away with a massive profit while providing a crap service.
Mine did. Withheld my entire last paycheck before the Christmas holiday because they overpaid me like $260. I had to cancel our family vacation 2 days before leaving. Sent me the check after the break with the money deducted. Happened like 8 years ago and I’m still fucking pissed about it. I told them it was illegal but they gave no fucks. Hollywood union job too. And I knew I’d lose more than money if I got the union lawyers involved. Wasn’t worth the stress. And they know it.
