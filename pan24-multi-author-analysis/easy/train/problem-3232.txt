Paul is one of my favorite Smart People, but this misses something so obvious that I'm a little stunned. It's race, Paul. Race. A considerable swath of white America has been rebelling against the government since the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s. That is why they have been against any policy that materially benefits average Americans - because now "average Americans" includes them. It's the main reason why we don't have nice things. Because a large swath of white America said "if they get to have it, too, then nobody will have it." The fact that rural (largely white) America is suffering because of it is their own Fing fault. People have been fond of marveling at how they're "voting against their own interests" for years. But this fails to understand what their interests truly are. They aren't for a rising tide that lifts all boats. They're for making double damned sure that black Americans don't benefit from whatever policy is in question. And since that's largely not possible anymore, no one gets to benefit from them.
Money just exacerbates personality flaws. Mature people would be assuaged by a roomier budget, while immature minds would quickly fill that budget with a $90k lifted pickup.
