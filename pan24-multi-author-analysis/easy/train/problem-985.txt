Just speculation, but my guess would be a lot of those losses would be related to money laundering. Buy something with a dirty $Xm from Russian oligarchs, sell it for a lesser but clean $Ym that goes back to your “investors”, skim a few $100k off the top for personal use, claim a loss for tax purposes and pay no taxes. Rinse & repeat for 40 years.
Seriously, for all the screeching going on at r/conservative about Soros and the “secret cabal running the US,” you’d think an actual story about a foreign gov that funded the attack on 9/11, hates America, but looooves trump would cause those parrots to lose their collective shit. But nooooo.
wrong…..proportionally the real estate investing assets and tax depreciation are a much larger , much more significant portion and strategy than FF&E of industrial or retail businesses. And real estate investors use experts to complete cost segregation studies to allocate portions of the buildings to shorter term depreciable assets ( like hvac systems, electrical conduit and wiring). such work maximizes the annual depreciation deductions. ( which are recaptured as ordinary income on a later tax return in a subsequent sale).
