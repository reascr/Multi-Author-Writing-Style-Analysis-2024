Funny the way you described is exactly how each and every non-colonial power industrialized. The US incentivized entrepreneurs who stole cotton mill designs from the UK, Japan and South Korea did the same for cars and appliances and were accused of making cheap knock-offs in the 70s and 80s. Ditto Taiwan with its semiconductor industry and methodical plans to monopolize fab know-how. Made in Germany was originally a mandatory seal to designate inferior product quality. The Soviets stole from Europe and Americaâ€¦ In fact, I cannot name a single country who did not follow this path. And to forestall the knee jerk argument that those were before intellectual property laws were widely recognized, that is not true, certainly not for Japan/SK/Taiwan, and the concept of IP as a tool for protectionism long predated the establishment of sovereign patent offices and the WIPO.
Touched? Where is the George W Bush carrier strike group located? I'll give you a hint, it's not near China. The US just deployed an infantry unit to Estonia. The US military is liasoning with Ukrainian troops in Poland. That's military time and effort that could be used elsewhere. It would be to the US's advantage to fight one war at a time. Just because a resource is not being actively used doesn't mean it's available.
