Their only strategy for governance is to serve themselves everything and anything that isn't bolted to the floor. It has amplified during the tea party emergence and dumified (a word worthy of the description) as the Q perfume enfragranced the uneducated to serve the most selfish in society.
How? With Ukraine controlling the land access to Crimea at that point, and the bridge gone, Russians in Crimea will have no way out other than via sea, and you can bet Russia won't be providing escape ships; in that scenario, Putin wants as many Russian citizens as possible to be stuck in Crimea so that when Ukraine takes it, Ukraine has to be the bad guy and deport hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens (who, having gone onto Ukrainian soil without a valid passport, were illegally present and thus subject to deportation; they're colonizers, not a legitimate pre-existing population).
It's so dumb. It's an empty threat because, short of launching a nuke, they're already doing the worst thing they could possibly do.
