Desantis doesn't have the Secret Recipe like Trump does, either. There's a certain weird something that Trump has that gets people to go crazy. It's like Beatlemania to a certain demographic. I can't imagine Desantis would have that set level of commitment. He likely lacks the Russian backers, as well, having not been in NY real estate for 40+ years. Any new Republican candidate is definitely losing 5 percent of Trump's supporters. Don't you think so? There was weird lightning in a bottle with Trump. (I sure hope I don't have to eat my words on this.).

Its absolutely hilarious. Suddenly these people are realizing that Americans dont like it when you encroach on their rights, and try to force your religion on them, and when you try to fight against trying to make peoples lives easier (instead making the lives of the rich easier). Yeah, people dont like that folks. And guess what -- theyll show that in their vote.
