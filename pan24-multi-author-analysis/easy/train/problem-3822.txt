I’d say we, as a country, set the bar pretty low. How many people think an island could capsize due to population? Idk myself but I know of 1 who was voted into congress.
Hershel Walker’s obviously suffering from permanent brain damage (from playing football), and as time passes, he just gets progressively worse… and it’s also extremely doubtful that his mental health will ever improve, as it’s beyond the scope of medical expertise.
Agreed. The people just need more education before the actual election, which should be a major part of media imo. The scandals should come out then so the public has all the information before putting someone up for election from their party. Because what we have now is turd sandwiches and giant douches (not always but more than we should when picking people to make decisions for the freaking country!).
Jerry Mungadze, the North Texas therapist Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker credits with his mental health recovery, has a history of controversial statements and treatments, including a variation of "conversion" therapy and a belief that choice of crayon color can reveal whether a patient has been possessed by a demon.
