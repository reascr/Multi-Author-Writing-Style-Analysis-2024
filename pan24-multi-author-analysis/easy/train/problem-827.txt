Another famous one was the caning of Charles Sumner, from Massachusetts. Sumner was an abolitionist and gave a speech where he called some southern senators basically whores to “the harlot slavery”. The slavery senator of course, having no principled or ideological point to stand on, did what most far right reactionaries did, and physically attacked the man while he was giving a speech in congress (days later). Sumner was so badly beaten that he barely survived, and was never the same mentally. Southern senators took pieces of the cane and made rings out of it to show their support of the attack. Massachusetts took the head of the cane and put it on display at the old state house, as he was seen as a martyr. The senator who attacked sumner was goaded into challenging another northern senator to a duel, but backed down from his own duel because he was a coward and the northern senator he challenged (who got to pick the method and place) was a known crack shot, and chose rifles on the Canada side of Niagara Falls (where he wouldn’t be charged with murder).
I know. Old watchers of the West Wing might remember an episode during an election when one of the staff does something to address an issue, and a campaign operative goes postal on him because -- according to him -- they don't want to solve that problem. They need it to run on.
