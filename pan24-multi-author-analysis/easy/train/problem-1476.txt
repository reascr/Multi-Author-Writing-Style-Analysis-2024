Honestly this is very serious. A war of attrition favours Russia due to population size. This has happened basically like I thought it would.... Russia rush in but don't achieve decapitation strike western help and intel allows a counterstrike, but Russia digs in and galvanises its resources. They're talking 500k troops. If we use history as our guide then we know when Russia is at war they will not cave in due to troop losses, no way. My belief is this will get extremely serious. We are sending Serious weapons intel and money, and Ukraine are hyper invested and focused. Russia is also fully invested and about to have another push. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the Ukrainian line cracks soon. That said, Russia may not be able to capitalise on a breakthrough because of the weapons, supply, tactics and intel we send.
Ok, interesting. Well, the way I see it, it is not bad to keep fighting for the right thing. Donâ€™t know if our opinions are really representative for all of Northern And Southern Europe, but if so: easy job for Putin. Divide and conquer.
