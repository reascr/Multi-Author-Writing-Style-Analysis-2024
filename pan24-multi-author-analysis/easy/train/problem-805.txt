After all the bad news for Republicans on Election Day, the GOP is just barely on track to meet its baseline goal of the midterms: recapturing control of the House of Representatives.
The exact composition of a GOP majority could take weeks to determine, but it’s clear that whatever margin Republicans have, it won’t be a comfortable one.
Even if Republicans secure and pad their majority in the coming days, McCarthy will face a problem that has bedeviled a generation of House GOP leaders: the House Freedom Caucus.
If Republicans hold a narrow majority, the California Republican might need his entire conference to support him as speaker—a task made more difficult by the fact that a few members have already suggested they have no interest in a McCarthy speakership.
So? How does the MAGA GOP gracefully lose the MAGA prefix? What happens to the MAGA voters. Remember that they are very cult like. They cannot change their stripes over night. They need a House Leader that is up to this task. Murdock has used the NY Post to show that he is about to Dump Humpty Dumpty. I imagine Fox is working on a Game Plan to do this. This could be hard to do to avoid a Circular Firing Squad.
