Before 2020 a lot of people in Belarus considered him somewhat independent and pro-western. But he turned out just another mindless pawn of his boss and Russia. Rest in piss.
And then there’s always a slew of responses that try to take it a step further to make the murder seem more ridiculous, each one thinking they’re extraordinarily clever, when I’m reality those are even more cringey than the original joke, mainly because they’re just riding the coattails of the original commenter.
I read it. Gave me the impression of someone who was in favor of working closer with the West over Russia but quickly sided with the dictatorship when protests broke out. Also got the impression from his reassurance shortly after the war broke out that Belarus wouldn't be used to invaded Ukraine (proven wrong after he was probably overruled or kept out of the know) and his desire for Ukraine to quickly come to terms with Russia that he was likely not in favor of the war expanding/Belarus being pulled into Russia's mess. Just making assumptions on the internet, though, so take it for what it's worth.
