The US military isn't stupid and has learned from the mistakes of the past. Just because we didn't lay a path of mines from Finland to Turkey doesn't mean we aren't fully committed. US and Europe are playing chess and he is playing checkers. If we sent in NATO or US troops it becomes Vietnam quickly, and he pulls natural gas shipments freezing half of Europe to death. Instead he gets bled dry with sanctions without justification for escalation since nobody else is technically stepping into the war and Russia's sovereignty isn't threatened.
I said that from the start. It was a show of weakness for both Biden and Jens to make public statements repeatedly about how NATO would never engage Russia and Ukraine was pretty much left to fend for itself (aid not withstanding obviously). Had the west take a stronger stand and stood up for Ukraine at that moment, this could have all been averted.
Russians weren't breathing a sigh of relief when the west backed down. Instead, they were all laughing and mocking them for showing weakness. Russia took advantage of that.
