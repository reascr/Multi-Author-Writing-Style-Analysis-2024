hi ye. how's that "blame the jews" thing workin out for ya? you should see if the kraken lady and pillow guy are free when donnie donuts goes to jail. you'll need some sharp tools in your arsenal if you really want to make a serious run. you may need to loan them a couple billion though, cause they're gonna get smashed in court for libel over dominion. but they are practiced liars, so in the end they can only help your cause by bringing even more integrity to your campaign. oh, and put your 30 million dollar PPP loan out front as proof that you're legit. i know you were hurting for money at the time. go get 'em buckaroo. the sheep are ready for ya.
