That's always been how I've seen the plan going down. Get us wrapped in a civil war, we stop supporting ukraine, russia takes ukaine, china takes taiwan. Sow unrest in south america to further destabilize the region. China, Russia and a few satelites now control most of the resources they need to cripple the US technologically. Wait 2-4 years for all of our designed obselecence products to crumble while they proliferate in advancements, but we still don't have enough time to get manufacturing at a reasonable rate inside the US, then why not take us down?

I identify more as a libertarian and find it hypocritical when Republicans claim that the government can't do anything, yet they support government programs such as Medicare, Social Security, and spending on defense contractors and the military. They often decry socialism, even though they benefit from many socialist programs. It seems they lack knowledge about policy and simply hate the other political party.
