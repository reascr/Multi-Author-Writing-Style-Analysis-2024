The EU sanctions were devastating for the Russian arms industry and a number of Russian oligarchs. That being said the European strategy of targeted sanctions that would only harm oligarchs and industries involved with the takeover of Crimea, without impacting the Russian people, sorta backfired. The Russian authorities simply responded by banning European food, medicines and machinery, which both harmed the European export economy and made Russian peoples’ lives more miserable while still being possible to blame on Europe. Now in terms of extra backfiring many corporations countered this by simply manufacturing for the Russian market in Russia and smuggling in whatever couldn’t be locally produced through China or Central Asia. This in part is why many Western companies that "pulled out" of Russia really just sold their local subsidiaries to a Russian replacement.
Propaganda. Russia is a beauracratic state. Multiple warnings. Meerscheimer predicted it as did others based on obvious provocations. Not that it is justified.
