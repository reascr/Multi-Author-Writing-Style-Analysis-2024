Flying Zelenskyy to the White House while Russia is struggling as badly as they are, and even worse, flying him back to Europe in an American plane that the Russians KNOW he’s on and can’t do anything about, makes them look really weak and out of control on the world stage. It tells the rest of the world that they didn’t even lose to the American army, they lost to the American armies technology. And this is no knock to the Ukrainian army, they are fierce fighters and well trained. But the fact that Russia has this outcome without even entering combat with a single American soldier is catastrophically embarrassing. The weakness they’ve exposed to the world in this whole invasion will take a very long time for Russia to recover from.
Exactly. Idk why this is even news. What self respecting journalist, editor and news organization ok’d this shit? It’s clearly biased propaganda.
But they do care. Other countries take note of this. The whole invasion was intended to gain a small foothold of the level of authority America has. Had they succeeded in their invasion and captured an entire country without America being able to do anything, they certainly would have achieved that.
