Although the words “separation of church and state” do not appear in the First Amendment, the "establishment clause" was intended to separate church from state. When the First Amendment was adopted in 1791, the establishment clause applied only to the federal government, prohibiting the federal government from any involvement in religion. By 1833, all states had disestablished religion from government, providing protections for religious liberty in state constitutions. In the 20th century, the U.S. Supreme Court applied the establishment clause to the states through the 14th Amendment. Today, the establishment clause prohibits all levels of government from either advancing or inhibiting religion.
So what? The GOP will just scream bloody murder no matter what anyone does and call it a power grab unless Biden and Democrats completely acquiesce, so unless your intention is acquiescence, they may as well do what's right and beneficial and completely disregard the hue and cry of the bad faith reactionaries. There is literally no pleasing them, so there's no need to consider them in the least.
