I read the article. The referral seems to just be a letter to the DOJ... I'm not seeing that there will be any televised proceedings tomorrow (Monday). Am I mistaken?
The idea on Jan 6 was to manufacture a situation that could be argued to meet the criteria described in that clause, basically by throwing as many monkey wrenches as they could into the vote counting and certification process. States with GOP controlled legislatures but that went for Biden set up fake electors they sent to DC. They challenge the legitimacy of the vote. They organize a riot to apply direct pressure and delay the process by temporarily taking over the building. The National Guard response is intentionally delayed. Pence, overseeing the certification, is supposed to say "Wait guys, we have a problem here." The vote isn't certified and nobody has a majority, at which point they start arguing that the 12th Amendment clause applies.
It has to do with a fringe interpretation of a clause in the 12th Amendment. The clause in question deals with what happens when nobody gets a majority of electoral votes. It's our version of a run-off election if nobody reaches the magic number of 270 electoral votes.
