So they're not the victims of propaganda that leads them to believe the Kremlin's lies, they know what's up, but instead of fighting for change they're fleeing for South America?
Self-preservation is inherent in everyone. I wouldn't fault someone for not participating in a Vietnam War protest. I don't fault people for wanting to leave Russia.
If someone is a vocal Putin supporter that fled Russia to avoid sanctions, fuck 'em. That's not the case here.
Regardless, people react differently to stressful situations. Personal experience here, but when I served, I noticed that I freeze when confronted with high risk. I'm nothing but useless in the frontlines, on a protest or anything of that sort. And I'm a non-pregnant 30something dude. Let alone a pregnant woman.
It's only sheltered, pathetic people who think that self-preservation is their highest calling, who think that the history of fighting against tyrannical, genocidal governments is someone else's problem while they "raise awareness" from the sidelines.
