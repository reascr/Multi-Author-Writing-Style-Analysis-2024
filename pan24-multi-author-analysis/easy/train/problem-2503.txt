Recounts are common when the margin of victory is small, most states have some system in place to conduct a recount if the election is very close. In a race thatâ€™s decided by this few votes it makes sense to do a recount because even a tiny discrepancy between votes cast and votes counted matters. We will likely see a recount in Arizona as well because the margin between the two candidates is about 1,000 votes out of over 3.2 million cast. Georgia is having a runoff election because neither candidate achieved 50% of the vote even though one candidate has won popular overall vote. Elections are complicated but things like recounts, run offs and allowing voters to correct ballots that were cast legally but require a correction like a clear signature all benefit voters in general.
