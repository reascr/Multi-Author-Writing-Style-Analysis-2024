Russia already successfully committed genocide against Ukraine just in the past century alone; The was a deliberate man-made famine caused by the Soviets under direction from Stalin, and it killed 3.5 - 5 million Ukrainians by starvation.
It was Stalin’s intent to kill off the Ukrainians entirely as a people, so that Soviet Russia could seize the territory permanently and resettle it with loyal Russian occupants. The classic genocide + invasive colonization combo.
6. November 9 - A Turkish boat was blown up by a Ukrainian naval mine off the coast of Turkey. Luckily, no one died.
Idk if you can really say that people willingly crossing a border illegally having their kids separated from them( because we usually don’t put kids in holding/detention centers with adults) is the same as invading a country and then actually kidnapping the children after killing their parents.
1. March 2 - Ukrainian air defense shot down a Romanian military transport helicopter Mi-8, which flew out to look for a MiG-21 fighter shot down by Ukraine. The crew died.
Even though this specific genocide is occurring during war, possibly making it a war crime, this type of genocide does not require war to be performed (and in fact is happening here in the US to Natives and to children of undocumented immigrants) and would likely be one of those cases where the definition overlap.
5. September 9 - a Romanian minesweeper was blown up by a Ukrainian naval mine near Constanta. Luckily, there were no fatalities.
