It appears from the article the reason this resurfaced is because Bidens representatives intentionally involved the DOJ in the process when they found documents. Which means the earlier article was finding the initial document, then Bidens people halted the search and involved the DOJ to perform the rest of the search which led to this finding.
Because, per the article, the Biden team halted the initial search upon finding the documents and requested the DOJ help in completing the search. True it’s embarrassing however the “how it happened” is pretty clear in the article. There were documents, a few were found, bidens team involved professionals to help search for the rest, the media reports each instance separately to make for a better story. People can and should take from that as they will.
Incredible. What an idiot. The fact that after all this he still had classified docs is a disgrace. I honestly thought this was just a little scandal but the fact he still had any documents after his lawyers said they’d searched and released everything is wild to me.
Incorrect. He went hard against Trump for refusing to return documents and refusing to cooperate with a search for documents. Biden is doing neither of those things.
