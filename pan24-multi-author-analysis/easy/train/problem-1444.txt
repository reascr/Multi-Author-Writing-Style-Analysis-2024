Occupying Taiwan isn't an option. It really isn't TSMC has already warned even though China is their largest consumer, there won't be any winners if they attempt to occupy Taiwan. If they don't destroy their chip-building infrastructure then the west will (and that operation will probably have a weird name that doesn't make sense. xD).
TSMC and Global Foundaries have advanced the art of process nodes to such a degree that it's almost impossible for countries to spend money and will that level of manufacturing performance into existence. The network of suppliers that support TSMC to create their 5 and 7 nm nodes is extensive and none of them would risk selling to China. However, even having all of the raw materials is only a small portion of the puzzle. Intel in the US is one of the most well-financed semiconductor manufacturers...yet despite their prodigious piggy bank, they have had significant problems getting to 10 nm process nodes with acceptable yeilds, nevermind more advanced 7 and 5 nm nodes. Realistically, Intel is 5+ years away from having a real, workable 7 nm process node and by that time TSMC will be at 3 or smaller.
