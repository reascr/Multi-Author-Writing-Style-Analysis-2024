Yes. There was a post-election massacre in the Pentagon as well. Trump cleared out those he perceived to be non-loyalists, hoping he could get the army to side with him.
Exactly. I still can't fathom why Trump was not arrested and put in Jail that day for an insurrection against America. That criminal is still walking around free and still claimimg he won and the election was rigged. Are justice department is the biggest joke I've ever seen in my entire life. I honestly feel like we're living in worse than a third world country.
