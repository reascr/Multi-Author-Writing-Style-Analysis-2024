This is so fucking funny. Imagine being a Qanon fuck who thinks Trump is the smartest human in all of existence and has a master plan. You've lost friends and family from your insane worship of this deranged grifter, but you've stayed strong with your Qultist bros on the message boards telling you that the next big thing is coming. That soon the globalists will be publicly hanged. Biden will be forcibly removed and Trump will return to office and solve all your problems. Trump announces a big thing is coming, "holy shit, it's actually happening" you're gonna get to shove it in the faces of all your doubters. And then he announces a fucking photoshop series of Trump EFT fan fiction superhero cards. For $99 a piece. Incredible.
I mean, the trump campaign steals the rights to shit all the time, turnabout is fair play. I'd say you'd need to edit them a bit, though. Maybe with some of his greatest hits quotes.
