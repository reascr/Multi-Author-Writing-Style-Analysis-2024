Yeah, I don't think they're trying to ban partying or anything! It's just that these party tour packages tend to lead to groups of 50+ drunk asshole tourists puking and smoking weed and harassing people in the street at 2am waiting for a charter bus to take them back to their hotel. People lose their fucking minds on drunk tours. It gets to the point where locals can't enjoy their own bars and clubs because there are roving packs of idiots full of unlimited vodka shots.
It sounds like they might be trying to ban package tours and booze cruises where partygoers get unlimited drinks. Some other tourist spots have implemented similar restrictions. Tourists can still go on pub crawls, but they have to pay entrance fees and buy drinks individually instead of doing "all-you-can-drink" packages. Those big organized tour groups can go wild in a way that normal stag parties and pub crawlers usually don't.
Amsterdam. I just love it there. Iâ€™m in the process of obtaining my duel Dutch citizenship so that I can travel more frequently and even perhaps one day move there.
