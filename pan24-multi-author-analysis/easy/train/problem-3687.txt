Stupid Florida doing stupid things to make Florida more stupid. Less education good, got it! Continuing a highly illogical argument that a student will take an AP Black history or gender studies course and magically become a gay/multi-gendered BLM activist is beyond ignorant. If you are truly convicted in your values and beliefs and believe them to be a universal truth then you should have no problem allowing students to learn about a topic and test the concept through good ole fashioned critical thinking. It’s like they are admitting that their children are dumb enough to not think about what is being taught to them. I have multiple degrees and I’ve taken courses that I didn’t agree with, I didn’t think that information should be wiped from the face of the earth. I will only go to Florida to visit grandparents and when they’re gone Florida could fall off the map for all I care.
