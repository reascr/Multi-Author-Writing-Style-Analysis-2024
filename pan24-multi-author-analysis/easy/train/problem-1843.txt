COVID brought a lot of it forward. But yet countries like the US still don’t see it an issue. Slowly it’s becoming destigmatized. From a male prospective we are still looked at extremely funny if we say we have mental health issues. Same with males who are abused. We should just toughen up.
I was a little worried about the structure of the study given how shit a lot of social studies are (this coming from someone with a social related degree and still somehow learned statistics), but clicking through and reading the setup of having multiple interviews including an initial in-person one makes me feel a lot better than "an online survey", which would not be representative.
That’s not what I was saying at all. The increase in mental health disorders is 100% real and measurable. The people who suffer from these disorders aren’t weak or “faking it”. I’m saying that the lives people live in the modern world CAUSE depression, ADHD, anxiety, etc. People are suffering more and in different ways than they would have a generation or two ago.
