Because she is a “good woman”. I grew up fundamentalist Christian so these dynamics hit home (I am a woman). Women who follow the role are rewarded. If they are pretty, faithful, always positive, have children, don’t question they are doted upon as being wonderful. Women who question, speak out against abuse (especially by men in high roles) are quickly punished socially by the group. Seen as bad, difficult, “crazy”, abusive, of Satan. “Everyone else doesn’t have a problem, why can’t you get along?” These institutions thrive on perception, women are groomed (and abused) to be good. Many have Stockholm syndrome in my opinion. It is really bad but people see it from the outside as the pretty facade that the group wants others to see. And Kate obviously is struggling with an eating disorder (similar to many women in the church with dealing with lack of control in their lives). Princess Diana also talked about hers she struggled with due to what she dealt with.
Exactly. Harry is the most normal of the rotten bunch and I applaud him for exiting that shitshow. I love it when they whine “but the queen sacrificed everything for decades to serve the people.” What? She got rich and used her money to protect a pedo prince.
