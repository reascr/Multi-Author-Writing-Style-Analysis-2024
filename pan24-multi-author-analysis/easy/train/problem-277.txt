China is not some massive intelligent superpower. It imports 75% of its food and energy with no nuclear navy capable of defending it's shipping lanes. Any county with a modern navy can park a few destroyers to choke off it's supply lines and it will lose power in 3 mo and deindustrialize and face mass famine in 1 year. They're facing a massive demographic collapse themselves, a fresh water crisis, energy crisis, economic crisis, food crisis, now the Chips Act... etc etc etc. The whole fucking shit hole of a country is run by 1 crazy, idiot despot who has killed every talented person who could give him counsel and threaten his position or a subordinates who brought him bad news for decades. Hence zero COVID still, HAZMAT suits disinfecting airport runways, and 9 months of rolling blackouts in their most economically prosperous city.
Anybody organizing any serious discontent is immediately arrested. Putin is a KGB man, so Putin knows how to keep the KGB working competently. Hard to revolt without any organization.
