They all make shit up. AOC isn't a bartender, she owns a bar. Trump isn't a financial wiz, he's filed for bankruptcy several times. Biden didn't do any of the shit he says he did in college, and his son didn't die in Afghanistan or Iraq (he's said both). It's so insane how we can think Bloods vs Crips is stupid, or Michigan vs Ohio State is stupid, but here we are arguing over whose rich dick we suck is better than the rich dick someone else is sucking. No one with more than 10 million dollars gives a fuck about what we think. Stop playin yourselves.

Santos even at one point claimed four of his employees were killed at the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, but as the Times notes, none of the 49 victims of the massacre have any connection to Santos’ firm.
