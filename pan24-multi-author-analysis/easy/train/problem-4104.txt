Yes. Or people who earn under a certain amount and whose employer doesn’t provide coverage. It’s a total catch 22. There are a ton of people in Georgia (who I know personally) with “professional” jobs at small companies (law firms mostly because that’s my field) who don’t get insurance through their employers and make way more than can qualify them for Medicaid. I don’t know what the qualifications are for it exactly, but I know that a family of 3 has to make under $40k a year to qualify for reduced lunch. Yet conversely, $40k a year won’t qualify you for a one bedroom apartment (too low) OR government housing (too high). What the fuck are these people supposed to do? I guess the answer is die in the street.
