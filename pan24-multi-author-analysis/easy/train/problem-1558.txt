Studies show that women who are denied an abortion face psychological risks, as do their children. 34% of all women who were denied an abortion reported seeing their child as a burden. Children of mothers denied abortion have more psychosomatic illnesses than other children; need psychiatric treatment more often. In a study from Sweden, 24% of all women who had been denied an abortion had been unable to adjust to the situation. 53% had been able to adapt only with difficulty and 23% could be described as well adapted to the situation. Mothers of unwanted children additionally often have relationships characterized by negative emotions, according to one study. Unwanted children are beaten more often and their parents spend less time with them. This affects the children's personality development and their school performance. Even in adulthood, the influences on the mental health, professional life and married life of the unwanted children are evident.
