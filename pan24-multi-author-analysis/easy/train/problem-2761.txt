Probably not, we underclasses are too busy fighting ourselves over national/ethnic/skin color differences, despite having far more experiences in common than that set us apart. And that commonality extends globally across borders and isn't restricted to east/west despite social media fostering cultural tribal silos to create arbiraty differences and irrational fears of those who don't conform to a particular social dogma.
Here is another fun fact. They can promise the money, or often stock, and take the tax deduction. They aren't obligated to actually give the money anytime soon. I don't believe there is a time limit for actually turning over the funds. Frequently they promise X number of shares at the current value. They hold onto the shares until the value has diminished. Then actually donate the shares. But they still got the tax deduction based on the value of the shares when promised.
