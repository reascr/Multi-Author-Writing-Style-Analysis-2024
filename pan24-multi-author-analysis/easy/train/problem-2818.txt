They've actually taken some time to think this through though, and likely have properly equipped this attack. Apparently a bunch of jets are standing by to provide air cover, and the reason rocket and drone attacks are have dropped off is because they are stockpiling before this offensive. I want Ukraine to smack them back hard, but this is probably the second largest mobilization of a military force in history - and the biggest offensive since Stalingrad. Ukraine needs all the help they can get, and they need it yesterday - bullets, artillery and tank shells, every kind of missile, mines, rations, medical equipment, with the US providing real-time satellite intelligence and StarLink allowing use of their equipment for communications and drone control. If Ukraine survives this, they've won - but it won't be easy.
Been incarcerated. And I sure as hell didn’t feel like a customer even tho you’re basically forced to buy shit from the commissary. Maybe they’re ESL or I hope so bc I find that language kind of disturbing tbh.
