During a search of Torres’s home in Brasília, federal police officers reportedly found a draft decree that sought to authorise an emergency intervention in Brazil’s electoral court designed to overturn the election result.Torres, who has denied wrongdoing, was arrested at Brasília airport on Saturday morning after flying back from the US where he was purportedly on holiday at the time of the attacks.".
So, there's what you said, that the terrorists wanted to cause mayhem so the Army would intervene in national security, plus an internal job inside the government of the Federal District to weaken the security and facilitate their actions.
I would say we more or less agree. I am not arguing for any particular system, just that they all fall to the same root cause and to fix that would take monumental change on a global level on how we as cultural societies and communities organize and vote fairly and that doesn't take into account the very important aspect necessary for a stable democracy that is a well educated public that understands what exactly its voting on. That kind of change is too monumental for most people and it would be heavily opposed by existing governments and ideologies.
