Context: in Canada, government student loans are comprised of provincial and federal portions. When COVID hit, the federal government suspended student loan interest on the federal portion of the student loan. Now, a bill is before the house that, if passed, will eliminate the interest charged, for good.
Not humanity. Education is free in a lot of European countries. In some countries students even get paid a small amount to study. Of course they still have to pay for literature as well as housing, food etc. so they have to take out a loan as well (with very low interest rate).
Finally. Maybe it's just me, but the idea of the country charging interest on the betterment of its people seems morally perverted and deeply impractical. It helped no one that it was supposed to serve. Finally, good riddance!
The problem with that system is it will further increase inequality and decrease upward mobility, which will also disproportionately affect under-represented minorities.
When minimum wage is $11 an hour, you feel pretty good making $20 an hour. But when minimum wage is $15 an hour and you are still making $20 an hour, it doesn't feel too good does it? What about when minimum wage will be $20 an hour in a few years, and you are still making $20? You suddenly go from being almost double the minimum wage to being a minimum wage worker.
