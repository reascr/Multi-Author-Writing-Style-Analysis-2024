if they were actually planning to start a war, there'd be less foreshadowing. surprise attacks require the element of surprise and throwing away the element of surprise like this is a very stupid move if you're actually planning to attack, but its smart if you're just trying to look tough in the eyes of the world and make your rival seem like the bad guy, I.E. "they keep shooting down our heckin' peace balloons!".
Other things to note: there is a tense and polarizing war happening in Europe, Ukraine is getting support but it's been tough to get the support they need due to politics but there has been a significant change in course with training and supporting the Ukrainian military by nato, Finland and Sweden about to join nato, China relations are stressed with the crackdown on technology imports and sanctions, election season is ramping up and it's going to be a doozy, neo Nazis are plotting domestic terrorism and coordinating with foreign groups and agencies, and there is a massive train derailment spewing toxic substances in the air and water in America's heartland and people are getting arrested for covering it.
