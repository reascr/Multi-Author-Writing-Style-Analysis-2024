>One of the ways it does that is by allowing employers to contribute to a worker's retirement fund. Many companies already match 401(k) contributions, but this change would mean that employers can contribute the amount that workers are spending on their student loan payments.
My understanding is that the company can match the amount of money you pay for your student loan monthly, into your 401k, so that you don't have to worry about contributing extra money into your 401k while paying off your student loan. Does that make sense?
Having to choose between retirement or student loan assistance isnâ€™t going to solve the underlying problem with the affordability of college/university.
Look, I understand that the whole system is fucked. I'm more making the point that a few years in the MD is going to be making $300k and will be able to handle those payments. The teacher with $100k in debt is making $50k. They're forever screwed. It's all a fucked up system but some are more fucked than others. Doctors are some of the least fucked because their earning potential is so high. This is why banks give them mortgages with nothing down.
