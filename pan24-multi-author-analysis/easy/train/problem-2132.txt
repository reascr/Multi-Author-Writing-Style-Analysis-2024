I mean pigs are widely known to be some of the most intelligent farm animals (ranked 5th in the animal kingdom overall) with the ability to recognize faces even over long periods, capable of deception (one experiment showed an evolution in tactics resulting in pigs learning to throw out a red herring to mislead to competing pig for food) capable of complex problem solving and reasoning, capable of mapping out and memorizing locations and routines, can distinguish minute differences in scent (one experiment showed they can distinguish spearmint from peppermint scent), and even perform better and concentrate better playing video games than chimpanzees. They can recognize themselves in mirrors, can recognize family members, have fantastic memories and can teach each other skills. Not domestic pigs, but wild pigs have even been observed using tools such as sticks and sheets of bark to dig holes for their nests.
