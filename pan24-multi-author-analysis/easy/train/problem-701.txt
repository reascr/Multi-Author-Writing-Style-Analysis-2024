I am really glad that they take it this way. Was afraid that russians would use civillians as cover, and hide in every building, making it impossible to capture the city without leveling it down to the ground. Being forced out without a fight is probably the best possible outcome, vs possibility of becoming Maruiupol 2,0.
Incorrect. They left due to a deteriorating supply situation that would have made surviving the winter impossible. If you've been following the conflict at all you'd know that Ukrainian gains in Kherson region have been incremental and capturing Kherson city was nowhere near imminent. Kherson would have fallen but it would have been very bloody and drawn out. Instead the Russians are trying to consolidate their holdings in Crimea and Donbas.
Victory! Kherson is once again blue and yellow. The Russians are in retreat across the river, to the crevasses where they hide. And the Ukrainianâ€™s hearts know-they will not face them again. All-of the west will rejoice.
What referendum? Kherson is Ukraine. Nothing changed internationally. What russia did was not referendum - it does not even matter or has any significance.
