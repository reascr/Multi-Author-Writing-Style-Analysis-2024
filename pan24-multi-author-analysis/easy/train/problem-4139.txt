Almost funny to imagine Iran keeps trying and MI5 are talking about the attempts the way you would scold a child. "Stop that! I can see you doing that, knock it off.".
This long list doesn't even some successful murders like Fereydoun Farrokhzad who was brutally stabbed to death by regime forces in Germany , or kidnappings like when the Iranian regime lured famous activist journalist Roholla Zam by getting female operatives to act as long time activist colleagues of his in order to gain his trust and lure him to the Iraq border and kidnapped him into Iran where he was executed, or celebrity activists like.
