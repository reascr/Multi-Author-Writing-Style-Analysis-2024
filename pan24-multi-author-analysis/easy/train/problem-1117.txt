When I was 16, I was pretty much an idiot who thought he knew the whole thing, beginning to end, smartest kid in the room anywhere. That kid would have totally agree with this decision, and embraced it, and engaged in the whole process.
The most important consideration, I think, in designing a power structure (including voter inclusion/suffrage) is to prevent excessive concentration of power rather than pursue real or imagined superior decision making capacity. Taking history, the state of the world outside of our reasonably functional democracies, and human nature (especially as it pertains to those who seek and behave with power) into account, extreme concentration of power leads to policies that benefit a select few which may be far harder to correct than poor planning potentially caused by a relatively ignorant collective power. Based on this as well as the potential for 16 and 17 year olds to pay a significant amount of taxes without representation, I think lowering the age to 16 is sensible.
