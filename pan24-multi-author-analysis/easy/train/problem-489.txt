In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
2.	⁠Even if there is a ban like a REAL ban where we have a gun buyback program such as Australia most people just will not give it up and keep their guns. I used to live in NJ and Murphy passed a high capacity magazine ban. 2 years after the ban there was a report in the paper by the police on how many people turned in their magazines and it was zero. People knew they were holding onto contraband that was a felony with mandatory prison time and a hefty fine but they didn’t care they were not going to comply with unconstitutional laws. Don’t forget this is a heavy Blue state not Texas so imagine what will happen in other states.

Really? Please tell me a law that is not allowing you to own a gun. And by “you” I’m assuming you’re a normal citizen and not a convicted criminal?
