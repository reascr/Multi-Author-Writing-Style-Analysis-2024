"The Santos story certainly has its amusing aspects, and represents a kind of joint failure of journalism, Democratic Party political operations and the Long Island voting public. But is it the kind of crisis that demands the extraordinary action of expelling a member of Congress, or altering the legal requirements for office?".
As for the author (who I'm at the point of just being disgusted with, despite thinking that making the news boring again is a significant point), I am not only repulsed that he blames his opponent for not engaging in sufficient mud slinging, but also that he insists that somehow the remedy for elections run under lies is to do nothing and wait for another election (when the problem is behavior that wasn't prevented in the first place).
Not true. They were pointing out that his stories weren't adding up. There was also a local paper that was doing the same. Problem was that the bigger media markets were too busy screaming "Crime.".
