Yeah, the Russian Orthodox Church has aligned itself with the invasion. In Russia, it's indistinguishable from other authorities. In Ukraine, not all priest of the Ukranian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchy has been pro-invasion, but the connections are there and too many are loyal to Kirill, who is fully backing the destruction of Ukraine.
This. And LGBTQ+ community has been assisting the government and conducting trainings for the police way before the war started. I'm Ukrainian and I remember maybe 10 years ago or so when Russia already prohibited any positive mention of gays in the media, Ukrainian Biggest Loser (the weight losing show) had a lesbian family participating in the family edition of the show on one of the major TV channels. I mean, the situation is far from perfect for sure and Pride in Kyiv has to have to a huge police plan, including closing off some parts of downtown and having police stand there protecting the march from idiots, but it's government helping the LGBTQ+ community to be safe. Again, not perfect at all that there still are idiots (mostly Russian Orthodox christians) who come to protest, but the government had been making steps forward before the war and hopefully will continue to do so to make sure our laws are aligned with EU and our people are educated.
