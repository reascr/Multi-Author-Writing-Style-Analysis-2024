While a lot of Middle Eastern have the mindset of Jews = Israeli, majority of educated Arabs that I met and within my family just despise Israel as a State and government not Jews.
I also did mention a lot of within the middle east has the mindset of Jews = Israeli because a lot of those who are uneducated do not even know the difference between zionism or jews because of what Media constantly convey. While government within middle east may support and work with Israel they do not endorse Israel at all at least not through media, many examples of People or celebrities within ME getting jail time, fine or losing their jobs purely because they have Israelis/Jewish friends, that is not the people but the government problem and the government do not represent the people, look at Iran for example.
Wow way to jump the shark there. I’m not blaming anyone just pointing out that under what op said they’re wrong and under what your saying they’re wrong. You can’t have it both ways if it’s one long continuous war that Arabs started then that’s it it’s one war. Running around saying every single war was started by Arabs makes no sense, there’s just the one long war, right? And on the inverse side if their are multiple wars they didn’t start every single one the second Arab Israel war proves that when Israel invade Egypt.
