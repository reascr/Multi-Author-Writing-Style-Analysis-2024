The problem is that looking at that agreement through a Russian lens it is useless because Russia never intends to actually comply. If Russia says 'we won't attack' they are already planning to attack, so when someone tells Russian 'we won't attack' then Russia assumes they are lying and are going to attack.
That’s categorically false. We got involved in combat during WWII because we were attacked. Before that we were lending and supplying weapons to allied powers because their democratically elected governments were asking us to. That’s fine. I’m fine with us doing things like supplying weapons to countries who ask for it and share democratic values, what I’m not fine with is us overthrowing governments or invading countries that have not directly engaged us.
None. That's why it's a good idea to offer it. It may be something that Puttie could sell to the Russian people as something gained when they return all military to Russia. It is likely good politics/optics for something that is of really no value.
