This is coming from the party that’s all about “freedom” but I guess freedom only applies to straight white men. It’s a shame they never sit down and talk with a LGBTQ+ member, get to know them better and judge them by their character but then again it’s a lot easier to judge than to understand; it takes empathy and compassion to understand someone, both qualities they lack.
It was. Somehow, under Stitt and people like Bullard, things have gotten even worse. The teacher exodus in Oklahoma has gotten even worse, as teachers (like I used to be) are all looking to leave after our new secretary of education was elected, stating he wants to force all schools to do "patriotic education". It is a nightmare in Oklahoma, getting worse under the Stitt-show.
Also "Jewish" isn't a race, nor genetically inherited. Wtf. Whoopie Goldberg just got into some shit with Jewish groups for saying this same misconception when she said Jewish people are basically a race of white people. Every race and ethnicity can be Jewish. "Jewish" is not a biological type.
