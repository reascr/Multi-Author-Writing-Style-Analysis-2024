Florian Philippot is fortunately a 100% irrelevant politician as of 2022. He left / was pushed out of the National Front after the 2017 elections and then founded his own party Les Patriotes which advocates leaving the European Union, the Schengen agreements, the European Convention on Human Rights and NATO, and he's become a covid antivaxxer shamelessly spouting fake news and nonsense pandering to conspiracy-minded people from day 1 since the beginning of the pandemic.
I'm sure he gets a little check here and there despite that. He's good at indoctrinating his small army of very loud idiots online, that has to be worth something. It's either that, or he's very, very, very stupid.
The French far-right have been in bed with Putin's regime for a decade because of an ideological alignment and corruption, but you can also find various shades of bothsidesism and relativism/complacency among part of the far-left / radical left as well as a few hardline conservatives who haven't jumped onto the National Rally's vessel yet.
It'll always be like that. This isn't a "left" thing. It's a freedom thing - we all must remain united and fight these assholes wherever they try to make things worse - and easier for them to dominate the rest of us.
