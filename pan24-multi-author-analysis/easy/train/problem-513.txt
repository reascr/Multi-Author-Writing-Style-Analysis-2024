There's also the nagging problem that Putin doesn't believe that he's lost the war, so he'll push for tens of thousands of square km in more territory if negotiations happen at this point, not less (in the form of Russian troop withdrawal).
This is what makes negotiations so unworkable at this point: Putin thinks he can reverse his losses with just a few million more troops, and thus doesn't want a negotiated end to the war that permanently freezes the frontlines where they are right now (and especially doesn't want any possibility of Ukraine joining NATO). The people of Ukraine do not want to give up post-invasion territory just after they liberated Kherson and only a few months after the Kharkiv counteroffensive, since they see that they have the momentum.
True. Russians need to learn a lesson about trying to rebuild the USSR one country at a time, and slaughtering people. The actions of Russia must not be swept under the rug or forgotten. Kick putin!
within three days after the start of a war, aggression, military operation, any disguised, hybrid war against Ukraine, the guarantor countries hold consultations, after which they are legally obliged to provide military assistance to Ukraine, in particular in the form of armaments and the closure of the skies.
Yeah. I'd love for Russia to be so "thoroughly defeated" that they won't try this again for a hundred years.
Which analysts, specifically? RUSI believes that Ukraine can handily win if it is provided modern combat jets, and Ben Hodges (retired general who commanded US Army Europe) believes that Ukraine can reclaim Crimea.
