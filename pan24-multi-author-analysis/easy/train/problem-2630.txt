In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I am not surprised. The far right has been responsible for the overwhelming majority of domestic terrorism for the past 20 years. Between 52 and 70% compared to <20% for the "far" left.
Reporters are not investigators. They report the facts provided to them by the investigators. They can ask the investigators whether the attacks seem related, are suspected to be politically motivated or could be considered domestic terrorism. However, the reporter can not on their own declare the incidents any of these things, no matter how obvious it might seem, because it is not their role. If the officials conducting the investigation don’t say any of these things, the reporter can’t state them in their story.

Yes, seriously. I’m talking about investigators in a legal sense. Maybe you don’t realize this, but investigative reporters and police/FBI investigators are extremely different from each other in both a professional and legal sense.
