Typically this is one of two options either living with a relative on a long-term basis or being adopted by someone else. The court has to decide what's in the best interest of the child.
However, in almost every state the Court's decision is governed by a finding of "what is in the best interest of the child.".
My conservative ex-father in law got a slew of fancy dogs that now all have thickly matted fur from where they are never bathed, one dog constantly gasps for breath from heartworms because they didn't pay to protect them from heartworms, and they'll go on and on about how they hate cats because "at least you can get some use out of dogs.".
The foster parents didn't like this and filed a separate federal case and argued in court that that was unconstitutional because it is explicitly treating them and the child differently because of the child's race.
And in my state, and apparently in Texas based on the procedural history, they do not prohibit foster parents from attempting to intervene or seeking to adopt a child.
Oh I know. But I'm also feeling like the maga world and establishment republicans are going to clash and it's not going to help their numbers.
