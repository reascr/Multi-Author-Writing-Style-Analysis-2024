I don’t necessarily think your point is wrong, and Hamilton may have had similar opinions about the modern senate, but it has changed so much that I think noting the historical context is important.
The Senate as it exists today is a completely different institution than the senate as it first existed, so I don’t think it makes sense to apply their perspectives to the modern senate. The Senate originally existed as representatives of the States, not the people, which is why every state is equally represented. Senators were chosen by state governments to represent the interests of state governments, and House members were elected to represent people by people.
Madison was a strong advocate of this system, where Senators would be long-serving experts who represented their states’ interests and were less subject to the whims of the people in any given election cycle.
Exactly. They knew times would change, and society would change, they just couldn't fully predict how and wanted the Constitution to be able to change with those times.
