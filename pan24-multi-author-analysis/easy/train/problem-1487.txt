I believe "Gott mitt uns" was originally a Swedish army motto during the 30 years war, that eventually got picked up by the Prussians who in turn became the Germans.
Projection. Some cases are worse than others. Weird number of GOP officials looking for underage escorts, sending daughters out of state for reproductive health procedures they publicly oppose, cheating on spuses with cancer, having non-hetero relationships on the side, pitching Antisemitic conspiracies, or lying about huge stuff like loved ones dying in 9/11. It's on the news for 1 week tops, and then it dissappears.
HAHAHAH! Yeah. That's drunk shit talking ... like your friend at the bar that has had one too many and slurs "Think I can take the bouncer? Yeah, I could totaly fuck him up." Then spends the rest of the night mean mugging him and pysching himself up ... until finally someone points out that the bouncer hasn't even noticed the friend's posturing at all from across the room. Bouncer is too busy looking for real threats.
