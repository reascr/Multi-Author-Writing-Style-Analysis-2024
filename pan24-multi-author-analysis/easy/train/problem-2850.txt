Cool. That’s not what the point of the original comment was about. It asserted that the right was apathetic to child death due to COVID. That isn’t accurate.
“Potential”? Good lord. Seems like letting a former president get away with wholesale insurrection could be construed as bad for the kiddies to observe. That seems like it’s full of “potential”. And how about “grab them by the pssy”? Not to mention the nude pictures of the former “First Lady” all over the internet. And let’s not forget the paying off of a porn start to keep quiet about his sexual dalliances while married. And the walking through of dressing rooms during his Miss America contests. And stealing of top secret documents. It’s like he was on a mission to break all the commandments! But do go on about drag shows.
