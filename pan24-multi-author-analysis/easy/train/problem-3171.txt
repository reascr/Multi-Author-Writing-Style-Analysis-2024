There is talk of NK sending troops to fight in Ukraine with the Russians. We know they are supplying arms to the Russians, artillery etc. Now they have a problem and need to be subsidized AGAIN Time to stop that BS, NOW We are subsidizing and supporting a mafia government that is nothing but a cancer to this planet. You don’t feed a cancer.
The Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee decides to convene the enlarged meeting of the Seventh Plenary Meeting of the Eighth WPK Central Committee in late February to review last year's struggle for implementing the programme for rural revolution in the new era and discuss the immediate farming issue and long-term goals for the agricultural development.
Thanks. Here’s another thought. If NK were to send soldiers does it make sense to call them combat troops or to say they are just construction workers being sent to help rebuild? Remember last weeks Chinese “weather balloon” did the Chinese call it a spy balloon or a weather balloon? Garlicroastedpotato, NK will call them Sunday School Teachers if they think the world will buy that load of horse hockey. Remember, Putin calls this a Special Police Action, not what it is, A War.
In order to put the country's agriculture on a stable and sustainable track of growth, it is necessary to promote the preferential development of the agricultural science and technology and direct main efforts to further strenhening the material and technical foundations of the agricultural sector including the perfection of the overall irrigation system.
