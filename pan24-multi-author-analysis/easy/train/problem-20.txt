Eh, more and more people are realizing the problems with Al Jazeera these days. Helps that since Qatar spent all that money and effort (and migrant workers lives) on gaining worldwide brand recognition, more people than ever are aware that Al Jazeera is a state run news source, not an independent source free to criticize its own government.
And do what? Do tell. I'm in the middle of this shit show and there are waiting lists for waiting lists for anything energy use reduction related. Solar panels? Ask Jesus, maybe he will provide.
Long term of course solar panels can be part of the solution to get rid of dependencies if the EU starts to build up their solar industry again which got destroyed by Chinese competition and a lack of foresight of European politicians who just watched and did nothing to protect a vital industry.
Qatar is gas, not oil. They'll find customers in se Asia/south Asia/Africa once Europe transitions to renewables (cause we know Europe/us will keep a lot of the renewable tech close to the chest and/or charge metric dick tons to export it, more than these developing countries can afford).
