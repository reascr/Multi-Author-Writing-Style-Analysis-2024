In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Phrenology? Come on, that's not fair. Give them a little credit. You have to manually inspect every head that way, the upside is way too low. It's no way to build revenue growth. Tonics, on the other hand...you get some dirty ditchwater, bottle it up, and bam! Now you're moving some real product.

Wow. Watching someone willing to knowingly harm his state and his people for attention is deeply disturbing. Psychopaths are impossible for normal people to understand.
