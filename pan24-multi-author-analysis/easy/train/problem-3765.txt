From what I’ve seen from the damage is extensive, you can compare pictures from before and after and the castle looks to be mostly rubble.
This lists the damage to the castle and while it isn’t completely destroyed, a fair bit of the exterior is destroyed and there is damage in other areas too. We also don’t know about the extent of the damage to the foundation, for example, and while it’s definitely very low on the list of things for the Turkish people to rebuild, once the rubble is cleared we should be able to see how bad it is.
Eh 🤷🏾‍♂️. There's many things that affect why ppl believe what they believe. I don't really look down on them for it though, even if it is absurd. Just a difference of opinion in my book, you know?
That's horrifying. My city just had a 3 day freeze and we lost a bunch of trees and power and it was the source of endless complaint, myself included... but then you see something like this...
That's gotta be absolutely terrifying. Four separate large quakes. Two being record breaking or near record breaking. Istanbul is on a major fault too and people are worried it will trigger one there.
