Small crimes? Setting aside the constant flagrant violations of the emoluments clause of our constitution, have you forgotten that he tried to extort Zelensky and illegally withhold aid from Ukraine unless he'd invent evidence of wrongdoing by Biden to help his reelection efforts then committed multiple further crimes covering it up?
Have a little faith... He got away with small crimes and misdemeanors....when he got into politics that was his mistake.. The DOJ is very thorough when it comes to investigations... He will be indicted ....
He will be indicted... He won't be allowed to get away with what he did... Even if he never goes to prison. He will banished and disgraced for all time.. Everyone around him knows it. The likes of Hannity and others went to these grand juries and told the truth because lying to the DOJ will send your ass to prison and they aren't going to risk that.
