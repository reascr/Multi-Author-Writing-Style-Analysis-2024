Or the US could simply opt for a full on conventional retaliation carpet bombing any and all infrastructure, both military and civilian in Belarus. Meanwhile, NATO could move into Ukraine and supply military and humanitarian relief pushing Russia back to the borders pre-Crimea invasion. If Russia want to retaliate with nukes then M.A.D. ensues and we are all dead anyways.
"Russia will train Belarusian Air Force crews to operate aircraft “which have already been refitted to carry and possibly use air-launched ammunition with special warheads,” Putin told reporters Monday after his meeting with Lukashenko in Minsk, according to BelTa, in an apparent nod to nuclear weapons.".
Basically a Regiment worth of Combined arms units (Tanks, and Mechanized infantry) with 4 dedicated support Battalions attached (1 for Recon, 1 for artillery, 1 for Repair and logistics, and I forget the last one).
Well well. Russia forcing Belarus to use nukes on Ukraine. If this happens, NATO nukes the shit out of Belarus and Putin can watch and analyse the outcome without him facing any consequences.
