Not really a crossroads. Republicans have failed to articulate a clear vision for Fetal Rights. Right now, the way Texas's laws work cause clear conflicts across state lines in a manner similar to the Fugitive Slave Act. The Supreme Court will have to address this, unless Congress acts. Republicans can't even elect a leader or explain to us how Texas will be able to prosecute out-of-state offenses. For healthcare workers -educated white-collar professionals who should be voting Republican- they're faced with unclear, often reactionary rules from their employers on how to handle all this. This does not inspire confidence. All of the instruments used here are punishments doled out in the form of fines or prison time, which isn't an effective strategy versus addressing why women have abortions.

Exactly! Thatâ€™s why I say let it be on every states ballot. Even in the red states of KY and KS, the voters supported abortion. There might be one or two states that go differently, but I bet the results would be nearly all states support it, if not all.
