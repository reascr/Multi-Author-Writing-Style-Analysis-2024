San Antonio here and it’s bad… been bad for years I unfortunately live in very busy area of town and yea fridays and Saturday nights routinely takeovers … I’m 38 I’m ole school I’m all for pulling over at a sonic and showing off your low riders and loud clear bumpin sound systems and custom rides but we’re talking guns and racing bullshit backyard Hondas and doing burnouts and donuts and firing off guns and violence against anybody who interjects it’s bullshit.
Did you read my response? Because I said there are already existing laws on the books that cover this stuff. They're being reactionary because the sideshow stuff in Austin just went viral despite it not actually being anything close to a common issue in real life in that city. The right knows that these events are largely populated by black and brown people, though, so they suddenly just put together a task force to "cover" it. That's why it's racist.
