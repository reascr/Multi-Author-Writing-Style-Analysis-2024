I dated a girl in law school. All her friends were obsessed with it. They were all either homeschooled and/or grew up in some Amy Coney Barrett type "Christian" cult sect. It was 100% why we broke up. They were rooting for Kavanaugh at the time. Thought he was this epic victim. They all aspired too be him. These were smart kids completely brainwashed but planning at 24 what they had to do to position themselves to be Federalist stooges. It was sickening and terrifying.
Education is important. You have entirely slandered an organization by misstating their principals and judicial philosophy. The federalists apply to the constitution the same interpreting principals every lawyer applies to modern legislation. If the language is not clear, what was the purpose (intent) of the legislation as understood by the average person at the time of adoption. It has nothing to do with religion. Literally nothing. It is a shame so many write with certainty absolutely without any factual basis for their opinions. Which are frankly just feelings since they are devoid of intellectual effort.
