Military recruiters know this and swarm those high schools/areas. I went to a high school in rural CA with less than 25% of most graduating class doing any post secondary schooling due mostly to economics. We had at least one branch of the military on our campus every day of the week. My husband, who grew up in a wealthy bay area suburb never saw a military recruiter on campus. Period.

Their entire tribe completely abandoned their homeland due to overpopulation and pressure from other tribes. It happened again and again.
There have been protests against the invasion when it started but were shut down and there were protests against the mobilization but they got shut down too so the only resort for Russians is to flee the country their home which is really difficult as some neighboring countries won’t allow them to and civilians are saying they aren’t welcome I feel so horrible for people of both Ukraine and Russia who pay the price of what one person is doing.
