Just fyi, that isn't really true at all. Translations of those passages might have used other phrases before, such as "sodomites", or "them that defile themselves with mankind" or 'men who sleep with men as they would women'(the Greek literally means 'men who bed men'), but these passages were nigh universally interpreted as homosexuality until the late mid 1900s, including by the people from the time it was written, for whom Greek was their first language.
Tell a white lie? Hate. Checking out the hottie down the street? Hate. Disrespecting your parents. Hate.
Meanwhile, of course, African countries (except South Africa) continue to criminalize homosexuality, leaving homosexuals in Africa, in jails, violently beaten, killed - and their families humiliated and without work - and Christians say nothing.
Like guys, relax. You’re probably a fine person who occasionally does things that I find morally objectionable. Secret time… I do things that I find morally objectionable from time to time. And I feel badly about it and try to be better. But it doesn’t mean that I, you, whomever, is hated as a human being. That is ridiculous.
Like Paul, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the boundless greatness of His power toward us who believe.".
