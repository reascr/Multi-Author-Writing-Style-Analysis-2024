The F150 can get 50 Miles of charge in 10 minutes, I'll use that since I imagine that it would use more power than most cars. A single charger could charge 6 vehicles (within that 96%) an hour, and if we go with 16 hours of available charge time (assuming the trucks run for 8 hours a day) a single charger could top up 96 vehicles in a single evening. Even if we cut that in half, and work with 48 vehicles an evening you are essentially looking at needing enough power for two concurrent EV chargers, something that's possible in many households to keep 96 vehicles ready for the next day's work, I don't know how many dozens of vehicles you aren wanting to charge, But I think 96 probably covers most use cases. But if not, we aren't talking about 1 to 1 increases in chargers to vehicles. we're talking about 48 to 1 vehicles to chargers, because it's much in the same way that we don't have a 1-1 vehicle gas pump ratio (and yes the time requirements of charging do make that ratio much smaller than petroleum but again, 1-1 isn't needed for the USPS use cases).
But have I? It takes a lot of resources to build a car. If I get rid of my 2018 Toyota Prius for a new Tesla, how long do I have to drive the Tesla to cover the environmental impact of consuming 2 vehicles within 4 years? I still donâ€™t have an answer for this.
