No, capitalism isn't broken. It works just fine. You think conditions in this country and this time period are bad? Go look around at other countries and time periods. Working a shit job today is basically heaven compared to what it used to be. I agree it could get much, much better., But capitalism isn't broken. What a ridiculous notion. People like you have been saying that since capitalism started. So far, every single one of them has been wrong. And I suggest you are, too.
Our JobKeeper scheme during covid paid money directly to employers to cover the cost of their employees, this money had to be paid by the employers to their employees, but in most cases they would have paid their employees that much money anyway, so in effect, we printed a lot of money and gave it to Australia's most wealthy companies (the ones with lots of employees).
I bought heaps of shit I didn't need this week. Just like everyone else. So, there's the impact of getting the resources to make it, making it, shipping it and deposing of it. No matter what it is.
