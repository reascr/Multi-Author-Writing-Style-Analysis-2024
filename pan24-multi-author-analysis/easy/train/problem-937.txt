I hate that we're still treating elections like a football game. The score predictions, the talk of hail maries. This shit is not a game. We are at the actual, no-joke, precipice of fascism. And there's nowhere to run off to. A Republican-controlled US that is aligned with Russia will absolutely change the entire world order for the worst. Israel is back with Netanyahu. Brazil barely scraped by. Orban keeps consolidating power. Italy elected an actual neofascist as president. Global democracy is on its way out, and a GOP takeover will snuff the flame for at least a generation.
Really? Republicans plan to fix the economy is always the same : slash taxes, cut benefits for those in need, hobble everything, shut the entire country down, lose to Democrats, then blame Democrats as they work to repair the catastrophe Republicans created, Democrats fix the economy, Republicans hem and haw about people who need help getting help, Republicans get elected, Republicans slash taxes, Republicans cut benefits for those in need, hobble everything………………..
