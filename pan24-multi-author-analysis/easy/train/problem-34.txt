The Nazi relationship with Christianity wasâ€¦complicated. Hitler, and the Nazi higher ups were not Christian. In fact, Christianity was seen as a threat to Nazism, and the end goal was to abolish it and replace it with worship of the state of Germany itself. But strait up abolishing Christianity was unfeasible at first, so instead the Nazis co-opted Christianity and christian nationalism to both bolster their own power, but also to slowly erode it to a point where they could eventually do away with it at some point after Lebensraum was achieved.
