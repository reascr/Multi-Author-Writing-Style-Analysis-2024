Probably not, but related anyway. The deal consisted of only 4 AIM-9X aiming devices and 40 missiles, plus practice and simulation missiles. So they're used to equip four Hornets with the missile, for the purpose of training on the missile in preparation for F-35s? That's what I'd guess.
Easy challenge, as an American: The American Continental Army won the American war of Independence against the far superior British Army, with utterly shit morale, the height of training comprising of a bitter winter boot camp under command a man who didn't speak the troops' language, a command structure that was basically whoever showed up (the head of artillery was a raised as a pacificist Quaker bookseller, and had never fired a cannon before taking up that post, whereas all British artillarymen were in a strictly merit based career track, for example; Knox learned everything he knew from a book), and woeful supplies (there were serious proposals to arm men with bows and arrows due to a lack of gunpowder).
