As a gun owner, making sure my guns are stored correctly, waiting for a background check, or having them taken away if I posed a threat to myself or someone else is TOTALLY FINE, and a very, very, very small price to pay to help ensure people are safe. Normal gun owners are NOT upset over any of these laws because they are fundamentally responsible people who know that with certain privileges come certain responsibilities, and having a weapon of any sort is a privilege. I don’t give a shit what someone slapped in an amendment two hundred years ago. No responsible human would ever, ever put an amendment over the lives of kids in schools and the founding fathers would be horrified that we have fake “patriots” doing exactly that.
These people who insist that that outdated amendment and their access to firearms be completely unhindered and that no laws should be made to restrict anything to protect kids in schools? Yeah, they are radical lunatics. They are the opposite of responsible. They are ignorant. They lie about everything to purchase and to keep their damn weapons in as irresponsible a manner as possible. And they are jackwagons.
