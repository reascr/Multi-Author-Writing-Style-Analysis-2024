Well that has very little to do with the high resilience. Finland has good resilience, since media literacy has been on base curriculum for decades. Not as "this is how you spot enemy propaganda", but as "spot what is advert, what is news item, what is opinion column, who owns this news papers and thus what motivates the writing" and "what emotional tricks is this opinion column writer using to try to get you to agree or to get angry".
influencing and propaganda resistance is a happy side effect of a program that started on grounds of "Maybe citizens shouldn't fall for cheap marketing tricks and thus waste their money" and "they should have at least basic skill to be critical of all of the political opinion columnists from all sides trying to bait them with emotional language tricks".
Right? I’m not sure how— checking the source of an article, considering whether that source might be biased, did the article cite their sources, can you find those sources, does the source say what the article reported it said, if a study was cited, in what journal was it published, who authored it, are there any conflicts of interest, and is the methodology flawed— can be part of a “leftist agenda” dictating what news kids read. Unless“just asking questions” about the veracity of a news source is part of a leftist agenda, that is.
