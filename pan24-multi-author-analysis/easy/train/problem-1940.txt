It's very hard to put a specific percentage on it, because (1) the USSR's economy was non-market, other than where it interacted with the non-Communist world (e.g. selling oil). It had transfer pricing within its five year plans, but they were literally called something like "non-price prices". So all you can do is see the output and try to make a guess at what it would have cost to make it in a market economy. How do you put an accurate value on shitty Soviet consumer products (main cause of apartment fires in Moscow was TVs blowing up)? How do you put an accurate value on bizarre USSR military sh\t like the Caspian Sea Monster?
Interesting article. Thanks! Fortunately, I was using it in a Mauser K98k and knew enough to wait on the hang-fires. It's still a freaky experience. Shot plenty of milsurp 7.62x54R and 5.45x39 (from sealed spam cans) and that all worked just fine.
Absolutely incorrect. There was MKE turkish .30-06 surplus that had bad years that blew up a bunch of garands last year. Brittle brass caused case failures.
Cosmoline. It's like wax and grease mixed together. I have 2 old rifles from the Soviet Union, an SKS and a Mosin Nagant. They both came to me wrapped in waxed paper and coated in the stuff. It took hours to clean that gunk off and when the guns would get hot from firing, they would drip and smoke. Took a long time for that to finally stop haha.
