"Due to the important interest of state security, I decided to suspend until further notice from 1200 on Feb. 10 this year traffic at the Polish-Belarusian border crossing in Bobrowniki," Mariusz Kaminski wrote on Twitter. Bobrowniki, more than 200 km northeast of Warsaw, is one of the main crossing points between Poland and Belarus. Kaminski also said that as a result of the jailing of journalist Andrzej Poczobut he would apply for further people connected with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to be added to sanctions lists.
The already tense relations between Poland and Belarus were further strained on Wednesday when a journalist of Polish origin was sentenced to eight years in prison by a Belarusian court in a trial Warsaw says was politically motivated.
I was born in that area. Ku≈∫nica and Bobrowniki were the main crossings. The last big crossing will be Kukuryki and Terespol and there were already MASSIVE queues there. This is essentially making cargo transport between Poland and Belarus commercially unviable.
M8 I'm happy to be proven wrong. I get my information from many sources and I don't remember where I heard it then (summer 2021), but here is a source from BBC that mentions the law I'm referring too. That was after the initial closure of borders during COVID was lifted in 2020.
