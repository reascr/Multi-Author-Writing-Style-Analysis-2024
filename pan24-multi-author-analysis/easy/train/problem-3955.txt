I heard on NPR yesterday that in the latest barrages there were rockets with inert warheads on them mixed in. Russia is (l think) claiming its to throw off defensive systems by overwhelming them...but it could also be indicative of them running low on warheads to attach to rocket bodies.
I work for a humanitarian organization. We're primarily doing capacity building here, which is training local people how to create data products for use within the humanitarian cluster groups. I was in Afghanistan before, and worked on projects for Syria and some countries in Africa as well. I also create automated tools for geospatial analysis that we provide to different working groups to help them lighten their work loads so they can focus on aid and not just spend hours clicking around in software.
I don't think so. The "fake" rockets that they are using, are real rockets, that were designed to deploy nuclear weapons. One might think that with a big enough blast, you could be less accurate. But, I am going to assume that when you are building these weapons, considering they are your most expensive payloads, you would build the entire package with the best equipment you have.
Really? You think so? I mean I’m an optimist myself, but my predictions are much grimmer than yours. Crime rates will be high af. The lads won’t go seek mental help, because “everything is alright” mentality(I really hope weed’ll become legal). Guns will be in abundance. The government support might be no existent for the vets. The country will be filled with some “Peaky Blinders” kind of gangs, enlisted with guys who are not afraid of anything, anymore. But we’ll endure eventually. There’s nothing that can stop us. Every time the power cuts out, I have 10 minutes to send 50-100 hryvnias to Povernys Zhyvim/Prytula fund or the Srg. Markus battalion before I lose the service. I really pray that this social responsibility among my folk will stay as habitual as it is now.
