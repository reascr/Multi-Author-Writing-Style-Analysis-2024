But yes. Most of the arrests were probation violations after the initial offense and sentence. Probably 10 were in a 16-month period. I wasn't out there doing crazy shit every week. But attendance at work/school (uni) were violations if I failed to be there and I spiraled hard after the first arrest and was eventually diagnosed with PTSD. So if you're not there (wherever 'there' is that you're supposed to be), that's a violation. "Pissing hot" (testing positive for drugs or alcohol--alcohol a few times in my case) is a violation. Not making it to your random UAs is a violation. How any of these are treated is basically up to your probation officer's impression of you. A thousand things are violations and I honestly don't believe that the system is meant to help offenders. I had some crazy thoughts every time I was in the clink and it definitely didn't help being around guys who were making some kind of life out of trying to be non-violent habitual offenders.
Interesting. 5 years for an $80 million dollar painting. But in one year, Walmart can commit up to $8 billion in wage theft total and not a single person thrown in jail or executed.
