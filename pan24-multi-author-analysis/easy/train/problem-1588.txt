Manchin doesn’t give a shit if WV is hit hard or not. He absolutely doesn’t want to set a precedent of congress giving more benefits to workers. He’s a capitalist through and through. He wants to set a precedent of workers going on strike, then being blamed for the economic fallout and then the government using force to end the strike. This will help consolidate power over his own underpaid and severely exploited workers.
Really?? Down vote that? Fucking spineless tools. You carry water for democrats without question?? Wow, well you get what you get. Dems are douche bag weaklings who couldn’t fight for anything if they’re lives depended on it. I hate democratic politicians. The worst of the worst. No fight, always willing to turn the other cheek like that loser, Jesus.
