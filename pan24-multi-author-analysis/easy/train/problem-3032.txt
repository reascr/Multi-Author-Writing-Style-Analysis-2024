America killed Iranian operators working to make commercial grade fuel, just regular citizens working a job, so that bad figures they disliked in the government couldn’t use the fuel in the future to begin making weapons. So not only does America force nuclear proliferation on others with force, they perform preemptive murder to prevent countries from achieving a potential means to begin possibly making nuclear weapons. They also completely destroyed Congo several times by causing wide spread horrors and instability to maintain a lie that US nukes were made with Canadian Uranium so competitive nations wouldn’t find the Congo source. They maintained control over it long after enrichment became available to save face… so America is a nation that will allow millions to die and suffer in another country to maintain a lie and not lose respect. Gross.
That's completely unrealistic. Nukes are here, and unfortunately they're never gonna go away, for the foreseeable future. We need to figure out a way to live in that reality, without killing ourselves.
