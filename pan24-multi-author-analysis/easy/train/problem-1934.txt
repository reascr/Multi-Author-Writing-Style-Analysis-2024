In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yuuup. I have a feeling many people will be defaulting on those loans and having their wages garnished. Going to result in a lot of evictions and foreclosures.

Exactly. This is my main argument when people say kids should just go be an electrician, mechanic, plumber, etc. with a good union. The debate centers around how much money you can make...but what if that career path would be torture to me? I can't and never would enjoy being in those trades. Good for people that enjoy that kind of work. But as a creative person that had a dream for his entire adolescence to do X, opting for a more lucrative career path was never on the table.
