CRT wasn't about the midterms. It was about getting control of school boards and dictating what is taught in public schools. They are the declining majority as younger voters lean left. It's another path in attempt to manipulate curriculums to keep kids from learning real history in hopes of regaining some fleeting hope of young republican voters growing in numbers. GOP has been at this for a few years before Covid. Covid presented the perfect opportunity to inject right-wing evangelical material into curriculums by controlling the boards that dictated what kids were learning. Once again the GOP is ahead of the DEMs.
Critical Race Theory? â€¦..Ohhh right, that thing that was the most important and consequential matter in the entire world for like four months, that was going to spell the ruin of our country, and is now soundly forgotten as the right wing outrage machine churns ever onward. The turnover rate for these absurd manufactured panics is getting pretty short.
