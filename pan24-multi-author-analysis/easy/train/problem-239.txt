That’s just a massive circle jerk waiting to develop. It’d be the absolute quickest way to ensure lobbying expands and vested interests become broader. Don’t let the fucks trade AT ALL while holding a political office. Did we learn fuck all every time this becomes an issue?
I'm not defending it because I do think they should be banned from trading individual stocks (index funds I'm fine with and blind trusts should be mandatory), but so it's not like they're doing any of their stock investing in secret, it's quite easy to see what legislation is being debated and is going to come up for a vote, often months to years in advance of it happening. I also think the reason Congress tends to do better in the market then the average "investor" is the average investor isn't as clued into current economic trends, Congress has to be as it's part of their job. So it's not like most congresspeople are doing anything that is nefarious because it's all out in the open, more so than everyone else simply because they have more strict individual reporting requirements (well, not as strict as actual financial institutions).
Nope. It was actually illegal to do stock buybacks until relatively recently. You can show some appreciation to Reagan and of course the republicans for that in ‘82.
Prosecuting insider trading is notoriously difficult. Martha Stewart didn’t go to jail for insider trading. She went to jail for lying to the FBI while they were investigating her for insider trading. This was at a time when people actually cared if someone lied to the FBI.
