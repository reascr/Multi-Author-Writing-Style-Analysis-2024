Also, the problem at hand is that McCarthy isn't extreme enough for some Republicans, and all the other GOP members are trying to rally behind the guy with the most votes. Suggesting the Dems put forward a moderate Republican will satisfy neither of those groups of people.
Lastly, siding with Dems here-- even in support of a mythical moderate Republican-- is political suicide for Republicans and they all know that.
Absolutely! Only way to begin to break the power of the insane 10% who now control the GOP. Pick one of the 16 who signed on to President Biden's $1.2Trillioninfrastructure plan and suggest if 6 R's join to vote for him, it'll happen and the crazy's won't get any important chairs and we can begin to actually have a Congress that does the Poeple's business.
This isnâ€™t politically advantageous. First of all, Biden has already passed the majority of the plausible legislative agenda that he had. The only things left to tackle are more progressive items that a coalition house would never pass. His focus now will be on foreign policy and appointing judges- which he can do with the senate.
