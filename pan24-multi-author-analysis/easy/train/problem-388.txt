Reach an understanding with a country that’s renowned for its neutrality? Are you reading what you just sent me? Look at all the foreign capital entering india or at-least considering entering india because everything is so tense with China. India would never agree to anything at this point they are benefiting from China becoming more overt in its goals. India needs china distracted anyway, otherwise China at this point could probally overwhelm them as you mentioned.
Similar population. Similar culture. Similar potential for growth. Bad experience with western colonization.
It’s either a CCP bot or a tankie. Imagine actually believing that a country especially China will go out of their way to “help” other countries when they won’t help even their own population. It’s clearly a power play.
Modern Indian government inherited powers and territorial boundaries from the British Raj which expanded into Tibet during colonization. China wants those areas back and has captured some areas during 1962 war.
