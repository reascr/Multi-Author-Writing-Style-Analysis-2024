To be fair republicans don't lose votes over something like this so it spreads way easier because they put no effort into stopping it from spreading. This could easily kill Biden's shot at reelection. If they decide to strike anyway and they actually go after the striking rail workers he will 100% be unelectable. He'll lose entirely too much of the two younger generations. Signing this in the first place is going to hurt but if there is no additional fallout he has time to recover. But that's a big if. I don't think this is going to cause them to back down, I just think they made this a much bigger issue than it was before.
Absolutely correct. I'm glad at least some portion of Reddit is acknowledging this. I hate the GOP and Republicans as much as I hate Democrats. I hate the divide and black/white political lines. We can disagree on many things but can always find some common ground. But if a republican president had signed this it would be plastered ALL OVER social media. No surprise it took me a number of minutes to find anything on Reddit about it. But any story mentioning the GOP's part in this was upvoted and awarded to the moon. Shame on people for their selective outrage. These workers deserve to be treated like normal humans and deserve their sick leave.
