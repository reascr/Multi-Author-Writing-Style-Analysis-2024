Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights law by the United Nations. - Wikipedia.
I think Burning the Quran outside of the Turkish embassy was a good idea done by the wrong people, while it showed that the so-called secular country wasnt so secular, it exposed how problematic violent religious radicals are and opened a discussion on these topics. It also helped Russia.
Also, you can't ban protests in Sweden unless they clearly intend to commit crimes or perform "hets mot folkgrupp" which I am somewhat unsure how to translate, closest translation would be something like hate crimes (literal translation is incitement against ethnic group, which this isn't since a world wide religion isn't an ethnic group). They are simply declining their petition for police protection. Stop spreading lies.
