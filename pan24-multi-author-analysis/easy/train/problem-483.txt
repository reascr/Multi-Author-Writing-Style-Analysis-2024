This system works really well in that Senators can slow down legislation by secret hold (or by an unwritten, arguably unconstitutional, rule called the filibuster), keeping the lawmaking powers of the House in check. The fact that all bills requires votes in the affirmative in both chambers to go to the President for signature or veto means that bills that originate in the Senate can be voted down in the House (and vice versa). The House AND the Senate checks the Executive Branch (including the President) in that all funding for the Government must be appropriated by Congress, as well as the power to override a Presidential veto on a bill (which requires 2/3 of BOTH chambers to accomplish). The Congress also checks the Judiciary in that, like the Executive Branch, the Judiciary's funding must be derived from appropriation of funds from Congress.
The Senate holds the power of advise and consent, meaning they confirm nominees for Cabinet (and other Executive Branch appointees that requires Senate confirmation by statute..ie law), Federal Judges and Supreme Court Justices. The Senate holds the power to ratify treaties, which holds the same power as law, so long as the provisions do not contradict the Constitution. Finally, the Senate is the forum for impeachment trials, where 2/3 of the body must vote to convict for a federal official to be removed from their position.
The House is what starts impeachment of federal officials, up to and including the President and Supreme Court justices. Any bills involving taxation MUST originate in the House (in the Ways and Means Committee).
