Felt like a refugee camp. Spent an hour in a taxi and was still inside the refinery ground, it was that dystopian. The workers camp was one of many demountable areas as far as the eye could see. Barbed wire fences, most basic of amenities, my kettle literally caught on fire when I tried to make an instant coffee. Meals left on door step and had to get them before the feral cats got into it. To call it ‘food’ was a stretch. This was during Covid too so weren’t allowed out of the demountable. Outside was 45, inside was about 30c.
Exactly. Did this guy know absolutely nothing about the place he was traveling to? Or did he just not believe everything he was told? Either way, glad to hear this guy finally left whatever bubble he has been living in all his life.
especially Europe? Is that not the case everywhere? East asia is like that, middle east, south asia, south america I have never been to Africa so maybe its different but I doubt it.
Unbelievable. Yes, he’s right that the US still has improvements to make. But how dumb/sheltered/brainwashed do you have to be to be surprised that most places in the world, including Qatar, are far worse?
