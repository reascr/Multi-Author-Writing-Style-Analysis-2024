No. Fairly-drawn districts will result in some districts that naturally trend Republican and some that naturally trend Democratic. That doesn't mean they were drawn in a biased way to artificially skew the district.

Colorado’s Republicans tend to be Regan neo-cons, fiscally conservative but socially liberal. Strong military, low taxes. Most I know are pretty easy-going on social issues like abortion and gay marriage, (CO is a leader in the country of reproductive science for the last 30 years.) Most Republicans, especially older ones in CO are more afraid of “socialism” (thank you Rush Limbaugh and Fox News) and higher taxes than anything else. It’s why the Tabor Amendment to the state constitution exists, which was approved by voters in 1992, limits the amount of revenue the State of Colorado can retain and spend. Specifically, TABOR allows the state to retain and spend an amount based on the prior fiscal year's actual revenue or limit, whichever was lower, grown by Colorado inflation and population growth and adjusted for any "voter-approved revenue changes." As in, the Governor can’t just change tax laws without voter approval.
