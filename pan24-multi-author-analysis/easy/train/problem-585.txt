Secret wartime files made public only in 2006 reveal that American GIs committed more than 400 sexual offenses in Europe, including 126 rapes in England, between 1942 and 1945.[76] A study by Robert J. Lilly estimates that a total of 14,000 civilian women in England, France and Germany were raped by American GIs during World War II.[77][78] It is estimated that there were around 3,500 rapes by American servicemen in France between June 1944 and the end of the war and one historian has claimed that sexual violence against women in liberated France was common.[79].
Not the original pre-war population of Bakhmut; in general, pro-Russian sympathies in eastern Ukraine have declined since 2014, and even of the Russian sympathetic portion very few wanted to actually be ruled by Russia; the way the LPR and DPR were economic ruins run by gangsters was a big mover in that. However, of the handful of residents left, Russian sympathizers are heavily over-represented, for obvious reasons.
Thank you Bakhmut. You've a fantastic run. You've churned tens of thousands of Russian lives through the meat grinder. But now is the time to rest. Be at peace.
It does seem like we are reaching a point where no matter how brave and well organized the Ukrainian army is and has been, they simply are going to be overwhelmed by Russia's sheer numbers and allocation of more resources and manufacturing to this war.
