Such a statement will definitely get Republicans to turn out because they'll see it as an attack on them. Even though I'd say the true fascists of the GOP are the ones in office or positions of power (the Matt Schlapps, Josh Hawleys, MTG, Sarah Sanders, McCarthys, etc.), whereas the voters, in some cases, are just people with layers upon layers of wool over their eyes and ears that don't see what they're actually supporting is wrong.
Not only that, my other concern are voters that would look at such a bold, albeit truthful campaign and turn on Democrats because that's "too divisive" or it turns them off because of insert excuse here.
Exactly. Biden has done a great job. Itâ€™s odd how easily people seem to ignore the monumental shitstorms and crises he has navigated us through. While continually bringing the country through stronger each time. He deserves a second term. Younger progressive potential candidates recognize that, and will not run against him if he chooses to run.
