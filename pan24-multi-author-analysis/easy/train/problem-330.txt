We all agree. But sadly our country is being held ransom by the 30% of wack jobs. Secure our elections. Tell Garland he wasn't hired to twiddle his thumbs and stall until retirement.

America is a plutocracy where money is protected politically. Legalized bribery. Govt. of money, by money and for money.
The process is often multi-directional, however. The House may pass a bill and send it to the Senate. Then the Senate may make changes or alterations. At that point it goes back to the House to reconcile the differences before going to the President. The Senate can draft bills but they still have to get passed by the House before they can be given an up or down vote in the Senate.
House and Senate are both needed to even get bills to have the potential to become law. The House can originate bills more easily (that's its job), but that doesn't mean the Senate has to officially vote on what the House sends them.
The idea is that the House originates bills, they go up to the Senate, and then they go to the President.
