Where some of this gets lost in the 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 14th amendments arguments (mix and match as needed depending on which law) is that these laws are a direct attack on the concept of judicial review. In Texas, the trial court ruled that since the law prohibits the State from enforcing the law, there is no valid State party to the case and it is not possible to enjoin the law even if it was unconstitutional. Basically, it ruled that there was "one weird trick" to prevent judicial review of unconstitutional laws which is much more threatening as a concept than any specific law (even unconstitutional, freedom-limiting ones). SCOTUS did not block the law pending appeal (which would be normal when dealing with such a radical departure from the status quo under a novel legal theory), so it is currently active.
It isn't inherently mutually exclusive. There a plenty of relatively reasonable gun laws such as universal background checks or no guns for violent offenders and non gun specific laws that probably do more to reduce violence than anything else. But states like Cali and NY are hell bent on doing the dumbest stuff, it's on them when these laws get struck down.
