No. I want him to face consequences for literally trying to overthrow the fucking country. This isn't a game. I don't want "infighting" between two sides both too incompetent to govern and then the party that's left on the other side wins by the skin of their teeth or somehow loses to woefully inadequate candidates. Excise the fucking cancer of MAGA and maybe you salvage a party with a person or two that's more interested in governing than lying, insulting, and not doing their jobs.
Exactly. Trump created the mold, but Republicans will move on to someone just as shitty as long as they are "winning". Trump knows he is in trouble since he lost that edge. He still has a chance for the moment, but he's never really been a winner.
DeSanctimonious was awful. Truly terrible. Firstly it's not coming from his brain, which is probably obvious to everyone but those for which it will sail right over their heads. Sanctimonious was not a word floating around in there just ready for a prefix. Trying to pass it off as his just makes him sound like he's lost his fastball.
