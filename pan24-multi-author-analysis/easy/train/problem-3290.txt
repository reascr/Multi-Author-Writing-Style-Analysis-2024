As someone who grew up in his district when I was younger came here to say a version of this. This district is winnable and actually contains some of the most liberal areas of the state. (Harrisburg City, York City, and to a lesser extent the resort town of Hershey.) Dauphin county is the only full country in his district has voted blue in basically every race for like 20 years or more. As a matter of fact It is the only county in the center of the Pennsylvania that votes blue consistently in basically every election for the last 20 years. It is gerrymandered, but there is no way to overly gerrymander it, due to the surrounding area in general. But for some reason it seems to be an abandoned district by the Democrats much like other rural areas I have spent time in. Only it isn't very rural it is actually mid sized population center on the east coast. So it is a winnable district and should be considered a swing district and one that Democrats should actually be focusing/spending on.
