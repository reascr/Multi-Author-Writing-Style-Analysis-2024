Even if I gave fraudsters all of the information required to fill out a loan application exactly like I would fill one out... they shouldn't be able to get a loan, get access to my bank account, get a passport in my name, etc. without me knowing about it. They'd have to go into a bank and look like me while carrying a sufficient forgery to fool a bank that identifies them as me, which passes all checks that the bank does. They'd have to intercept my mail. Somehow remove and then provide fake "official" convincing replacements of all my banking apps on my phone, without me knowing, so that I didn't know that notifications were coming through to my phone to confirm my loan. They'd have to keep that ruse up, stop my bank sending me alerts and statements, keep that information about my own account from me for 90 days, and in those 90 days somehow authorise a transfer from my account to another with no trace and using the 2FA and password that only I have access to without triggering an alert.
I hate it. I already have a full web setup running on my server, just give me the actual PHP files and let me use my already setup PHP/MySQL ffs. I have 2gb of ram on it, I don't have room for docker too.
Other countries use PROPER AUTHENTICATION. Not "hey, you copied the magic number that everyone has to use on all kinds of things throughout the year".
