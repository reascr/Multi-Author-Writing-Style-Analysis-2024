I think because the US is so pro-gun, they often forget that there are still those of us out there that hate guns. I don’t want to buy one, keep one in my house or even touch one. I’m a liberal and I realize a lot of Maga people are fully armed. I’m hoping the government and military (not local cops) step in to help us if there ever is a full out civil war type of situation. I can’t imagine ever shooting anyone. Part of my reason for hating them is I’m an elementary school teacher and I’ve seen what guns have done to our students and the constant fear they’ve created. I don’t want to be a part of that.
>Jason Stanley defined fascism as "a cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation.".

Exactly. Imagine accusing the boss of racial discrimination after they call the employee a racial slur and drop their pay because of their race. Now, under this law, if the employee accuses them of it (by suing them in Federal Court), this law allows them to sue that employee m for defamation. And even if it’s true, they still lose. Because they accused them.
