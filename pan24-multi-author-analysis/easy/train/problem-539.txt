things related to north korea are beyond right vs left. you don't know the relationship between the minjoo party and Kim's regime, so get your ignorant ass out of SK politics. NK spies have had free reign over the past 5 years because of a leftie president, NK defectors were forcefully deported back, and the left wing gave hundreds of millions to NK over the past 30 years under the "sunshine policy".
Like I've mentioned earlier, the Minjoo party (aka Korean left wing) has been funding the Kim regime with hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 30 years under the so-called "sunshine policy" and allowing NK spies to operate in SK during Moon's presidency unabated. Some specific examples: falsely charging an elite NK defector with crimes to convince him to return to NK to appease Kim Jong Un (he had to emigrate to the U.S to escape harassment from the SK government as well death threats from NK spies in SK), SK government ignoring over 400 NK spy reports between 2017\2022, refusing to accept NK diplomats in Vietnam who declared themselves as refugees to the leftist SK government which was rejected, so they were deported back to NK (and most likely executed), and many many more such incidents...
I'm not the confused one here. If you are going to say it's "beyond left and right" and then you use an entire paragraph shitting on one side, you have to be so little aware you're under the influence.
