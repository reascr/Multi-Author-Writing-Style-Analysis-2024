It wouldn't solve the problem violence, but we'd probably have a lot lot less firearm deaths if we had much stricter gun control.
But I also think that looking at it objectively, that very thought, can be a part of the equation that leads to gun violence.
But when I look at it honestly, as someone who can be as objective as possible looking to find the solution to the problem of the gun violence and deaths...the math adds up that the vast number of guns, and the ease in which they are available, are the significant overwhelming factor.
Setting aside the 2nd amendment (a big ask, and admittedly not just unlikely but utterly unfeasible in today's climate) wouldn't removing the ubiquitous availability of firearms in the US help solve the problem of not just mass shootings, but much of the general firearm violence?
I’m down. Let’s bring the Democrat policies to their logical extension. Can cars. Ban semi-auto weapons. Ban synthetic clothing that leaves micro plastics in our water.
