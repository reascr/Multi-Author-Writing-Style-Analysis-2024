1) Controversial one — Ukraine have the same problem as Russia. Corruption, tons of it (I even asked my Ukrainian friends - they proofed it). So….
Obviously this is just some quick maths and oversimplifying the situation but generally speaking, if it's for a country or a private person, investing money and putting the profits to work instead of just spending the money itself is not such a bad idea after all.
JUST DO IT! ya cause the damage, now pay to repair. Ever think about not only homes destroyed and whats in them, but cars and hospitals, schools, stores etc. Sorry Vlad, not sorry, ya got to pay, to play.
Ukrianian here. Yeah corruption exists (through I personally haven’t met it ) but society hates it and fights it as well. That’s why I would like those seized russian money to be handled through some kind of EU organisation, it will not only make everything much more clear for any of the west political powers and societies but also will help to integrate my country into EU system more. I think it will be good if there will be EU organisation that will be creating orders for let’s say rebuilding this building in this place, where companies from both EU and Ukraine will be fighting to get this order to be done. This will help with integration and also improvement of Ukrainian business.
