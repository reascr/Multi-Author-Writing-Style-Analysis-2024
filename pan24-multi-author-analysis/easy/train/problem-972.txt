Until enough people simply ignore them. Trump's ability to keep the base angry and vocal about that one issue simply couldn't last forever. Sure, there are some who continue the nonsense. But nonsense like the Big Lie only works as long as it keeps people engaged. The title of the article is a bit misleading, in that Kari Lake hasn't changed her message or her most fervent supporters' minds. The difference is that enough people are sick of it that the collective shoulder shrug means we'll finally get to stop hearing about it (hopefully!). The fact that the claim has no basis in fact is obscured by the claim itself. The truth was never an issue where it matters, and now that Hobbs has been certified and Lake has no options to continue taking up the oxygen she'll go out like a candle deprived of air. Even if she and her rabid supporters consider her continuing to "fight" it just doesn't matter to anyone else. We need to be willing to just walk away from the incessant bullshit. Acknowledging their screaming is giving in. Like a toddler throwing a tantrum, sometimes the only way to get them to stop is to let them just scream it out. Scream away, Kari. Scream away, Trump.
No conspiracy theorist is interested a theory such as: during the Regan hinted (probably through intermediaries) to Oliver North that if he took the fall he would be functionally rewarded. This is an uninteresting conspiracy theory to theorists because it is just too grounded in reality and thus doesn't create this sense that there are a select few with massive control over society.
