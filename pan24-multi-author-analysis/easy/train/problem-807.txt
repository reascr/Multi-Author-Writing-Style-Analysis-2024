I know this isn't a great source but my friend is one of the soldiers that man the S400's. During his boot camp he explained how some soldiers asked the sergeant where the prayer room was and the sergeant went to town on that soldier. My friend is a staunch nationalist to the degree that he is trying to revive the old Turkic religion of Tengriism. He says that the military is still very secular but high officials closest to Erdogans position are probably filled with his cronies who have had secular military training.
nope. almost 7k buildings collapsed(could be more). lets say each of em has 10 flats and assume only 1 person living in each flat, thats still minimum 70k minus survivors(which is not many since no actual coordinated help arrived in time). now we know that those buildings has more than 10 flats in general and that region has a tendency to have crowded families. when you add all these to that equation the approx result is horrifying. i havent even considered the ppl who went inside after the first quake and got hit by the second one or any other big aftershocks.
