It’s probably not anything more confidential than how world superpowers like Europe and China are constantly directly/ indirectly funding and creating terrorist organizations and rebel groups in the middle east to prevent the middle east as a whole from becoming another world super power, in order to exploit their insecurity to drain their natural resource reservoir to keep the economy and working classes in the more developed worlds functioning at increasingly elevated rates. It’s hard to achieve and maintain independence when all your countries/states/provinces are constantly ridden with wars and poverty because buildings, communities, and viable laborers are always being withered by acts of war/terrorism. This is also why you’ll likely see acts of terrorism by middle easterns in more developed worlds, some of these people are somewhat or fully aware of this and have become a little indignant as a result. Also, it’s easier to persuade members of the Middle East governments to become allies with particular political, religious, or military influences in exchange for services/profit, considering they’ would likely be absent of any power or influence without significant outside support. In turn, said terrorist groups and government officials are armed by external support and used to advance agendas related to extortion of more developed worlds.
Really? I wonder how’s the Republicans are going to spin this? They’ll do one or two things. Make this out worst than what it is …or make sure it appears it’s the worst thing any Republican ever done…. That’s not possible by anybodies standard.
