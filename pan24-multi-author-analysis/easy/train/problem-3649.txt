I would not be so sure or use such a "confident" answer. If you've been paying attention since at least 2016 then you should know republicans absolutely can't be trusted. They're all absolutely loyal to the party, except a literal few which doesn't make a difference and is basically a rounding error. And the party chose trump. They loved trump. They're actively rolling around in the shit he left behind and looking for someone to shit all over everything again. The republican party is highly concerning and actively looking to undermine the US gov for greed. Nothing has changed because trump lost. And 70 something million still voted for trump after everything. That's not a huge loss and shows how much support an actual wicked party has in the US.
Exactly. 2016 we all had our fun with our "Let's watch the world burn" attitude of voting in extreme Right leaders. The US with Trump, UK with Johnston and Australia with Turnbull (And later the horrid Morrison), none of whom actually gave a fuck about running the country they were elected to run. But we all got rid of them. Any of them come back, you're fucked and you deserve to be fucked.
