I think somebody who is a decade or two out of from their country is out of touch with what's really going on there in the day to day and following politics (at best the art of persuasion, not of truthfullness) isn't going to give you that - you'll just be hearing more and more arguments about things for which you have no context.
From what I've seen both with myself (having now returned to my homeland) and other fellow immigrants, as an immigrant one always ends up loosing touch with the actual society of one's country and following politcs there isn't at all enough (IMHO) when one doesn't really have the pulse of how things are going there in general.
oh what? Seriously? THIS is the direction of the topic? In Thailand Russians fight with Russians about Ukraine topic cause they can't do it within a country. I already know a story how guy literally got beaten for asking arrogant russians to not contact him as clients. Just focus on your laws being executed, that will bring more value then banning all people based on their passport, who might be seeking shelter from their "home country".
