Chinese government needs to show bravado in front of its people. It's part of their schtick: "You may be poor and living a shitty life but your country's super amazing and beat the crap out of other countries." We are talking about a country whose state news agency's nightly news would update US covid death count each day just to show how how successful their zero covid policy has been. And will always repeat over and over how they have the 2nd highest GDP in the world.
Including forced quarantine? Forced separation of children from their parents? At some point foreigners were totally barred from certain places like malls, hotels and restaurants, no matter how long they stayed in China?

Partially. Although the chance of a new strain are low because the virus likely doesn't have to mutate in China, it's still a chance it does. Especially given the wast numbers of hosts. Every country has the right to defend it's national interest, that includes protecting their citizens from a virus.
