As a person who studied in France in the past and is studying there now, for some older people or the snobs, it’s definitely true. In France, pretty much anyone under the age of like 70 can speak comprehensible English. But French people also tend to care a lot more deeply about their language, whether it’s because they don’t like how English has taken a stranglehold on it, or because they don’t like hearing their language butchered by foreigners. When I first studied in France, I only had 2 years learning French in college. Sometimes when I tried to speak and it was bad, people would quickly get frustrated with me or give me attitude. Or when I asked “est-ce qu’y a quelqu’un qui parle anglais? », everyone just shakes their head no when you know good and well a lot of them can understand and speak it. France stands out for this specifically because throughout other countries I’ve been to in and outside of Europe, I don’t see the same attitude. For example, someone in the Netherlands is not gonna catch an attitude with you for not knowing Dutch. And they all can speak English and speak it well.
Edit: fucking autocorrect turned experience into experieNYC... I believe i have figured out how to butcher english.
