The US Army is supposed to take possession of the first "small" batch of the new rifles with the appropriate ammo supply this quarter and they'll assign weapons to training and tactics teams to test it in full before officially ordering the remaining batch to replace every rifleman's weapon. Also SIG and the US Armory's productions will both feature both the high pressure round and a more standard pressure round to reduce wear and tear during practice.
