I often think the hate has focused on trans people because they're a small minority and outside the mainstream. A few decades back, this hate was focused on the gay community, but as gays became increasingly visible and organized, it was hard to put them into such an 'other' category. I would expect most Americans know (or at least know of) some gays and have learned they aren't that different from the rest. But trans people? Most people don't know any trans people and I'm sure the thinking is "An operation to change your sex, and boys in the girls bathroom, that's weird. And dangerous", so they make a convenient and distant target for people who need to find someone to hate.

Probably. MTG is pretty creative in her stupidity (let's face it not many people are stupidly creative enough to come up with stuff like 'Jewish Space Lasers') but she still just parrots the same issues that right wing media says.
