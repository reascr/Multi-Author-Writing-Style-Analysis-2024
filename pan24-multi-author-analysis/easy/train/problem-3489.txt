Bush winning in 2000? Was contentious because the electoral college was so close, it came to one state, and the events used to push Florida's electoral college into supporting GWB was inappropriate, underhanded, and Republicans have been gloating about stealing it for years. Even then, Gore didn't stage an insurrection, he ended up stepping down in less than a week. The contention of Trump's victory over Clinton, was not staged by elected leaders like Jan 6th was, they were peaceful protests. women in pink "Pussy" hats were marching with their familes, and on top of that, the contention was that even though Clinton clearly won by something like, 3,000,000 votes, the electoral college has been so biased by Gerrymandering and Republican Party redistricting that a person won the presidency by winning the right counties, and not the popular vote.
I don't recite any of it. It's a fucking flag. I don't pledge my allegiance to a piece of fabric, nor what that fabric "stands for." I love this country, but it's super fucked up in a lot of ways. I will do what I can to move it forward and make it better, but even if it becomes a perfect utopia, I will still not pledge allegiance to it. That's just super weird to me.
