I donâ€™t think they are destabilizing it. They are there to support the existing government. Destabilizing is more like starting a coup to replace the existing government. Which they are not doing.
none of these terms and descriptions are wholly accurate but its a general developed, developing, and undeveloped economies can be split into global north being more developed or developing and global south being developing or under developed.
That is in the cold war era. Nowadays 3rd world countries are considered the "developing" countries. In this case these Latin American countries are more developed than African countries we think of when thinking of 3rd world countries, but not quite to the level of the "western world". So we call them 2nd world countries.
socio-economics literature doesn't really deal with this, this is a political science term/concept. The 1,2,3rd world is dated but they generally refer to the terms Global North and Global South (with some exceptions like Australia being an outlier) in todays literature.
