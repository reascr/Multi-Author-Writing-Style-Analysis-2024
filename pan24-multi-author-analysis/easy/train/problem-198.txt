They are looking to the future. Planning. It's related to other things. Many areas in California are requiring new developments to be all electric - no gas lines in the street. We have gas lines here that are a century old and not well maintained. No one wants to pay to upgrade them. About two years ago, three days after a relatively small earthquake a tiny fracture in a line caused a huge fire at an oil storage facility. Because we have experts on standby 24/7 it was put out quickly. But the hazard is there and will only get worse over time. If a bill is passed it likely will nto come into effect for 5 or more years and will only be for new construction.
Whatever. They have been losing to Biden and the Democrats on every issue for years now. The same old ridiculous, fear based propaganda over something that isn't happening. The GOP has become stagnant and predicable.
