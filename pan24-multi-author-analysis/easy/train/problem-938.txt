But that's a win for the EU and Ukraine. Russia issuing passports in Crimea in the name of another land is admitting that they don't have the authority to issue passports in Crimea's name. This is not a "sanction" against Russia, but rather the EU saying "I don't think you own Crimea, so this passport you issued in a foreign Ukrainian city doesn't make any more sense to me than if you said it was done in Barcelona or Berlin".
20 days?! Jesus. I think mine took 6 months this past year. That's such a huge disparity. Wonder how/why the time it takes to get them can vary so much.
Different governments have verification processes? I mean, the US has 350 million people and is more or less the business capital of the world. Mine took around 5 weeks this spring.
Depending on how well local governmental offices were purged of info before they became occupied there might not be an accurate list of who has valid passports, so a hypothetical Ukrainian person who has a Ukrainian passport and gets issued a Russian one could just lie and say their original got lost/stolen/destroyed somehow or that they never bothered to get one before and keep their legit one?
