PiS is friendly with anti-EU groups that almost always are also pro-Russia groups. I did not mean to say that I think they are getting money from them or anything like that, I am saying that they are working together with them, that their anti-EU ideology trumps their anti-Russia ideology. You mentioned the propaganda, that is a prime example of what I was talking about. Helping Hungary, meanwhile, is an extremely powerful way to help Russia and undermine the EU, and that one isn't just meaningless some domestic politics to rile up people, that is actually actively and extremely effectively harming the EU. That cannot be ignored.
This is PiS smuggling their politically expedient conspiracy theory into what should be an obvious condemnation of actual stuff that Russia is completely responsible for. Unfortunately, the right-wing PiS is engaging in nationalist propaganda.
So? Can you not read? I am just saying that that is the basis as to why they made that declaration. Where did I say it is a fact?
