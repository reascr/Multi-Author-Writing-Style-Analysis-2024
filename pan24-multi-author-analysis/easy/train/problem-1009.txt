But isn't that a tactic to figure out the response time of your enemy? Couldn't the Russians divulge the capability of our response by how long it took and how far they could push before they got the call? Risky maneuver but if you were assured an enemy would have to call you before they launch a perceived counter attack wouldn't you like to know where the line is? Russia sacrificed those men in the first battle to see what would happen if they fucked around, well they found out. The second incursion was to gain intel and posturing, after they learned we weren't playing games anymore. I'm just an armchair tactician so I'm just blowing smoke, I couldn't really tell you what happened or why but you should always give your enemy more credit than they deserve. Russia is still a nuclear capable country and that should give us a bit of a pause before all the dickswinging gets started.
American-residing Pole here. Anyone who thinks we would have a "morale problem" while facefucking Russia doesn't know a thing about our history with them.
Exactly. Russians are starting to realize that they've been lied to. The more people who realize this, the worse it will get.
