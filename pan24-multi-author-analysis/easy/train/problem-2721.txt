For every three punches thrown in Georgia, it reduces your tax debt in Texas by $0.67 cents. It’s an old law on the books back from the Civil War Era. The Southern States were trying to figure ways to support each other while the Union Army was starting to get the upper hand and wanted to encourage citizens to take up arms against the invading North.
Lol. Kind of random but I wonder how he’d be against today’s college players. Still exceptional or just very average? Or subpar even. Things have changed since the 80s.
To answer your hypothetical, no, they couldn't do that, because most states have a residency requirement that is mutually exclusive with other residency requirements (such as, list residence in the state as primary residence, inhabit your residence in the state for a majority of a year, etc., etc., etc.,). But if a state does not have a mutually-exclusive residency requirement, then there's nothing really stopping someone from running for office in either. "Inhabitant" does not equal "Primary resident". Inhabitant is decidedly a much more general term, and while I'm not an expert by any means, I'd imagine they could've expressed just such a specificity back in 1787 when they wrote the constitution if they had wished for such a specificity.
