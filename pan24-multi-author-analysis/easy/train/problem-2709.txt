Billionaires don't exist because they own billion dollar businesses, they exist because they possess dictatorial power within the business and can freely monopolize all the profit that they're intentionally not paying to the workers who created it.
Yes I remember this. And it was was overturned and came to a settlement. Microsoft works with people to allow for competition. This was before Apple came out with the iPhone and microsoft was in the lead on os because they were really the only ones doing it since they kinda started it. Kinda. They were inspired by other creators. They also didn’t even come out with Xbox at this point and were the only business with a os that was dominating the market, since it was so new at the time. Since then Apple has taken the lead in os sales. Microsoft is still last os and all there other business ventures. So not a monopoly. And Microsoft had a chance to merge with Apple early on but didn’t cuz that would’ve been a true monopoly and they needed competition. Lol.
