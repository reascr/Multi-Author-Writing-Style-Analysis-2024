also, Rapper SamanYasin's death sentence could be carried out anytime soon as he has been moved from Evin Prison to Raja'i Shahr Prison. He's charged with "enmity against God" for supporting the Iranprotests & singing about injustice.
Terrible headline. He was set for the death penalty for stabbing an officer after giving out hugs and chocolate. Apparently the officers get a confession through force. He didn't take kindly with his knife.
Now, as this young man gave hugs and chocolate to people who were protesting the Islamic government of Iran, that means that according to the Quran they were fighting against Allah, by spreading corruption in the land, namely, showing support to those who do not agree with women being killed for not wearing (or incorrectly wearing) clothes women are demanded to wear by Allah in the Quran.
Change? People will literally give you their first born to die in order to prevent the "depravity of the west" from taking over. They'll cry about abuses , no rights and death for chocolates and then they'll roll the rug and pray, without skipping a beat.
