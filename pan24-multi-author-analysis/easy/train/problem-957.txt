The elections were rigged because we didnâ€™t win We resorted to violence to try and force a win. A few soldiers got locked up but our leaders are still free and still shouting from their positions of power we were robbed. We have passed laws to strenhen our voting system to stop all the cheating. So if we lose again we will use more violence and our leaders will demand they be placed in positions of power that they rightfully deserve. And by 2024 when Trump runs again we will not let you vote against him and will use violence to prevent his loss. Because we are American patriots who stand behind our flag and our constitution This is how things will go if we as Americans do not demand that Trump be held accountable along with rest of the people who tried to overthrow the government and be brought to trial and given the opportunity to defend themselves from these charges. If we ignore the fact they are not being charged and tried before a jury we will only get more of this bullshit.
