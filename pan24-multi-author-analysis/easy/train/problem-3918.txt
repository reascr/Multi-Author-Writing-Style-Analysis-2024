I quit cigarettes in college, used to drink like a fish and now only have 2 drinks max on any given day, and haven't smoked weed in 3 years, and I can still say the Internet is the hardest habit to break. I can't even imagine how I could have ended up if I started having access to these apps, sites, and devices when I was 8-10 years old. My childhood and teens was running around in the woods, shooting fireworks at each other, riding bikes, skateboarding, playing in bands, and watching movies on the couch with my friends without a single social media app or smartphone distracting anyone. I find it hard to imagine what growing up must be like now.
