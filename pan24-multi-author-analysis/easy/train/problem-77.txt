Trump also treats running for president as a legal strategy. He thinks that prosecutors will be too afraid of interfering in an election by prosecuting him, and he might be right. He can use his campaign as a stall tactic to try and delay all his legal troubles until after 2024, and if against all odds he wins, until after 2028 or beyond. Then the process gets derailed and has to start all over again with years more of his lawyers and complicit judges delaying, and a firehose of nonsense to distract, except this time with no Democratic congress investigating him.
If he can delay, delay, delay, then some of the cases might eventually just be dropped entirely as people lose the will to pursue it years after the crime, or the statute of limitation expires, or key politicans are replaced by allies who put a stop to it. And of course, he's pretty old and might not be around to face consequences anymore in 2026 the next time he's back in legal jeopardy.
