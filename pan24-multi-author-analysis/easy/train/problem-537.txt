The article referenced on the OP compared global warming to Ukraine and other geopolitical issues. The warning is simple. If serious efforts against climate change aren't met soon (or right now kind of urgency) then there will be a shortage of food and water in an unknown amount of time.
Forget about which is more important for a second, or I'd the claim is correct about food and water shortages. The problem I have and continue to have with climate change perspectives is that they make this racket about it being the most important issue to face the world and try to strike fear as fast and fierce as they can. It's just fear mongering at this point. Not that the environment isn't important, but I refuse to tolerate the level of fear mongering that is going on and that had been going on in climate change narratives. Infusing the idea that other geopolitical issues like war and instability of a government or instability of a society are less important than global warming.
It is. I forget which study it was but it concluded that the carbon footprint for having just one kid is almost 60 times higher than it would be if you never had kids but could take a long haul flight every few years, or eat meat for a lifetime, or own a car for a lifetime.
I'll say it again. Global warming is a rich county's issue, when we should do so much more for poorer countries besides saying to stop polluting the air.
Regardless how people feel about climate change, pollution is still a big deal. It's just not the biggest issue. Peace is.
