Funniest thing is - it was designed to survive a Stinger hit. Early operations displayed a weakness, which later on was removed (Stinger was detonating inside of engine. They added an armor plate separating both engines and drainage collection, so if one engine was destroyed, it didn't affect the second one and the plane was able to return to base). However it occured that Russian MANPADS are pretty effective against this plane - especially the later versions of Ig≈Ça. There is only one confirmed kill using Stinger in Ukraine (and that's due to pilot error in emergency procedure), but multiple kills using the Russian/Soviet MANPADS (yes, I know, Ukraine has more RU based equipment, but taking into account how many missiles were fired it's still crushing advantage of RU/Soviet systems).
How does this relate the thread? Well Russia was supposed to host this year, but because Russia fucked up (In a rather serious manner) it (The World Juniors) got moved to Halifax. Much nicer folks in Halifax. ) .
