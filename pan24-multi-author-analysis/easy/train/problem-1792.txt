When exposed to sunlight, the device absorbs water from the air and produces hydrogen. The hydrogen produced in this way could be used as fuel or for the long-term storage of solar energy, the authors wrote in the scientific journal “Advanced Materials” on Wednesday.
__EPFL scientists have developed a prototype of a solar-powered device capable of extracting water from the air and converting it into hydrogen.__.
Yes, I am aware of that. Imagine the air as a river. We caused great damage, by building dams, rerouting rivers etc. Why? Because our ecosystem not only cares on the amount of water in it, but also where and in what amount the water is in the system. If we start extracting water from air on a great scale and putting it back, by burning it, nobody can say, what the actual effect is going to be, because our ecosystem is extremely complex and can't be simulated in it's entirety.
Am I the only one who thinks, there's an unknown danger of extracting water from our air, split it into hydrogen, burn it in cars and expect everything to still be in balance, as soon as we do it on a great scale?
