It's against the law for Russians to adopt foreign children but this was eased in May specifically for Ukraine, it was also made harder for the Ukrainian families of these children to get them back. There's a register matching Russians to Ukrainian children, a hotline to pair them up, summer camps to teach them 'patrotic values' and the Russian families get up to 1,000 euros per Ukrainian that gets Russian citizenship.
I know. I was struggling to find a progressive talking head that has name recognition like Tucker and occupies that same space in the political infotainment industry. Do you have a more appropriate suggestion?
Unlike WWII, Russia has nuclear weapons and the ENTIRE reason NATO allies haven't gotten involved yet is because if any of us so much as send one platoon of troops over, its a declaration of war by NATO and its precisely what Putin has been trying to get because it justifies all the bullshit he's been spewing about NATO / America to the Russian people. And that will get him increased internal support, and drag every single Nato ally into a full on war. The reason we are arming the fuck out of Ukraine and supplying a firehose of intelligence along with the rest of Europe is because it's in everyone's best interest to see Ukraine end this war.
Ukraine fights and wins this war, Russia is fucked anyways, but the people will have a chance to survive even if Russia as a nation may be over, and Ukrain then joins NATO and takes the center stage as one of our most important allies. Ukraine winning this war prevents WWIII, a nuclear disaster, and will set Ukraine up for generations and make all this fucking death mean something. And Russia will become a weak shadow.
