Yeah its pretty bad here in the Netherlands with these people. They dont know wtf they are talking about do you have comments like this. These idiots are also active in politics as well and some idiot now wants to sue the goverment for the renovation of the parlement because he says there is to much CO2 emission while doing it. Hahahha classic man. This law also fucks up many new housing projects while we have not enough housing and more people coming in. Narrow minded foke.
Earlier in the year the government came out with a map about where they planned to reduce farming businesses that emit nitrogen, but forgot to give any nuances, so the farmers (and people that support them) got the impression that in some places 70% of farms would be forcefully appropriated by the government (with the implicit notion that they would not get full reimbursement), resulting in protests and small-scale riots using dangerous farm-equipment to force their way. Resulting in a split in society with on one side the environmentalists and the regions with big population centers (Called the ‘Randstad), and on the other side the ones working for or owning agricultural businesses and the more ‘rural’ regions that have a lot of farming.
1. 75% of produced food in the Netherlands is being exported, and they are the second-largest exporter of agricultural products in the world. So yes, easily. And this concerns mostly livestock farming, which is not even a necessity.
