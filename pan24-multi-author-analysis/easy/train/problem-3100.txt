Meanwhile, the most delusional MAGA types seem to be people, more often women, who retain a core moral compass and empathy for others, but have gone down the rabbit hole. They suffer from massive cognitive dissonance: On the one hand, they've been convinced that America and its children are under attack by "global elites," a nebulous group that now includes anyone who criticizes fascism. On the other hand, it's very hard for them to avoid the fact that the people who lead their movement—Trump, Gaetz, Bannon, Schlapp, Falwell, various insurrectionists—are sexual assailants, violent criminals, and/or serial fraudsters. Trump is a bragging pssy-grabber whose party pal was Jeffrey Epstein, the face of the reviled "global elite.".
In the redemocratization process, the military leaders passed an amnesty law, that pretty much forgives all crimes commited by the government, so pretty much all of the dictators, tortures and murderes in the armed forces were never punished by their crimes like happened in our south american brothers (go see Argentina 1985, a really great movie that covers the Argenitinian dictators trial).
