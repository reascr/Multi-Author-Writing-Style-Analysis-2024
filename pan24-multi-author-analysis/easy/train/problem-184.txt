I tried. I really fucking did. A group of six of us, four will be voting. One refused to register, one didn't do it in time because it doesn't matter to him.
Exactly. As we know from Donnie's suborning election fraud, he only lost Georgia by 11,779. Swifties could make a big impact in many states, although I'm sure she would take even more flack for endorsing races outside her own state.

Registration is terrific. But there still appears to be a huge gap between "registered to vote" and "actually voting".
In 2018, early-voting data showed a fuck-ton more young people were turning out to vote than 2014, and they did.
in 2018, the percentage of registered 18-29-year-olds actually voting made a HUGE jump...but it was still only 35.6% compared to 59.5% of 45-64 and 66.1% of 65+.
Still, taking that into account: 50+ has twice the population but around 12.5 times the ballots cast (75% vs. 6%).
