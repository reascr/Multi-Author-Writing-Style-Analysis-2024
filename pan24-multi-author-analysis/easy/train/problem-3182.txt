I suspect they won’t touch those already receiving benefits, (note the GOP folks phrasing comments as ‘we won’t be taking away our senior citizens benefits’), but will gut it for everyone else. First they’ll only allow those within 5-10 years of eligibility to still be eligible, potentially with increasing age rqmts for both early & full RA as well. Then, for all the rest of us working stiffs, (and our employers of course), we’ll need to continue paying the tax to fund those currently receiving until that segment dwindles off over the next 25-35 years. But don’t worry, we may not have any reciprocity of getting our own benefits, but will either a) get a check for 25% of all our withholdings over the years earmarked for an IRA, or b) be told we’ll get to claim 5% of our total lifetime withholdings as a tax credit deduction each year for the next 20 years.
I don't understand how they could even do it. Like 70 million people collect SS and Medicare that they paid into their entire working lives. If they killed the programs there'd be riots on the streets the likes of which we've never seen before.
