That has nothing to do with the law being unfair. You can argue about unfair application of the law, but by doing so you're sort admitting to breaking the law.
If a cop stops you for speeding and you're arguing that the speed limit is wrong in that spot - you're arguing that the law is unfair. If your only defense is that you saw your neighbor drive the same road the day before and not getting a ticket, you admit you have no arguments against you personally breaking the law. Sure, it's a problem if a cop systematically doesn't give a ticket to a friend for the same offense, but it's a separate issue from you breaking the law. Both things are wrong, but they don't make it right.
Anyone thinking Morocco has leverage over the EU when push comes to shove is either ignorant or delusional, especially after 2022 demonstrated the sheer institutional force the EU can bring to bear when one trade partner overplays their hand and threatens to destroy Europe by cutting it off from a resource it's supposedly impossible for it to reorient from.
