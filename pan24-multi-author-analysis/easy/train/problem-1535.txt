Had Rona once. Scratchy throat. That was all. Vaxxed. Wife and father in law had Rona before the vax and they were crushed for 2 weeks a pop. Not sure if it’s a blood type thing or what. I just don’t get sick in general so I have some kick ass immune system or something else going for me. I legit have never had the flu or any real sickness that lasts more than a day. A bad hangover is the worst I’ve ever felt. Having said that, RSV is no joke. It doesn’t travel like the flu or Rona but you don’t want it. The young and old are particularly at risk because it hits so much harder. Like life threatening. Just get vaxxed in regards to Rona. I’m actually considering the flu vax for the first time since I’m in the field having to deal with it. So many viruses hitting at once may even overwhelm me (patting myself on the back).

Never vaccinated. Covid wasn't even in the top 10 worst colds I've ever had (and I have had Covid approximately 5 times).
