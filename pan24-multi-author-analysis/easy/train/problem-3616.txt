Like all religions, if a core tenet of your religion centers on oppression, it can and should be mocked. Do you think that we don’t mock Christians constantly as well? It’s usually an intelligence check for people here, if religious they are either scamming people with mega churches or too stupid to be of use. I reality if you believe in your own personal sky daddy that’s fine, but complaining that people joke about your silly made up rules (that were made just to oppress women and keep them servile), then you may need to rethink your… well everything.
Name one. And don't say the US, because we still print "god" on our money and (unfortunately) only elect people who pander to the religious on both sides. Not having a state-sponsored religion is not the same as being an atheistic government, and realistically, the word you should have used is "secular," not "atheistic." Hell, I don't believe there are any atheistic governments in existence, because nations that don't have a state-sponsored religion typically value, y'know, freedom of religion.
