So, in short, supermassive black holes today are heavier than they should be according to previous theories. This is because the space that exists behind the event horizon also generates the same vacuum energy as the universe outside them, leading to the black hole just growing in mass from its own stretched space time?
Essentially, yeah. We may be able to explain them with other means and still have them act in the same manner they act now.
Repeat infinitely. A parent universe can only die when all itâ€™s children black holes die. But those children black hole can only die when their children black holes die. Potentially meaning that there is an infinite chain of dying children universes. There is also an infinite chain of parent universes going backwards in time. There is no end or beginning to the totality. Only the ends of intermediary steps.
Presumably vacuum energy. What happens in short is that they realized that the black holes grow faster than we expected by X amount, and it happens that X matches with what would happen if dark energy is vacuum energy, and the source of it.
Small black holes blow up (due to hawking radiation) instead of growing infinitely. It's actually hard to feed matter to a very small black hole because if it's not well aligned it "slingshots" away.
Perpetual motion machines are impossible. It's a constraint of physics. Energy _must_ be wasted in some way.
