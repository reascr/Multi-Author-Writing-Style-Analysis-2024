...Usually. The 3 day closing disclosure rule that took place in 2015 when buying a house came quite quickly, and software managing loans had to be updated. It wasn't a major process change - this timeline was already being met most of the time anyways, but putting a rule in place that it HAD to be met requires extra internal auditing. It was a fairly big feature that was implemented by some organizations as quickly as two weeks.
