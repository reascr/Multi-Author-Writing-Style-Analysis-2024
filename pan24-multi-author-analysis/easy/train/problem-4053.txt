According to the Ukrainian navy, on Tuesday there were 12 Russian ships were in the Black Sea on standby for combat operations. Three of the ships were armed with Kalibr sea-to-land missiles, which the Black Sea Fleet has sporadically used to bombard Ukrainian positions.
A total of 18 Russian warships and other vessels have been destroyed by the Ukrainian military since the war began on February 23.
Following the reports of the sinking of the five motor boats, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry did not update its tally of Russian ships destroyed by its forces, perhaps indicating that they were too minor to count or unconfirmed.
Right. Then you also give it land units. But that will take some serious AI to keep it on task. And fuel. Just make it so it can turn biomass into fuel on the fly. And why not make the bots look like animals. It will either camouflage them or make them look intimidating. How about make them look like dinosaurs?
Plus such a powerful radar would be a massive target for Russian Anti-Radiation missiles (their actual capability is irrelevant, just idly scanning would be perceived as dangerous by Ukrainian operators).
Seriously. They haven't offered up anything more than conspiracy theories backed up by the apparent assumption that Ukraine couldn't possibly be capable enough on their own they would need Big Daddy USA to do it for them.
