Thankfully you have no say in anything. Good luck with trying to disarm a nuclear power. If you can't think from your enemy's perspective then all is lost. Frankly there is a world of negotiation that should have been happening.
There need to be negotiations. Not on the terroritorial integrity of Ukraine, that is not up for negotiation. But for how the West and Russia can live together on the same planet in a way that doesn't put us on the constant brink of nuclear annihilation. Even a military defeat in Ukraine will not solve that. Whether Russia or Ukraine ultimately prevails if the only solution is force, we will be a hair trigger from nukes for decades.
Negotiations are impossible. For the same reason you say the existence of an independent Ukraine is considered an existential threat by Putin there can be absolutely no negotiated solution.
Hi. I suppose thatâ€™s a problem few of us in the comfortable West can really understand. Despite the bravery of the Ukrainian people, we only see the futility of the war, and can only see one gloomy outcome, however short or long term the war will be.
