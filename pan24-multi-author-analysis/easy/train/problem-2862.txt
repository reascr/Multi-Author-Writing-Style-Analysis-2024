The striking difference in coverage begs the question: Is this unprecedented Western rage genuinely inspired by Qatar’s human rights record or Western bias against Qatar’s Arab and Muslim identity?
But despite what Western media coverage suggests, Qatar does not hold a sporting monopoly on human rights violations. In February, China hosted the Winter Olympics while carrying forward a genocide against the Uyghur Muslim population in its disputed northwest region. The BBC and ITV both televised the opening ceremony despite the existence of concentration camps in the Communist nation and calls for global boycotts against China’s staging of the Winter Olympics.
While British outlets, including the BBC, aired programming highlighting the Uyghur persecution leading up to the Winter Olympics, human rights reporting from Western outlets largely slowed once the games began and in some cases halted altogether.
