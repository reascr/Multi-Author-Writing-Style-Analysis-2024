The properties would not be 'seized' out of nowhere without a legal process, and the crown estate would more than likely remain intact in some form. But the process of abolishing the monarchy, which would be a major constitutional overhaul for the country, would obviously be a complex process. They aren't going to just duct tape over the crowns on postboxes and leave the rest of the structure unchanged. Acts of parliament (which, incidentally, are what created the crown estate) would determine what legally becomes of all the trappings of the monarchy which, again, are not Charles' private property but owned by him by virtue of his position as king which, again, in this hypothetical is being abolished.
In what hypothetical situation would there be public will and a legal plan for dissolution of the monarchy which allowed them to retain ownership of properties they only 'own' and have only ever 'owned' in right of a crown that is being removed from them.
It isn't. It's independent. Abolishing the monarchy wouldn't get that extra 25% of income, and would lose the 75% income it takes.
