China is actually an interesting point because relations with china were improved in big part because of our questionable relationship with Pakistan during the Nixon administration. It's also what soured our relationship with India because during that time Pakistan carried out a genocide in east Pakistan (now Bangladesh). We tolerated (and financially/militarily supported) Pakistan's atrocities because they were our link to better diplomatic ties with china. The cold war was messed up.
while i agree with the quality of life aspect, the reality is that anti-western hostility is a revisionist interpretation of "century of humiliation"; IE colonialism was so bad that any evil we do is justified as long as it is against our colonizers, even if said country wasn't involved in said oppression.
You got me there! There was also the pro-US coup in Bolivia. You'd be very correct that that influence is still there. However, wouldn't the failure of both of these indicate a shift?
Interesting! I must have mixed up with rape victims or some other sordid stat. I checked in Canada out of curiousity, we're doing a bit "better" with up to 30% murders being done by family members, must be because other types of murders are lower.
