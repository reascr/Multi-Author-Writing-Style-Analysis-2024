Worth noting this was around the time of the FAST act, which required a cost benefit analysis of existing regulations- which is how the original rule requiring pneumatic brakes was overturned during Trump’s presidency. Important to note that the regulation was not overturned by executive order, but by the application of legislation. Means it can’t be reinstated by executive order and has to meet the cost benefit analysis— and research is underway during the Biden presidency to attempt to do that with regards to the pneumatic brake requirements.
See what I mean. you are saying that Trump breaking things has nothing to do with Dems fixing what republicans break, but it most certainly does.
Correct the republicans are complaining the Dems didn't fix the thing they broke in the first place after the Dems fixed it the first time.
So basically you blame Dems for not fixing the regulation broken by republicans after the Dems fixed it the first time?
