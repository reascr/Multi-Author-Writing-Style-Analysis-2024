That being said, I'm not surprised - the fallout from China's one child policy is the gift that keeps on giving. Massive gender imbalance, women that have no interest in marrying and/or having children because they fear it would threaten their career, and China's elderly literally suing their children over neglect because the traditional stay-at-home daughter (in law) is no longer there.
Like, if it works, cool. You get some tiny social clout. Mostly from traditional & conservatives not worth hanging around in the first place. Otherwise you're just... sharing like a good couple should anyway.
Disgusting. Just more pissy lowlifes that need to keep more than half the country back to have a shot at success. Their inferior asses cant compete. Lazy fucks would rather oppress billions than improve their skills or themselves. Losers.
It's still the best 'base' environment to raise a child is still between parents that are committed to each other that children can reliably imprint on, notwithstanding the benefits of living in extended family situations where both parents are still present, with the inclusion of other close-knit 'family' (not necessarily blood-related) members.
If it doesn't work, half your stuff just vanishes overnight. Quite possibly more, if there's bad blood and/or children involved.
