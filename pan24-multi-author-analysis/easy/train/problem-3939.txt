The Republican party, as a whole, has been pushing those ideas for a long time, but most of the politicians are smart enough to not call a spade a spade. They're willing to be racist so long as no one calls them racist because that's how the average person thinks.
For most of the conservatives that have more than a smidge of racist viewpoints, they still think they've overall good people- and they probably are. Maybe it's the dad who is a little extra skeptical of a black guy dating his white daughter. Maybe it's the grandparent who did something in blackface back in high school and never had to address it afterwards. It's the people you get along with well, and then, all of a sudden, it's like: "Wait, what?" If you call those people racists, they get super defensive because they \know\ that racism is bad, and they don't want to think that they've been bad people. They'll deny and give flimsy justifications for most things to spare themselves the realization.
