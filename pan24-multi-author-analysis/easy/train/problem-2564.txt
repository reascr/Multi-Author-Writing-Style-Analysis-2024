All of the chemicals involved in the spill are volatile and tend to evaporate long before they can impact water tables. Doesn't mean they won't show up in surface water for a few days (streams, lakes, etc.) but they all break down in a matter of hours to days so the water is likely perfectly safe, same for the soil is safe, etc.. What wasn't safe was the air in and around the area for a couple days before they had a chance to biodegrade to a safe level and anyone that came in contact (inhalation, skin contact), with the chemical in the first few days will suffer some level of contact issue.
i mean theres some nice prostitutes. went to mexico for vacation and the hotel desk person doesnt speak any english. they went out and got a prostitute to come translate for us. she also gave us her number in case we have any further issues communicating with the hotel staff or somewhere nearby.
