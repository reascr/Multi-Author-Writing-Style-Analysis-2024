Unfortunately there's no good way out. Putin doesn't really care about Ukraine at this point - he cares about maintaining power...and his life. And for the rest of us, the sad reality is if Putin goes we could very easily end up with someone far worse in control of Russia. The best hope might be Ukraine boots Russia fully out of Ukraine but Putin manages to barely maintain power, at least for awhile, so there isn't a sudden and violent conflict in Russia.
If they actually succeeded, even to a small extent, we're left with a Putin-like figure that actually has a competent military and might also enjoy the support of the Russian people, especially if he's able to play on their nationalism in ways Putin no longer can.
2. Ukraine doesn't differentiate between deaths and casualties in reporting, and doesn't clarify when asked. It reports numbers of "liquidated" enemy troops without explaining what that means. The US military, for example, also estimates around 100,000 Russian casualties, . Many wounded troops return to duty: killed and permanently crippled casualties are usually the minority in total casualties.
