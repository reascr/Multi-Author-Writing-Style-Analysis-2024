There is a lot of other ways that Ukraine could intercept those drones, don't we have something along the lines of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization of some sorts? If I'm not Mistaken Brazil is not in there. Don't the US has the biggest military budget in the whole world? Asking for a developing country that just got out of a coupe attempt and had an administration that was literally fascist (and don't even get me started on WHY he got elected in the first place, because that is a another story on its own, but TL;DR TRUMP) to send ammunition is like Asking Zimbabwe to help in this war. We are done with other nations messing around with other nations, we learned the hard way, 2 times already. But a question that I would like to ask is: Do you want the war to end, or do you just want Russia to loose? Or even better, can you make that distinction at all? If land is what matters then US could return some to Mexico too, that could be a demonstration of good will that could change the course of this war. The whole world was built on stolen land, and now you want us to join this madness because of it. big no from us.
A German manufacturer is currently building a new factory for this special ammunition. It will start production in June and the first batches will be ready for shipment in July.
