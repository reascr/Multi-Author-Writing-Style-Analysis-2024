Hopefully enough Russians who don't want a nuclear war will remain behind because I'd hate to think of what might happen if those responsible for manning their nuclear arsenal get replaced with fanatics.
What? No they won't. Russia has absolutely wrecked its military and will have very serious difficulties recruiting and training new people. Ukraine will not have that problem.
Well, kiiiiinda. Isolate and contain, and then figure if they're worth anything. Otherwise they're just pieces of shit who went along with this whole thing from the start, and bailed once it went sideways. Fuck the whole lot of em.
>Chinese government is forcibly removing organs from prisoners' bodies: Evidence suggests that is part of a systematic campaign against people Beijing classifies as politically problematic.
Oh definitely many were. My point was that not every single Russian is a fanatic, and as long as enough of those along the chain of command that would be used to launch their nuclear arsenal don't want to die it could potentially prevent a nuclear holocaust. If every single person on that chain is fanatically loyal to Putin it's far more likely that a nuclear exchange might happen if Putin ordered it.
