First, it’s not true. We want to be done with Putin and his regime. We do not want the destruction of the Russian people. Yes, they are brainwashed, and, yes, we find their support for this war unacceptable. But they are normal people who have been misled and we should wish them well. I wish them well. Even if you don’t, remember that it is in the West’s interest that a peaceful Russia not only survives but thrives. A collapsed, chaotic Eurasia will help no one.
I guess I just dont understand how people get away with not having insurance - I've switched insurance carriers and was promptly hassled by the MVA because of a non existent lapse in coverage during the switch and threatened to have registration revoked if I couldnt prove I currently have coverage.
No. Western elites do not want to waste energy on your temper tantrums. You can do whatever you like, until you are not starting a war. No one bothered Russia before 2014.
Victim forever. ... Vlad the Invader, invades Ukraine, the ukrainians defend themselves, and ...."Western Elites Want To Be Done With Us Once And For All"... but the answer is... YES! We want to be rid of "Vlad the Invader", and replace him with a democratic, rules based government....
