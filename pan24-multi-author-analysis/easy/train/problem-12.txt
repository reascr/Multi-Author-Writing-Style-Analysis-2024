Doesn't matter where the money is from, who it was sent to, or what it was going to be used for, even trying to evade reporting requirements is a felony and the language in the statute is very broad, "cause or attempt to cause a domestic financial institution to fail to file a report", "structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any transaction", etc.

I'm sure there's nothing at all shady going on.
