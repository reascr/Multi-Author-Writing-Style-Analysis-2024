I’d like to take this opportunity to remind everyone of Katherine Harris, George W Bush’s Florida campaign manager and at the same time Secretary of State of Florida. In her capacity as FLSoS, she purged 170,000 voters off the voter lists, under the pretense that they were felons, a pretense which was never proven and in many cases shown to be utterly false. Just straight up stole thousands of citizens’ right to vote. And the vast majority of them were black (and almost certainly democratic voters).
Interesting. So no matter how you spin it, the math shows that Republicans were in fact, the ones who were doing the "steal" they so badly wanted to stop.
Haha, terrific! Hey, I have a random, serious question for you. I remember in the 90's there was a song on the radio ("alternative rock" radio station) that was a kind of pop-punk song with the refrain, "Fucked it, fucked it, fucked it uh-uh-uh-up, / Fucked it, fucked it, fucked it uh-uh-uh-up." I can't remember any other words. Does that ring a bell? I've tried web searches but all I find are the dozens of other songs which have the F-word in them ... Thanks for any insight.
