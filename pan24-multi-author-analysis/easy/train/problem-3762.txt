Document and intel security is obviously in shambles around DC. We now have an ex president who screwed that up. An ex vice president who also messed that up a bit. But I don’t see how what trump did or what Biden did has any pull for someone saying “trump should be in office.” No, he lost. And trust me I don’t like Biden being in but he won the election. Plain and simple. These events really have no bearing on a sudden change of office. Or at least I would hope….
To be fair democrats were calling to impeach Trump before he was even sworn in with Adam Schiff was claiming to have solid evidence Trump colluded with Russians that he never produced, so yeah you can probably expect the Republicans to start impeachment proceedings relatively quickly.
But he was NOT "caught". His people found them and immediately turned them over. Then they searched other areas (his homes) and found more. Which were also immediately turned over. If he was caught it was basically him getting by himself.
