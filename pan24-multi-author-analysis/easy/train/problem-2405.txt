The people she worked with were very disabled. They couldn't work independently at all. That meant in order for them to work you needed at least one other person to help them. While some of these were volunteers you needed at least one trained person to help deal with issues that would crop up. This meant that you would have a group of maybe 2 or 3 disabled people and one or two helpers to do this task. This is a task that could likely be done by a single person about the same speed. Some of the people couldn't talk, some weren't mobile, and many had severe mental deficiences.

Exactly. We have vastly different health care systems. Vermont had a healthy one and Missouri has failing one. These programs have probably filled a void in social services. I'm hesitant to prefer the void, but it would be preferable to exploitation. The article didn't make it clear to me that is whats happening. Tough topic.
