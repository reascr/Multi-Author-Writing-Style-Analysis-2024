They keep saying pregnant women are waking up at 8.9 months of pregnancy and deciding they don't want the baby anymore and go and have an abortion. Someone introduced that idea into their news cesspool and it's been floating through the conservative bloodstream for a while now but any gynecologist will tell you how ridiculous that is. In the unfortunate, extremely rare case where such an abortion is performed it's because the fetus is unviable or has extremely severe birth defects, or threatens the life of the mother, but they'd still try to save the fetus's life if viable outside the womb. They're trying to tell women the sky is red when they know it's blue.
Exactly. They haven't changed their ways at all, only now they dislike the fact they lost quite a lot in a way. I was perusing the comments as well, and mentioned this elsewhere, but while some sounded sane and made excellent points about changing party ideals, they still ended a long comment with "Now let's keep the house and stonewall the Biden agenda." They're still in it for owning the libs and voting against their best interest. I'm sure some woke up, but plenty still haven't.
