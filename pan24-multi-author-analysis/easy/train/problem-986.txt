He was openly gay but allowed into the cool kids club because he was willing to persecute the red and lavender scares. McCarthy’s bullshit quest that was only ever a disguised attack by Hoover against the Dulles brothers (Eisenhower’s Secretary of State and his brother the CIA director.) never uncovered a single enemy spy and both Cohn and McCarthy were fully owned by Hoover. (Both suffered similar fates after being exposed for who they really were by Allen Dulles, who was a piece of shit as well, then promptly succumbing to their lifestyles.).
Gee I wonder if a guy who surrounds himself by a diverse body of both national and international criminals for photoshoots regularly, and owns multiple companies charged with criminal activity, is someone who might be involved in crime?
he does look like he has lost weight though. being the subject of dozens of investigations (civil and criminal) and having millions and millions of dollars in loans coming due is a hell of a weight loss program.
