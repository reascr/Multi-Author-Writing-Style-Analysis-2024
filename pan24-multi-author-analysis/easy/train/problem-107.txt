Its essentially safety theater but recycling theater lol. When I was a sophomore in Ap environmental studies we went to the recycling center and dump. That's when I learned how pointless it really seems/is. That was like 13 years ago now I think and we obviously often discussed climate change pollution and how we were gonna run out of time and I don't think things have improved much. Its weird growing up ppl constantly telling you the worlds in danger, rainforest are being destroyed then you grow up and those are issues as much as they were talked about, are never addressed and now things seem to be at that breaking point and I think most of us have just become numb. Whatever Happens for exactly the reason stated in a comment up top and even urs. Corporations and government who can actively make change anything have decided to ride the Bitch that is profit straight to hell instead.
Exactly. Climate change is barely a scratch for the earth. For us though? Itâ€™ll kill all of us but in 1000 years earth will be back to pre industrial era.
Because apperantly (?) Economic growth is more important then saving the planet.. i think the people ignoring this issue are betting they will die before it gets to bad.
