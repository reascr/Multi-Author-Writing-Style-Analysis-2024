what about all thise high attitude balloons that these scientists keep sending up? do they ever recover them or do they just keep floating about the stratosphere and are forgotten after they got what data the needed??
Hardened or reinforced Mylar films are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as electrical insulation, packaging, aerospace, and industrial applications, where high strenh and durability are required.
How do we not know what they are? We know at least that they’re balloons, right? We at least do a fly by first? We’re not gunning down Mothra and being like “fuck was that?” Are we?
Some examples of reinforced Mylar films include Mylar® RL (reinforced laminate), which features a layer of aluminum foil sandwiched between two layers of Mylar film for added strenh and puncture resistance, and Mylar® CR (clear resist), which is a clear, heat-stabilized film with improved resistance to abrasion and chemicals.
Could be. A metallic skin would potentially be more durable in case of a rough trip across the ocean, and be able to handle a higher pressure differential -- and thus more lift from a smaller balloon.
