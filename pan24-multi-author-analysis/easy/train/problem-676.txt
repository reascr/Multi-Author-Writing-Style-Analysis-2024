In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly. There’s no way to enforce “promises” made for a deal. Kevin failed to keep these petulant children disciplined for the last 2 years and now he is getting to deal with the consequences. These petulant children are arrogant chaos and media junkies. There’s nothing that Kevin can get them to satisfy the fix they want.
Dealing with national issues takes experience, which is why seniority is a significant determinate in committee appointment. Without a track record of experience, every House session leads to showmanship personalities instead leadership (showmanship is what is driving these radical rights).
Yeah, well. Republicans thought it was a worthwhile risk to help elect a bunch of white nationalists fascists just to maintain a majority. They fucked around and now they found out. They WANT the government to stall and fail so they can point to it failing and yell "SEE THIS IS HOW PATHETIC AND USELESS GOVERNMENT IS!". Nevermind the fact that they're saying this as they chop the legs off of government, that doesn't matter to the people they care about.
