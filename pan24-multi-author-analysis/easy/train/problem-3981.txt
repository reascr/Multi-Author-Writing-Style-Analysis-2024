Did he actually say anything at the rally or was it on a teleprompter for the crowd to read? Like I get it. he had a stroke. sucks for him. I wouldn’t want someone with his kind of brain damage operating a tech support line. I wouldn’t want a blind person driving a tractor trailer. Why is it ok and wanted for this guy to represent a state in the federal government? We somehow elected a walking corpse to president. I’ve seen people who move like him in senior centers getting their free cake and coffee and shuffle dancing to some old music. I don’t picture any of them leading a country but the spite “not trump” vote prevails. Hopefully the supermajority is lost today so his handlers can be leashed for 2 years and we stop giving away money and forgiving debt.
REALLY…. You inner city folks love it yourself. Stay Woke. The left is absolutely not quite. Who are you kidding. Most of us grew up staunch democrats as our fathers were until the radicals took over the party. Again, hate most of the personalities on both sides but do your research on the issues.
