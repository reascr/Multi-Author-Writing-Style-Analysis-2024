I'm still crossing my fingers for Caraveo in CO-08 too. If we get both Boebert and Caraveo, we've got 6/8 of our House seats blue, plus both senators and the governor (and maintaining a trifecta in the state legislature). Definitely happy to be living in this state right now.
The same thing happened with the 2020 Presidential race in Arizona; you might remember Fox News calling Arizona for President Biden much earlier than everyone else (and that causing them problems as it effectively called the election for him); they did so because at the time Biden was ahead by more than the outstanding number of votes - but that was an underestimate, and the election got much closer.
Only way they can win. This so-called red wave, more like ripple, was mostly due redistricting in Florida. Even though the house was lost, overall, this is a bad signs for gop. Canâ€™t wait to grab the popcorn and watch trump and DeSantis go at it.
