Which makes me think about how an individual drug may have a prominent effect on one country, but be irrelevant to another. It seems to add a unique layer to the complexity of every country restricting, or not restricting certain drugs. It seems like there needs to be a data driven analysis in each country about the specific drugs that are the most prevalent and cause the most deaths/damage to the citizenry. With this information there could be a lot more targeted drug enforcement which would also lighten the load on law enforcement, which would lead to significantly less effort/money spent on arresting low level offenders that consume non-targeted drugs, and there would also be a significant budget surplus to provide way more training to police officers that were basically all detectives that could effectively pursue the “real” crimes while also adding a significant workforce of mental health advocates and advisors that would reduce the overall workload of an individual police officer.
5. ﻿﻿﻿Racism, apathy, and other forms of bias that stifle scrutiny and prejudice many lawsuits and other attempts to counter or remediate police misconduct.
Great. But this does nothing for the complete lack of accountability for the cops who purposefully ESCALATE. No amount of deescalation training can fix a lack of accountability, leading to a feeling of invincibility/free reign.
