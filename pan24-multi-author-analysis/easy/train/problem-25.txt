It's also worth noting that our 5th gen aircrafts are invisible to Russian AA systems (S300 can't do jackshit against F35) and even 4th gen is already going to be very dangerous to them. Russia never truly felt threatened enough to invest in any seriously effective defensive systems. It is NOT a part of their doctrine (nor do they even have funds to develop a decent aircraft, their greatest super prototype so-called-5th-gen-airplane has 1000x radar signature of F35, it's barely better than F16 from 1980s). I have to doubt their AA capabilities since they frankly speaking never had to test them on anything better than their own shit. I mean, the very fact that few months ago two helicopters could just fly into Russia, bomb Belgorod fuel depot and fly away without giving a fuck tells you a lot about Russian air defense quality - it's most likely extremely limited and only applies to most vital areas.
Are they racist? Xenophobic? Extreme nationalist? They are not. They're shitty, but let's not paint them like the Nazi Party yeah?
