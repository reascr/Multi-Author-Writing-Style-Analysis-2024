Yes, I meant US would enforce a no fly zone for Israel's attack on Iran. Sorry if I wasn't concise.
Assyria and neo-Babylonia were based in modern Syria + Iraq (and have absolutely nothing to do w/ Iran / Persia), and, while (both) incarnations were deeply traumatic and impactful incidents for the local Israeli political caste and development of the Jewish religion (and arguably, the principal development that makes judaism and even christianity / islam what it is today), could quite literally be summed up as that 'for me it was a tuesday' meme from assyria and neo-babylon's perspective, lol â€“ to call that a religious battle between Israel and the empires that conquered it would be pretty hilarious to anyone except the Israelis / Judeans.
What?! Iran has death squads around the globe, Iran is a main destabilizing force all across the Middle East: Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Turkey, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, and now it is the main supplier of weapons to Russia in Ukraine, Iran supports extremism across the Muslim world and is the main supporter to the most totalitarian regimes from North Korea to Syria. Iran with nuclear weapons would be a huge threat to any western and moderate Muslim country.
