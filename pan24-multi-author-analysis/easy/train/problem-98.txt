What is with this obsession over balance or "global equilibrium"? What good is that balance if achieving it means accepting deep immorality? Doesn't the world need justice instead of this bullshit?
Understandable. Whilst I donâ€™t think Kissinger himself flew down to Cambodia to go on a murder spree, the mere fact he hand waved a genocidal regime was moreso to prove his word should mean nothing in terms of diplomacy, especially when talking about Ukraine/Russia.
Reminder for those who slept through history class: Kissinger is responsible for upward of millions of deaths in South East Asia, when he pushed the incendiary bombing campaign against Laos and supported the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
yup. the borders the Russians signed on for and promised not to invade Ukraine if they surrendered their nuclear stockpile.
This is absolutely, unequivocally untrue. In fact he _lenhened_ the war by undermining LBJ's attempts to end the war before the 1968 election so that Nixon could run on ending the war instead.
