The language is vague. Growing is decriminalized. So does that mean a yield over a certain volume is punishable? Why not just say legal? Perhaps it’s a distinction of marketable product vs personal use. Would love to read the bill but I’m too lazy to find it ATM.
Different for everybody. Aside from actually eating the God damned things, it was always my favorite drug. I can tell you that one time my buddy was driving us, but didn't realize he was driving. I don't know how that worked, but it made sense at the time. Personally, I always had a period after taking them where I was unable to speak. I knew what I wanted to say, but I'd just speak gibberish. That always fascinated me.
Let’s differentiate between legalization and decriminalization. Use of psilocybin and other psychedelic chemicals are not yet legal in Colorado. These chemicals are now legal for use in a controlled setting.
