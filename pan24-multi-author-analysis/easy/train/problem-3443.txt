In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Eh. Obviously that's true, in a perfect and sane world. But all Republicans, politicians, voters, and talking heads alike, blame Democrats for every. single. shortcoming this country has ever faced. That will be no different.
“budget sequestration”, the House side of the 2013 budget deficit crisis, not passing Hurricane Sandy relief right away, suing President Obama for not penalizing companies that failed to provide health insurance for employees while after having pushed to delay that part of the ACA, held repeated votes to repeal the ACA and then gut its budget, going hardline against the LGBTQ community, opposed coal-fired power plant emissions regulation, and supporting/voting for TARP but then opposing all recession stimulus plans proposed by President Obama.
Sure. It means they won't be able to muster the votes to pass performative legislation, such as the Obamacare repeal you mentioned. It means no Biden impeachments. It means no debt ceiling hostage crisis. It means no nationwide ban on abortion.
