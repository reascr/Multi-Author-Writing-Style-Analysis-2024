There are about 7,000 uncounted ballots and 5,000 of them are mail-ins. There are another 500 which are undergoing signature verification. Also, this is going to trigger an automatic recount whichever way it goes as it will be within half a percent. I wouldn't say that any outcome is more likely at this point. It's just too close.
As a household, myself and my roommates sat around the table at dinner and went through the booklet, googled people, discussed the pros and cons and tried to read between the lines the best we could, debate the bigger picture and make sure not only were we putting D's forward but that we knew a little bit about each one of them and determine to some degree we actually liked them as a democrat to represent the party. We had good food, tried to make good choices, and in the end we all voted and dropped the ballots off without drama days before the election. We then all shared screenshots of emails that our ballots arrived, and again when they were counted. We enjoyed the process of voting in Colorado and look forward to doing it again.
