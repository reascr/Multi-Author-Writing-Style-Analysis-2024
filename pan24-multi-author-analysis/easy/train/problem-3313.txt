Why do we have to assume pleather is just thrown away while leather is responsibly disposed of? I get that there's a micrplastics issue, but that is not the case for all vegan leathers. It's not like leather is a necessary thing in most of the places it is used, so it's not really an either-or scenario. It's not like pleather is the only place plastic is used, either.
In March 2013, Charity Navigator issued a Donor Advisory advising that "the majority of the Center for Consumer Freedom's program expenses are being directed to its CEO Richard Berman's for-profit management company, Berman and Company". The Chicago Tribune depicted CCF as an organization that "employs razor-sharp wit and unconventional tactics." Berman and Company does not publicly name its clients; 60 Minutes obtained a list of companies that funded the Center for Consumer Freedom in 2002. Among the parties named were The Coca-Cola Company, Tyson Foods, Outback Steakhouse, Wendy's International, Inc., Brinker International (parent company of Chili's and Macaroni Grill), Arby's, Hooters, and Red Lobster.
