Itâ€™s a noble idea, but right and wrong take a different meaning in a war Zone. My father was the most humanistic progressive man I ever knew, yet when he hit the beach in Iwo Jima, no matter how much he never wanted to kill a human, he shot and killed Japanese soldiers. He kept photos out of the pocket of the first man he knew he killed hoping to one day return them to his family and apologize. But with all his guilt and horror that he killed another human, he carried on and shot many more. Life and death changes how you operate, regardless of your morals.
Not necessarily. Blowing up the damn intentionally is a textbook war crime but now they just have recklessly damaged the dam when blowing up the road on top of the dam. It could still be a war crime (due to reckless endangerment), but I would not say it is "textbook".
I would not say it is terrorism, but it is very likely a war crime. Targeting valid military targets (in this case a road which has potential military use for Ukraine) near a dam is a war crime if there is a risk that attack destroys the dam.
