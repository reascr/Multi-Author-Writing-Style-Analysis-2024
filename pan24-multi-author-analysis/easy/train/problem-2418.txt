I don't barely know about the dude. It's just a popular quote in the American Holocaust Museum. But yes, you literally restated the poem. It's not just a warning to other fascists, It shows everyone that a fascist government doesn't care about you, and never will. It only benefits the people at the absolute top.

Authoritarian regimes of old always had their organizational and technological limits. People still maintained a level of freedom because the state couldnâ€™t fully and completely dominate the lives of all its citizens, and the enforcement was always done by people; people who had to be appeased and some of whom have a conscience that could be appealed to if the repression got too brutal. You could automate the oppression (Elysium), or give a smaller and smaller number of oppressors more power through technology and organization, which North Korea seems to do with its expansive spying networks and constant and inescapable propaganda.
