Some poor Russian Bloke just going about his business when all of a sudden poof! 5th story window appears out of nowhere He tries to run, but the window is simply too fast, and as he tries to flee, desperately looking back over his shoulder, he trips over something and realizes too late that he’s run straight into the cursed window. He falls five stories… somehow. Splat.
Okay, so I think we all know that at least SOME of these high profile Russian deaths are actually assassinations, but I'm curious: how does it actually compare to other countries with similar populations? If we looked at lists of dead American and Chinese businessmen/politicians/military staff, would we see anywhere near this kind of Russian list (proportionate to population) or is it as bad as the headlines make it appear?
They know. That's the point. These methods are supposed to be obvious enough that it sends a message/threat to others that may speak out but not an overt execution so that they can maintain plausible deniability. It's like a mob hit.
