I thought this was about getting sick time. Which is fucking ridiculous. It's 2022. This is a major union. Give the workers sick time. There, done. Ownership eats the expense. That easy. Don't care about the hit on the bottom line. That's what the owners and investors need to deal with. If they wish to hire scabs who will work for less, go for it. See what happens. That's how this works.
Here's the thing: favoring intervention can mean anything from nationalizing the entire rail network and giving all rail workers the standard government worker benefits including paid sick time and time and a half for overtime to forcing the workers to accept the status quo with mandatory overtime and no sick days.
Uh. This is a stupidly worded question. People who want congress to union bust and people who want congress to force the corporations to capitulate to the labor demands would both answer yes to this question as it's worded. It's worthless.
