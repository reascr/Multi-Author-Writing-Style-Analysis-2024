I'm talking about the regular, every day citizens. They actively do think that way. When you oush them about the deaths of women or subsequent infertility or unreasonable hospital bills, it inevitably falls to "It's God's will" or "they should've been more responsible with their body/money/health/"insert BS topic here". I say this because I've seen it way too often across social media, where I live, and in my family/(former) friends. Politicians will specifically tout removing ALL acess to abortion and people eat it up - they may not be the actual majority in the country, but they're voting in enough numbers to be very dangerous otherwise politicians would NEVER get this far.
2. The mainstream argument I hear is something along the following lines: Abortion is murder, and women need to take personal responsibility to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Do you think they are lying when they imply they care about the murder of a fetus? I donâ€™t know how you can so confidently claim that.
