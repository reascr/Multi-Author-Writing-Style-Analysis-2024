Another reason is that the German army wasn't actually that mechanized. They still relied heavily on horse drawn logistics. And well there are gas mask for horses, its difficult to get them to move once they are on.
Oh definitely, i used the religious tolerance thing as an example because religious intolerance usually comes with cultural intolerance especially with how integrated culture and religion were back then. Religion back then was a wayyy different beast than it is now, people of different religions often genuinely believed other religions gods were true, they just thought the ones they worshipped we're better. Ancient religion is incredibly fascinating.
I get what he's saying. By those same lights, the Mongols were pretty tolerant -- you just had to get past the notion of absolute submission to their rule. Mongols allowed religious freedom, you could do whatever you wanted so long as nothing interfered with their rule. They weren't trying to religiously convert people. Likewise, even the bible talks about how the Romans had temples to every god. The problem they had with the Jews is they refused to submit properly.
