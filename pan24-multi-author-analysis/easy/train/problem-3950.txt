Yeah, I often heard locals disparaging people who moved there. Guess I blended in enough to hear this. I wanted to tell them that my husband and I were both recruited for jobs that required graduate degrees because there weren't enough educated local people to fill them, but I kept my mouth shut. Bless their hearts.
What Republicans running Herschel Walker is about, in fact, is them believing black voters are of such low intelligence that they can put up someone as stupid and of such low integrity as Walker against a quality candidate and Senator like Raphael Warnock, and it won’t matter to black voters as long as he’s on the Republican ticket and looks like them, and that they remember him from football. That’s the truth here, that’s the ugly cynicism that the GOP tried to weaponize with this candidacy. For Graham to turn that around and cry crocodile tears about “silencing black people” or whatever the fuck… get out of here with that garbage.
