I'm comparing Republican voters to Democratic voters and the way they try to argue their positions. Republicans use emotional manipulation, assuming that it works because it worked on them, and Democratic voters try to use reason, logic and evidence to persuade Republican voters, who do not value reason, logic or evidence. I'm not talking about conspiracies or projection, but obviously projection has become their deliberate strategy and it's upsetting how effective it is.
Hi I'm Dan with Amazon customer support. A hacker has stolen your account and has already purchased 2 iPhones. I can stop the hacker, but first I need you to login and give me a payment. Can you please send me a payment of $500 in Gift Cards.
Democratic organizations. I delete anything thatâ€™s full of capital letters, tons of exclamation points, and different colored fonts. Anything that attempts to appeal to emotion rather than just facts and policies.
