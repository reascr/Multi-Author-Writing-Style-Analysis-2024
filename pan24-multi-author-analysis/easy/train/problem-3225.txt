“I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races—that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermingling with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior. I am as much as any other man in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.”.
Seriously. I may have voted Republican 8 years ago because I wanted “lower taxes” but I will absolutely never vote R again in my lifetime. I’m not the only one either. I come from a purple state and many in my circle of friends feel the same way. Republicans won’t attract independent voters for a very long time.
