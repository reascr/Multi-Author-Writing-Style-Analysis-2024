In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Republicans criticize. Full stop. This is all they do. They have no solutions, no answers, just partisan bickering, and trying to get their mugs on TV with juvenile reality TV stunts. These are not serious lawmakers. I wish we had a way to track what they actually do for the country, a running tally, and a way to broadcast it everywhere. It really needs to be matter that these people are doing nothing for the country.

Biden completely flip and give the republicans everything they ever wanted and the republicans would immediately, and without missing a beat go full communist and vehemently deny ever having any other political stance.
