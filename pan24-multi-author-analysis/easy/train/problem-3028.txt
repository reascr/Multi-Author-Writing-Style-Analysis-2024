The damage impacts of the scenario earthquake were estimated using both HAZUS-MH and expert opinion through 13 special studies and 6 expert panels, and fall into four categories: building damages, non-structural damages, damage to lifelines and infrastructure, and fire losses. The magnitude 7.8 ShakeOut earthquake is modeled to cause about 1800 deaths and $213 billion of economic losses. These numbers are as low as they are because of aggressive retrofitting programs that have increased the seismic resistance of buildings, highways and lifelines, and economic resiliency. These numbers are as large as they are because much more retrofitting could still be done.
Edit: corruption leads to poor building standards/bribes when a building needs to be up by a certain date but safety inspections aren't complete/cheaper materials used when compared to suggested standards/forged papers, again hindering building security/falsified quality of materials/falsified quality of supports used in those buildings/etc.
