I think what people overlook is when Trump hit the scene most Conservatives were fed up with what they consider “career politicians”, they craved an outsider. Most of the candidates who ran were what their voters considered RHINO’s so when an outsider came along and roasted and attacked them they roared and cheered because it’s the same insults they probably would’ve said themselves; Trump in their eyes was attacking a corrupt system of politicians not listening to the constituents.
Oh I don't know. Trump demands different treatment and people acquiesce and give him different treatment. He can attack other MAGA politicians, but they can't attack him. He can be as vicious as he wants about absolutely anyone, but if anyone says anything about him, they're 'nasty'. He does not owe anyone loyalty, but everyone has to be loyal to him. Narcissists always have different rules for themselves and other people. We've seen this for years. It won't change with DeSantis. People are already accepting his attacks on DeSantis. Noone is pushing back or coming to DeSantis' defense.
