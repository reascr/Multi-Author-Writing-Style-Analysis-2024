People who own guns do not look at Uvalde as reasons to ban guns anymore than you look at car accidents (or even Wakeusha and Nice) as reasons to ban cars. Or the mass stabbing in Canada recently as reasons to ban knives. And more to the point, criminals will always get weapons, hence why places with strict gun control that also tried defunding the police simply saw massive spikes in violent crime rates. So the only way to defend against a criminal is to maintain parity with them, either by using a weapon yourself or by relying on someone else. And Uvalde proved relying on the cops is unreliable, while the Greenwood Mall shooting (and White Settlement from a few years ago) proved armed citizenry do work.
Contrast how Uvalde was handled by the police vs. the Greenwood mall shooting, where an armed citizen (who opted to ignore the gun free zone signs, no less) stopped a mass shooter within seconds. Or White Settlement a few years ago.
If you actually tried to pay the least bit of attention and debate honestly, you’d realize they aren’t talking about gun control whatsoever in the comment you responded to - they’re talking about voting for conservatives in general, and they are completely right about the bigotry and intolerance.
