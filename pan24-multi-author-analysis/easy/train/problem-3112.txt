The default is largely manufactured and was on a tiny payment I don't think it will scare lenders off once sanctions are gone. In the short term yea- India, China, Iran maybe some former soviet nations or south american countries even. Anywhere that feels its a decent rate.
But then if you go more in depth you realize that the RUB is stable because it's basically not traded (there are a lot of restrictions in place so the exchange rate means nothing as long as you don't have a free market), you realize that yes, prices for energy have skyrocketed last spring / summer and Russia made a ton of money, but it also had a ton on expenses related to the war and since summer the global prices have crashed back to pre-war levels. Yes Russia has a rainy day fund it took more than a decade to build, but with current trajectories that fund will be empty before summer. Yes, they had "only" a 2% recession, but the pre-war forecast was for a +4% year (so in reality the economy lost 6% last year). Etc, etc.
