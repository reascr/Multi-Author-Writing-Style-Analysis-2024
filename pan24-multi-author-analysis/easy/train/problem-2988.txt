I'd like to call him Captain Obvious.... but he's right. This needs to be stated, over and over again. Russia will not win this war or any part of Ukraine.
Government corruption into the highest echelons of power isn’t a 4chan conspiracy theory. It’s been proven time and time again. Before Reddit turned into a Ukraine circlejerk, it was well known it is one of the most corrupt governments in Europe. Zelensky is only in power because of corrupt oligarchs who overthrew the democratically elected leadership in 2014, on behalf of the US national security state. But keep on believing the same media ran by these criminals. You do you.
It might seem obvious, but significant opposition and pushback to supporting Ukraine does exist, especially internationally. Even here in Canada, .
“In the first audio, Nuland and Pyatt are heard discussing strategies to work with the three main opposition figures: Klitschko, Arseny Yatseniuk, former Ukrainian economy minister, and Oleh Tyahnybok, the far-right nationalist opposition leader.
Are you shitting me? Most conservatives in the prairies here, where I live, are absolutely not the kind of people who will support Ukraine. They think zelensky made up this whole war just to make money. I see shitty memes all day from locals about how zelensky, trudeau, and biden are all making tonnes of money off this "fake" war. They actually claim it is staged, or not happening at all.
