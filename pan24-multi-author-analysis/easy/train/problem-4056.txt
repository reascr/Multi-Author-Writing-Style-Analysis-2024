Yeah Russians main goal was to divide America by pushing the extremes. They also tried to help Bernie to. The evidence of collusion really comes down to the fact that when trump was told Russia tried to help him he took Putins side over our intelligence community. If trump would have sided with our intelligence community and actually punished Russia for interfering in our elections it wouldn’t be nearly as big an issue. But he did not and obstructed the investigation left and right so we couldn’t figure it out. Which is why he should go to prison for obstruction even if he wasn’t colluding with Russia.

Trump’s administration was illegitimate. All we’re going to find is more evidence and more examples. We need to talk about how to unfuck everything he did because it was all illegal. SCOTUS, EO’s, laws, - everything.
Not officially. In reality, they have never been anything but an enemy to every country on the planet that is interested in democracy and not being run by a dipshit authoritarian clown.
