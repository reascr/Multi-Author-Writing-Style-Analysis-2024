The way I see it, let's say that abortion makes 2024 elections blue bloodbath, because the nominee will be someone young (hopefully someone somewhat progressive with some swing vote appeal) and Democrats manage to retain at least razor thin majority in the Senate (which heavily favors Republicans in 2024). She gets to be elevated to federal appeals court at the age of 37, in 2025. By the year 2030, if Democrats still hold both presidency and the senate (because I really think that Republicans committed suicide with Trump and Dobbs decision), Thomas would be 82 or 83 and likely to die already. She would be slightly younger than him when he was appointed. But she'd still have already 5 times more judicial experience and just like Thomas was used to destroy legacy of Thurgood Marshall, she would destroy his. And while Thomas would out-serve Marshall by 15 years, she might very well out-serve Thomas, just because women tend to live longer!
