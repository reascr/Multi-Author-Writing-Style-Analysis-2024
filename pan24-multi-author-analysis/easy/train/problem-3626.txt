The defense attorneys will argue that he didn’t target trans people because he himself was non-binary. The prosecution will have to combat that by showing he hated a group even though he identified as one, which will be incredibly difficult and that’s why (I believe) the defense is making this move.
Ok? Non-binary people can uphold heteronormativity and have internalized homophobia/transphobia just like everyone else. This isn’t about their identity or proximity to queerness it’s about the hatred they learned. It’s understandable that this young non-binary adult would have those thoughts in this highly anti-queer environment that they have been raised in. What led them to their actions wasn’t them being non-binary it was the homophonic/transphobic/anti-queer environment they grew up in and were probably forced to believe as a divine truth. They had already been victims of homophobic attacks online and came from a religion that demonized queerness so I’m glad we are told their pronouns but at the heart of this is still the hateful rhetoric against queer folks/trans folks . They also get to identify however they want, it’s not my place to police their identity and their identity doesn’t protect them from absorbing this hateful rhetoric we live in and acting on that hateful rhetoric. Sorry for the rant just really want better nuanced conversations about the shit that is destroying peoples lives and taking too many beautiful folks from this earth.
