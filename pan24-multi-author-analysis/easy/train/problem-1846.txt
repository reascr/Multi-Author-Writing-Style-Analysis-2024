But the Steele Dossier intrigued me, so I started digging, researching, widening my sources. And in particular reading source material that was less narrative and more objective: DOJ reports, court documents, offshore company records... abd I widened my reading and really critically assessed everything I was hearing. I came to a different understanding. While I am convinced that Trump is corrupt, exploits the system, routinely lies, has likely committed fraud and money laundering etc, (because there is plenty of evidence of that) I also now realise that many aspects of Russiagate just weren't true. I heard over and over by Democrats that Putin stole the election etc. Except after lots of research by independent parties and by the SCO, there was no evidence at all this was true. None. But it was a claimed repeated over and over. Not unlike Republican claims that the election in 2020 was rigged. There has been no evidence of that. So try and look at the facts, be critical, try not to be left or right, you may get a clearer picture of what is happening.
