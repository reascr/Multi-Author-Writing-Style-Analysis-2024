As if Europe has done anything for indian security. Let me give you example regarding india and Europe when it comes to security of each other, Italy is the one of the largest defence partner of the pakistani military, majority of long range radars in pakistani service are American, majority of Pakistani helicopter fleet is American or European, entirety of Pakistani tank fleet runs on Ukrainian engines, all of Pakistani and Indian military winter gear used to come from Europe. Saab literally sold AEWACs to Pakistan while bidding to sell Gripen to india. Ukraine itself has been a profiteer between India-Pakistan, as I said entire pakistani tank fleet runs on Ukrainian engines, their mi-17s were overhauled in Ukraine, they were looking at ukraine for engine replacement for T-129 attack helos after US blocked sale of their engines at the same time thousands of R-77 and R-27 BVR missiles were shipped out of Ukraine to india, around 40 indian warships run on Ukrainian turbines, entire indian An-32 fleet was overhauled and upgraded in Ukraine.
Ummm no? Isn't that like taking a side in this war? No matter how sweet the deal may become it won't happen.
