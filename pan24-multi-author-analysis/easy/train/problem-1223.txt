The funny thing is, both sides think they are saving democracy. At the same time, trying to silence those who oppose them. Yes, the SJW are a small but vocal minority. The same could be said for the far right extremists. Yet the MSM would have you believe that anyone voting red wants to overthrow the government, every white person is a racist, every gun owner is a time bomb waiting to blow, etc. Sadly, most on the left believe this. I have friends on both sides and I can promise you this, whatever nefarious thing you believe about those on the other side, they believe about you. THAT, my reddit homie, is the problem.
Additionally, authoritarians like having “enemies” to distract the weak-minded. Could be black people, women, young voters, Latinos, LGBTQ. Could be school boards (see Pompeo’s recent foot-swallow).
Seriously? Damn, I should be JACKED! What am I doing wrong? I'm a firearms instructor and I have to work my ass off in the gym to stay in shape. What guns should I buy to get this steroid effect you speak of?
