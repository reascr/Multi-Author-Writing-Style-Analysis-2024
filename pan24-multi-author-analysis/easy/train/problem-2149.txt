The weather / storms and oppressive heat will touch everyone as will ecological failure. We are already amidst a mass-extinction that’s seen 70% of all wildlife lost since the 1970’s. Make no mistake, we (humans) did this and it’s going to take Herculean efforts and massive engineering and scientific progress to dig ourselves out.
Absolutely. The trouble is, most people in richer countries know they'll be gone before the shit truly hits the fan, so their attention is easily diverted against poor immigrants--that is, poor immigrants from countries falling apart due to global heating. It's perverse.
Georgist land value tax, waste-to-energy technology (maybe hydrogen fuel/electrified public transport in ideally dense, walkable cities too) and nuclear power.
lol where? All the new windmill blades are made from petroleum. Breaking down solar panels takes huge amounts of energy with less of the materials being recoverable. Not to mention replacement every 20ish years. Did I mention that solar panels are less efficient in the heat? Smart when the planet is getting warmer.
