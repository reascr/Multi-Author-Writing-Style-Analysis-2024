Russia has been in a hybrid war against every western democracy for more than a decade. We literally didn't do anything against it at all. Russia could use soft hybrid attacks without any consequences. They attacked hospital infrastructure, they attacked political parties, hacked email systems, but also blew up weapons storage in Bulgaria, attacked german rail, us electricity infrastructure and nord stream, supported terrorists and assassinated people in many European countries - with no response from us.
50%? Man i thought prices were crazy in America. I suppose a part of the reason is rapid population growth. more demand for same supply.
Not to mention the online attacks, they literally have thousands of full time trolls trying to disable our democracies, they made Trump and Brexit happen, they made the AFD and the Italian right-wing relevant, they supported Orban and took over an EU country, they infiltrated Austria and made it weak, they caused the death of tens of thousands of refugees, they murdered hundreds of thousands by spreading anti-vax / anti-covid idiocy, they push Polish PiS anti-EU, regressive talking points and literally a MILLION other things.
