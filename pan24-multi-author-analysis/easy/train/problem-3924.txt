At least 21 Palestinians were killed in a fire that erupted Thursday night in a residential area of the Jabalya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian and Israeli media reported.
Actually, that's interesting. The comment section on every other website is the most pointless thing I can imagine. Nothing intelligent ever gets said.
Construction materials weren't originally blockaded in Gaza. It was only after all the aid sent there was used to build terror tunnels under civilian buildings that limitations on building materials were imposed. Even still you can even find nice modern malls in Gaza.
I mean, if you watch two people repeatedly punch each other in the face for several decades, and then in a rare moment when they aren't, you look away and then look back, and one of them has a nosebleed, your first thought wouldn't be "Huh i guess the air is very dry today", it would most likely be "Okay so which of them threw the first punch?".
Palestinian Authority-controlled WAFA reported that "scores" of casualties were evacuated from the burning building to a nearby hospital, with the number of casualties likely to increase. Seven children were reported to have died in the fire, according to Israeli reports.
