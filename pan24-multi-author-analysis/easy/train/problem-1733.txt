All these bigots and traitors you hear about on the right are the symptoms, manifestations of hatred, regression, greed, religious zealotry, and abiding thirst for violence and subjugation with their rabidly coveted firearms. The plague is spread by Fox News, Breitbart, power hungry “christian” fascists, and paid right-wing shills, all united by a need to control others, line their pockets, and undermine the public’s avenue to self-determination (democracy).
Agreed. It's very telling because it directly contradicts this narrative that the mainstream GOP has moved on from Trump. If that was actually true, then hosting a neo-Nazi for dinner would be a great chance for them all to uniformly denounce him. The fact that they're all remaining quiet shows that he's unquestionably still the Republican party's standard bearer and the leading nominee for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.
The most heinous part? Those same vectors that spread the disease simultaneously convince the idiotic, brainwashed rubes of the right-wing electorate that they are fighting for freedom. You see it time and again- the stupid Republican base smiling while they vote the for the same leaders who exploit them to give tax breaks to the rich, foment distrust in science and rationality, and even get them to throw away their lives trying to install a dictator who feeds on their donations and sells out the secrets of the nation they claim to be “patriots” of. It’s really sad- and frustrating.
