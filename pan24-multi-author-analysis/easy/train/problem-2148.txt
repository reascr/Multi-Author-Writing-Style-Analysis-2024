Nobody could shame me for taking a sip of water or enjoying the sun or doing anything else that is very clearly uncontroversial. I think this implies that we all understand there is a gravity to the situation.
I like the idea of a statutory fine of $1000 per person whose medical information is leaked charged to any company which leaked it or is hacked, with $500 per person being paid to anyone doing the hacking (along with immunity), so long as there's no damage or service interruption and the hackers are not associated with the company or anyone who's worked there in the last year, the hack was due to security which is less than standard for the industry (like a default password on a router or an unlocked door to a server room etc), and any leaked data is turned over to the enforcement agency without being released to the public.
Yes. Can you please explain how this is a strawman? I'm more than happy to change my examples if you're having a hard time understanding the connection, but the fact that you refused to answer such a simple question implies, to me at least, that you're just avoiding talking about it because the very first obstacle is one you've not considered before.
