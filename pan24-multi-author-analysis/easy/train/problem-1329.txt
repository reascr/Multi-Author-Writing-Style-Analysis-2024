I've been out for 15 years. These past six months is the most afraid I have ever been as an LGBTQ+ person. I've pretty much had to go back in the closet about being trans. The local LGBTQ+ group that I'm a part of has received numerous messages harassing us. I sometimes teach comprehensive, scientifically accurate sex ed as part of a community organization that exists because we cannot trust our public schools to teach that to kids, which is why some parents choose our program. We all received death threats in June, and remove all of our names and information from the website. People are fucking crazy. I was way more hopeful about the world in middle/high school than I am now.
'Strongly' linked to Republican voters who endorse and encourage more violence by supporting domestic terrorist groups, unaccounted trigger-happy police, murders who cross borders with violent intent, congressional leaders who flaunt their willingness for violence in political commercials, politicians who insight violence attacks on other civilians, foreign governments who invade innocent neighboring countries. Fuck the GOP.
