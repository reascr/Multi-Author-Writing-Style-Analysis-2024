The idea that we were savage in our conduct (spoiler alert everyone was to some extent) comes from the Canadian soldiers extensive use of trench raiding tactics. I have also read some other things that are less reliable sources(personal letters, journals etc.) of commonwealth soldiers not liking taking over section of trench that were previously held by Canadian soldiers. accounts are similar in that they all describe the Germans being jumpy and on edge after standing off with a Canadian unit. I donâ€™t take this to be universally true as any number reasons could have contributed to this or even the observers on distortion of the situation that they were presented with. WWI battlefield rumours were rampant, and when you are in as a terrible a situation as they were, rumours quickly become fact when nothing else makes sense.
interesting. i was thinking lately about the value of a country keeping their developments secret. for instance if russia never knew about ukraine's more recently discovered natural resource reserves, would any of this be happening? i am glad to know they did much preparing in secret.
