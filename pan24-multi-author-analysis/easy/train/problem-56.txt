I think in most cases the religion is only an excuse that is easy to sell for the people in power to the idiots that go do the killing... im afraid if it wasn't religion they would find a different excuse. Supposedly pretty much as soon as the prophet died Islam split in two and they started killing each other over who was the new leader of the religion. And those guys were supposed to be the followers of the most Pious man of all time (who himself made it his life work to go around slaughtering people of other religions)... if that doesn't show you that religion is just another branding of "power" I don't know what would.
Interesting. I care deeply about what happens in my Diocese and very much about my own parish. Iâ€™ve just come to accept that man is wicked and corrupt and there will be evil at the highest levels of every institution we touch. Worrying about what is happening with 1.3 billion Catholics is just so out of my control that it would take something very local for my trust in the church to be truly shaken to the point of leaving.
