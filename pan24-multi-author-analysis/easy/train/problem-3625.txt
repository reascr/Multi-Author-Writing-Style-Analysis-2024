It's not the only thing, either, he appointed Tesla’s China president, who oversaw Gigafactory Shanghai’s transformation into the world’s largest EV plant, to run the new Gigafactory in Austin, Texas.
No he is NOT. They’re just 2 good natured fellas sacrificing everything for us all to live better lives. Elon should help Trump everyday and at every appearance. I hope they become the same person they spend so much time together. Doesn’t Mara Lago have a spare closet with a cot or something for Elon?
Controlling a social network like Twitter is not something that China can do directly, but having someone like Musk control it is something they consider beneficial, specially given that without moderation, their traditional means of saturating overseas networks with fake accounts is specially effective.
