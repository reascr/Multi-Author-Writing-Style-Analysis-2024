I agree. It's insane that my household income is 7 figures but I pay the same social security tax as someone who makes 10x less than me. I'd happily pay more and can afford it if it means social security stays solvent.
This inland negotiation. This is saying “ok, you want to play negotiation, how do you want to do this?”.

It’s absolutely ridiculous. For the past decade at least, Republicans only goal has been to destroy faith in our institutions so they can point out how broken it is and how we need to vote them in to fix it. They are 100% willing to let the government default so they can point to it and say it’s all democrats fault. Doesn’t matter if it’s true or not. Their constituents religiously watch a single “news” source that tells them exactly what to believe.
