And who challenges it in court now? The losing candidate(s)? Would it mean he needs to be removed from congress or that he was never a sitting member at all? How does that work in terms of the votes cast or work done on behalf of constituents? What would winning in court do? (We sort of saw this question with Clinton vs Trump, did Trump fraudulently acquire something that should have belonged to Clinton, and if so, could a court transfer the title of POTUS from the person who fraudulently acquired it the way they could other things?). Elected officials are supposed to be nearly immune to interference in the course of their jobs to prevent other politicians or courts interfering in the representation of the public and the functioning of other parts of the government. Unlike some monarchies, where the only one immune from prosecution is the sovereign and everything is done on their behalf, there's no equivalent for a republic (or at least for Americans). "The people" cannot have their representative(s) taken away from them.
