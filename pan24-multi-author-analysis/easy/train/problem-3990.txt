Using the online environment as a formative and summative tool to help build up proximate skills that are not explicit course objectives improves students' performance both in the short and the long term. E.g., a history course is not a writing a course and you don't want to be focusing on writing too much in such a course. However, students write better the more they write, so have them write more and then engage in peer review and revisions helps them become better readers and writers--this improves their performance in the history course and in future courses (i.e., future learning outcomes).
