It's important when hurling generalizations to keep in mind there's a separation between the voters and the ruling class. Voters are often earnest even when being led by their noses. As for the elected, I saved this comment from another thread, because it's the clean and concise truth of it: "Always remember: their only values are their own personal enrichment and power. The meandering path they use to get there will change, the explanations will change. It won't make sense. It will be self-contradictory. That is because strategy can change and tactics follow strategy, but what doesn't change are values. The strategies they employ are solely to achieve outcomes matching their values.".
Albatross? Yeah but, without pretending to believe in Christian ideals how else would the richest people in America trick the poor into voting against the poor’s own self interest? To leave the religious right would be to literally lose more than half the GOP’s voting base. Lying to poor Christians is the only chance the GOP has.
