Sounds a bit like trying to shoot down a nuke. There are so many ways you can use this tech. If you're going to send 1000s over in one go then it won't really matter how slow they are. If they are slow you could have dummy drones, drones can also act as a hive or independently. Hypersonic drones would cost more but be even more impossible to stop and more deadly because of the forces involved. Not to mention accountability - you send a swarm towards an unassuming country and blow up most of their infrastructure before they even have the time to find out what's going on and who sent them. The robot wars are going to be insane.
Not particularly effective though. Even if you crash it in a trench your only getting 1 or 2 casualties. The effect on moral will be rough, but so is just having a hand grenade fall out of the sky and land in your foxhole.
Extremly effective. Not just in field tactics, but as a military strategy. Killing a soldier results in burial costs, wounding a soldier results in medical costs.
