Oh, the irony is all yours, my friend. Most of the fear mongering around the patriot act turned out to be not true, shocking I know. Lots of amendments and changes have been made, the worst excesses have been overruled as unconstitutional, the sunset provisions people said would never expire did indeed expire, etc. I remember everyone freaking out saying you could be detained indefinitely if they suspected you of being a terrorist or involved with terrorists, which of course turned out to not be the case. I remember the same people saying cops needed to stop kicking in doors with high powered rifles to serve search warrants, while simultaneously saying the ability to serve a search warrant directly to a telecom for a voicemail was the end of the world and they should be served the old fashioned way with guns blazing.
Not good. Not good at all. But are we talking war time censorship, or are we talking Soviet or Nazi level full State press? Chinese level control? Because there IS a difference. Neither are acceptable, but some levels are more evil than others.
