"The Julian calendar has two types of years: a normal year of 365 days and a leap year of 366 days. They follow a simple cycle of three normal years and one leap year, giving an average year that is 365.25 days long. That is more than the actual solar year value of 365.24219 days (the current value, which varies), which means the Julian calendar gains a day every 128 years. For any given event during the years from 1901 to 2099 inclusive, its date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days behind its corresponding Gregorian date.".
I can assure you mobilisation won't be popular, whether there will be bombings or not, it was already proven by crimean bridge bombing that it does not raise patriotic motivation, even despite it being literally the most iconic accomplishment of putin and so called putins electorate's greatest pride. On the contrary, such events raise a lot of toxicity towards status quo in Russia due to unspoken agreement between government and average ivan ("you keep us secure and strong and we dont interfere too much in what you're doing").
