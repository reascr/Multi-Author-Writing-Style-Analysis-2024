If a doctor whistleblows about Medicare fraud at a hospital because she is ethically uncomfortable with the hospital’s actions, we don’t accuse that doctor of hating medicine as a whole. If a lifelong churchgoer whistleblows about child abuse by priests, we don’t accuse that employee of hating Christianity. Whistleblowers deserve protection, not to be tarred and feathered as liars because of the identity of the organization they’re reporting.
It is difficult to blame a whistleblower for talking to the people who are willing to take them seriously. If a lifelong Catholic raised claims about child abuse at her parish, and an atheist publication publicized those claims, we would never suggest that the authorities should refuse to investigate them on the basis that they were published by atheists who have an agenda against the Catholic Church. They'd still have to be investigated.

Obviously the MO AG has his own political agenda, but the political agenda doesn't nullify that these are allegations objectively warranting investigation. The same way that it was still objectively warranted for the New York AG to investigate the NRA's financial misconduct even if her subjective motivation was political.
