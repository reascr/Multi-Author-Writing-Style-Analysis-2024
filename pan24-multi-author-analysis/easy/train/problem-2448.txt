Takes a lot more than minimalism to like engineer the earth's climate to be the same way it has been for the last couple thousand years when the climate is always a constantly changing Target and never static.
This point people who are serious about it should be thinking like we need to take control of their climate because it's not naturally stable and it's too easy to screw up.
The big problems is that like 80% of the people who say they care about climate are not interested in any of these facts because they want to believe that like we could just minimize and not pollute and that'll like reverse climate change or something but you know climate change always happens naturally too.
Yeah, it's a GG. 6 million years of us and our evolutionary ancestors suffering horrifically from disease, starvation, and being ripped apart by predators so that a handful of oligarchs could throw it all in the trash for a new yacht. Fantastic.
Most people are forced to work too hard just to make ends meet to take time to organize and fight. Organizing takes a lot of time and effort, that most people dont have because theyre too busy working. Its by design. They have us by the balls until the heat gets so high that people dont give a fuck and start french-revolutioning oil execs. By that point though itll be too late.
