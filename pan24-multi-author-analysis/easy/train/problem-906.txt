I don’t understand the motive behind this kind of comment/narrative though. I’m a liberal but this seems like absolving the federal government of their responsibilities to the border because of partisan motivation and I think that’s bullshit. Why should states have to fill the gaps (or why should they raise taxes on people, as you suggest) when we already pay the federal government to do this. The feds have very few natural jurisdictions, but the border is one of them and successive governments have failed and failed again. I don’t think it’s civically aware or engaged to flippantly try and switch accountability to states you don’t like.

Do you not understand that immigration and border security are federal government responsibilities? It doesn’t matter if a Democrat or Republican is in the White House or who has the majorities in Congress, it’s the federal government’s responsibility.
