From reporter Colby Itkowitz: The U.S. House member and former CIA analyst is seen by many top Democrats as a formidable Democratic contender in a key battleground.
The 46-year-old former CIA analyst is seen by many top Democrats as a formidable Democratic contender who has a proven record of winning in competitive House districts. She has positioned herself as a moderate, rejecting positions and rhetoric adopted by the far-left while championing Democratic principles like abortion rights and a ban on assault weapons.
By whom? The last time Michigan elected a Republican was in the mid-term red tsunami of 1994. He lasted one term and then Debbie Stabenow booted him out.
Both are basically piles of steaming dog shit to dump difficult to insure people onto a public system, while leaving all those healthy enough to work a job that offers benefits paying into the private system, all while saying nothing of the benefits those on the public system would receive other than they would be "competitive" with current plans (which means at least a little worse, so as not to threaten our donors).
Oh, OK! I didn’t get the context. Still, with how well the Michigan Democrats are doing these days, and Kristina Karamo now head of MI-GOP, I’d say the Democratic candidate will have at least a fighting chance.
