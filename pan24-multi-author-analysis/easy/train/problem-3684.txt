For example, the supreme court in very short time already decided that it's not reasonable that Der'i would be a minister - fine. Totally fine.
Legalizing the settlements (hilariously on the same day as they evicted one) is a (radical and dumb) tool of punishment to the Palestinian hostilities, the logic is, they claim they murder Jews so they leave 'their' land, so they build settlements in response to dissuade them, this was also a direct response to multiple attacks in recent weeks which killed numerous civilians (most recent 2 kids) which are a 'response' to the Israeli 'tidebreaker' operation going on for the past year since the last big terror wave (in which Israeli forces enter the Palestinian territories daily/nightly to arrest terrorism suspects and confiscate weaponry, focusing mainly on the known terror organization affiliates, which causes casualties, which causes more terror attacks, which feeds the endless cycle of violence).
No. Its basically a third world country outside Israel. And when less civilised places feel they are suppressed they turn to religion. And religious chanting will always bring death, at least when mixed with decades of apartheid and just literal tyranny.
