"We often hear "but investigations take time." And they do. But not THIS much. Not two -plus years (re; Jan. 6). I fault Garland (and Willis, to an extent) for taking this long, for not focusing properly on the top power sources, and for overall myopic approaches to prosecution. It may already be too late. Even if Trump is indicted, when will a trial happen? 2024, at soonest. Yet we will be right in the midst of presidential primaries then, which will make it that much tougher to get a jury to convict, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.".
They also missed the one where a woman had charges against Trump from when Trump and Epstein said they'd pay her many thousands of dollars to use her for sex when she was a minor, didn't pay, threatened the life of her and her family, the statute limit passed but another state rescinded the statute of limitations for statutory cases, she refined anonymously, was found out by Trump's people and withdrew a second time due to death threats from leg breakers again. This was when he was still just candidate Trump.
