The purpose of the senate is to prevent an excess of democracy, and it has served that purpose very well. Itâ€™s important to remember how few people actually voted for the Republican minority throwing a wrench into things. Gerrymandering has the same effect on the house (states are basically large gerrymandered districts without the requirement of roughly equal populations), though it would be a much more complicated graph with a smaller effect size.
This is cruel! Those interpreters risked their lives to assist America and her cause. And they were promised a better life in America. To deny them is yet another betrayal in a long string of betrayals. If America cannot be trusted, why would anyone ally with us? Damn GQP.

jesus. see how many people will risk their lives for usa interests in the future. like what happened to the kurds, the gop is really screaming at the world that they dont give a fuck about you even if you're on their side.
