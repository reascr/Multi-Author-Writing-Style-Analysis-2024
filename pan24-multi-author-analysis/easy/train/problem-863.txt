Yup. I once hired a non-profit Lutheran lawyer to help me with some government forms. Fucking crook stole $200 and didnt even fill out the section that i paid him to fill out, said that by law I had to go down to the courts and request the documents. Guess what the nice lady down at the court house told me, public information is apparently made available to the public and anyone with a cashiers check can request almost anything. Had to do everything myself and multiple times in the end anyways. Fuck that guy.
Congress cannot write simultaneously conflicting mandates. The debt ceiling directly contradicts detailed spending directives and does not specify which funding should be stopped.
