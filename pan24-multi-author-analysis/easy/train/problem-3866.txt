Story from my coworker about Vietnam. He and his buddy didn't want to get drafted and the branch with the lowest deployment rate at the time was the Navy. So a ton of people joined the Navy including my coworker and his buddy. His buddy felt good about not getting deployed because he also had an English degree because he wanted to be an English teacher, that's useless to the military right? Well they wanted to build schools and teach the Vietnamese english, so guess who got sent to Vietnam? Meanwhile my coworker did not.
But not all countries are like this, i am also against conscription in times of war but the government first priority is the country and without conscription they will very likely just collapse and fall (similar to Britain, china and the soviets in ww2, without conscription they would likely not exist today).
Yep. It's pretty straightforward. If your country is invaded, those of military age don't get to go scampering for the border. Not sure why people can't grasp this.
