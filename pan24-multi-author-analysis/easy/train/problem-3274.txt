I agree, the US does not annex countries. The US invades them, killing tens of thousands directly and hundreds of thousands through the humanitarian crisis generated by these invasions (lets remember that the US invaded Iraq without any evidence of weapons of mass destruction and never faced any international sanctions or punishment by the "free world"), leaving those countries in the hands of terrorist groups that took advantage of the vacuum of power created. Or, in the case of Syria, arming rebels so that they can kill the proxy soldiers of its rival empires for them, ofc, also killing directly or indirectly civilians. Or, in the case of LA arming and financing genocidal (30k deaths in Argentina alone) military dictatorships. But hey At least the US doesn't annex them (I can give you MANY more examples, like, a lot). And I'm not even mentioning the consequences of the economic imperialism of the US... oh boy.
Geographically, sure. But politically, no. Just as Australia is geographically in Sahul, but politically Western.
