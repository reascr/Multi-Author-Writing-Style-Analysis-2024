"I leave tremendous tips, the best tips. Every time I go out Just last week, I was at one of my beautiful hotels and I got the... the... whaddya call it when the book shows up with the paper in it? Oh, we need the paper Everybody loves the paper But sometimes there's two or three papers in there and ya gotta... so I wrote 'get a better job' for the tip And the waitress came over, a big, strong waitress, with tears in her eyes, and you know what she said, she said 'I just want to thank you, Mr. President, for saving my life, I never thought about doing that', can you believe that, people? She didn't know that she could just get a new job until I told her.".
He’s sued for non payment and Trump basically filed bullshit motion after bullshit motion, and eventually wore the guy down in legal fees of the point it was cheaper to accept what paltry sum Trump was offering than to see it all the way through in court. Don’t forget, to just answer a claim in court is $10k, depositions are minimum $5k a day and discovery can easily cost $50k. You could be looking at $100k in costs but also a 3-4 year legal battle with all the BS trumps lawyers are paid to pull.
