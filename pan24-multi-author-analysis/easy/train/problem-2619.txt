I just can’t get over how personally the goal of a fascist America is bigger than respecting and defending his wife. I understand how other things aren’t cognitive dissonance for these people cause I grew up in small town central Florida and understand the compartmentalization. I don’t understand how Ted Cruz personally just accepts it. Like he must have such a small amount of respect for himself or little love for his wife. Idk maybe in private they’ve talked but again personally for him to get booed with people yelling at him that he likes people saying his wife looks like a dog just baffles me at how he hasn’t snapped saying he wishes someone would say that to his face or at least pretend to say he’d fight trump over it. I get how people can vote for him still. I worry about his low character that he sleeps at night campaigning for a man that repeatedly speaks that way about his wife.
