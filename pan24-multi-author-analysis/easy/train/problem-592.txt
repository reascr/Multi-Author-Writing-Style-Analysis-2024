"In a linear regression model controlling for yearly trend, the federal ban period was associated with a statistically significant 9 fewer mass shooting related deaths per 10,000 firearm homicides (p = 0.03). Mass-shooting fatalities were 70% less likely to occur during the federal ban period (relative rate, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.39).".
The paperwork for a full auto firearm is faster than in the US, takes about 2 weeks, though it's not legal in every Canton (state), similar to how it's not legal in every state in the US (though it takes much longer in the US and you're limited to firearms registered before 1986).
. Currently, Swiss legislation bans the use of automatic weapons, silencers, laser sights, and heavy machine guns. The government demands licensing for the acquisition and carrying of any firearm, and requires registration and licenses for ownership of firearms, with some exceptions made for hunting weapons. Practically everyone in Switzerland is trained to use a gun, yes, but that training, as well as the use, storage, and transportation of guns, is very regulated.

Ownership isn't regulated, purchasing is. And as I mentioned earlier, that does not require a license.
