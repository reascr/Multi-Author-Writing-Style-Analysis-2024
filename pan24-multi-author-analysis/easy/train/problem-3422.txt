I dont have older data but Hungary was sliding down on democracy since at least 2010, in 2010 they were close to Poland level under previous government, by 2015(which is year current Polish government come to power) Hungary was already below Poland level in 2020, thats how fast they were sliding without Polish government protection and while under EPP protection, EPP only stoped protecting them in recent years when it was no longer possible to cover all their BS.
