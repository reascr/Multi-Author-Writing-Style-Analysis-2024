How much did they pay for those containers? A market price or more? Who sold them? What is going to happen to them now? Are they being sold for a market price or less? Who is getting them.
Why do the Republicans always seek to excuse the harmful actions of corporations and yet insist on calling them "people" and why do their economic polices always benefit most the greediest of the wealthiest minority, to the substantial detriment of the majority employee class? Oh, ... yeah. The greediest of the wealthiest -- persons and corporations -- are the actual owners of the Republican Party; they just stroke the emotions of the zealots who have contempt if not outright hatred of others not like themselves for votes -- emotions blind that follower class from seeing beyond the three or four word (slogans the cult of "45" Republican policy use to "sell" their brand) or they're just too lazy or too busy hating or telling others how to live to actually take the time to examine the actual facts of Democrat vs. Republican policy.
