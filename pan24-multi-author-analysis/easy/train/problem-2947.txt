Israel is likely very concerned with what might be returning on Irans transport planes now that Russia is ignoring nuclear disarmament treaties and Russias becoming increasingly cash poor due to sanctions.
Hey. Ukrainian citizen here. A lot of discussion is about who is winning now. Most Ukrainian sensible people and experts worry a lot about current situation. For now, Ukraine is surely not losing, we are holding our ground and prepare a good number of strategic reserve brigades in our backfield. Russian advances near Bakhmut, even losing Bakhmut, is strategically not impactful. The biggest problem strategically are russian mobilisation reserves - if we continue with the same casualty ratio - 1 : 3 to 1 : 5 depending on location, we will not be able to hold russia off during 2-3 years of non-stop war. That’s why we need an edge in technology and equipment. The political problem we suppose exists - US is fearing our recapturing of Azov coast, cause that will make russian conventional defence of Crimea impossible. That’s why the help is tailored in a way to not allow big offensive operations against high density defences. Sadly if USA holds to this strategy, we will not have any manpower to hold even smallest offensive operations in 2 years. And a large percentage of our patriotic youth will be killed.
That's absolutely possible! A few years ago I saw a young NK refugee on TV. This guy said that he only fled because someone told him that in China you can eat a whole chicken all by yourself.
