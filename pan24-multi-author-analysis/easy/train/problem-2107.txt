The world isn't peaceful, but it's sure as hell a lot more peaceful than it was, if for no other reason than because Europe and China blew themselves to fucking hell during WWII and the USA sat on Japan. If the USA was actually interested in conquest in the same manner that the major European and Asian powers were, the world would look like a very, very different place.
Or are we going to conveniently forget about the horrors of European and Asian colonialism from the early 1800s all the way until roughly 1970/80 in our desire for America bashing?
Or are we forgetting that pretty much every single one of those events has its roots in earlier stages of colonialism?
