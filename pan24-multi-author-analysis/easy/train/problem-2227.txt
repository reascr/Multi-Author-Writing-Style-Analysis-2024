Sorry but no one has a real concept of war these days please refer to Rome they learned about rebellions and constant fighting early on in the empire to quell these 3options were given enslavement of the population. Killing of the entire population. Or u can send ur men to fight for the kingdom as an enslavement for protection of their loved ones families from what happened to previous ones who refused. This is why Iraq fell back into others hands. U can't win a war fully without 1 of the 3 options being used. Because u will always have some sort of insurrection without doing these things it's been proven on repeat with every war since old times even world War 1 and 2 u saw this happen. This is why war is pointless u can't do the three options without human rights violations from the un or the whole world being against u for doing so. Sorry it's a hard truth.
There is also a current belief that the Russian government is disproportionately recruiting conscripts from Russian ethnic minorities and then effectively throwing them into the front lines to die with no expectation of success. They've also been doing it with Ukrainian people in the occupied areas since day one which looks suspiciously like a method to depopulate the occupied territories so they can be resettled by ethnic Russians. It's effectively a genocide on these people as well and somewhat explains why they don't care about their casualty rates.
Exactly! This is no place for Euphemisms, Russia is straight up commiting genocide. it's also what Ottomans/Turks did when they enslaved Greece. Kidnapped children and brainwashed them to be Genitsaroi, soldiers made to hunt down and fight their own kind.
