Most other blue states would also benefit from no longer subsidizing the red states. Some things would likely become more expensive, food prices for example because they would need to import a lot more. But in reality, there is not a ton of economic downfall for blue states if the red states succeeded.
It would be worse for the red states, but it would likely benefit blue states, especially my home of California. Hell California could be its own country and survive. We are the fifth biggest economy in the world, we have the capacity of producing a lot of our own food, the only thing we would struggle with is water, which is something we already struggle with and will likely have to use desalination technology eventually.
yea no. you want a divorce... you go your own way. you don't get to take federal assets with you, and you sure as heck aren't going to keep getting blue state dollars to subsidize your red state hellholes.
