I mean, if we are talking about what I really think should happen when this is over, then Putins wealth should be liquidated to pay for the rebuild and with his money that would pay for a damn big chunk of it (if his estimated wealth is to be believed that is) and the rest should be footed by the Russian oligarchs.That would be one way to rebuild and for Russia to think twice about this bullshit in the future. But realistically that won't happen. And really overall I'm just talking theory here anyways. I'm making a distinction between what could be vs what is most likely. Because you are right about how it's probably gonna go the way it always has. I'm just saying it doesn't HAVE to be that way.
It's as simple as BlackRock making a targeted push to be advisors for the reconstruction, make a profit from consulting, and they will probably make targeted investments into Ukraine + provide liquidity for rebuilding schools, hospitals, etc. In particular Ukraine has a notable tech sector, that if nurtured, could be a huge net benefit to investors and the economy of Ukraine. The folks at BlackRock would likely want a piece of that pie, but it's a win-win IMO.
