How realistic such anxieties are matters little. The ensuing attention to Taiwan’s fate has been hugely detrimental to China’s interests. Westerners eager to demonstrate their support have elevated Taiwan’s international visibility and status, which China has worked tirelessly to deny. Even worse, the prospect of war in the Taiwan Strait has energized US efforts to bolster Taiwan militarily and diplomatically, further hollowing out its “one-China policy.”.
Cumulatively, the shift in Europe’s stance toward China and the prospect of a war between mainland China and Taiwan sure to devastate global trade have injected an urgent and powerful momentum into the West’s “economic decoupling” with China. Alarmed corporate executives no longer need encouragement from Washinon’s China hawks to reduce their dependence on mainland-based supply chains.
