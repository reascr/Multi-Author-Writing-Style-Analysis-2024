“Therefore, Moscow is reaching for other methods to break Ukraine. Instead of fighting soldiers, Russia is bringing death, starvation and hypothermia to civilians,” he continued.
“Russia is fighting to rebuild an empire and knows that an empire is built on bones and corpses of innocent people. Exactly like 90 years ago during the Holodomor times,” he added.
Between censorship within authoritarian regimes like Russia or the crucial need for communication and information dissemination within Ukraine, the importance of global satellite internet for all cannot be overstated. Starlink is great but this concept needs to be a global public service, accessible to all akin to GPS. Imagine the capacity to independently connect to and communicate with the outside with any cheap phone within an authoritarian state. Would lead to a surge of progress in many places, I suspect.
Russian volunteers are having another tragedy today: the Russian ministry of defence suddenly blocked the import of various military equipment and clothes into Russia with no explanation. Vatniks have no idea what's going on.
Definitely a little suspicious. It could of course be natural. According to a couple resources I just Googled (take that for what it is worth), the average life expectancy for males in Belarus may be as low as 69. Of course, this could be another one of those “too close to the window” or cliff accidents that seem to happen a lot out there.
