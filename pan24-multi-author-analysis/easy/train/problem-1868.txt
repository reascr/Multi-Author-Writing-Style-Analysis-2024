Sanctions, until they change their minds, or heads again. Asset seizure, worldwide, and handing those over to Ukraine.
Exactly. I agree with all your points. So the real solution would’ve been a harsher treaty with full enforcement to the terms. To ensure it cannot take up arms again or to be used as nazi propaganda.
everyone? If you think majority of Russians would be okay with giving back Crimea you are actually crazy, they will EMP strike kiev before they permanently lose Crimea again.
Edit: Nevermind. Read it a bit again and completely misunderstood. Yeah all for this one here. If your stuff’s already confiscated….
For us, I think that we will be thankful to your dear leader to some weird extent in the long run, because without his actions, we would have probably taken years or decades more to push the switch to greener energies from Russian fossil fuels; for the part of the economy (like chemical industry) that is dependent on natural gas, well the USA and Quatar and Azerbaijan and others are more than happy to provide enough LPG to cover those needs. And in the long run, the renewable energy sources are way cheaper, especially with scaling effects taking off right now, the pain of transition is obviously something we can take for a few years and way easier when there is no choice to be made between immediate and long-term profits.
Ok… as a lover of WWII history this idea scares me…. As much as I agree… the history of what tends to happen scares me.
Also, the stream of well-educated Russians that is constantly coming over in search of _a_ better future is more than welcome, since it is waaay cheaper to import already educated people than educating them yourself, with in this case the benefits of them being desperate and accepting lower salaries and working in their fields although they have no chance of advancing in the hierarchy since they are not really trusted. A new well-educated bottom class to exploit — that's what capital loves.
