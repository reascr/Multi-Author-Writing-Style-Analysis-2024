I don't like being contrary, but - are you sure? Look at it from the flip side: how does Putin lose? Who is going to lever him out of place? There is no mechanism, no power in Russia that can displace him, any more than there's anyone in North Korea that can shift Kim Jong Un, no matter how miserable the people might be.
Serious question. But have they actually told anyone of their demands? Back in March it was to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk region as independent and Crimea as Russian. What about now? After their “referendums”, dont they still want to lay claims to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions?
Absolutely agree. Here's the problem though. Putin already declared the four oblasts as Russia. Obviously this is embarrassing and silly. However it also presents a real problem if Putin wants to literally survive the war. Any retreat from these oblasts will be seen as failure, and so Putin has no option but to continue to fight. I don't see any way Putin can win this war now. The Russian economy and people won't be able to stand this for years to come, and Putin can't leave without being killed himself.
