2020: "On Tuesday, we got a reminder from the latest New York Times deep dive into the president’s taxes that Trump’s accusations, as always, are lifted directly from his own life to an extent that borders on plagiarism. The Times reporting showed it was, in fact, Trump who has tried for a decade to make financial inroads into China; it was Trump who has a (previously unknown) corporate bank account in the country, one of only three foreign accounts the company maintains; and it is Trump who has absorbed millions of dollars from Chinese and Chinese American entities at his different properties since becoming president. The Times’ latest report doesn’t deliver a hammer blow to the president, but that’s only because standards of presidential conduct apparently no longer exist and it’s likely the tip of the iceberg, an opening salvo into Trump’s murky financial ties to China that will likely be investigated for years to come even after he leaves office.
Agreed. Half of american's do not want to be stressed out by nuance and facts. They want you to tell them the patient doesn't have cancer even if it is stage 3.
