You used the word 'asylum' 3 times in the comment I responded to. I wasn't talking about economic or seasonal migrants. I was referring to asylum seekers, specifically those who risked their childrens' lives. You didn't answer the question though.
To be granted asylum you need to show a well founded fear of persecution by your government based on race, religion, political beliefs, ethnicity, or membership of a particular social group (which btw, doesnâ€™t mean a cisfemale afraid of DV, or being a member of a particular gang/non-member) on top of that you can not have ever been a persecutor yourself, and on top of that (this one is important and not oft-mentioned) you can not be able to avoid the persecution by relocating somewhere else within your home country.
Compare it to cleaning up your room. Making a mess takes 5 mins while cleaning it up takes at least double or triple the time.
