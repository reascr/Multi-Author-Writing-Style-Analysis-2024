In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I'm no fan of the GQP... But this was done under the Biden admin and somehow we blame the GQP. Please stop blaming everything on the other party ALL the time. It lets the people that we actually voted for get away with murder. We can hate the other side while still holding our side accountable.
Exactly. It's when someone misreports a number from their W2, didn't report 1099s they received, both separated parents claim a tax credit for the same kid, etc. All stuff that's easily checked by a computer. The IRS isn't "auditing" random low to middle income people. That would be a complete waste of their time.
