Even better would be a case that reaches the Supreme Court over the right to an abortion based on freedom of religion, considering that Judaism and Islam don’t believe life begins at conception (and Jesus didn’t oppose abortion either, but the Pope of the Romans who crucified Jesus seems to have a problem with abortion, but no problem with child sexual abuse by clergy).

This. My tech-savvy and unabashedly liberal high school kids are already concocted schemes for cross-border pill arbitrage. I really don't think the FDA will cave here - add it to the mountain of constitutional crises we have. But if it becomes quasi illegal to get RU 486 in the states, I am sure my kids will figure a way to turn a profit from it.
