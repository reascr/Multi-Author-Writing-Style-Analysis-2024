You’re speaking of what’s on the surface, the Swiss veil of “neutrality.” Yes, the government is neutral, but what does it matter when their companies and banks are free to financially plunder wherever, whenever, and however they want. Let me clarify as an example. Nestlé S.A. did not stop doing business in Russia despite ruthless corporations like even McDonald’s, et. al. did. Nestlé S.A. then, while real estate was cheapest, had the audacity to open a factory in Ukraine, like a month or two ago to “help” Ukraine jobs. That’s the Swiss way. They’re in everything of change no matter if there’s blood involved, and war is the biggest change and blood is irrelevant. Lots of money to be made. The good news is, you can see this as the banks’ ledgers are mostly public for those publicly traded ones (proxy statements). Swiss banks particularly enjoyed the debacle of fuel and wheat famine in the world.
Completely disagree. The average Russian does not deserve to see their athletes in the Olympics at all. The Russian people, brainwashed or not, are not protesting their government to stop the war. Until Russians stand up to stop their governments genocide, I think they deserve everything they are getting.
