Now I'm not one to mock those wheelchair bound, but Madison strikes me as somebody who had a very high opinion of himself prior to the accident. And probably not a lot of respect for the handicapped. He had a lot of confidence and an ego that turned to self loathing and hatred. He'd later accuse his friend who was in the crash of leaving him to die in the burning wreckage, when in fact they saved him.

Hire outside counsel. It’s easier/cleaner to prove the expense of collection when you have your own collections’ attorney’s invoices to present, plus every minute I spend chasing a dollar I’m already owed is a minute I’m not spending earning the next dollar. Most attorneys get paid by billing hourly: I literally have better things to do to.
