>The combined number of South Asians (from the countries of the Indian subcontinent including Sri Lanka) by themselves represent over 1.5 million people (60%) of Qatar's population. Among these, Indians are the largest community, numbering 650,000 in 2017,[15] followed by 350,000 Nepalis, 280,000 Bangladeshis, 145,000 Sri Lankans, and 125,000 Pakistanis. The contingent of expatriates which are not of South Asian origin represent around 28% of Qatar's population, of which the largest group is 260,000 Filipinos and 200,000 Egyptians, plus many other nationalities (including nationals of other Arab countries, Europeans, etc.).[15].
The UK has hosted a World Cup before, as well as the Olympics recently, and has the infrastructure in place to accommodate a massive influx of tourists as well as the stadiums to hold the games already existing when they made the bid, and they will not be dismantled or left to rot afterwards. They don't need to work slaves to death to meet the standards outlined for the event (standards Qatar never met anyways so FIFA lowered them several times).
