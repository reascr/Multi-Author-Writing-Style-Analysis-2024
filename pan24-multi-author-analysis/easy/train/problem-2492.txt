I think it's important to remember that being incorrect is not the same thing as lying. If Pence said, "I do not have any classified documents in my possession," and he believed that to be true, that isn't a lie. His having documents and Biden's having documents are in the same general area on the left of the "oops<------------------->espionage" spectrum, while Trump knowingly having documents and refusing to give them up to the point where it required the FBI to raid his fucking home is considerably further to the right.
It's not a mantra. It's a well known problem that relates to how the classification process is administered. You can look up pre 2015 sources on this if you want. Classified content accretes and attracts more classified content. It's literally a snow ball effect. Then the process of sorting classed from unclassed portions of mixed documents is so burdensome it makes sense that people just call the whole document classified versus making a mistake. Calling it a mantra is just off the mark.
