If the court rules against the start-up, Switzerland could become the first country in Europe to ban the use of animal meat names in connection with plant-based products.
Planted Foods, Switzerland’s largest start-up producing meat substitutes, could be ordered to remove the terms “chicken” and “pork” from the labels on its pea-based products. This is despite a ruling by the Zurich administrative court that deems the use of animal meat names on the packaging of plant-based foods is not misleading for consumers as long as they are clearly labelled as “vegan”.
Should the Federal Court decide to ban the use of animal meat names on Planted's labels, it would go against European legislation, which allows meat-related mentions on packaging.
Current legislation in Switzerland does not provide clarity on the correct naming of plant-based foods. “The law is very abstract and general. The products are not regulated in detail,” said Fabio Versolatto, an intellectual property lawyer at Rentsch Partner in Zurich. In fact, the Federal Act on Foodstuffs states that “substitutes and imitations must be characterised and advertised in such a way that the consumer can recognise the type of foodstuff and distinguish it from products with which it could be confused”.
I totally agree. It was a beachside cafe that had hippie vibes and I kind of just assumed. Was not pleasant when I bit into it on the beach and realized my error. Didn’t blame the cafe at all.
