So so so many 18-45yr olds are just staying here and hoping to not get caught on an overstay for long enough that when they inevitable do get sent home the war will be over.
Disgusting really. Their country invaded a neighbouring country, are killing and torturing civilians and meanwhile those fuckers are in a tropical paradise partying.
I do. Moved here after the war started. Lived in Russia for close to 2 decades and have many Russian friends and my wife is Russian. I do speak Russian, although with errors, never really polished it, but good enough for chatting over a beer in a pub. So yes, i can understand it when i hear Russians chatting in the streets as well.
Exactly. I had a friend sign a petition at the start of the war and within 24 hours she had gotten a call from her work and her boss was terrified for her asking her what she signed because someone was asking her questions and that they would have to talk about it with the police.
It's cool I guess. The local economy needed the boost badly and I'm sure most of the Russians on an overstay are the ones that do not agree with the war.
