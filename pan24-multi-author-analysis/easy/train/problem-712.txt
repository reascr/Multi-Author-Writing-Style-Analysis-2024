Another wave from Belarus territory is possible if not likely, but still will not involve Belarusian forces to great extent - they are not embedded into Russian structure, so Putin would probably try to do the same they do elsewhere use Belarusian troops as cannon fodder, throw them into meatgrinder just to exhaust Ukrainian defence, everyone is aware of that - Lukashenko too and he will resist on the basis this bringing risk of an open revolution in Belarus (Russia does not want that).
That video was fantastic. Very even handed assessment that took a lot of variables into account. My money is on Belarus sitting on their thumbs bc Lukashenko is kinda in checkmate.
My degree is entirely theoretical. When I first started studying planes they asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I told them I had a theoretical degree in physics, so they said welcome aboard!
