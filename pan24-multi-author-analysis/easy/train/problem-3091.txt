and don't forget, I was the first person to ever bring it up, nobody was talking about Antifa before I said something, and remember the Fake News laughed, they thought it was funny, until their Houses and their Cities burned down, then it was maybe not so good, and I did a lot, they wanted to change the 20, take away one of our Great Presidents Andrew Jackson, One Of The Greats, and I'm at the top of that list by the way, and they called him Old Hickory, not a lot of people know that, but that's ok, and you know we went from a World of Total Beauty under Trump we had 100% of an Economy, and a 100% America, but now look what we have, Sleepy Joe is letting China, and even Japan, they're walking all over us, he's letting President Putin make him look so so bad over there, and we had a Great Relationship, he likes me a lot and I like him quite frankly. you know we probably would've never had a Cold War if I was President, I mean Reagan he was good, I'm better, but he was good no doubt, and he tried, he tried, not like Obama, he gave Iran a lot of Nuclear and now we're paying for it Big Time, he Unleashed Iran and Iraq and he Unleashed North Korea, and here we are, and I can tell you if we get 4 More Years of Sleepy Joe's Disastrous Policies we're gonna burn up, there'll be nothing left, ok, no need to thank me, enjoy yourselves, you're welcome.
