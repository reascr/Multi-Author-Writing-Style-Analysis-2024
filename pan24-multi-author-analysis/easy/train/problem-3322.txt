In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
>I agree. The vast majority of House members come from safe districts where they are chosen by a tiny fraction of the electorate working from scant information. They never get a proper vetting because the parties can’t be bothered and local media has been decimated. Since the Santos revelations, The Post’s Jacqueline Alemany and Alice Crites identified several holes in biographical claims by freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), and Tennessee’s NewsChannel 5 found discrepancies in the résumé of freshman Rep. Andrew Ogles (R-Tenn.). Like Santos, both lawmakers played the victim, claiming persecution by leftists.
