Since 2016 there's a rise in religious conservatism here, and the conservative party had been pushing this to be included in the revised criminal code (for years, our criminal code is pretty much a translation of the Dutch criminal code imposed upon us when they were our colonizers, so there had been an attempt to make a revised criminal code of "our own making.").
100 years most Westerners considered Indonesians immoral, hedonistic and sexually promiscuous. Balinese women went around topless until the 1960s. The Indonesian government stopped them because they wanted to attract western tourists.
That sounds actually really really dangerous. Not only you're a minority, people have reason to envy you. Isn't that essentially how Jews were for most of Europe's history? Had lots of money and controlled banking since Christians couldn't lend at an interest. Didn't exactly do them any favours.
Fuck oppressive religions, especially Islam. Why you ask? Do you not have eyes to see?! All you Islam simps can save your comments. Religion is illogical, irrational and an anchor around our necks. Unbelievable how many people in the world believe in magic. Grown ass adults who can think for themselves. Ridiculous.
