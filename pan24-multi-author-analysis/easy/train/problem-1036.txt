In any army, a ton of manpower is spent on non-combat roles: truck drivers, military police, construction, guarding supply lines, and also patrolling and protecting the country’s borders. With a peacetime army, I’d be wasting trained soldiers escorting supply convoys, protecting rear areas, and just loading and unloading shit on and off trains and trucks. If I had a ton of new conscripts, I’d put my conscripts in these roles and move the trained soldiers to the front lines. I’d also use conscripts to guard non-conflict borders and move the combat troops from there to the front lines.
Of course, what I said above is only if there’s still professional combat troops available. If all those are gone and they’re truly scraping the bottom of the barrel for every last man, then yeah, they’re pretty much fucked.
There is collaborative evidence. Circumstantial granted, very circumstantial. Some alleged captive Russians that decided to fight for Ukraine did a press conference thing. They wore ski masks and didn't identify themselves so at best they are ATM, alleged Russian turncoat/s. It seems they may be operating as a detachment within a larger unit. I think most likely propoganda but it is a possibility none the less.
