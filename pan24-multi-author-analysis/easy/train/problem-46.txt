Yes, but there are investigative processes that need to take place before such a claim can be definitively made against another world power. Crimes against humanity is a big accusation, and changes our relationship diplomatically. Add to that the 1 year anniversary of invasion timing, and it makes sense. Unlike the public acting as judge and jury, rallying around guilt without the proper access to all info, governments need to tread carefully as a single designation can spark new and devastating conflict.
lol. Trump was not the first time it happened. In fact, Obama deported more people than any other president. We don't get to complain about others while we're also ACTIVELY doing the same thing. Unbelievable that I should have to explain that.
Wasnâ€™t to long ago we separated families at our southern border and currently we have a few governors who gleefully like to bus and fly immigrants and asylum seeking to various places without so much a thought to tell the authorities of the place they are sending the passengers, but also not even doing the curtesy of telling the passengers where they are going.
