Plenty of immigrants fled their home countries to America to escape danger and persecution, so they were also basically "forced out". And who is "We"? There were plenty of Jewish people who willingly left the area to live in places such as Europe etc. Unless a Jewish family in modern times can produce legitmate proof showing that that specific family was forced out, such claims so far in the past are pretty nonsensical.
Dude what? I asked in my first post if you were familiar with The Shaw Commission of 1930. They issued The Shaw Report, and in that report they concluded that all Jewish land acquisition was done legally. Here.
> Herzl was not alone in framing the settling of Jews as a colonial project, and other Jewish organizations (including those settling Jews in other parts of the world like Argentina, or non-Zionists organizations settling Jews in the Levant) also actively used the vocaublary of colonialism to describe the process.
Ok, I’ll bite. Exactly who’s land was stolen? How familiar are you with the origins of this conflict? Are you familiar with the Ottoman land reforms of the mid to late eighteenth century? Are you familiar with The Shaw Commission of 1930? Pray tell.
