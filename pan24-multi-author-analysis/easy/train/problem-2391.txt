Lol ... let's not be hypocritical here. We eat millions and millions of chickens, pigs and cows every day, and suddenly a little donkey skin is no-no?
Since donkeys are not endangered (40M+ population in the world), there shouldn't be a problem eating them then, according to your logic. Good that we clear that up.
The lawsuit claims the e-commerce giant is illegally selling products that contain "Ejiao" a gelatin made from the skin of donkeys and used in various products like health supplements - in violation of California animal welfare law.
The US Center for Contemporary Equine Studies is suing Amazon for selling products containing a donkey derivative, despite efforts from advocacy groups to halt the practice.
According to the Brooke USA Foundation, a group fighting against Amazon in support of donkey welfare, ejiao acts as &amp;quot;a hard gel that can be dissolved in hot water or alcohol to be used in food or drink, or in beauty products such as face creams.&amp;quot; Some advocacy groups and consumers claim companies are deceptively using the substance, contributing to the slaughter and skinning of millions of donkeys a year.
Okay thanks for the info. This is certainly the first most in here including myself are hearing about this issue. If you have time, Iâ€™d suggest updating your other comment with sources so people could learn more. I legitimately thought everything you said was pointed out in this article.
