My mom is in a district in Wisconsin and got lucky because most admin here are former teachers. But there’s a lot of nepotism that lead to those hires and some are absolutely atrocious. Luckily the bad don’t last past a couple years until they tank everything. And now we’re constantly dealing with parents threatening to campaign for school choice if you don’t implement or remove x,y,z and charter schools here don’t require teachers to be certified.
Some? In most southern california districts the average teacher has only lasts about 2 to 3 years. Beginning pre covid teachers were leaving left and right because parents refuse to let the teachers do their job and schools keep hiring career bureaucrats and business people as administration. The distrust between the classroom and the offices have never been higher and teachers are feeling left out to dry. Unless you're in a private school (which often isn't much better) or a really wealthy district, the pay/benefits aren't even close to worth it.
