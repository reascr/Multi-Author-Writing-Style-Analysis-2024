Yeah. Greene won re-election as did Boebert even if the latter election was close. Trump had the second highest number of votes cast in US history. Most of those folks are still around.
Republicans are an anti democratic, anti-American, violently hostile insurgency. They’ve embraced being the “and domestic” in our military oath of enlistment. They’re fucking terrorists. I fully expect them to try for their “turner diaries day of the rope” and I don’t expect powers that be to respond appropriately, because the terrorists are white Christians who were born in places like Kansas City and Cleveland, not Fallujah & Kabul. They’re not “black or brown.” America negotiates with WHITE terrorists.

Totally. Politicians pander, and these whackos are still a huge force and source of votes. If Trump can somehow pass as Christian, then anything is possible for an even seemingly logical candidate once it’s time to get the votes. It’s not going away. They will choose their new idol soon and have some insane reasoning why they read the tea leaves wrong but this person will ACTUALLY be the one to round up all the pedophiles in global tribunals after 3 days of darkness.
