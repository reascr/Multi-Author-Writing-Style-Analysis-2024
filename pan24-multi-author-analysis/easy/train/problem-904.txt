In any case, it shocks me to no end that for a certain section of the old money, these medieval practices never really ended, alongside good ol' boy networks, nepotism, and feudal style inheritance. If you brought an aristocrat from 1500 to today, he'd probably do just fine, likely because he directly had a hand in passing down those practices and customs. We just don't pay attention to most rich people, especially old money, and also because the US doesn't really have native aristocrats.
Yes. The fucking answer is yes. Do you live in America? Do you understand the concept of transparency? Did you not think we had the right to know what happened behind Iran Contra? Or, Watergate? Or White Water? Or January 6th? The Constitution demands transparency for the people. They are supposed to answer to us. Thats the way its written. Our leaders have been implicated in Epsteins crimes. We absolutely have the right to know. WTF? Dont tell me im not answering the question when you dont even understand the basic principle of the question you're asking.
