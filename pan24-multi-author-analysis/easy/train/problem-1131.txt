I disagree, and think Mulvaney effectively hamstrung the CPFB in a way that is, in my opinion, irrecoverable. Whether it was eliminating the ability for the org to demand settlements with lending institutions, or letting the credit bureau hack go unpunished, there is a long list of enacted by Mulvaney to kneecap the organization to the point of it being less of a regulatory institution than one set to "bargain" for damages in a way that protects credit, lending and banking institutions from more severe penalties and sanctions that the court system could enact. The purpose of the CFPB is more to protect these institutions from harsher penalty, as Mulvaney made it much more friendly to big banking/lending. Not being in the pocket of these institutions was the original point of the agency. Elizabeth Warren .
That's... not entirely true. The beauty of the CFPB is that its major functions are written into law via the Dodd-Frank Act. 2018 marks the year CFPB lost the case protecting its Director as for-cause, which ultimately didn't matter as the Trump administration engineered multiple bullshit reasons to fire whoever they needed to - proving that "for-cause" executive agency heads are not really a thing.
