The fact of the matter is that Xi needs a signature success to hang his hat on. All the previous leaders had a signature policy that they can point to and say that was what made them great. Xi was originally on the "made China respected" train with the Olympics being a success and a 'coming out' party for China to be a co-equal on the world stage. Between that, the yuan becoming a reserve currency, and China taking the lead on a number of international organizations it seemed that was going to be the defining thing. But... a lot of that stuff didn't go great. The Winter Olympics they held a few years later had a lot of people questioning why there industrial parks mixed among the ski slopes and a lot of people were boycotting stuff over the treatment of the Uighur. So that ended up a bust.
Well, history shows that this sophisticated surveillance balloon has been part of recognized Chinese territory for thousands of years, and as a part of traditional Chinese lands, the American warmongers have taken a disappointing action in violation of national sovereignty that requires a response.
