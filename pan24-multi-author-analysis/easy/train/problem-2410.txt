Biden has held zero campaign rallies to expand public insurance. Instead his administration has carried forth a trump plan to further privatize Medicare. If he runs again I'll vote Republican. More inflation in healthcare because Biden refuses to do anything to take on his corporate lobbyists will mean an even worse economy. I'm not willing to sit through another 4 years with another midterm where Republicans pick up even more congressional seats all while Biden lets corporate media gaslight the country into believing we have to lower wages to fight inflation instead of just taking on the industry that has increased prices the most over the last 2 decades.
Better hope he wins. However, I hope democrats realize how much credibility is being incinerated with this 2 term Biden deal. People were scared of Trump, but there is going to be hell to pay the next election cycle in 2026.
