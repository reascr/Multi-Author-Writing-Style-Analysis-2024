The investigation involves his tax returns. Devon Archer was convicted of fraud based on dealings of a separate firm he was a part of and Hunter Biden had nothing to do with that firm. The James Gillar communication was a text message regarding a deal that was being negotiated with Tony Bobulinski, who was advertising that he had several wealthy Chinese contacts that he could potentially bring on as clients. The partnership with Bobulinski never went through. This was also in 2017 when Joe Biden was no longer VP.
Kushner absolutely should also be investigated. His deals with Qatar Saudi Arabia and Israel are of course sketchy. There is a deeply embedded culture in Washinon, of connected persons leveraging those connections and then kickbacks come back to the politicians who can exert political power. It's blatantly obvious why Jared Kushner or Hunter Biden can even do these deals - something is expected in return. Democrats that insist on pretending that the Hunter Biden story is a nothingburger are part of the problem, in my view.
