Bro... Imagine if they took $100 billion of it and just gave it to NASA. If they had that kind of budget 20 years ago, we'd just now be making a colony on Ganymede or something.

really, you mean the unqualified nobody who was appointed AFTER Trump lost the election who specifically ordered all national guard deployments have to get his approval days before the coup attempt and then inexplicably delayed deployement of said troops for hours during the insurrection says he was working to protect against trump all this time and you believe him?
