Look at Iran today. Rioting in the streets, currency tanking, officials transferring wealth out of the country and standing on the verge of regime change,... The punishment may be closer than we think. At least we can hope this is the case.
Exactly. It’s been in the works for sometime. The U.S. is going to attack Iran, and I never say such hyperbolic shit, but they’ve been piecing the reasons together for years.
I’m genuinely not too into conspiracies and all that shit but there’s so much about Iran over the last few months that I suspect the U.S. is building a foundation for military action against Iran. They do the same thing every time there’s a conflict. The whole world will say something must be done and the US will be the one to raise their hand when they intended to anyways.
Probably surrender. You can’t make a common enemy not arm your enemy. It’s like Russia telling USA not to arm Ukraine. Doesn’t work like that. Either surrender or keep on fighting without whining.
Yea , If you can’t fight, surrender. You can’t whine your way into winning a war. Specially if you are fighting with a nation that’s equipped with most nuclear weapon.
