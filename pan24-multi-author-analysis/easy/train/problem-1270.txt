If you talk about the actions of the Soviet army, I think it's important to note that while the biggest nationality prob was Russian, Ukraine also comprised a large chunk of that force. Belorussians, Georgians etc also contributed.
I have a farm in Alaska. During harvest one time 10 years ago, nobody was there that day. Then all the sudden 6-7-8 cars come down the driveway all together. They were all old cars and filled with Russians. The proceeded to get their buckets and I showed them where the black currents were. ( they LOVE these). Then in an hour or so, one older lady came to me and asked about some small grafted trees I had for sale in the back of the 70 ft greenhouse, ( far away from the parking lot and current patch). She asked 100 questions. When we came out all the cars were gone except hers. All my fruit was gone, apx 400 pounds, my entire harvest. She claimed she didn’t know any of those ppl. I had two children and lived on 16-18 k a year. Money was tight for me also and they stole all. That’s was just one year , so I won’t bore you of all the years since. But yea, wish Biden would tell all the Russians to leave the US. Why are they still here?
