It would take something much bigger than a single long distance attack for NATO to declare war, no politician wants to send their people to die if they can help it and provoking NATO wouldn't make sense either given that Russia's pretty much beaten by now, if a formal declaration of war was put forward Putin could announce country wide mobilization and that's it, all that would get him is thousands of demoralized, untrained and poorly equipped infantry so that's very unlikely to happen.
Decades? LOL. The war in Ukraine started in 2014 with the capture of Crimea. Unless you’re insinuating the US was behind Chechen Wars you’re not making sense. Even during the Cold War there wasn’t a conflict in Eastern Europe even remotely like this one, not since WWII. The breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s was not a border conflict with Russia.
Isn’t the investigation still ongoing? I’m with you tho I highly suspect it was an Ukrainian missile, however I question why a soviet era rocket was used. Was Ukraine not given newer military equipment, also how does an old Soviet era missile even work in newer air defense system? These are questions I’m curious about. (I have no real knowledge on military equipment so I might be asking dumb questions).
