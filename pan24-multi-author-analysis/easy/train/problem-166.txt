Ha. You assume too much if you think they have any idea about what this bill means for actual trans people. Just look at Bulso's quote.

Exactly. Whenever the child-GRS myth comes up I point out that “normalization” surgery on intersex newborns is often literally what they are describing, but these bills have carveouts to protect such surgeries because it’s not actually about protecting children it’s about conformity and hate.
You're not alone. I know these assholes are out here trying to make you feel like shit, but you're not unwanted in this world. Even before I knew I was the parent of a transgender kid, I was in awe of the courage it takes trans folks to live their lives in honesty. Despite what these rightwing fuckbags say, you're worthy of living a beautiful life, and the world is a better place with you in it. I promise. Take a breath, take a break, and we'll keep fighting for you while you do, okay? Hang in there, friend. We need you.
