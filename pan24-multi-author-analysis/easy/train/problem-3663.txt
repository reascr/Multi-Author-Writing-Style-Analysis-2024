It’s boring paint-by-numbers fascism. After a decent amount of brain washing (30 years of white angertainment Faux News) the weak minded are made to simultaneously believe their enemy is both weak and strong at the same time. I mean, last week it came out that these talking heads know their viewers are crazy morons and talk to each other about it, cause they’re grifters and they have no problem lying if it’s for ratings.
