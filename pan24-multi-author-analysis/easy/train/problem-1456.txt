Yeah, although I would think this is also a more modern concept. There was probably less to learn about environment in terms of gaining significant advantage compared to now. You basically had to just learn how to avoid obvious mistakes, many of what might have been pre-programmed by evolution. It would've been much more lower hanging fruit in terms of evolutionary fitness to be able to just survive and reproduce than to gain wisdom and attain advantage from that. So that probably started to change when people started learning about tools and how to use them, then there might have been more to learn, but maybe still not enough to provide decades of learning/wisdom like now is required for many fields. So that also makes intelligence an interesting aspect, because the sort of intelligence people might have, might not have given immediate obvious advantages, but at certain point obviously it started to become overwhelmingly advantageous.
Yeah. I can see why Westerns are popular, at least on tv. There aren’t many frontiers left in the real world (Space? Unexploited nature? Technological or scientific progress that comes without a massive cost?) and the metaverse isn’t ready for prime time at all.
That's a great point that's so often overlooked: natural evolutionary processes depend on a constant population churn to generate more input into selection, so if we go down the dubious road of assigning "intent" or "design" to something emergent, then it could really be said that nature/evolution "wants" people to die as early as possible as long as it misses unduly impacting the viability of subsequent generations.
