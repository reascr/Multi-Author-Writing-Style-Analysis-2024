All Pete has to say is, "Here is my $20B infrascture plan to upgrade the technology at all US airports. All it needs is the Repugs approval.".
So he effectively failed to advocate for guaranteed benefits (benefits that he enjoys) within his own administration when that administration had complete control over forcing through a contract.
That's not true. He was directly commissioned because of his exceptional education. Pete is a Rhodes Scholar that went to Harvard and Oxford and speaks 8 languages. He worked in Naval Intelligence.
2) I’m just gonna pretend that none of the homophobic undertones of this argument exist, there hasn’t been a SINGLE documented instance of his availability causing an issue in processing under the DoT, in fact there are multiple references from both department leads and members of Congress where he took meetings at the hospital his children were under intensive care in. I would love to see something backing up this claim about ppl being told they didn’t have authority to address issues because these departments are designed to be able to maintain functionality while their heads are working on other projects.
And how do you know this? He has run for two ambitious positions. DNC Chair and POTUS. Both were done with 0 name recognition. And he outperformed on the POTUS one. He could easily get governor or senate position if he really wanted it. Dude's favorability is the in this administration, higher than Biden and Kamala. He also beat the current President Biden in a NH poll for 2024. Pete is very electable. So saying he can't get elected out of SB is a really silly political statement.
