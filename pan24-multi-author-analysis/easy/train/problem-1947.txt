The services they say they provide are already provided by State agencies. Interpreter services for over 160 languages are standard at SOS and DMV. Those interpreters are vetted and certified to uphold certain standards to ensure the applicants actually understand the rules of the road for driving in that state. Major medical facilities have printed signs showing various languages on how to request an interpreter to assist with healthcare needs. Again, the interpreters are held to certain standards. Are the Chinese agents in these special centers held to such centers? Who knows. If they claim diplomatic immunity, they need not disclose any information on their policies. This should be considered highly suspect.
There are so many fucking Chinese people in Southern California: international students, green card immigrants, China-born naturalized US citizens, US-born Chinese-Americans, etc. and thatâ€™s not even counting all the Taiwanese variants of the above since they probably consider Taiwanese as Chinese.
