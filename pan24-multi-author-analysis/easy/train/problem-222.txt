This is a generational educational problem, but weaponized and amplified. America, like any State, uses it's educational system (which includes culture) to help perpetuate that State. But when the Fox News's and social media groups start using a kernel of truth here and there in a lie to inflame a base or group (like the anti-abortion/trans "protesters" or Proud Boy and/or "militia" folks) and then use them as both a voter base and as a "Sword of Damocles" over the heads of joe-blow conservative politicians we start to see our modern problems in American society reveal themselves. The latter being the only real fear-based, lizard-brain reason I can think of that someone in an important political position, conservative or not, in this country would not comment on or take action against these home-grown sociopaths calling in bomb threats to children's hospitals, plotting to/destroying power grids, and/or violently charging State institutions.
I do. After all, conservatives are all about "personal responsibility", right? Of course they always mean for others, not themselves.
