Sorry, no. Them being trapped with Trump doesn't mean _they're secretly reasonable or good_. Where did you get that idea? What it means, simply, is that Mitch McConnell and the rest of the establishment GOP would much preferably have someone like DeSantis, so they can continue their Reaganite / evangelical policies without the element of fraction and volatility now exists (because in reality Trump's ego is totally just focused on Trump).
> For the House G.O.P. today, an equivalent escape is imaginable. Its majority could be used to pass a series of messaging bills on issues where conservatives have, or might have, an advantage with the public: a crime bill, a border security bill, a bill highlighting issues with military recruitment and readiness, reforms to academic funding and tax breaks and school standards that aim to weaken the elite-college cartel and influence the educational culture wars, some version of the pro-family policies that pro-life groups have pushed for in the wake of Dobbs. In each case the goal would be to position the party on ground where the concerns of activists and independent voters might overlap and set the G.O.P. up for success in 2024.
