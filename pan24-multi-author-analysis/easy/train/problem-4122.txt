That's just you, and you think your smarter than average. Everybody thinks they are smarter than average, half of them aren't. So you might win, and you might have friends that can bail you out if you fail, but just as many will make that bet and fail, and those people will be a drain on you and me and everyone else that exceeds any benefit. Social Security is the single greatest government program ever invented in this country. It's been so good for so long that you have no idea of the poverty that it prevents. Conservatives and their ilk have been demonizing it and trying to kill it for as long as it has been a thing. It needs to be expanded, the caps need to be bumped up. It's great.
The GOP is going to try to dismantle social security claiming they will eventually come up with a fantastic replacement (while plundering that cash stockpile), meanwhile many of their voters who rely on SS are going to probably starve and/or become homeless.
Exactly. Every "reform" to the welfare state has only ever meant a hollowing out to the point of near-uselessness. Just look at what we did to food stamps for one example of this.
