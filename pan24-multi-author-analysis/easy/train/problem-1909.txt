See I understand that when it comes to the more sophisticated weaponry like fighter jets. But they seemed to pick up and learn the artillery and the anti tank weapons like the javelins and TOW missiles.
Exactly. I 100% agree. I very strongly support sending ATACMS to Ukraine, this is literally the perfect war for them. In most wars, the USAF would have bombed all the high-value targets long before the Army gets to them. ATACMS has a "measly" 190 mile range, while the USAF was sending B-52 bombers from the continental US to bomb targets in Iraq and then flying them back home. Even Tomahawk cruise missiles have a 1,000+ mile range. The Ukrainians already know how to use HIMARS and M270 GMLRS too. If we don't send them, then it was a waste of money making them if they never get used and just collect dust in a warehouse somewhere, plus it would be supporting the freedom of an underdog nation. Lastly, ATACMS is going to be retired and replaced by Precision Strike Missile anyway. Better they be used to support a worthy cause than destroyed because the whole system simply got retired.
