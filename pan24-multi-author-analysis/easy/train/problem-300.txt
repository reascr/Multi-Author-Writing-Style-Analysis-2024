Wow. I can’t figure it out. It’s shocking. And then these young adults have the audacity to ….buy themselves nicer things….
Really? Where do you even get that a huge majority of people go through life NEVER buying a luxury item? Most people I know have some sort of a luxury. People don't need a gaming PC, they could do with integrated graphics because why is gaming even necessary, anyway. People don't need an iPhone 14 Pro when they could do with a hand-me-down iPhone SE. People don't need a full-fledged laptop when a Chromebook probably does them just fine. People don't need the highest speed Internet when they could probably do fine with basic level Internet. I mention tech items because people who dismiss fashion items often have zero issue spending on luxury tech purchases.
