I truly believe it's by design to get rid of people with French as a 2nd language with some collateral damage for some foreign Francophones. I used to live in Quebec and I don't think the locals understand how much the system is set up to try to screw over immigrants. My occupation was regulated so I was expected to get tested in French by the OQLF in order to switch my geo stagiaire to my PGeo designation. A colleague was Francophone (but not from Quebec) and failed his test. It's well known to be graded extremely harshly. There's also some newspaper articles about people who did law school in Quebec and sat their bar exam in French yet they failed the language test, and doctors who did med school in French but also failed the language test. I decided to just cut my losses when the PQ government got into power because living in Quebec after that was so horrendous (more racism and hate towards anglophones stirred up) and they were tightening everything up with OQLF. Might as well move to a province where they're not purposely trying to make life harder for immigrants!
Interesting. Going to read about that. Some of the exams i've passed required an extremely good understanding of french while in CEGEP and university. The kind of sentences you had to read 2 or 3 times because they overcomplicated them.
