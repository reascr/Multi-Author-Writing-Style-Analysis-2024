Article 231 - The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.
Privyet. American here. I lived with some Russians once, have a Ukrainian friend, even know a Belarusian girl. I know you're all normal humans. Some people perhaps haven't had interactions with that culture. I for one love your culture, very solid. I tried learning Russian, no class at my university, but oh well. So we don't all hate you man, but this IS America, we've got our problems as well. I just hate your asshole president and government lol. But good luck to you friend, and be safe. Poka.
