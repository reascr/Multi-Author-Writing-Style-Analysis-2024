This is totally my boss. Wants people back in the office for “reasons”. Says she will come into the office on certain days then forgets that she has X, Y, or Z reason for why she can’t make it that day. We are both really busy, so we would be sharing an office on two different set of Teams meetings all day long. She even put on my performance review that I should come into the office 2 days a week for “collaboration” with other teams, except no one else is in the office. She wanted our 100% remote team to come back into the office 100% of the time for the same reason. Literally one of those “if I can’t see you working, you must not be working” type supervisors.
