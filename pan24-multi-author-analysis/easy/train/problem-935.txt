We knew this was coming- the opposition party has nearly always gained ground in midterms even in the best of times, which these are not. The democratic parties coalition is falling apart- not because the young or people of color or working class have given up, but because the republicans have had runaway success with ensuring that large swathes of the American public cannot vote. Democrats spent too long shoving progressives to the sidelines of the party in order to court corporate donors, upper middle class liberals, and the ever-vanishing "centrist" that they ended up being complicit via denial to republican undermining of democracy. The democratic parties' biggest victories have always been on the backs of the working class- and now when the party needs their fire again they have found it smothered. And to their horror they are holding the pillow with the enemy.
