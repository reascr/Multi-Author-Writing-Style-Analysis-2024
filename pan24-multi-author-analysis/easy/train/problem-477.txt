Switzerland’s “armed neutrality” was openly hostile towards the third reich. It was all they could do to maintain their territorial integrity surrounded by axis powers. Spain had just had an utterly devastating civil war (though that doesn’t excuse their nazi sympathies - Franco was a real piece of shit) and Winston Churchill commented of Sweden that they “ignored the moral issues of the war and played both sides for profit”. I think my comment holds up.
No no major sports commission on the world level takes political stances to avoid losing rights to play in those countries sell merch Yada Yada its the same agreement placed on the world Olympics stage ur not allowed to bring politics into It because it's not a political thing its a sports thing and should remain as such that's the view point to alot of world wide events with sports as it should be and as it should remain.
100% this. For all of their moral grandstanding, none of the European teams actually boycotted this World Cup, they all went and played.
