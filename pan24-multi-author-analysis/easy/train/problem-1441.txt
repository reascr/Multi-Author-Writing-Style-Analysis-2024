I agree but disagree. NPR, or at least morning edition, all things considered etc. try to play the neutral arbiter role. They ALWAYS give both sides of a story even if one side (Republican) is bat shit crazy. There is fair criticism there, but Iâ€™ve seen, or rather heard, host like Steve and Coki push back hard on the crazy talk. So to imply they promote right wing bullshit is disingenuous IMO. I say this not as a centrist but someone who gets most of their news commentary from left wingers like TYT, majority report, secular talk etc.

The legacy is another slew of do-nothing, ineffectual, political appointee bureaucrats. The money these clowns make in relation to what they accomplish is astonishing. Also it effectively neutralized Tom Ridge as a potential republican presidential candidate, to make room for the Bush boys. At the very least, things are the same as before the department was implemented. I'd say worse.
