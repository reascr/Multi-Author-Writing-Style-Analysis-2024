Fair point, but that is the result of their refusal to use better vaccines. Perhaps this is the best they can do but I feel like there is a lot of over-reaction. When human lives are on the line erring on the side of caution is my preference but they should have followed the science and seen that good social practice AND mRNA vaccines is the right move. They are just worried about admitting that the western mRNA vaccines are superior. Again, their insecurity is biting them in the ass. I firmly believe that China could make a great mRNA vaccine and we would have helped them.
EDIT: Unfortunately people are downvoting because they disagree. Downvoting pushes comments down so that they are less visible. Right now there are three groups in the US: People who suffer Long Covid, people who know others who suffer Long Covid, and people who don't care because it hasn't affected them. If you don't care then don't push down on the people who do. We are more sick of hearing about Covid and living around it than anyone, believe me.
