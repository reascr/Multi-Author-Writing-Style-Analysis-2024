>The Chairman of the Brest City Executive Committee in Belarus, Alexander Rogachuk, announced on Telegram that the troops are advancing as soon as possible.
Relax everyone. There's little chance Belarus would invade Ukraine. Their military is too small and weak to make a real dent. Also, there is no clear viable axis of advance for any ground attacks. Not to mention that most Belarusians don't want to fight a war against Ukraine. In fact, many of them are against the war in general and sabotaged railways to hamper the Russian supply movements early in the war. Many Belarusians actually volunteered to fight for Ukraine and are there fighting right now. Belarus is doing its job by simply keeping the Ukrainians stationed near their border. It costs nothing and achieves the same results.
The military has shown only a minimum of support for the little dictator, the people of Belarus have shown an active resistance against him, and the actual winner of the last presidential election is quite vocal and very present in Belarusâ€”despite her not actually being in the country. (Her husband, who was basically imprisoned for running against Lukashenko is still in prison.).
we developed technologically, but not mentally. we are mentally still like little toddlers who fight over their little toys and complete bullshit. just that we have way more ways of killing each other than toddlers..
