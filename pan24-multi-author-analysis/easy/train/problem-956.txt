It’s always tempting to blame third party candidates for being election-spoilers, but there’s rarely any evidence or reasoning going into those narratives beyond “their vote total exceeded the margin between the two main candidates and I really wish my person had gotten those votes instead.” In reality, third-party voters don’t usually form a cohesive bloc that would otherwise have overwhelmingly voted for one of the two major parties.
I lived in GA for over 30 years. Everything I learned about GA politics in that time tells me that Walker is going to lose the runoff and it will not be close. Hershel has no enthusiasm for him and he's clearly on the more extreme side of republicans. GA has clearly rejected this particular type of insanity in both 2020 and 2022. The race was only close because of down ballot votes. White people will show up to vote for Kemp against Stacy Abrams, but there is no way they show up just to support Hershel, especially when it will not flip the senate to Republican control. Enthusiasm for Walker is through the floor, he won't have support from down ballot voters, and voters for Warnock are highly motivated to make a statement that GA is no longer the deep red state that it used to be. Much more purple now.
