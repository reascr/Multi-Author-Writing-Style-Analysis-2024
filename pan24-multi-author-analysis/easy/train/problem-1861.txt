I think these announcements are now in the style of North Korea - they are merely posturing on the world stage just so their national news outlets can tell a story about their hypothetical strenh. The rest of the world rolls their eyes.
Exactly. And the truth is that Putin would use nukes if he wanted to regardless of Russian policy. This whole signal of maybe changing their nuke military doctrine to include first strike is just more sabre rattling from Putin. Putin can't make overt threats about using nukes anymore because that pissed off China and Xi told him to STFU about using nukes because all that talk was threatening to fuck up China's money. Russia is more dependent on China now than ever so he had to comply, which means he can't make direct nuclear threats anymore but he can male veiled threats like these warning that the threat of nuclear war is at all time highs and that Russia might change its nuke military doctrine accordingly to defend itself. It's all bullshit.
Strategic ambiguity. "No first use" formally ties American hands in defense of Taiwan and gives China a set of rules to game, while the rules are unclear they're theoretically unable to move. We probably wouldn't nuke China over Taiwan as it stands, but the PRC may fear it. Taiwan's a bitch (that is to say, a massive challenge. It occurs to me that American slang might be misleading here).
