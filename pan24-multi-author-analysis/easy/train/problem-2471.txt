In theory, no. In actuality i think the political system in the US is too corrupted and rigid for a 3rd party, because said 3rd party would essentially act as a vote splitting party to either ensure a perennial democratic or republican leadership.
Nashville. We realize it is a Republican stronghold but it is nothing like the far right in Florida. People here seem to mostly act like Bush era Republicans. In eight months, I have seen literally one Trump sticker/sign. Not a single Trump “rally” on the side of the road which was a weekly event where we lived. Also, regardless of politics, people here are generally nice and respectful to each other. I will also point out that we identify as moderates.
Exactly. Didn't learn from their Tea Party experience, didn't learn from tRump. Here's my take, conservatives are typically poor strategists because they use the same playbook no matter how many times it fails. I see this in court with defense attorneys. They don't pivot, they turn like an aircraft carrier.
