My point is that you should learn to be a capitalist so you can use military and law enforcement agencies to maintain your power too. Then you'll be on a level playing field. Republicans always win because old evangelical Christians never miss a vote. Meanwhile, getting young people to vote is like pulling teeth. If you don't learn how to play the game in a capitalist and democratic country, you'll always lose. It's a lot easier to just take over the existing government via a vote than to overthrow the government in a revolution. It's a lot easier to just teach every worker to become a capitalist themselves than to overthrow capitalists in favor of labor. It's much more stable too.
Thirdly, buying stock is not actively participating in a company and reflects the myopia of capitalism wherein quarterly profits trump the long-term profits and any other measurable aspect or metric of a business (some businesses that make less money are better for the customer and employees, not that an investor would actually care).
