I agree with everything you said, except for the statement that the military was less effective over the last 20 years. In the military actions that would be considered “conventional warfare”, I.e. large movements, shock and awe, taking objectives, the military passed with flying colors. The reality is that the style of fighting that Iraq and Afghanistan devolved into presented unique challenges that our government and society were not totally ready to face, i.e., an enemy that hides amongst a populace, restricted rules of engagement that halted or hindered mission integrity, and the concept of fighting an “idea”. Had we fought Iraq and Afghanistan from start to finish conventionally, both conflicts would have been over very quickly, but with civilian losses that some might not be able to stomach.
Really? China is accusing us of “Salami Slicing” tactics? That’s like being called out for fiduciary irresponsibility by Bernie Madoff. The Chinese are the masters of the “eating an elephant one bite at a time” school of international relations. If you want proof of that just look at a time series map of Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.
