Rural Amurkan here. Yeah, they love to hate on windmills here in the Midwest. People get whipped up into frenzies about how ugly they are and peddle conspiracy theories. But some of these companies really are out to get peopleâ€¦just not in the way they think. They target older rural landowners (who often depend on rental income from farmland to cover expenses and not particularly financially literate) and try to get them to lease the entirety of their farms (initially on an option basis). I totally get it ðŸ’¯when people groan and roll their eyes when they hear uneducated, conservative rural people make claims about wind power. But, as with any good Big Lie, there is a grain of truth in there. Large corporations are, in reality, making large land grabs in rural America. Most of these projects are exactly what they say they are: renewable power projects that will benefit rural landowners and their communities. However, some are naked land grabs. Some companies will include clauses in their lease agreements which transfer water and mineral rights to the leased land. When a leasing agent approached my own family, he could not promise that the land would actually be used for renewable energy. He also could not promise that the land would not be subleased for oil and natural gas exploration. So, again, there is just enough truth in the Rightâ€™s Big Lie here that it can gain some traction. They hope enough people believe it so we keep on burning coal. The best thing to do here is to give people who live in rural area facts about which companies have a commitment to environmental stewardship and community development. There is also an obligation for us to bring attention to the fact that greenwashing is a very real thing.
