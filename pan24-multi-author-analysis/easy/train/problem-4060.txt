It's an impossible task to re-pass all federal legislation and would basically destroy the rule of law in the united states, effectively overturning hundreds of years of legal precedent and, arguably, every amendment to the constitution, as well as making all military contracts, personnel and secrets evaporate. all of those things are federal laws that would need to be re negotiated. There simply isn't enough time to even review the military budget during a two year session. That's how insane this idea is.

No definitely impossible. Absolutely impossible. Its like, not even close. It would require completely changing how congress works, which in turn would require a constitutional amendment. Even the founding fathers couldn't ratify and write just the constitution in a single congress. They had to postpone huge sections of it for future congresses to deal with. Now imagine that times ten thousand. And that's just the basic law before you get to budgeting.
