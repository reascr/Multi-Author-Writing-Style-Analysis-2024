Unfortunately, that's a distinct possibility. Even the Raffensberger call is more of an uphill battle to prosecute than you'd expect. The relevant Georgia law requires the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Trump intended for Raffensberger to commit election fraud. The tricky part is that he didn't actually say that: the words he said, taken literally, suggest he believed there were illegal votes and illegally discarded votes, and he wanted Raffensberger to investigate to find enough of these fraudulent votes to prove that he actually won Georgia. Of course this is complete bullshit, and we all know what he really meant, but the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove that he meant something different than what his words said. Unfortunately, proving Trump's guilty mindset at the time of the call is essential to convicting this crime.
