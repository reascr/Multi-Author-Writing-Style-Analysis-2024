Tbh, it's not a completely far fetched argument - even many leftists/centrists agree that at times, the SC was overreaching with his influence. It's possible that measured changes are needed, but the current reform is simply an all-out destruction of the system - pretty much destroying the SC's ability to influence in almost any case. In theory, if the reform passes as is, there will be nothing preventing a government majority to pass whatever law they want to, like outlawing the opposition or blatant racial discrimination.

So you have secular social liberals, secular social conservatives, secular social centrists, religious social conservatives, etc. And that's the simple part before those parties split up because of policies towards Palestinians.
The Knesset-overruling-independent-judiciary shit is terrifyingly authoritarian. Itâ€™s also shortsighted as hell. As these geezers die off, the face of parliament is apt to get less reactionary.
