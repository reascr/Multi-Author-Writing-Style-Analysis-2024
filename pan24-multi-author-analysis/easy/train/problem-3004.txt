Without the generic "CRT" label, the right would need to rile people up for each instance. They might be successful with some topics, but not all. With CRT, though, they've trained their base to dislike anything that's called CRT. Then, all they need to do is say "this thing is CRT" and their base gets riled up.
The right stripped CRT of any meaning so that it could be used against as many things as possible. Did a school tell kids that white slave owners bought and sold black people as property? That's CRT now. Did a teacher mention the Fugitive Slave Act and the Underground Railroad? It's CRT. Did an economics teacher mention redlining laws? CRT!
According to capitalistic ideals that conservatives (supposedly) prioritize, businesses "going woke" is precisely what "the market deciding for itself" actually looks like in the wild.
Are we at r/leopardsatemyface yet?? Corporations still keep donating to them and none of them seem to ever speak out about anything the right says about them. I’m still confused why Disney of all companies hasn’t publicly said anything or pushed back against DeSantis.
