It's also not clear how that person would govern. The Speaker needs to be able to pass legislation, but they wouldn't have much support from the Republican caucus. So would they be just passing Democratic-backed bills? And they would face regular motions to vacate from Republicans, so they'd have to continuously rely on Democratic votes to keep them in office. At that point, might as well just become a Democrat.
Doubtful you can get most Democrats to vote for a Republican speaker, let alone all. They have to answer to voters as well, and trying to explain a year or two after the fact that it was better than the alternative is a risky proposition when a primary challenger is attacking you for voting for a pro-life, pro-gun, etc. speaker.
However, since he admitted to molesting children in court, and at his sentencing the judge called him a "serial child molester" and imposed a sentence including sex-offender treatment, I'm willing to fudge the details on that one and still try and get people to remember him as a convicted child molester.
