Perhaps as a sign of friendship between nations Britain can help design a secure museum and research facility. Ultimately it could further multinational research and enable more openness.
Totally. The British Museum has a weird game with the government where they get cover for what they hang on to. Whichever you ask they’ll tell you it’s a question for the other to decide.
TIL returning stolen property is relatively unpopular. These comments sound stupid. The original pictures of these pieces of history, which most of yall I'd bet money never heard of or cared about, are clearly labeled "loot" and "more loot.".
Poland couldn't really have argued anything after World War 2, it was a broken country basically under Soviet occupation.
Poland had a government in exile at the time, which was the 'good' government, operating from France and then later UK as it was impossible for them to continue functioning inside Poland during the war.
So in a way it can be argued that the Western allies all just went with what USSR wanted, even if they had a legitimate (as in recognised by Polish people) government they could have included in the talks. If they didn't let USSR take over the role of governing Poland, the history would have gone differently, and a lot better for Poland.
Poland then 'renounced' their claim to German reparations in 1953, but it was a decision made by Moscow, and forced onto Poland. Again, a country led by a puppet government, and a directly controlled satellite state.
