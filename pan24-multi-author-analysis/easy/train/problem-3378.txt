Any. Fucking. Day. Now…I get that they want to have an airtight case before prosecution but we’ve all heard him say ‘I just need’ the votes. That is a crime, that is tampering, that is all that it should take. I’m so sick of this prick walking free.

Exactly. Enough with this shit. It could just as likely be nothing. It’s really hard to make a case when there is no clear cut crime. That’s why the rich get away with shit.
Oh and btw, as pointed out the other day ( ), US prisons in louisiana still resell the prisonners in slavery (they even sell unconvicted pre trial suspects that would have a bail in another state; they set it purposely too high like 5 millions then they can sell you off to some business as a "leased convict" as you can't afford to bail yourself out even with a bondsman); using the loophole in the XIII amendment, since it's yet another thing the GOP Is exploiting and the white house won't lift a finger upon.
