For example it doesn't matter if the russians have 10x the ammount of cannons if all the Russian ones are rusty soviet ones while Ukraine is fielding PzH 2000's and Ceasars, that would still give the ukrainians a conforable force advantage because of how much better those new guns are.
!? I'm pretty certain the 700,000 troops, the equipment they'll need to use for transport and attacking, and the supplies to keep them fed, clothed, armed, fueled, etc. would be spotted by satellite at the least.
The whole point of Verdun was to have a battle of attrition by attacking a target of wich they knew the French would defend it even at cost because of moral value of Verdun (It being the only fort that didn't break in 1871 despite being under siege).
And? That is what the Ukrainians did. Do you think the ruzzians attacked and the Ukrainians just popped their heads out the windows and said "Blyat You are in wrong country" and the ruzzians walked away? No, the ruzzians launched an offensive, and the Ukrainians drove back the offensive through force.
