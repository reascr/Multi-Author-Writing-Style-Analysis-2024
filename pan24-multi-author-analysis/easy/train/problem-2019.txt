When it seems clearly to be neo-imperial aspirations and such entitlement to Ukrainian land/control that any overtures to a different axis of power (aka working with “the West”) is seen as an existential threat to all of Russian pride.
True. True. I was thinking about Russia's latest threat "the west can't imagine the response for supplying arms to Ukraine." Yeah, all kinds of bad shit can happen. Bad things may happen anyway.
Under the constantly shifting auspices of “de-nazification” or to “demilitarize” or to “protect the Russian speaking population” or to “combat NATO infiltrators”.
Well, of course. Right after Biden placed a quarter million troops on the Ukrainian border and gave the order to invade with the shittiest equipment he could find, he hired Wagner to get in there and really fuck everything up. Checks out.
And then they just lie and lie and lie and lie and lie until those who hate “the West” for whatever reason are given a mental handhold to support this adventurism despite its justifications being shallow at best and a farcical absence at worst.
