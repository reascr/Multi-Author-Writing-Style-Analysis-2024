Their military was incredibly topheavy with significantly more officers than could be helpful, because it was designed to have a large conscripted force to fight under the command of experienced officers. This large conscripted force would still largely solve problems with sheer body count but with enough trained officers could actually be directed and useful. When solving problems this way there is minimized benefit to keeping your soldiers trained since they’re somewhat cannon fodder with a big benefit to keeping way too many officers trained. Instead they burned all of their officers and trained personnel at the start of the war with no conscripts or other cannon fodder to use in the intended manner promptly losing their ability to make strategic/tactical decisions on how to successfully use their soldiers, then they conscripted a large force but instead of being able to direct it as an overwhelming force they’re largely just wasted. Think the difference between having enough tanks to take staggering losses taking a UA city or literally just driving tanks into a minefield one by one until you lose the whole company without any benefit, Russia is spending large portions of their forces for no gain instead of concentrating overwhelming force into anywhere they they can make gains.
No. You have it all correct. I have served for 14 years, when we are given mission orders part of it is our 'arcs' or limits. We also get rules of engagement and commanders intent. All of this exists this way so we can accomplish our orders to how we see it being done. As in, you see a chance to achieve more? Go for it. Do you know of a way that is a little unconventional but could be just as effective? You use your judgement.
