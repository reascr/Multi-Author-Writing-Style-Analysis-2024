Well that article was very much a French intelligence press release. Think they're pissed of Total has been frozen out while Maduro is cutting a deal with Chevron.
Exactly. The US is already buying oil from Saudi and is buddies with them. Venezuela is less oppressive than Saudi which is openly anti LGBT and any women. Just that Venezuela weren't buddies with US earlier. Now if they are reconciling why should there be any more of a moral outage than it was before with Saudi. It wasn't about morality anyway. It is about money and power and doing business with the countries they need and who toes their line. Venezuela has come around now.
Agreed that they have huge corruption and have completely mismanaged their economy and I wouldnt consider them a democracy but they actually have an active opposition movement, they actually have regular opposition protests, they aren't in a war of aggression against a neighbour, and they aren't openly anti-women and anti-LGBT.
Who said that? India isn't buying oil to fight for world democracy. Just so you are not confused again, you gotta know that US isn't buying oil from the Venezuelan dictator or the Saudi Monarch to fight for world democracy either lol.
