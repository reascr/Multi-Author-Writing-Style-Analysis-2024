The data isn't pointing the opposite way. It's not pointing anywhere _at all_. Because we don't have any meaningful data. With few exceptions it isn't possible to extrapolate meaningfully from early vote data to electoral outcomes. It just isn't.
We know that early voters so far are, in terms of demographics: more white, more male, more old, and more rural than in 2018 and 2020, which youâ€™d think would be a good sign for Republicans except for the whole part where Democrats are leading by 4 million even with those demographic changes.
We know that Democrats have a more than 4 million vote lead so far in early voting, which is significantly greater than the percentages at this time in both 2018 and 2020.
We know that the Kansas abortion vote and the five special House races in the last half a year showed Democrats outperforming expectations by 10-20 points each time.
