Look at what is happening in the House right now with McCarthy, MTG, Santos, etc. You can argue that's because voters gave them a slim majority, but that doesn't change the fact that the establishment GOP is cow-towing to the fringe extreme-right. That has consequences as it moves the party to the right on policy when they do shit like holding the debt ceiling hostage, something voters clearly don't want.
Splitting the vote was precisely what I was thinking he might do, but by running third party if he doesn't have the backing of the establishment. That alone would be the end of republicans' chances in '24. There are a number of other ways he can sabotage republicans though. For example, if he loses a republican primary, he could spread conspiracy theories and lies about the primary being rigged, which would further divide the republican base and discourage turnout.
E.g. if you get 20 million out of 39 million votes (or however many Californian are registered voters), you win California, and all its Electoral College votes. If you get 39 million out of 39 million votes, you... also just win and get nothing that 20 million votes wouldn't have gotten you. That's why Biden's effective lead over Trump was less than 100,000 votes.
