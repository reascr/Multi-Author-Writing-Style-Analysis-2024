I'll mark your words and up the antie and tell you that there's nothing there. Just like there was nothing found when the Republicans lead investigations into Whitewater, Benghazi, and didn't even bother with an Obama investigation, etc. But, the Dems together with a couple of Republicans found a GIANT pile of evidence against trump. Not to mention that he was impeached, not once but twice during his 4 short years. So much damage was done by him with his Russian psyop affiliation. Such a sad, pathetic, and offensive assault against this country. If we get through this mess with our democracy intact, it will be a much stronger democracy. But, you can mark this word, if we don't, we will find ourselves blatantly ruled by Russian-like government tactics. We are already getting super close with so much wealth going to the 1%. Our oligarchs like their power and wealth as much as the Russians.
Really? Letting Saudia Arabia off the hook for assassinating journalists is a popular policy? Do you have a link that shows a majority of Americans want to support Saudia Arabia in this?
