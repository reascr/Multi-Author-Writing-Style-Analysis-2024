Dave Chappelle touched on this recently. He said (in so many words) that Trump won by admitting to everyone that he and all the other politicians were cheating on their taxes. Trump admitted to it, said that makes him smart, and people will continue to cheat their taxes until the laws are enforced. The fact alone that Trump was HONEST and admitted to something that no politician would ever admit to, instantly endeared him to a lot of people. He was right about it, too! It's one of the only things he was right about in the end, but of course he was only emboldened to break more laws even harder once he got into office.
Definitely not. I remember going to some gore thread, I remember a .webm file that showed a few Brazilian(?) dudes cut up a woman with a machete.. I still remember it, there's no context as to what led up to that; most of the time there's no context to these things. 4chan fosters the old school rube vs intellectual/professional mentality. US politics and history is filled with rubes' hateful rhetoric and actions. It only ends when they fully perish.
