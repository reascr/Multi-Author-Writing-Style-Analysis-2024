Most countries. Because starting a nuclear weapons program costs multiple points of your GDP in investment alone and once you have tried to acquire raw fissile material, almost every single major political and financial power will sanction your economy into dust. Iran has once again started their nuclear program and they are the second most sanctioned country in the world, only because the terrorist state of Russia overtook them for obvious reasons. Once the US and Israel actually get seriously worried about them making a functional warhead they’ll get sanctioned back into the times of great Persia. If the current Iranian regime is still in power by that point anyway and it’s entirely possible that after said sanctions another revolution could occur.
Hahaha! Credibility? I think they lost that around the second time they failed to prevent a genocide, despite having troops right there. In Rwanda's case the commander begged to raid weapon stockpiles. UN leadership said do nothing. Even when their troops were traumatized by the sounds of women and children being raped and butchered just beyond their walls.
