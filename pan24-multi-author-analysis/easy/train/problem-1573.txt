Trump was voted out, but he very nearly wasn't because the US has been gerrymandered, and its electoral system absolutely corrupted, to hell and back, by institutional attacks and systemic, tolerated abuses; as well as increasingly blatant voting restrictions. You wait another 5 or 10 years, there may well not be a "democracy" (which the US can only be marginally considered one anyway) there if people like the GOP keep abusing and undermining the system. Have you heard of the Independent State Legislature Theory? Have fun with that, if you haven't.
Exactly. Mfrs don't know something, Google it for 5 minutes, then make a confident statement while they really have no understanding and then everyone's confused or misinformed because they're too damn lazy to spend time learning for themselves. This is humanity's biggest weakness lol.
