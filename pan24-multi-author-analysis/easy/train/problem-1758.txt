It doesn’t matter. The 2% management fee is what they get regardless of performance. If the fund makes a profit, the fund managers will take 20%’of the profit. If the fund loses money, they still get the 2%. He could sit there and do nothing and still get paid $40 million per year.
EDIT: if anyone doubts the role that Israeli intelligence operatives play in election interference, A consortium of journalists that investigated the election disinformation operations of Israel included reporters from 30 outlets including Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El País. The focus of the investigation centered on Tal Hanan, a former Israeli special forces operative, who it's claimed to have manipulated more than 30 elections around the world using hacking, sabotage and automated disinformation on social media. He formerly was cooperating with Cambridge Analytica, who managed Trump's social media operations. Amazingly, Robert Mueller didn't investigate Cambridge Analytica - there's not a single mention of them in the official Mueller Report.
