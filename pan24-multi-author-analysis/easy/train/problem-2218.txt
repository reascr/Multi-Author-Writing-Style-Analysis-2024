The funniest part of that whole thing was the reaction from the state's pro-life organizations, which was -- and I'm only lightly paraphrasing -- "nuh-uh.".
I am absolutely the sort of parent who will explore birth control options for my teen when she comes of age and I am pro-comprehensive sex education in schools starting at an early age, but I wouldn’t want my teenage daughter to be able to go out and just get medications without my consent until she was old enough to understand the cause and effect of the medications she was getting.
This is an absurd ruling and chilling. If someone can argue that a program infringes on a protected right by the simple virtue it may conflict with said right then it’s game over for a lot of programs. I only hope that this suit is tossed on appeal because I can’t see how there was any standing to begin with. But knowing the the 5th circuit they will keep any injunctions in place even if they do toss it out (which is far from guaranteed).
