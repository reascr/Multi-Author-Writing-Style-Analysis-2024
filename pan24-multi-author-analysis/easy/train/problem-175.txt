So what? You can't just take away houses owned by someone else, even if it's empty. Property rights exist. And just because an empty house exists somewhere doesn't mean it's somewhere where jobs and opportunities are, so even if we did go with the populist option of just seizing empty homes and giving them as handouts to the poor, that wouldn't necessarily help the poor in many instances. Also, if we did something like that, it could massively deincentivize future production of new housing, since potential developers and future buyers would see how property rights aren't being respected and thus that investing in new housing could be a bad idea. So the whole "use existing empty housing" is kind of just a dead end.
