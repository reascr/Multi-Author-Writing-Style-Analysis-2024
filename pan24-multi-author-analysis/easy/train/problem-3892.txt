I am all for cracking down on gangs especially when they are this powerful but this seems like a dangerous way of doing it. There are so many ways this could go wrong.
A lot led up to it, they got a new young president in 2019 that made Bitcoin legal tender, they developed an official government cryptowallet, opened up the immigration laws to encourage rich foreigners to invest in the country, have a plan to use geothermal energy since theres tons of volcanoes in the country, and expand infrastructure to rural areas to increase quality of life and economic opportunities, but at the same time it was one if the most violent countries and after 60 people were killed in one day from gang violence the president started the military campaign and declared a national emergency and suspened some of the peoples rights.
I get that. I just worry that this crisis is being used by people to gain more and more power. Like in Star Wars where they hand over more and more power and it’s ends with dictatorship. I know that is a movie but it has happened a lot IRL as well.
If it’s any consolation rightist authoritarian governments often eventually cede power to liberal democracy.
I don’t know enough about it to judge it either. I have read some less than flattering things about the president but I guess he has improved the situation so I don’t know.
