Won't be a force multiplier for long. Robots use on the battlefield will be continually expanded until personnel will only be used for extremely special cases.
Wrong. First, Russia is not officially at a war. In fact, you can go jail for even calling it this if you make enough noise. They call it “special military operation” so NONE of the wartime laws apply. The fine for ignoring the summons letter last year used to be 3,000 rubles or $50, not sure if this has changed recently. Second, even if you go by this logic, mobilization was declared on September 21, 2022. So who was fighting in Ukraine before? The answer is very simple - people who wanted to be there or at least were ok to be there as they all willingly agreed to sign a CONTRACT to go kill in Ukraine. After mobilization has started, this includes people who simply don’t care enough to avoid it. In my book this does not make them better. You would have a point if they declared war measures, draft and sent conscripts to fight. They did not. Russians killing in Ukraine are grown ass men who are OK to kill, torture and rape for a little money or to avoid even slightest inconveniences of avoiding the mobilization or saying NO to a contract.
