Seems like files where left at a secure office that Biden used while he was VP. I'm going to rate this as questionable judgement since there where classified docs, but it seems like like was a private office so, meh. The investigation is most likely protocol for classified docs in general, so also meh, the same protocol its likely what kicked off the Trump records investigation or its a direct result of said issue. Honestly if the Trump team found some records in one of their offices and returned it to NARA I would have called it a non-story, even if some of them where classified. Main issue on the Trump side is he stole the records hid them in a broom closet and lied to the FBI and NARA so kinda loose all credibility on the whole innocent mistake story.

It is absolutely unacceptable to be acting like Biden's attorneys finding about ten classified documents and immediately notifying the archives is comparable to Trump taking over one hundred classified documents and lying about it to the archives.
