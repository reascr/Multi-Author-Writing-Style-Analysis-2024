Yeah my salary has stagnated and the prices have been slowly going up. But Russian economy was slowing down for years now anyway after the boom in the 00s. A lot of prices skyrocketed in February/March 2022, mainly electronics, some imported goods, some basic stuff like sugar too but then crashed back down later(tho still higher than pre war) since then its a slow rise in prices and dissappearance of one brand after another(I can't easily buy Guiness/Murphy beer and Pringles anymore). Most movie theaters are near bankrupt, half of the shopping centers too since they lost many high paying foreign renters. But it's far from 90s levels so many people are begrudgingly fine with the situation for now. People in the west don't understand how much of a shock late 80s/90s were to many Russians and how much PTSD they have from it. A lot of people are willing to cling to this slowly crumbling "stability" in fear of potential chaos that changes will bring.
Exactly. You have to keep up your quotas, and it isn't like Russians are a . You can't expect them to be smart enough to figure this stuff out on their own.
