No need to be snarky. Or course it's obvious. Nonetheless NATO definitely shouldn't be meddling that far east. This whole thing, without a doubt, is Russia and the West testing the boundaries. Russia has all the reason to not want NATO expanding to its borders, and NATO has all the reason to want the war to go on as long as possible and to deplete Russia of everything it has. The war is dumb as hell and needs to end, people are dying so two world powers can flex and exhaust.
Really? The US hasn’t supported just about every democratically elected president of Colombia? The US doesn’t support Lula, Rouseff or Bolsonaro? How about in Chile and Argentina, neither of which are under authoritarian rule and still enjoy US support?
Obviously. But Russia can leave whenever they want and it'd be fine. Ukraine giving up means surrendering land and the ongoing lives of those people to Russian control, or even giving up their entire state, as Putin tried in the beginning of last year.
