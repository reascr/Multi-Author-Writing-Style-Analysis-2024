All science is slow at the start. There will be better analytical tools and better understanding of immune cells as you go. Now isn't the time to give up.
Absolutely! As someone who had to watch his older brother struggle with this disease both physically and socially while he deteriorated before my eyes in the mid 90's, this is a historical milestone and the leukemia implications make it even more so.
Condoms? No, we don't have vaccines for HIV, HSV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis yet. Only HPV and hep B. There's still value in condoms.
In related news, researchers at OSU are researching whether Leronlimab, a Ccr5 antagonist, can be made within the body essentially creating the effects of the delta 32 mutation without the need for radiation and a bone marrow transplant from a delta 32 donor..
Yes. This does not occur naturally, so to make it happen, it would have to be engineered. Instead of zapping the immune system with no preparation, a parallel one is installed with protections against attacks from the HIV. It activates only on command until fully brought online. It's like transplanting, but like pruning instead of cutting down the tree, so to speak.
