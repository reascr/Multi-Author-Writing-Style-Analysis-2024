Yeah for real. It is using calling peeps of history to paint an inaccurate picture so while relying on the stereotype of 'jews being good with money' so therefore capitalism is good for them. Furthermore, it tries to imply that socialism caused upheaval and racism, which is used by authoritarian right, or specific cases of authoritarian government and comments it with socialism (racist populism?). Oh and the cherry on top it fails to recognize that the period and instability taking place during this period and time was not caused by socialism but lays the failings of fascist regimes and instead purports socialism as the cause not fascist populism. Like definitely socialism that caused WW2 and not idk the response from WW1 leaving a fractured society where many wealthy people happened to be Jewish.
Dictatorship? What dictatorship do you see in the industries? None of them control an army, for example. None of them have prisons. None of them can force revenue via taxation. What do you think a dictatorship is?
