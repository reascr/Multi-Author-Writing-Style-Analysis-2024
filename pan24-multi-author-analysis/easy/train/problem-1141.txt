I think he was talking about wars and atrocities in Africa, China’s attack on India and Bhutan for land grab etc where West stayed quite. More of the colonial mindset to say, etc.
I get the hate but y’all need to brush up on history , Pakistan has been a US ally since it’s creation and both US and Pakistan were instrumental in building the mujahideen to fight the soviets , once the Cold War was over , the US went home and Pakistan was left to take care of the mujahideen which by then had grown really unstable and splintered into different groups , one of those became the taliban and certain factions that Pakistan army still had control over , had other geopolitical problems and then you see US returning back to Afghanistan and more extremism happening and once the war on terror is over , the US throws Pakistan to the side and starts cozying up india and Iran so Pakistan also makes more links with china to prioritize their national security interests and it’s a really complex topic . But tldr the Pakistani army has for decades been very pro US and a US major non nato ally , just that they grew abit distant with the war on terror . And for the ones who have been saying bin laden was found in Pakistan , US has done nothing to Saudi regime when there has been evidence that the house of Al saud directly funded 9/11 and bin laden was Saudi not Pakistani , and all the hate towards bin laden goes to Pakistan for some reason. Also you don’t want Pakistan and china having a full time alliance as that would be a diaaster in itself, china would gain access to the Indian Ocean and the Arabian gulf , about 600 extra nukes than India , both could hang up on India in the Himalayan region and India wanting to be independent means once everything is done , the US could lose a stronghold or backup in the South Asian region and it could seriously affect trade routes and US influence in the region.
