As of now Iran benefits more from threatening to cross the line that it does if it actually crosses it. Iran is hoping to leverage the threat to get a better deal. Maybe that won't work because of their support of Russia in the Ukraine War. However, that's what they're likely doing. If they cross the line then they likely get attacked by Israel, KSA and the US as well as max sanctions, embargoes, blockades, etc.
If Israel, the US and KSA attack then Iran will make a bomb immediately and detonate one in the desert signalling the attacks are an existential threat which they'll respond to with maximum force.
Hahahha. Iran wouldnâ€™t be the first religious state, the first terrorist state, or the first religious-terrorist state, to develop and maintain nuclear weapons.
So now Iran has 2 options: acquire nuclear weapons to deter foreign invasion & war, or attempt to acquire nuclear weapons for that act to cause a foreign invasion.
Iran is sure to be invaded by a foreign state should they not acquire nuclear weapons. North Korea and Ukraine are the best precedents.
