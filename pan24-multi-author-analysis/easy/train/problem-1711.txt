It's middle of the road for a European state in these regards. Its government corruption is about on the same level as the UK in recent years (low-level corruption however in e.g. courts and hospitals is still an issue), and its organised crime is significantly lower than in e.g. France and Italy, and just a bit better than Croatia.
Really? I remember basically the opposite from Germany. For two months or so, you could use both. Most shops just did 1 € = 2 DM, and prices were shown only in €, so if you wanted to spend your DM, you multiplied it by two. Technically the rate was roughly 1.96, so you may have gotten a bit of extra change to compensate for that in some shops.
Racist who is literally right now trying to repeat the same lies about us not being "ready" to join Schengen in a different thread recognises himself in a comment that doesn't refer to individuals but the many racists in those countries, who are unfortunately representing the country as a whole through their government's decisions, and bleats that he's being discriminated by being called racist. A classic.
