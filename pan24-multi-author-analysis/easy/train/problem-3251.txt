The part that really makes me the most disgusted, is how the situation is portrayed by mainstream media. You will see articles about how Israel has Palestinian children in captivity, how they are being shot by Israel, how their rights are being trampled on to live peacefully. All while ignoring entirely, that they have been enlisted by Palestine and trained to kill.
And one could just as easily say, Palestine's endless crusade to destroy Israel is leading to their own mistreatment.
I am not saying that Palestinians don't have a right to live peacefully, but that isn't going to happen while they are under their own self-made terrorist rule. Hamas is a group of religious fanatics, they aren't interested in peace.
Hamas is a religious radical terrorist group, and human rights groups have been trying to raise awareness of that situation. They are no better than the Taliban.
