Ukrainian intelligence perfectly knows where, who and for what purpose. Simply because they intercepting russian talk on radio, have access to secret russian documents gathered after russians retreat, have their spies inside russia, and have shit loads of other methods to recognise russian units, including their loses. kremlin knows their loses too. Its also can be a place for small error in counting estimates, but its not make big difference. And all this info just not public and not all of this information shared with our allies.
