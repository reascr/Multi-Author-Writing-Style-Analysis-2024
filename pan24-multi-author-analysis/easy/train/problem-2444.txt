Yep! Same exact things. I forgot about the headaches, and yea, they were a bitch too. The tickle in the throat is so annoying. Can go from fine to having a coughing fit all beginning with that stupid tickle.

My husband and I have evaded Covid the entire pandemic until Christmas Eve. Husband had a bit of a sore throat and dry cough, general feeling of being run down. Took a test and had a faint positive. I tested negative for 2 days before I went positive. Fever, chills, the worst body aches, fatigue, weakness. At one point, I was so weak I almost dropped to the floor just getting out of bed. That shit lasted about 3-4 days. Shit was the sickest we’ve been in awhile and we’re both vaxxed and boosted. Now, my 5yo had a faint positive yesterday.
