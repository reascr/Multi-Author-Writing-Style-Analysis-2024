All they need to do to completely change how the West conducts itself is seriously threaten a carrier. Just sinking one would be an incomprehensible blow to the US. No one alive today has experienced a loss like that. They don't need a Gerald R Ford class carrier to do that. That's the whole point.
That's my point with this. Not the minutia of the history. We're getting awfully close to "The Chinese could never defeat the US Navy because they don't have carriers like ours" and then the Chinese are going to come out with a carrier that uses drones and surprise the West because China couldn't possibly do that. They don't need to be better. They just need to be good enough. The effectiveness of that strategy should be self evident in Ukraine where drones that you could buy at Walmart were being used to great effect. They don't need a billions dollar 5% of your GDP carrier to make it work.
Really?. Oh I quite fancy getting arbitrarily detained for doing nothing worse than being a dual passport holder, charged under false pretences then languish in jail for several years whilst they ransom me to my other government.
