It's a complicated alliance, for sure. Chinese recognize that their government was derived from Leninism. But I can't imagine china has been impressed with Russias performance on the free market post collapse of USSR. They see Russia as a precautionary tale of what NOT to do. Which is China's opinion was denounce Stalin after his death, which they could never do with Mao. And of course the collapse of the USSR, which the CCP knows it can't show weakness.
Yes, Japan had great animation exports which popularize franchises...but there is definitely an underlying hostility.
Those actions are being taken. But I think your timeframe is optimistic. Even Taiwan doesn't design the chips, they just produce them. Currently china doesn't have the tools, the factories or the institutional knowledge to even start. I'd say a decade at least.
They have significant territorial disputes over Siberia(Whose ownership China claims, particularly in consideration of its immense oil reserves) and there has always been a significant degree of distrust between their leaders.
Not in the 1980s lol. I used to read old sci-fi books at libraries, they often re-hash WWII atrocities, use of Ninjas for corporate espionage, and surprising amount of rope bondage for blonde women that the white hero need to save.
