Vote for who you want in the primaries. Vote strategically in the general. Corporate ass-licking "moderate" Democrats are still better than fascist/authoritarian Republicans.
You know who did have their way? South Carolina, so it's not like S.C. doesn't have enough power in the nominating process by being the 3rd state rather than the 1st in the nation. I'm not saying that the South shouldn't have an early say in an early primary. I am southern. I'm saying maybe South Carolina shouldn't be the southern state we choose for that early primary role. Maybe choose a southern state that Democrats have a chance in hell of competing in, like Virginia, N.C., or Georgia. Maybe we shouldn't stack the deck in making multiple southern states early states, as this plan does, and maybe we shouldn't stack the deck by making southern states disproportionate to the rest of the country on the first Super Tuesday, like we do. All of those things put together give an institutional advantage to conservative and moderate Democrats. I'm not asking for a progressive advantage. I'm just asking for a somewhat even playing field, especially early.

It unnaturally advantages conservative and moderate candidates. You're not even disputing that. You're merely arguing that an ideological concern doesn't matter and that the only thing that should matter is racial representation, even when there are states which accomplish both better than S.C. does. Should progressive candidates expect a somewhat fair primary process or shouldn't they?
