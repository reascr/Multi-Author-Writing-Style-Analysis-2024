You post often condemning the US and other “capitalist” countires and praise the USSR, China, and North Korea, and openly make false statements such as this one, tell me how you think north Korea invading the south was not the first punch. The whole reason there was two in the first place was under Japanese occupation it got invaded by the USSR and the US on both sides. And the only reason there’s two now is China didn’t allow North Korea to get conquered. So if you wanna go back further to prove it then you can’t blame solely the US. Please do not respond with communist or North Korean apologetics, you cannot tell me in good faith North Korea is in any realm better than the south. I feel for the people forced to live in that nightmare.
They have also demonstrated higher accuracy missiles that indicate satnav integration. This isn't a hypothetical, it is a "There is video and civilian satellite imagery confirming it.".
If the US was trying to support democracy then why did they destroy the people's councils that had been established in the south, fill the government and police force with former Japanese collaborators, and install a dictator in Syngman Rhee? And then after Rhee was eventually overthrown, why did the US support the military juntas that came into power?
