Biden does share a small amount of responsibility for shutting down the strike. However, there's plenty of blame to go around. Norfolk Southern, as you mentioned, should have done more for their infrastructure and their workers. The rail union negotiators came to a shitty deal that the unions ultimately rejected. Congress could have simply refused to pass the bill banning the strike.
Also remember that it's not just a question of whether the president has any sway or influence but whether that influence would be stronger than the influence that the opposition party would have (and the opposition party tends to have stronger persuasive ability when it doesn't hold the presidency), especially at a time when presidential unwillingness to act would lead to economic catastrophe, and even if the president's swaying power did outmatch that of the GOP, if it would be enough to make any real difference (bearing in mind that if we look at that 2024 Senate map, the Dems may need basically a landslide if they are to take enough seats to have the power to make a difference legislatively here, they could have a really good year while still losing seats.
