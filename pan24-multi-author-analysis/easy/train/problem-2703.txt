Seriously. This would cause a huge problem if the law meant that. I could be a freelancer and be working in different states prior to the election. You wouldn’t legally be allowed to vote anywhere.
Seriously? You’ve never seen one? They are/were in people’s houses for a start. Google white Jesus or aryan Jesus to find lots of blonde Jesus pictures. There are even really old paintings where he is a blonde child in his mother’s lap (the halos make it clear who they’re supposed to be). I’ve seen a lot of painted crucifixes, and paintings of the crucifixion or resurrection where he is very white, blonde, and blue eyed. Though I’m not sure where people were getting them. Most of them were older people, Catholic, and some Latino. I just thought most people had come across those at some point.

Unlikely. She apparently still utilizes her parents address as her residence, and has a driver's license stating as much. hence the ballot getting sent to that address. She wouldn't be eligible to vote anywhere else.
