Justice should be served to everyone acting in criminal activities. Hunter Biden for one has filmed himself weighing his crack stash with a hooker.(it’s on YouTube) The Epstein island list? The judge redacted and hid all the names from people who went to the island. Maybe we should condemn what other countries are using for a labor force, slavery is still active in some prominent countries. But people are still stuck on trump. It’s crazy because every other corrupt or criminal politician is still Scott free. I hope they do investigate trump, but also bidens, obamas, bushes, the fbi, the cia, the atf. They’re all involved in some sort of corruption. Whether you choose to believe it or not is on you. The fed as a whole is the issue. Not just one man. I mean, cmon….
On today’s episode of the podcast , Attourney Andrew Torrez predicted a Boebert loss from the remaining (approximate) 1500(ish) votes to be counted in the last remaining voting district still counting votes (which also happens to be a relatively blue district). This won’t be certified until 35 days after Election Day (Tuesday). This is because Boebert will lose by a very small margin that will trigger a mandatory recount by Colorado law, the 35 day mark is the time limit the Colorado Attourney General has to complete the recount and certify the election count.
I dunno…. After trumps bad mid term showing…. Maybe the Republican Party offers him up to the courts to show their base that the crazies are gone…. Oh wait. That was a dream. =).
