The “ times of Israel” as a counter source. Hahaha the shills will cling to anything as a source if it makes their genocidal state seem innocent. So pathetic.
Israeli settlers are known the commit acts of terrorism against Arabs and recently the Israeli government moved to put some of their most radical leaders in charge of the West Bank with no one but Netanyahu having the authority to check their power. They already enjoyed near impunity for their attacks under previous Israeli governments but with Smotrich, a dude who was literally arrested by the Shin Bet for trying commit arson attacks during the Gaza pullout, and Ben-Gvir, another psycho who celebrated the cave of the patriarchs terrorist attack, being allowed to turn the west bank into their fiefdom the violence against Arabs is only going to intensify.
The truth is all you need. Israel is being called out for their crimes against humanity more than ever and it’s awesome. Terrorist state being put in its place. No more “free passes” on their genocidal crimes.
