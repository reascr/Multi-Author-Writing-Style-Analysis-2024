Stop treating Hispanics as a monolithic voting bloc. The Cubans, Central Americans and the Mexicans have different points of view, as do many of those within the communities of those regions. Stop treating blacks as a uniform constituency. Many blacks are actually quite conservative in outlook, and they resent identity politics as much as anyone else. Acknowledge that many people moving to the state bring their value systems with them - a retiree moving from Michigan, Ohio or Wisconsin doesn't simply start favoring the Democrats just because they moved there. Stop running sh\t candidates that bring with them deep flaws (Crist, really?). Finally, run candidates that actually listen to the messaging from the voters, instead of telling the voters what should matter to them. Floridians for the most part actually care far more about the economy, jobs, taxes and safe streets than they do Roe v Wade, "climate change" or the New Green Deal.
Honestly... I'm still surprised people are calling this a bloodbath. Maybe, if both teams has played the field and the stadium was full, but the Democrats didnt even show to the game.
Regardless, Gerrymandering is an absolutely un-Democratic, horribly corrosive tool to systematically subvert elections and the will of the people. Two wrongs do NOT make a right.
