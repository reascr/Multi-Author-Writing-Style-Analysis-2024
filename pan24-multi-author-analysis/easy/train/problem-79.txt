We're going to have to keep fighting, but I think it would be stupid and shortsighted to not at least take the opportunity we have right now to set ourselves up to fight from a position of power. It's a hell of a lot easier to fight, to organize, and to remain politically active when you aren't trying to figure out how to survive because you suddenly don't have insurance or are having to go to court to establish rights to your kids or to make decisions for a sick partner, or suddenly might not even be a legal US citizen anymore.
No. Its worse than that. Religions can be openly hateful of others anyway. They can believe whatever bullshit, hateful doctrine they want. When they say religious liberty, what they mean is religious privilege. They are afraid of losing their privileged status in the U.S. which frankly they should. Religion shouldn't have such a strong voice in determining what the laws around free association should be.
Exactly. If every couple had to go down to the courthouse and fill out separate marriage papers there, I feel there wouldn't be anywhere near as much resistance. But because a vast majority of people get married through their church they never see that side of things. They think any paperwork they fill out is for the church, not the government. The fact that their ceremony is also a legal one is completely lost.
