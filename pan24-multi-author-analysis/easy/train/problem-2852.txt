It could be found that the information was kept from him because he’d use it irresponsibly and get people killed. I seem to recall that technically someone else was president or commander in chief during the events of January 6th for a short while and it’s since been hand waved away because those involved don’t want to go into it, something like that could have occurred in the chain of command.
I like balloons. Haven't seen those ones. Red balloons. Big balloons. Three. Two if you know what I mean. Two big balloons at the front... my wife. Helium balloons filled with hot air. Like the Do Nothing Democrats. Three balloons came over when I was president... didn't tell me. I knew they were there. Four balloons if you count the baby Trump balloon. Very insulting. I like babies... not the babies that made that. So three balloons and what do the cry baby Democrats do? Nothing. Let 'em sail over our beautiful country. I saw them. Three big tits They did nothing. Helium air folks... not hydrogen like they used to. Sad.
