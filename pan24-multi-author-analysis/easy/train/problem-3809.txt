What? Jan 6 committee, and Merrick Garland wont even enforce the law of trumps subpoena. They are helping trump by continuing to stall and hold him above the law. trump will never be charged with anything worth it. Jan 6 committee and Merrick Garland ARE THE BIGGER LIE. people are smart and we learn. they MIGHT charge him with something small but wont stop him from keeping his self appointed power over America-- while he continue to harm us. SHAME on THE BIGGER LIE.

Exactly. If this country has a chance of getting back to a civil, law-based foundation, there has to be a trial and the trial has to be completely above-board and public. And when Tuck and Haggity start 'just asking questions, jussssst askin'! ' actual lawyers who know actual laws need to come on the shows and explain everything so that even they can understand. No more waiting, no more doubts, no more bullshit.
