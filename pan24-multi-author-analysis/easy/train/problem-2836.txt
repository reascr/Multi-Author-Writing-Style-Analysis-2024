Nah, but they are the reason why many dictatorships around the world aren't democracies today. How many people was it worth? Did really make us safer? How much did they really need to do to serve the American people? How did preserve our democracy? And this is shit that we actually know they did. What do you think the CIA's body count is? I'd bet they probably cracked the 7th digit. Does that really sound like an institution you'd describe as "Honorable?".
"Charles Rettig, the Trump-appointed IRS Commissioner who has refused to release President Trump’s tax returns, has made hundreds of thousands of dollars renting out Trump properties while in office, according to documents obtained by CREW.

Absolutely! Not to mention that the Republicans have hamstrung the IRS to the point that the IRS does not have the agents for auditing complex tax returns so wealthy people can take comfort in the fact that the IRS won't audit them because they can't. Nice way to assure your donors that their fraudulent tax returns will go unnoticed.
