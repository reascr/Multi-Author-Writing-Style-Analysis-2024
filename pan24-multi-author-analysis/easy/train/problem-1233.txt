The algorithm only shows you similar things to what you have already watched. To my understanding you don't get shown things on youtube unless you have given it an indication you'd be interested in watching that, either by watching other videos or by search. This would be where the "interactive" part comes in.
Yeah, I do think having algorithms and "automated" services do the content curation (they're automated as long as their owners like what they're automatically spitting out, but they'll be adjusted if that ever stops being the case) does create a little bit of a special social risk where it can seem like everybody thinks a certain way or is talking about a certain topic because the robots can quickly find a bunch of different voices talking about the same thing once you've shown an interest in it, so maybe some sort of law that makes platforms have to disclose some information about their algorithms wouldn't be a bad idea.
He's a sitting SCOTUS Justice. You don't just use his name without the honorific "Justice" or "The honorable"!
