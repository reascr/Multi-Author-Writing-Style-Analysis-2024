It's the main action that can be done without Russia realistically picking up the "End world" stick, and can very much be justified: Your shitty war has caused outside deaths, therefore you can't have any war anymore.
I'm suggesting that NATO could do anything up to a full blown invasion of Russia and they wouldn't do shit: Because they can't do shit.
Bare minimum, NATO enforces a full no fly no missile zone over Ukraine, I wouldn't be surprised if NATO goes full "I'm now in Ukraine, get fucked Russia" as it's the main action that can be taken without Russia picking up nukes.
Complete air control from NATO would seriously harm Russia's ability to wage war and attack Ukraine, while forcing Russia to be the one to escalate into an unwinnable situation. It's also impossible to logically argue against: They fired missiles that hit none Ukraine, therefore NATO are stopping said missiles from being launched. In addition, it lets Putin theoretically exit the war in a "Well we got stopped by the entire of the super soldier NATO" without a messy situation where boots on the ground start causing deaths on both sides.
Heck some people have suggested that this is what Putin actually wants: He can spin losing to the entire of NATO. He can't spin losing to just Ukraine.

Yes. But are you willing to go to worldwar3 for it? Im personally not. A proper response would be to basically close the sky extending over to Ukraine for lets say 100km inwards.
