Millions of people wanted his account banned after he provoked an insurrection and attempted to lead it personally to the Capital in order to assassinate the Vice President and other lawmakers.
Tump, dude, TRUMP. He should have been arrested that very evening, along with people like Bannon, Cruz, Hawley etc etc etc. I'm not saying there's a conspiracy, I'm saying there is incompetence, indecisiveness, fear, timidity, naivete. Why are there so many probes, panels, investigations, when the treason took place on live TV, on Twitter, on the streets. Failed coups are not a matter that is even supposed to dealt with in the regular way other transgressions are. Ok, lets forget swiftly putting him behind bars since that seems to be too much to ask, but WHY the fuck is Trump even allowed to run again? Why are not the fake electors jailed? Why are Hawley and Cruz (et. al.) STILL in congress? Etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc...
