Not OP but it sounds like Kamila. Wasn't her failed test on the day of their nationals or some other olympic qualifier? I have little faith that any Eteri skater is actually clean but that debacle takes the cake. Russia should be banned from the olympics based on that circus alone.
It's hypocritical, period. I get it that shitting on anything that's russian is a must in this sub, that doesn't mean you can be a hypocrite. As simple as that.
Countries collectively choosing to boycott the games is completely different from the IOC literally banning athletes from competing because of their government's actions.
Again, countries choosing to boycott the games is completely different from the organizers banning a country's athletes from competing because of politics.
Ehh. I feel like the general Russian consensus will still be that their athletes are winning. You see this to an extent in rhythmic gymnastics now - Russia is banned but a few successful athletes in other countries were born in Russia. Despite said athletes moving from Russia 10+ years ago their media still describes them as "ex-russian athlete" or "ethnic Russian competing for XXX country won X title this week".
I imagine with athletes who recently competed for Russia at the top level it would be even worse/they would just consider them Russian wins. Plus how will the IOC handle tensions between recent Russian athletes/Ukrainian athletes?
