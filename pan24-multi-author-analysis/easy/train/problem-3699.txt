What AOC, Tlaib, Bush, and Bowman should be doing right now is fielding their own nomination for Speaker and using each nominating speech to speak directly to the American people, denouncing all the various factions of the Republican Party as well as the Democratic leadership. In the highly unlikely scenario that it comes to a plurality vote, they should then offer to vote for Jeffries only in return for serious concessions, like rules changes that would improve their ability to agitate from the House floor or guaranteed floor votes on pieces of legislation that would directly advance DSA’s platform. In years where Democrats have the majority, the protocol should be to do essentially what the Freedom Caucus is doing right now, but with strategically valuable concessions in mind rather than a personal vendetta against the party’s nominee.
No. It’s accurate. People like to say there is no left wing party in the US, but it’s simply not tru. There’s a center left party hamstrung by a far right party that harbours far right extremists. In horseshoe theory, the center left and extreme/far right are as far apart from eachother in every aspect as is possible. We don’t have extreme leftists in the US, we have centrists, center-left, and just leftists.
