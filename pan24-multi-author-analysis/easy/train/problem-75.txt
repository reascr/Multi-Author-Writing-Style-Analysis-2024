The grid is in the process of being re-energized and power . This is separate from the fact there is a shortage of power and a need for continuing rotating blackouts.
Unfortunately. At least in the US, solar doesn't work when the grid goes down unless you have a battery system. They make you install your system that way so you don't kill a lineman when he thinks the power is shut off.
Yes, undoubtedly. But first thing first, now the most important thing is fuck Putler and his monsters off of Ukraine. Seems like there is still a long way to achieve the goal, cos ruzzian animals won't leave by themselves. Sigh.
Pretty much the same for NATO in that their restrictions to (providing Ukraine with) defensive weapons has allowed Putin to focus exclusively on non-military targets without fear of any tangible retribution or preventive action.
In NA yes. In Europe which has large transformer manufacturers in several countries no. And Ukraine is being prioritized per a plan recently agreed upon by 12 EU countries and possibly there is support from South Korea as well.
