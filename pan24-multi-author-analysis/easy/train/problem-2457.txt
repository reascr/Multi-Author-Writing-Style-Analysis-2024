In order for Congress to even pass legislation protecting first trimester abortion, we'd need to not only elect a democratic house but also at least 52 democratic senators.
48 Dems voted to bypass the filibuster for abortion earlier this year and we got another anti filibuster pro choice Dem elected. You only need 50 if you have a simple majority of Dems who are also fine bypassing the filibuster. So only one of those is needed now.

I’ve been through enough cycles that I guarantee the average American will have no problem looking beyond all of that and fall for the typical lies about taxes and “crime” that they’ll be willing to put violent insurrectionists in charge of their government because they think they’ll save a couple bucks in taxes or that thousands of immigrants will suddenly begin flooding their tiny midwestern town the moment a Democrat takes office.
