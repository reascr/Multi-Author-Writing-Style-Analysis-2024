The only "veneer" is in our heads. DeSantis is a lying sociopathic corrupt violent sack of doo-doo. The fact we have the citizens of Florida and across the U.S. who like that sort of human being and have no idea what true goodness looks like is a tragedy of the highest magnitude. An equal tragedy is our main stream media who are already dangerously normalizing him just like they did with Trump and are treating the coming fascism as entertainment. We've learned nothing and tragically I no longer believe our republic will survive the media's purposeful complicity and the Republican Party's spiritual brokenness. Evil is moving across our land and in the words of the late great Gil Scott Heron in his song Winter in American, "Ain't nobody fighting because no one knows what to save.".
Most conservatives aren't so inherently henious. But they are tribal and they see all their tribe(even when most of it is inorganic) online saying dems bad so eventually they simply start to parrot what they hear, like a sports team's cheer.
