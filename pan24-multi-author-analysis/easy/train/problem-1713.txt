It's more about the timing than the action itself, though. Heck, we (and the Russians) have had entire space stations re-enter uncontrolled (Thank goodness the Australians were good natured about it, as I recall. I think that they issued a $400 fine to NASA for littering or somesuch). Now-a-days, we're smarter, NEO to GSO is getting pretty crowded and everything that we put up there is EXPENSIVE as heck. TImes have moved on...
Other junk will usually de orbit after a time due to all kinds of different factors depending on its height, for example parts on the ISS's orbit will deorbit due to atmospheric drag within a matter of weeks/months/years, which I think (dont quote me) is part of the reason it's at that height, safety is actually higher if you play on that margin.
Yeah... However, let's be fair about this. The US did, indeed, blow up a de-orbiting satellite, USA-193, in 2008. It created 174 pieces of orbital debris, which was deemed better than having the hydrazine fuel tank impact somewhere. Most of it deorbited within a month or two, but a couple of them were boosted into a higher orbit and lasted 20 months. In short, there are no pieces of it still around in orbit.
