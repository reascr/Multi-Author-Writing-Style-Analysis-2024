The dude is probably the most ambitious politician I've seen in my lifetime with no moral or political theory underpinning his actions other than, how to gain popularity and win elections.
No. His brand is a guarantee for failure. His culture wars have been reversed by Florida courts over and over. It’s all about the outrage over manufactured problems that he creates and then “solves” with some bogus legislation. He’s done nothing to improve the lives of average Floridians. Housing/rent, food prices, health coverage(refusal to expand Medicare), home and auto insurance rates, inadequate infrastructure management, etc. All of these everyday kitchen table issues in a state that still doesn’t have a living wage or workers rights, and then he brags about an almost $22 billion surplus, most of which is from federal funds from the Biden administration.
Absolutely. Look how much support he's been gaining over the past couple of years in Florida alone... now imagine the amount he'll have on a national (Presidential election) level. Republicans are easily persuaded to follow when a leader hates the same things they do.
