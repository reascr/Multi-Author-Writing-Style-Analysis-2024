Everyone knows that nothing happens with Trump unless he's directly involved. The hilarious part is how well it's common knowledge everyone has to walk around on eggshells because unless we can prove it 100% with 50 witnesses 100 personally signed documents, his DNA, fingerprints, eyewitnesses etc they won't risk bringing charges because he was the president at one time. Trump is the acid test for our democracy and the Constitution. Is it really true that nobody is above the law or are those just words that we like to put on slogans but don't have any validity in real life? We shall see.
