I'm talking about radio dramas, movies, novels, video games, and TV shows. There were multiple generations who grew up with the idea being thrown around that Russia was a considerable military threat, even without the use of a nuke. I can't help but imagine that that notion died in Ukraine, along with a good chunk of Putin's cardboard army. It almost makes me wonder if any future video games will continue to use Russia as the opposing team in military shooters?
Hahaha. Russia has been such a good partner in providing tanks and artillery to Ukrainian troops. The farmers appreciate the Russian military for increasing the iron content in the soil with all the Russian blood spilled. Iron is an essential component of photosynthesis pathways in plants.
Hahahahha! I want whatever Russia has been smoking because to be losing so badly and to still feel like the world is at your fingertips sounds absolutely delightful.
Exactly. I wish this bullsht wasn't even posted here. It's obviously meant for their population or to troll westerners.
