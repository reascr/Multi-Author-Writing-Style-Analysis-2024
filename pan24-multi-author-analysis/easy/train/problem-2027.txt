That's huge, the UK just announced hundreds including bulldogs, with the potential for strikers from the US maybe to be announced. People are fixated on the tanks but other armoured deliveries seem to be ramping up a lot as well.
BAHAHAHAHHA, Okay. Russia does make a fair few missiles the whole "running out" thing is incorrect. They have reached the hand to mouth point already and it reduces the tactical flexibility of Russia.

Towards these goals, Gerasimov‘s new plans involve tens of thousands of new troops, accumulated 70-80,00 thus far; that they’ve ‘starved’ deployed units and PMCs of ammunition, in order to stockpile for new campaign; and crucially, new plans finally involve “demilitarization,” which Gerasimov says requires taking or at least attacking western Ukraine in order to end the supply of western weapons, and thus there’s a large buildup of Russian troops in Western Belarus.
Yea i'd be a right shame is something were to... happen... to those factories. Perhaps the international community could work with Phillip-Morris to send the hard-workers there care packages of Marlboros. Lots and lots of Marlboros.
