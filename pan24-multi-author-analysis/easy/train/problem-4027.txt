Yes. For example, on Reagan's watch, the broadcast industry was deregulated. Formerly, ownership of media outlets was limited in a given area. But now my local CBS and NBC affiliates are owned by the same national conglomerate, and they push newsmax and other right wing media. Even their local news covers actions by right-leaning actors favorably, while all but ignoring anything that whiffs of the left. You'd never know a democrat was running in an election if they could help it. Reagan allowed this to happen with the push for deregulation, and now, owned by the rich, fewer viewpoints are offered in the broadcast media.
