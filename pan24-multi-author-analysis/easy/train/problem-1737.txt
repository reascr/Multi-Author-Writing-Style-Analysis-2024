Absolutely. Having someone on his level with his experience and geniality really lifted tom up. YMH has been pretty stale for a little while, it seems like the guests you see on all the comedy podcasts are just doing the circuit which has very much lessened my attention to what they put out. I don't want to sit through hours of the same stories by them just to enjoy the nuggets of individual chemistry. Al's episode made me remember just how good tom is when he's not in the throes of bert. Like he and bert's friendship is awesome and all but 2 bears has literally just become them trolling Bert, and talking about how much money the things they do for/to eachother cost. Bert almost always starts a converstaion on money and tom almost always gleefully jumps in. It's tiring as fuck. It lowers Tom's humor and Bert's too. When he's with someone like Franken that's practically a towering figure in their world he's SO much more interesting and witty.
