If Russians dealt with their elderly and misinformed 10 years ago, there'd be no war today. But not-giving-a-shit runs so deep that it's not happening even now. Even soviet time had "kitchen talks", when also you couldn't say anything in public. People still spoke among themselves... and empire of evil eventually crumbled. Where is it now?
Because the Russians conscripted mostly come from small towns and villages, economically depressed areas, and especially, ethnic minorities.
Wow. Over 100,000 Russian combat deaths so far since February. For comparison, the US had 58,000 combat deaths during the entire Vietnam War. How are the Russian People not completely rebelling at this point?!
Western Intelligence disputes these numbers, specifically deaths. It tends to be exaggerated as it is part propaganda part fact. The source always matters and in this case you gotta take stats published by UA with a grain of salt. Most Western Intelligence agree that the 100k number is a mixture of KIA and WIA. In the case of UK Intel, they also included deserters as part of the 100k. Intel comes from multiple sources including boots on the ground, AID agencies, OSINT, etc. Russia, as an example claims more than 160k UA military KIA. But who knows if they are actually counting combatant AND civilian deaths.
