Key word: TRY. Russia will either fail or nuke. Thats about all they have left. Sure having a ton of reservists is great, but they're being given barely any training and cold war era weapons, and sent off to fight an extremely well equipped, well orgabised and highly motivated enemy, who are pretty well all now experienced veterans from chewing through the first few waves of Putins cannon fodder invasion.
Sigh. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing again, but expecting a different result. Has Pootin learned nothing over the past nine months. He can't win this at all and he knows it so instead, he will destroy as much of Ukraine as possible out of evil spite. "If I can't have it then neither can they!" He is a man child with no conscience.
The Germans didn't really lose to the Russians, the Germans lost to a mix of winter weather, and the stupidity of engaging multiple numerically superior opponents on a split front.
Its nuts. 2 weeks of training a pistol few clips of ammo , shovel . Weeks worth of food and 2-3 weeks to next supply and some Rusty heavy barely working heavy machine guns. Never felt BAD for the invaders before.
