"Two state solution" is a catchphrase. There are dozens of solutions with 2 states differing by their borders, relations, governance system etc. One thing that has to be clear: the Palestinian's two state solution is not the Israeli's two state solution in almost all cases. When the Palestinians talk about it, they almost always mean the borders of 48 or a Muslim country from the river to the sea with a Jewish one somewhere else. When Israelis talk about it they usually mean some land swap with the Oslo accords as a basis or some 67-based borders (but not one to one). There is a small amount of people on both sides that agree on an identical two-state solution (usually all of 67 as-is), but they are extremist in both sides.
This is actually extremely incorrect. In accordance with international humanitarian law, wars of national liberation have been expressly embraced, through the adoption of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (), as a protected and essential right of occupied people everywhere.
