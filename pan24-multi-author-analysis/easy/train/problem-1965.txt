Maybe the capitalist world should quit embargoing communist countries and trying to force them to be capitalist liberal democracies?
No. We need to keep N. Korea stable until the rest if the world is ready and able to rehabilitate N. Korea. China won't let the West do that nor will they help the inferior (as they see them) N Koreans. If the DPRK where to collapse tonight, there would be 25 million hungry N Koreans to take care of but no government structure in place. It would be a huge humanitarian crisis. As horrible as DPRK is, it functions enough to mostly keep the people alive. By bailing them out, the people of N Korea live, barely. If we refused to help, N Korea would fall into famine and war. The resulting war of barely fed soldiers killing starving, desperate civilians would force outside intervention bringing devastation to S Korea while the DPKR rallied its people one last time to fight the American evil. Even if it was China that stepped in. Unfortunately, we will have to help.
