He is literally running on the exact same promises from his original campaign, and no one is pointing out how all it took was a slim majority from the other party to completely undo it all, apparently. Either you are blatantly scamming the country by saying they'll only prosper when you're president (and said prosperity is on a matchstick foundation), or you are indirectly advocating for total and indefinite government control.
4. A Plan To Challenge Or Change Conservatism. In 2015 Trump was the only major GOP candidate focusing hard on trade and immigration while visibly waffling on "entitlement reform" (cutting social security) and "pro life" (banning abortion). Trump wasn't just hogging the attention, he was genuinely different from the other options voters could choose. Any claim that 2022 Trump is energized by a similar unorthodoxy has to crumble in the face of history: he didn't build the wall, didn't revolutionize America's trade policy, didn't replace Obamacare with "something beautiful," just tweeted from the White House toilet for 4 years while Mitch passed his tax cuts and Federalist Society judges. Paul Ryan may as well have been President.
