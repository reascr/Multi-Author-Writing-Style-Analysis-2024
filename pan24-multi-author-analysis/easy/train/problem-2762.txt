We conquered a few square kilometers of land, which is completely ruined by war. We enlarged our country by an insignificant, tiny fraction of a percentage, because we had one of the largest countries to begin with. We sacrificed an insane amount of youngsters to do this who we can not replace in a rapidly aging population with below replacement level birth rates. We lost half of our tanks an most of our modern vehicles in such an embarassing way, that no one will buy our weapons any more. We ruined our relationship with every country, and strenghtened the resolve of NATO. Our economy is in ruins.
One year in; decimated army, thousands of pieces of armor lost, flagship sunk, 'unsinkable' transport sunk, 50% of special forces out of action, command structure decimated, infighting between commands, air power that still can't achieve air superiority against a Ukrainian air force well over ten times smaller, mercenary leaders threatening Russian power structure, worldwide sanctions crippling economy, hundreds of thousands fleeing Russia in it's latest great brain drain, but not to fear, they're making 'minor progress'.
You don't understand what they are trying to do. They are hoping for a breakout. Remember Ukrains offensive that resulted in huge swaths of territory when they broke Russian lines?
