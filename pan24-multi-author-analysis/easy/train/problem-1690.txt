Wages and productivity were fairly well coupled between 1944 and 1974. Then, started diverging in the 80s look it up. So, you are saying they were artificially inflated before 1974 or they are artificially decoupled after 1974. Or, more likely it is all about policy in both cases, and union busting, tax cuts for the wealthy, stagnant minimum wage, and other government policies favoring capital over labor decoupled them for the last 40 years.
Yes. There are more than a "few wealthy individuals" who control the US labor market. There are thousands of employers out there with different business models. Fr example, Chik-fil-A has a vastly different corporate culture than Disney.
Fiscal responsibility! Just look at the republican record regarding US debt. Reagan and Bush Jr tripled our debt, Clinton and Obama cleared it up. But of course Republicans vote for who they “feel” like would be the best president.
