Almost as if they have a networked system where counter artillery radar can directly digitally transmit the Excalibur artillery round programming solution directly to a group of motorized artillery units which operate in unison with one moving, one on standby and one reloading meaning they can always have one gun ready to fire. Seeing as the radar can pick up arty rounds quite early in their flight and fire solution is transferred digitally and the round programmed automatically one should be able to fire off a GPS precision guided round back towards an enemy artillery position before the enemy artillery round has even struck its intended target.
A third of Africa already speaks English. They’re way closer to Europe and N America. And we can’t offer better deals than China?
Their goal continues to be to hope to deplete Ukraine and Western ammo reserves and morale by making it as miserable as possible while taking what resources (sadly mainly children) from the territory they have while they can and to fortify positions/lines of defense to make future offenses costly and miserable in the hope that Ukraine will offer to let them keep some territory at some point as a victory.
Yep. If you want to be mad at somebody about China investing in Africa, it should be us, that we’re not even trying to out-compete the Chinese there.
