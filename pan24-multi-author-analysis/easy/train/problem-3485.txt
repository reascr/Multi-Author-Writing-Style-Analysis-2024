I mean, I wouldn't like it if somone burned my countries flag, I can see being upset about somone burning your holy book. But it's still within their right to do so, and restricting free speech that isnt inciting violence or slanderous is far more offensive to me than anything else.
"Security guarantees". Yes. The very vague "guarantees" that some countries will do "something" if Russia invades.
Exactly. Remember at the outbreak of the first Gulf War; "Iraq has the 4th largest army in the world!" The Iraqi army collapsed within 3 days of the ground campaign.
Military strenh - right now they are the 2nd largest standing army, has a particularly skilled army fighting against insurgence, have one of the fastest growing military industrial complex in the world, is one of 2 moderate secular Muslim countries so it legitimises the alliance in some Muslim nations, is in direct opposition to Russia or Russian proxies in 3 open conflicts, yet, itâ€™s the only NATO country who is in talking terms with Russia, which helped bring the grain deal and prisoner swaps.
If that's enough for you guys, what can I say? It's your country. But if it were mine, I certainly would not trust those assurances.
