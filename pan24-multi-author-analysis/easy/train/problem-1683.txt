Voters haven’t shown that. Majorities of both parties favor different forms of gun control, and there’s actually some merit to the Republican talking points of closing the current loopholes and enforcing what is already on the books, which (depending on the poll) is supported by between 70 and 85 percent of conservative voters.
It’s Never. Fucking. Stopped. I’ve lived my entire life looking for closest exits in classrooms. Daydreams we’re often more like nightmares, thinking of all the ways I could hide, run, or fight. I know school shooters rarely have political motives so it isn’t considered terrorism but FUCK i’m so tired of being scared. And I’m terrified to one day have kids and them go through the same string of never ending trauma.
