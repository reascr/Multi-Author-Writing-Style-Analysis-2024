Maybe easy to understand is not the right phrase, what I meant was is that they are using eye catching lowest common denominator reactionary talking points. Like just being real I believe most people aren't educated enough or equipped to understand the niche topic of gender study and such. Non binary people don't deserve such constent attention and discrimination cast on them 24/7 but they are a minority of a minority demographically speaking. Hardly anyway in suburban sprawl interacts with them and the academic discussion is to new a niche. Easy Boogeyman.
I'm more concerned with them shutting down the government and holding the budget hostage for months as a method to negotiate for increasing the eligibility age of Medicare to 70, decreasing Social Security benefits, cutting off funding for Ukraine, and probably some more tax cuts for the ultra wealthy. Additionally, I fully expect them to slash the budgets of several agencies. Imho, they'll cut the IRS budget back and de-fund the department of education and the EPA, at the very least. Probably de-fund that Consumer Protection Bureau and a bunch of other terrible shit.
