the debate over whether or not Donetsk (the city, the oblast should be out of the question) is included. it makes geographic sense, since what is russia going to do, hold on to a piece of land they can't maintain since it relies on Ukraine for water, supplies, and electricity? while having a bridge that is a joke as the life vein? or the oblast they have 95% control over and surround even with pre-2014 borders? preferably Russia gets neither, but Luhansk Oblast would be more costly and less of a significant victory since all the propaganda and political capital has been spent on Crimea and "the Donetsk People's republic" - forcing them to shift gears propaganda wise, a "Russian speakers homeland" (as silly as that is, great place to deport all Russian loyalists to) and a ramp off which is Pyrrhic in nature is a nice second option to total Ukrainian victory, without the complications of said victory.
Any agreements made then are not worth anything now. In the 90's Russia guaranteed the independence of Ukraine "forever", and in return Ukraine gave Russia all their nukes and a lot of aircraft etc. But that didn't stop Russia from meddling in Ukrainian politics, nor invading in 2014 and 2022.
