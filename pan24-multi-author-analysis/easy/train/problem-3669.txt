I don’t have strong opinions on this because I honestly don’t know the answers and I don’t even know where to look. Because it’s a politically charged issue, there’s a lot of disinformation and bad statistics out there to sift through. I would bet a million bucks that violent crime is correlated with income, parenthood, education, environment (lead levels), and many other class-related issues. It would be interesting to look at police shootings among white people only and look at how many of those shootings involve people with bachelors degrees or higher. As of 2021, 35.5% of white Americans had bachelor’s degrees or higher. I doubt that 35.5% of white people shot by police have bachelor’s degrees or higher. Where are reliable police shootings stats that involve factors other than race? None of the statistics in the article or in the study cited in the article appear to control for class factors.
