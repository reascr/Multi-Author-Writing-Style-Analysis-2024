Sorry. I’m so done with how stupid less than half of my country is. I have no doubt the GOP will back him. If it wasn’t so horrifying it would be funny.
The only form you have to submit to the SEC in order to declare your candidacy is a Statement of Candidacy, which is pretty simple and includes things like your name, address, and designates your campaign committee and any additional committees authorized to raise and/or spend funds on your behalf (i.e. joint fundraising committees, etc.).
After the election there was a growing chorus from the conservatives against mail in ballots because people are voting before they know who the candidate is, and now we have an elected conservative that lied about their entire resume and suddenly it doesn't matter if you don't know who the candidate is, intentionally, becuase dems embelish too.
I don’t give a fuck if you broke the law. We’re talking about you being an untrustworthy liar, you fucking untrustworthy liar. Shove the nuances with “breaking the law” up your ass.
See how he puts the emphasis on him not breaking the law? I wonder if the universal American Mentality will be snowed by this they way so many are with trump.
