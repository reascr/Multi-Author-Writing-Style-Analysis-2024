Apparently, risk of death from omicron is about 1/3 of that of the original strain (so estimate of about 0.6% unvaccinated CFR). Vaccines can reduce that risk by about 95% - but as someone else here has pointed out, the Chinese vaccines are not as effective (60-70% of western versions), and uptake is … problematic.
Vaccines have waning protection over time: first mRNA shot gives 40-50%, second raises it to between 80 & 95% (full effectiveness about 2-4 weeks after each shot).
Each booster is administered after a gap of 6-12 months (once immunity has dropped) to bring the effectiveness back up to the 80-95% (and in some cases to give broader coverage against newer variants).
What if you’re wrong? >100 million COVID cases in 3 days and you think I am somehow untrustworthy when I shared what someone else shared with me? Wait until the deaths follow in 10 days… how long will you hold your anal sphincter before you lock your door, close the blinds and stop going out? What if you don’t get cautious and end up being the 1/3? That’s the worthier conversation for you. I’ve seen people die in 7 days. My friends husband lasted 21. They were married for 8 months. It took a year to get the 60% of the life insurance policy that he had purchased 4 months earlier, in good conscience. Everything can change in the blink of an eye. I hope you’re right.
