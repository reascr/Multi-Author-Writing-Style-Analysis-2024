I didn't say it was the only factor, but the de-escalation of military buildup post WWII in Europe was not accidental. Trump wasn't some genius to notice that most of the EU had military expenditure below 2% GDP, his predecessor's noticed too but didn't mention it because it was part of the plan. Prior to WWI and WWII countries patrolled their own trade routes and places of strategic interests and so military expenditure for each country was by necessity higher. With the US unironically acting as the World Police and ensuring the security of international trade routes, it no longer became necessary for many countries to spend so much on their military especially if they were aligned with the US. And this isn't entirely the US doing the world an altruistic favour either, in return they basically get to dictate the world order and have overwhelming influence in shaping geopolitics so anything that might threaten their hegemony gets dealt with long before it even touches US shores.
Pretty cool first! I've never been on the on foot part but regularly use the Folkestone to Calais trip. Being in a car, on a train under the English Channel never gets old.
