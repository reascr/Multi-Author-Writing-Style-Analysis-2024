I would normally disagree with stopping athletes from competing since it goes against the original Greek spirit (which athletes competed even when in disagreements with other city states), but Russia and Belarus view Olympic success as national pride with lavish rewards and celebrations for medaling athletes. It is so important that they cheat with the help of the nations funds, and pay big money to recruit talent away from other nations. Any participation from their athletes would turn into a circus, with Russian flags sneaking in, the letter Z turning up at sporting events. To Ukrainian athletes it would be like Jews competing with Nazi germany. They need to sit this one out.
If war and war crimes are criteria for not being allowed in the Olympics, then a lot of countries should not be allowed to attend, including Iran, China, Myanmar, the USA, quite a few African countries, and a few Western countries that still support Saudi Arabia's illegal war against Yemenis. That's why the Olympics won't ban Russia because white people's lives are not more important than anyone else's. We must support Ukraine; my country does just that, and I'm happy about it, but the idea that we should ban athletes because of their nationality is pretty funny and hypocritical.
Confidently incorrect. The Olympics has a rich history of athletes representing countries and using their newfound fame to speak out against their governments in ways that help advocate for others.
