That result is definitely dominated by older people. Some people In Indonesia still believe in "strong" leader figure like Putin to lead a country and most of them are people from older generation that lives during our 2nd president era Soeharto (he is also a dictator but don't say that to old people they'll start telling you that you are wrong idk why tbh) that is why lots of people are pro Russian when it comes to this war. Also this older generation gets most of their news from normal news broadcast and lots of news broadcast in Indonesia are pro Russia. Even at the start of the war lots of experts are interviewed and they believes Ukraine wouldn't last a month against Russia but hey look at the reality now LOL. People from older generation also hates west cause in the past there is lots of stories about CIA trying to screw over our country from behind the scene that's why they hate America. Kinda silly to be honest cause lots of people from younger generation that uses social media and saw more than just what the news presented are pro Ukraine and support the west but lots of us just don't want to start a fight with people from older generation that's why we rarely talks about it in public.
