Netanyahu, someone who belongs in jail, is leading one of the most right-wing, terroristic governments Israel has ever seen. Opposing these violent, genocidal bigots is an intelligent and rational position.
How it's going? Let's put it this way: in the last 6 months media that opposes Netanyahu avoids reporting on it, while the media that supports Netanyahu reports constantly. I don't think there is a need to spell out why...
China has Xi Jin Ping, who has presided over the genocide in Xinjiang, purged all of his political rivals, and tossed away the countryâ€™s international goodwill with years of ultranationalistic propaganda and foreign policy, ruining his predecessors achievements in that arena.
I did a very simple exercise. After one witness testimony, I read the coverage in anti-Bibi media, the coverage in pro-Bibi media and then took the actual protocols of the testimony and read them start to finish. There was only minor difference between the pro-Bibi media coverage and reality, while there was 180 degree difference between anti-Bibi media coverage and reality. To put it simply, anti-Bibi media ignored cross interrogation, that actually nullified everything that the witness claimed in her initial testimony.
