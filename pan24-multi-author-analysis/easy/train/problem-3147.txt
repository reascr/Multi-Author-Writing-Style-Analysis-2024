"See? The perfectly peaceful tourists weren't being violent during this five second clips or this twenty second clip or during this fifteen second clip thus proving that there was no violence that day unlike what the woke, socialist Democrats would like you to believe!".
It’s one thing to grant an exclusive interview to Maggie Haberman, but it seems to me like releasing criminal evidence exclusively to an organization explicitly incriminated in the actions is quite another.
Ugh. “Let them in”. If I have to hear “POLICE WAVING PROTESTORS IN” one more time…first of all, they looked more like cops retreating in the face of a mob, but more importantly…who fucking cares? Cops don’t dictate laws. They enforce them. If they genuinely waved people in, that’s a complicit cop, not a crime that’s been justified. It’s the same horseshit with “PELOSI COULD HAVE HAD MORE SECURITY”. Even if it was up to her, it doesn’t make what Trump did any less abhorrent or incriminating. It’s just such horseshit deflections.
