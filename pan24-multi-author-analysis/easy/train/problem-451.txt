Think of it as a flood and the people drowning in debt huddled on rooftops that are almost swamped by the flood. Then you come by in your boat and say, "It's your own fault You should have bought a boat" Whether the callous (or true) as this statement is, it really doesn't matter. People are drowning and we need to help them.

You are missing the point. The idea is not to diminish personal financial responsibility. The point is that there is a looming financial crisis for the lower and middle classes. If people cannot get their children into increasingly expensive schools, we face a severe lack of the educated young people we need to run this increasingly complicated country. We suffer as a nation.
