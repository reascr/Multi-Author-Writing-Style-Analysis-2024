Why is this liberal when it's true and even conservative judges admitted to a responsibility of institutions (especially govt ones) to correct biases that are the result of previous unjust laws since correcting/removing/replacing the laws and policies does nothing to fix the long lasting damage done and the racial disparities that were established previously.
Ugh. I definitely feel for you. My family is blah with politics, meaning they don’t at all immerse themselves in the information that’s available on candidates, political parties, legislation, etc yet still bolster the Republican Party. It’s disgusting. Whenever I tell my mother about anything, she’s just like “well I don’t know anything about that”, yet still feels entitled to an opinion ahahahha she actually told me during the mid term elections that she wanted the republicans to gain majority in house and senate, and when I asked her why, she just said “I just do.” I had to explain to her that all the benefits my family gets, disability, social security, food stamps, state mandated health care, etc will be drastically cut if republicans wind up having a much larger presence.
