It was 8-12 jets (depending on how you interpret the satellite images) and it was conducted using covert operations. However, the impact of the strike was several times more, since Russia evacuated dozens of jets further into Crimea or even into Russian territory, leaving them less able to use airpower on the frontlines.
Where did I say that? We're talking about the Russian military learning from their obvious logistical and tactical short comings. You don't seem to be following. Here it is very simply: Russia bribing Kadyrov to stop fighting ended the second Chechen war, not the Russians learning from the first Chechen war and fixing their military. If they had done that then they wouldn't be in this position in Ukraine.
German reconstruction post-WWII followed its total humiliation and attendant soul-searching. Russia is just not there yet, as there has been no fighting at home and nationalism / fascism is still a majority opinion. A grinding humiliation in Ukraine and maintenance of sanctions for the medium term is the best possible outcome for the West at this point.
