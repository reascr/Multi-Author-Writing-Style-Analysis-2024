Canada has, or at least had, 80 or so. They were being used as target practice starting a few years ago. If any of them dodged that fate I hope we can send them too.
Danish news reports that 99 ex Danish Leo 1A5s is stored in a warehouse just south of the Danish border in Germany, will be sent to Ukraine and that Ukraine thanks us for our contribution to the war calling us "True friends of Ukraine" as far as I know from Danish documentation the 99 ex Danish leos are almost Standard Leo 1A5s with minor modifications to suit their use, the gun is the standard 105mm.
But why? Leo 1’s will literally go up in flames. Their armor is laughable. The amount of parts available is questionable. The only thing they have going for them is speed, but in the mud and winter of Ukraine that won’t matter cause it’s a light tank. They’ll get stuck.
The Leo 1A5 can still be an effective weapon in taking out enemy IFVs,APCs and other lightly armored vehicles and annoy enemy soft targets with HE shells, while the protection isn't the best I believe the Leo 1A5 will be able to use the older but still effective western optics and targeting systems and will have a older thermals, but anything is better than nothing.
