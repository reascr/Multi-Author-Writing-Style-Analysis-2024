And Putin looks only at the paper and gives money for creating batallions that don't exist. This all smells like corruption like the first day. All that destruction of foreign weapon systems is being rewarded too, if it really happened is another question. You hit a BMT or something similar? Wow you just destroyed a M270 MLRS, here have your 50000 rubles.
I never understood people who doubted Ukraines numbers; there’s no point to them lying about it because the truth is in their favour, it’s their weapon to enable the western world to support them, if anything I believe their numbers are conservative bias because at some point some idiot would say “look how easily they are making the kills they don’t need help” when you see a thousand deaths a day any western country in a similar situation (an offensive action) says “that’s too many we need to stop” and then project that behaviour on to Russia and assume they will stop but they won’t because they don’t care about their people, like most dictatorships.
