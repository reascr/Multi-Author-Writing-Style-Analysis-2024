He's absolutely correct. Do you see military recruiters set up in Beverly Hills, CA? How about Greenwich? UES/UWS Manhattan? It's what we've done for the longest time. Reason a large population of our military comes from rural. They do not want intelligent soldiers, same reason law enforcement doesn't either. LAPD is a perfect case study. After Rampart fiasco, they went on a squeaky clean with college degree requirements. Wound up with a majority force that couldn't tell a drug deal from a Girl Scout cookie deal. Intelligent people questions direction and orders. That or they get bored and they wind up causing trouble.
“Nuclear engineering” is irrelevant, without stating the designation the piece of paper entitles: there are plenty of community college / tech diplomas and degrees below a bachelors degree and far simpler—the educated concentration of MAGA is composed of those ranks.
It’s true. I watched shameful actions to Vietnam vets. I can only hope Americans learned from these cruel mistakes. Whether it was because of the draft or voluntary, your time was sacrificed for USA. Thank you.
Military mentality supersedes education, given the research I’ve seen, thus far; religion is another that often manages to circumvent one’s education.
