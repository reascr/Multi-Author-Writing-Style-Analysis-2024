Common core mathematics was one recent example that I think warranted a bit more emotional empathy from the left even though I do think the majority of the coverage was and just anti-Obama opportunism. I do think the approach is a far superior method for those who independently embrace it, but it's also a field that many children and adults struggle with. Given how much 'good grades' are emphasized, I could see it being very frustrating for adults bad at math & abstract concepts seeing their child struggle in their classes. At which point, is it acceptable for an engaged parent to request that a child struggling with mathematics be put in a traditional mathematics setting so they have more resources available? In a healthy society where adults are making rational decisions and issues like this isn't overly politicized for cheap pops, I'd say yes - but we'd have to get away from the overly charged left vs. right approach and have crucial subjects like these discussed in a more mature setting.
