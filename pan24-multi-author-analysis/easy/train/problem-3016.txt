I'm just reading some RU reports about Wuhledar. The gist is that after initial assault an breaking up early Ukrainian defences by 155th, there should be an immediate follow up with other units to reinforce the flanks and secure the gains. Apparently commanders of those units (which were consisting of battalions of mechanized infantry with about 70% of mobilized men) reported full readiness of those units, when in reality they were still in preparation phase. They supposedly did that to avoid anger of their superiors. So when the assault started, 155th went forward, but units of 41th army didn't follow. They followed only a day after, when 155th was trying to survive and was doing some back and forth maneuvers losing about about 100 people. The following days mobik units noticed that the field wasn't fully demined (Ukrainians correctly focused fire on engineering vehicles) and that only a narow path was safe. So they made a column. That of course was what Ukrainians wanted. They started to shoot the front and back vehicles. When the column was blocked, some vehicles tried to move forward, avoiding fresh wrecks. Some succeeded, others exploded on mines. That caused the lower level commanders to order retreat. Veterans tried to save equipment, mobiks just opened hatches and ran. That made the retreat of 155th difficult as there was no safe passage at that place. They lost two tanks trying to find safe passage, but they were able to finally get away.
Honestly? I personally think Ukraine has this in the bag. But it's going to be incredibly hard nonetheless. Ukraine doesn't have decisive superiority in the battlefield. They need to get it right.
