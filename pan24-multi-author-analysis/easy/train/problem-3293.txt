Lol, the socialists of reddit can't figure out why natural gas prices are high right now and fall back to the default "muh gouging/profiteering". I love it.
I will, though, leave you with the concept that increasing the price of something just because of either actual or manufactured scarcity is, in reality, totally and completely sociopathic. Like, "oh no, we're short on insulin/natural gas/food/whatever-else-society-needs-but-we-commodified... welp, guess the only solution is to increase the price so only the wealthiest can afford it. Makes sense to me!".
Recent articles on the topic have suggested that there are a few reasons for the higher prices, two of the most salient being increased exports of LNG to Europe (since they are not buying from Russia at the moment), and increased local demand for power generation. US consumers now have to compete with the global market.
