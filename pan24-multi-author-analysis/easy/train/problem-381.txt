I agree. The Republican Party needs to fix its badly damaged image by shunning scam artists and yahoos. The Republican Party needs to endorse intelligent conservative respectable politicians.
The rest of us knew this in 2015. Republicans are only speaking against him now because he served his purpose; they got their supreme court. Now they can dump him and act like they never supported him. "This isn't who we are." Bullshit. Then why did you support him? Vote for him? Support his policies? Not speak out against him when he was president? He was just as disgusting as president as he is now, but you cared more about your party's power and your own career over than things like honor, honesty, integrity, decency and any other virtue. It's beyond disgusting. What's worse, the voters will do the same. "Oh I never really supported him." will be said by those who decorated their cars with his flags and bought his shitty made-in-China merchandise.
