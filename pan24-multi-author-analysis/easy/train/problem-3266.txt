People forget it was a bloody war between English and French Canadians at the time. And they were expected to just move on like nothing happened.
Those provisions included explicit provisions that oaths of office did NOT prevent French Canadians, either by the fact that they were French Canadians or by the fact that they might be Catholics from holding office, and the Legislative Council (under the Quebec Act) and the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly under the Constitution Act all had French Canadian (Catholic) members.
Wrong. Canadian parliamentarians, like Australian and NZ parliamentarians, do not swear oaths to the United Kingdom. They swear their oaths to their own nations. Those nations just so happen to share the same monarch, however, in those respective nations, the monarch is sworn to solely as the monarch of their nation. So in Canada, parliamentarians swear their oaths to the King of Canada. Australians to the King of Australia. Brits to Great Britain and Northern Ireland, etc. So there’s no different state there, and for Canadian parliamentarians, no sworn oath to British royalty — just Canadian royalty.
Regardless, Canadian parliamentarians do not take an oath to the King/Queen of England, nor to the United Kingdom, but to their own nation under that same mutual monarch. In Australia it’s to the King of Australia, and in New Zealand, the King of New Zealand. Same for Canada. Nobody is swearing an oath to a foreign nation. These countries just happen to all share the same monarch as fully and functionally independent realms.
