Pretty sure the inability to bring decent jobs to the south which has been going for 150 years isn't going to become solvable at some point. They lack so much necessary human infrastructure to support real economic growth with good economies on its doorstep to the north and west - there's simply no reason to make the enormous investment there when practically none is needed for corporations to kick up in other states already with dense available educated employee bases.
How with what money? What jobs? Move into neighborhoods poor people can afford? Ghettos making life worse for brown and black Americans. Gas? Wake up the only thing moving are the ballots. We will always suffer. Time to rise up as one.
I’m a Canadian interested in US elections, and I sometimes find myself wondering how many white Americans really, truly realize that everything progressive (in fact, pretty much everything that’s not fascist and outright delusional at this point) that happens in US electoral politics is due to Black people’s commitment to unceasingly pushing for progress (even though elected officials so rarely give them much in return).
