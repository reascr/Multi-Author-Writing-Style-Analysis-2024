The last point would fit, in a way. The political situation has been swinging back and forth for the last years, but the situation is also more or less stable. A thing like the president dying could destabilize the country and put a more pro-russian element in power, or if this is not possible then I guess destabilizing a country supporting Ukraine could be like their supposed sabotage of other countries, like that thing of the russian ambassador asking for the removal of the italian president.
There are FSB agents throughout the world. This kind of warfare is cheap and for the most part easy.
Strictly speaking, people stilll haven't come to terms that russia=/=communism and that being anti-imperialism, anti-USA and pro-russia can act as separate positions; you don't have to be pro-USA if you are anti-russia and viceversa but people don't seem to grasp this, much less consider it. And this affects both sides.
Russian assassination attempts are indistinguishable from radicalized nutjobs though. See the absolute fisting of an encounter that the KGB had in Salisbury.
Russian influence operations in western countries are opportunistic, not ideologically driven. They're willing to get in bed with any local movement that is anti-government or anti-alliance.
