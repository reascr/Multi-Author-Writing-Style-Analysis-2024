What goes around comes around. Misapplication of trafficking applied to abortion access is infuriating, but not at all surprising.
This was me at 12 years. I’m so, very thankful my parents allowed me to get an abortion at 12 fucking years old. I now have three children, and it’s so damned hard. I will never, ever regret having had an abortion, particularly considering now that I’ve had children, I know I have a genetic disorder that’s affected two of them. Pro choice for life.
During the 00’s it was liberals and feminists (I identify as both) who promoted the misuse and misapplication of “trafficking” during a windfall of private and government funding to build an anti-trafficking movement that has helped few victims relative to the largesse of funds these networks accessed.
Also, as a parent: Nope. If my daughter needed an abortion and felt she couldn't tell me, that'd be my failure, not hers. And if I forbid her from getting one so she felt she had to sneak off and do it I'd be a shit parent.
