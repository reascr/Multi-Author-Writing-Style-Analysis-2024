China's military is surely technologically advanced and they are closing the tech gap with the US quickly due largely to their ability to fill in their forces with modern systems without having to worry about the same costs as the US in pay, excess bases, and keeping up more antiquated systems. However, never underestimate the Pentagon's ability to overestimate enemy systems capabilities from a mixture of caution and a desire to spend money on defense.
Yes. TSMC's foundries are useless without support, supplies, maintenance, etc... from ASML (a Dutch company). It would still be devastating though for companies like Apple and AMD if they were abruptly cut off of computer chips.
Chinaâ€™s military lacks experience. The People's Liberation Army struggles under the legacy of an obsolete command system, rampant corruption, and training of debatable realism.
