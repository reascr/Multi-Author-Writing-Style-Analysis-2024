Obama had one in 2015 that would have meant better braking technology for trains carrying highly flammable materials. But lobbyists got him to water it down so actually vinyl chloride wasn't included on that list. This is against the advice from safety groups.
Maybe he will toss out some towels and say he basically fixed everything with his personal money and then cnn will run stories tracking donation money for the victims and state with a news headline “trump lied about helping the victims” and then the article gets lost in the waves of other breaking news but when you bring it up to a pro fox watcher then they will say “but what did Obama or dark Brandon do for Ohio?”.
Nope. Starts at local level and up as it should. If locals are overwhelmed they call County and on up to State which calls Feds in turn. The East Palestinians and Ohioans in general are complaining about the hands off no regs government they voted for. Will they change? Not likely and will vote for them all again cursing the gummint.
