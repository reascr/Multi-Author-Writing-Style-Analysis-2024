You can’t keep blaming some other country for the failure of local governments. Reverting to past colonial rule as an excuse is not taking ownership of your bad decisions. You got independence and fucked it up, take ownership of it. Then you can rebuild.
Haiti got screwed hard by France after the war as they saddled them with a massive debt that would take over a century to pay, and the fact that it was a slave revolt that ended with them massacring the white population(which they had agreed not to in the peace treaty, and they also targeted their white Allies and supporters in the country) earned them little to no support from the international community. Additionally there initial leader, Louverture, who seemed competent and a good leader that was able to negotiate successfully with world powers was captured and killed towards the end of the war, with Dessalines being partially responsible as he switched sides briefly to take him out. Dessalines would go on to become the first dictator of Haiti and would immediately re-establish plantations, just for meager wages… he is also the one who ordered the massacre….
