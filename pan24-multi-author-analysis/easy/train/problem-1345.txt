When I first moved to the Florida Keys way back in the late 80's, there was a bar across US1 from me that had motorcycle skid marks on the walk leading up to the door, and a sign over it that read, "What's the matter? You scared)? The front part of the saloon was indeed pretty rough and ready; usually tourists who drank too much rum and then thought it was a good idea to challenge some of the local fishermen to a game of pool. The tourists would put down bets (sometimes $100 per game or more) and then when they'd lose, which was most of the time, because the fishermen hung out there every day) they'd start a fight. Since there were bikers in the place a lot as well. Sooo, it'd get seriously rowdy, with pool cues and bar stools being smashed over people's heads. I'd drink my daqiari (I'm a female) off to the side, and just watch it all, then after it was all over I'd head to the back room which was pretty nice, and fights weren't allowed in there. I met this biker once there who had an insane custom chopper (which he drove in and was right next to him) and he was really sweet. He was drinking a plain 7-Up; I couldn't believe it, but it was - he said he didn't drink alcohol while he was riding, as he'd put $25K into his bike, and didn't want to take a chance.
