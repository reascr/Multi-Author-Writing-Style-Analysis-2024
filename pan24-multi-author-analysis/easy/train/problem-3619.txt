So they invaded Ukraine, stole the fur coats, which they shipped back to Russia to give to mothers and widows of soldiers who died invading Ukraine-- only to steal them back from the mothers, to create more photo ops of them giving those few stolen Ukrainian fur coats to an increasingly huge number of mothers whose sons died for not even a clutch of fur coats and a few washing machines, but half a thimble of soil in Bakhmut.
I agree. Conditions for an effective Russian offense were never met. Surely some commanders knew this. But it seems they were ordered to attack anyway. Could have been panic. Could also have been arrogance, incompetence, impatience, politics, or a combination. It is so hard to tell with them sometimes.
