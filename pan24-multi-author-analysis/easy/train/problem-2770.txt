I'm really just annoyed that nobody went after him for perjury for lying on his declaration and court statements. That would have been a fun ride to see.
Roger having a whole marketing machine behind him pushing him as the face of tennis (and succeeding) since 2004 doesn't change the fact that his career accomplishments have been surpassed by both of his greatest rivals, with Djokovic only now being accepted as the leading man, having for 15 years been the villain to the perfect duo of Fedal.
No not at all. We should be outraged at the fact he tried to enter the country when it was a mandatory requirement of the Australian government in 2022 to be vaccinated, that he lied on official government documents that should have resulted in a three year ban on any visa, that he falsely claimed he had Covid to avoid getting the vaccine which was very easily proven that he didn't have Covid when claimed, that he made up this entire web of lies to try and intentionally deceive the entire world. That's why we should still be outraged.
