It’s crazy. I live in a very liberal town populated by former flower children. While I was growing up here they were always putting together programs to help underprivileged people, constantly boosting funding for school, creating festivals of great music and art that benefited the hungry or disabled, voting for people that built the town into the great place it is now. Recently I’ve noticed a lot of people with Tibetan prayer flags in their windows with signs to vote against the school funding referendum, or for a nimby organization that’s against building up, “we didn’t elect you to destroy our neighborhoods” etc.. it’s kind of wild to see a friends parent, who used to be very chill and kind, go on a racist tirade against immigrants that may or may not have crossed a border 2000 miles from us.
Exactly. I'm in the rural-Midwest and so many of people in my area that I've talked to want better healthcare via the government, more money towards education, and better housing options. These are all policies that the GOP outright rejects. In Missouri, we just legalized marijuana while the GOP railed against it for months.
