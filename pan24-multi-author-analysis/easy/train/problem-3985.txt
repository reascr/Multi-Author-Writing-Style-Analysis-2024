As someone from Long Beach who got to witness him as mayor....please dont celebrate this tired ass hack. He's an absolute piece of shit that waves the brown and gay flag around to get him votes and then completely ignores his constituents. He campaigned on the homeless problem and when it came time to actually do something he installed like 4 parking meters in DTLB and said the donations would be going toward "the fund", which never materialized. So many other instances of shitty political games, not the least of which are the architectural monstrosities that were allowed to be built in DTLB. He essentially used Long Beach as a springboard for this congress bullshit without ever actually giving a damn about the city. This comic book shit is just more empty theater, theres nothing real behind it other than trying to make him seem likeable. Bleahhh.
Very much, he used his sexuality to get elected then immediately worked for developers to develop “luxury apartments” all over downtown. Rents have raised drastically, homelessness increased, then created bike lanes that impacted parking more in parking impacted neighborhoods. A lot of vanity projects that only pad his resume to move into higher office. I use the bike lanes often but they were poorly planned and create a lot of blind spots, creating even more dangerous situations for riders. His response of the protests during the pandemic were very in-empathetic. Not to mention his silence in lbpd’s tiger text scandal.
