Not everyone is selfish, I agree that most people don't want to be around smokers, and smoking at a bus stop in a crowd is a dick move, you can go somewhere else and not smoke a cig around jane doe waiting for the bus with her kids, she obviously has groceries and just wants to go home and cook some dinner without getting blasted in the face with cig smoke. I fucking get that, that is disrespectful, but a lot are going over to the corner away from everyone else, I've seen crack smokers show less respect.
Most smokers go out of their way to not smoke around non smokers so I wouldn't say they're selfish, but if your smoking inside a food place or a bar or something that's a dick move. The shift in behavior is recent so I'll give you that, I would put the majority of smokers around the same place I would put pot smokers, mostly they go outside and stuff.
Bad comparison. Oil companies pay for cleanup if there's a spill during their bulk delivery. They don't pay to clean the storm water system if Ricky dumps his used motor oil in the street.
