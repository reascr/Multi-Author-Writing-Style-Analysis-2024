Good. I live in TN and we have pretty much one of the worst child poverty rates in the country (1/4 kids is below the poverty line) and losing any money sucks for us, but if people donâ€™t listen to reason hit their wallets. And yes I have kids and still want this to happen.

Republican sexual interest. The line they have applying it to drag is "...male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest". There is also a line that says "regardless of whether performed for consideration". Basically the part that makes it illegal is Republican sexual interest in trans people and drag queens. It doesn't matter whether that was the persons intent or if there was money exchanged. They could call a drag person on the street a street performer. They are probably sexually interested in the minors who dress as cheerleaders too, but they are less open than that and their goal isn't to punish that.
Republican policy isn't even popular with Republican voters. And the GOP knows it. All they have are culture war emotional triggers to get their voters to the polls, so they went all in.
