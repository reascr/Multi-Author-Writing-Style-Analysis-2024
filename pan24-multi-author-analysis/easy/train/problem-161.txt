It's not that the crowd was smaller; it's that the ideology was always fundamentally self-focused. The protest songs people point to were written by members of the Silent Generation, not Boomers. The Vietnam war and draft was ongoing for years (Vietnam started in 1955, and ramped up in 1964), but didn't prompt outrage until it was Baby Boomers getting drafted. If you want a look into the era without rose-colored glasses, read by Joan Didion. In retrospect, it's not at all shocking that Madison Avenue had a pathetically easy time turning the privileged among that generation to reject any communitarian values in favor of "this is what I need, and my personal growth is the most important value.".
Kentucky voters simply rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion.
The work is never done. We got lazy that's why we got Trump and current disaster that is the GOP. People didn't show up to vote for Hillary though she won over all by 3,000,000 votes, she lost the presidency by 35,000 and disaster struck the US.
