I was following Tulsi on Facebook before she announced a run for President. She seemed genuine even if you didnâ€™t agree with her position. Literally the day she announced she was running for President, her whole shit changed. All of her responses to people were spineless and you can tell she was fishing for opinions so she could identify which stance would be the most popular. It was almost like her page was just an AI experiment to become the most likable candidate ever. I stopped following when Fox News was running her clips from interviews to basically support Trump, and her dumb ass was reposting them because nobody cared what she had to say otherwise. She is definitely on the payroll of a foreign power.
Absolutely. Most of the Manchin hate I see here is entirely unwarranted. WV is redder than shit and runs on fossil fuels top to bottom. It SHOULD be an R seat and Manchin is the only reason it isn't. He's representing his constituents. Sorry they're not left leaning enough for Reddit.
