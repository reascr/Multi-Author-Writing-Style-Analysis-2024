Not quite what happened it was more outgoing trains didn't want to let them on. Racism should not be excused or discounted or even diminished but there where a LOT of women and children trying to get on those same trains into poland. Some rich (for africa or india) student wanting to get on the train vs a feeing family.....I can understand how things went down the way they did. Probably just as likely they prioritized their "own" but I try not to judge the ukrainians as a whole for what happened people are people.
