I don't see Hungary as "specific," I understand the Treaty of Trianon ripped off a lot of land but by that logic Croatia should still be Austrian (among other things). The fact of the matter is that most of Europe has mostly just stopped fighting over these things, with the exceptions being extremely localized flashpoints at the edges of Europe (Kosovo, Poor Ireland, and of course Russia's attempts to rebuild its empire at the expense of its neighbors), conflicts that have mostly just been ignored for one reason or another (Gibraltar being the best known example), and Hungary spending a lot more time on Trianon than its other WWI allies over their losses (with one notable exception in the pastthat is kind of the reason why people get icky when Orban screams about blood and land).
For sure. All of Reddit seems to be completely oblivious to the very real, very serious possibility of nuclear annihilation of the entire world as an outcome of this conflict. Even mentioning any sort of negotiation to end it to avoid that outcome will get you labeled as a "Putin apologist.".
