The countries are very well sorted geographically. Basically only Australia and New Zealand don’t geographically fit the Global South mold. If I understand you correctly, you think I should have called the countries Third World countries. This of course would not include China, which is included in the Global South. The opinion of China is pretty critical in this conflict. It would change the meaning of my statement and make it less clear if I used the term Third World. If you come up with a better suggestion I’m open to it.
Between the brutality of the war on Ukraine, the devastation of its infrastructure, the minimal effort by Swiss companies to leave Russia under sanctions, the cloaking of financial dealings related to Russian assets, the minimal financial aid provided to Ukraine and its neighbours, and the refusal to provide arms and ammunition, Switzerland--the world's wealthiest country per capita--certainly enjoys a certain privilege while ignoring many types of severe war crimes ongoing in real time.
