This is the crux of where the lies of the Russian government have been spread - lack of evidentiary backing, attempts to manipulate the media regarding the purpose for their war of aggression, constant blaming of others for their “moral” (read: violent) actions.
Wow it’s probably so hard to explain the concepts and spins because there’s no viable pathway for Russia to not be implicated in heinous human rights offenses such as; mass execution of civilians, using ballistic missiles and mortars against civilian infrastructure, and the big elephant in the room — a war of aggression against a sovereign neighboring state. Take the time to explain your position, I and my brain cells can wait.
Those same joke fucks are working to undermine US domestic security (power grid attacks by "domestic" terrorists), international relations (shoveling fossil fuels to China and India), and Democratic stability at a global level. Just to steal some land they willingly relinquished any right to DECADES ago in a treaty. The Russian government is a joke that can't reliably provide stability for its people, who they control by a frayed thread via state sponsored media. A travesty of modern governance on par with the failures of North Korea.
