At the beginning of the war PiS government distanced itself from Orban's pro Russian rethorics. They also experienced Orban's 'loyalty' in 2017 when Hungary voted Tusk in as the council president. Given that Hungary's got their EU funds heavily restricted recently due to unprecedented corruption and missapropriation levels (which is possible also due to Morawiecki's government agreeing to the money-for-rule-of-law mechanism in 2020), and Orban clearly bets on kickbacks from Russia, especially in the energy sector, Poland might soon outlive its usefulness to lil old Victor. Also, PiS has lost its foregin policy in 2015 and is still to find it as of today (excluding of course the Ukraine stance, which is actually quite bipartisan and naturally russophobic to most of Poles).
Yes. there's money to be made for the 3rd tier assholes who fuck up their population. Little people shut up with your Western ideals of caring for shit,.
It is very tempting to be against EU institutions well protected by NATO, by European laws against discrimination, by laws protecting human rights and working conditions, without military duty neither conscription, well shielded by social security and free public education (existing however perfectible), authorised to go everywhere you want to, to listen, look or read everything you want to.
