Yeah but shes backing McCarthy for speaker. Shes been in dc now for 2 years and wants real power. McCarthy panders to her to bring along the far right and she likes the taste of being truly important to someone who will be 3rd in line to the presidency. But staying close to power means compromises and speaking out in defense (vigorously it seems in the speakers race) for a squishy guy like McCarthy. Not a good look for the base.
