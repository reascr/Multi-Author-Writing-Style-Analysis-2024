Because it's a narrative issue. The Republicans have no problem destroying America if it means "own the libs at all costs" (it's literally one of their political strategies. Make things so unbearable and then automatically blame the Democrats, smear the Democrats in the media, and at the same time praise their actions to their supporters/base/voters as some kind of conservative heroes). Biden did the thing that he believed would've saved millions of Americans from going hungry and thirsty only a year before a major election. Oh, but some people would be fine because it will be in solidarity with the rail workers (which I would too) but with a country of over 330,000,000 Americans, not all people would survive with no heat and/or drinking water. And not all of them are young people, some of them have young children, etc... But not only the Republicans are getting away with sticking to the rail workers they are also getting to go around saying they "saved America from a massive rail strike" that would've destroyed America", but they would have no problem blaming Biden and the other Democrats if the economy would slip into a nightmarish depression that would result in millions of deaths of the cold and thirst. Millions would lose their jobs and also their homes, etc... But the rail companies SHOULD give them sick days but they also need to hire more people.
Lol seriously. Does anyone really think this would have been better for the workers with the GOP in charge?
