Don't you see that this was caused by generations of NIMBYs before you? You're just perpetuating a harmful situation because you personally benefit from it.
I did sell the house a while ago after leaving the area. I'm still in a high CoL area, but I am kinda sitting here looking at the market thinking "this can't be sustainable". It continues to skyrocket, it just feels like it's on the edge of collapse as it is in a lot of ways, but in other ways it honestly doesn't feel like it's slowing down at all, something has to give at some point, but it doesn't feel super imminent to the people that can afford to buy into this market (which I can't anymore).
Right? The housing where I live isn't great. It's not a metroplex. People are constantly buying "investment properties" and immediately renting them out in the already shabby condition they're in. The last lease I had, they said they were selling so we had to get out, they opted to leave it empty for 8 months (trying to get 300k plus for a 900 sq foot 2 bedroom 1 bath from the 1960's) and instead just started renting it out again.
