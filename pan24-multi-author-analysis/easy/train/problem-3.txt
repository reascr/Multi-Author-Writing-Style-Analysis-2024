Like others, it made more sense for my husband to be the stay at home parent when we had our son. My position always supplies us with insurance and I make more. He's a 1099 work for himself most of the time or works part time when our son is in school. After childcare, gas, wear and tear, it doesn't make sense. Of course things get tight, it's not easy and right now it feels impossible at times, but it's a sacrifice that allows our elementary age son to have a parent home with him. My husband actually really likes working part time and being the stay at home parent. He wasn't in a field where he was fighting for management or a level of prestige. He's a skilled welder and woodworker. So maybe working for himself didn't lend the same stresses I can see other people would feel if they left their career path to raise a family at home.
Not particularly. In rural Missouri the local wage was like 5.50 an hour. Rent for our house, a two bedroom, was 550 a month. You still had to have two incomes or one good income but it would be tight. 10 an hour in 2000 was 17.29 an hour now.
