Second, and this one is potentially the most damning, was that we don’t hear much about these stolen documents and how that potentially relates to the suspiciously high number of human intelligence assets, WORLD WIDE, that were captured/killed/turned as per a CIA cable revealed by the NYT in the fall of ‘21. This aspect of the Trump documents story was a blip in the first week or so of this story blowing up but I haven’t heard shit about it since.
The two biggest points to this story that I’m afraid aren’t getting enough attention are that someone in Trump’s inner circle ratted him out to the feds. It’s my impression that basically everyone within ketchup distance of him is culpable for crimes of one sort or another. Which means that whoever blew the whistle was trying to get some sort of protection. As such, they’re probably privy to knowledge of more than just malfeasance with secure handling of said documents but rather malicious intent (sale, distribution, exchange of docs). In other words, if I got busted for selling drugs, I’m not gonna expect to get a plea deal from ratting on my neighbors shed that doesn’t meet HOA regulations.
