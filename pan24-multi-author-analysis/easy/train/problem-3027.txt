The Puritans showed up here in the early 1600s and settled in the New England area. The Roman Catholic Church wasnâ€™t hardcore enough for these guys. Puritans believed it was the government's responsibility to enforce moral standards and ensure true religious worship was established and maintained.
P.S.: it's a bad political move for the left to rag on religion so much. Polls show that most people are still religious to some degree; it's a part of being human for a lot of people. The left has to show some of that nuance they're famous for and be more tolerant, too OR at least get their message straight that they're not God haters and fall right into the hate preachers' "us v. them" agenda. If you actually read the Gospels (& ignore the stuff written/approved by the authorities), there's not a lot of bad things that can be said of Jesus. People just don't read the Bible is the problem......and it's not even the 1400s. lol.
Yes, most people are still religious to some degree, BUT follow the trends... between an increasingly educated youth, and increasingly bigoted and anti-science, anti-human, anti-environment religious right, Christians are doing the heavy lifting of eliminating their religion all on their own. They dont need any help from "the left".
