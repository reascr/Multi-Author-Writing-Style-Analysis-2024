Lots of folks manage some low-key relationship with alcohol and find it brings a lot to their lives. I'm not here to argue against that. I gave up a very happy 1-2 drinks a day relationship a while ago that I had maintained for years and was ready to defend to the bitter end. Being honest, I regrettably found I was more stoked for hobbies I love, had more energy and more ability to focus / better impulse control, lost some weight, did better at work, was generally in a better position to deal with hard stuff in life, and emotionally painful stuff didn't bum me out so much. Pros strongly outweighed the cons once I gave my brain time to find a new baseline and got over the "eff this, I feel crappy and want my drink" phase. Still miss alcohol, but it's not worth it IMHO. YMMV.
You also failed to acknowledge that my observations were not just observations alone, but also the evidence that was backed up by research that is publicly available. If you want to do your own Google searches on the topic be my guest. Thereâ€™s plenty of research you can read up on.
