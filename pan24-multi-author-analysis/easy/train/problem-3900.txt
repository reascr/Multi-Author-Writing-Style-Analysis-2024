Nobody cares that things have changed, if you want to change the agreement, you have to convince the other side to that agreement. Turkey is not going to give up it's access to the Mediterranean because Greece feels like having more territorial waters than it agreed to after it lost the war over said territorial waters the first time it tried this kind of bullshit. If Greeks want to force Turkey's hand - they should go right ahead.
Yeah that's the Greek position, which is why Turkey can do whatever they want and only France will heed Greece's bitching. Turkey is not the one expanding it's territorial waters after 100 years, using other nations as a shield, and the real world is not reddit. Bitching and running to France doesn't get you territory, if you want to take shipping lanes from Turkey, you need to prepare to fight Turks for it. That's what happened last time the Greeks made the mistake of thinking "Turks are weak and France is on our side, let's quickly attack to get revenge for Hagia Sophia.".
Turkey being a signatory is irrelevant. The islands previously under Italian control were formally handed back to Greece by Italy with the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947 with a quite specific stipulation: the islands must be and must remain demilitarised (section V article 14).
