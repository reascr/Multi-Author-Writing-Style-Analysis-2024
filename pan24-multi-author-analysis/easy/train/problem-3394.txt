But no putin is a shart stain and would launch a nuke because, fuck it he's dieing anyways so fuck everyone else. Russia needs to get rid of him.
Sloppy documentation/administration combined with rash-acting commanders who throw around their weight rather than to allow for the investigation of likely clerical errors.
That is true! Russian knows they didn't and cannot win, so atm they are fighting to trade equipment and resources. This way they can force Ukraine to sit down for talks. Very unfortunate is that NATO countries are starting to run out of old post-soviet equipment as well, and even if they would like to give them modern ones it's not as easy because Ukraine would need training which takes months if not years to finish also it would require rework and adjustments to take out communication systems of each country and to suit Ukraine systems.
Dude. Not all of them. Most are being forced into this. Their lives and their loved ones lives are being threatened. 'Do it or die' is their choice before being dragged away and forced into this.
