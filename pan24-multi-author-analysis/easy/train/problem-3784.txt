Neither the intelligence community nor law enforcement obtained intelligence inadvance of January 6th on the full extent of the ongoing planning by PresidentTrump, John Eastman, Rudolph Giuliani and their associates to overturn thecertified election results. Such agencies apparently did not (and potentially couldnot) anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer the crowd in hisEllipse speech, that President Trump would “spontaneously” instruct the crowdto march to the Capitol, that President Trump would exacerbate the violent riot bysending his 2:24 p.m. tweet condemning Vice President Pence, or the full scale ofthe violence and lawlessness that would ensue. Nor did law enforcementanticipate that President Trump would refuse to direct his supporters to leave theCapitol once violence began. No intelligence community advance analysispredicted exactly how President Trump would behave; no such analysis recognizedthe full scale and extent of the threat to the Capitol on January 6th.
Thanks.... Your link validates the debate. Manafort was convicted on Tax Evasion. Nothing to do or proved against Russian Collusion to win the 2016 Election. The Election Trump was called an Illegitimate President by the 2016 Democrat Election Deniers.
