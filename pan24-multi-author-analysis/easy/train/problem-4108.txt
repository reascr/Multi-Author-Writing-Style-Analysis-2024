Yeah. The world can thank this mustachioed fuck for fueling the conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, rebellions in Congo, and Angola. So many died and shit is still a mess. The world can thank him for ensuring the African continent is awash with weapons. Obviously he isnâ€™t the only arms trafficking scum to operate there but there is no doubt as to the damage he is directly responsible for on the African continent. I hope this guy gets to join the other ruzzian felons on the frontline.
