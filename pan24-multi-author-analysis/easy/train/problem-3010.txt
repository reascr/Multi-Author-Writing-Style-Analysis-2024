TL.R for people who clearly didn't read the post: European countries are selling Russian oil to the UK under their own flag, bypassing the "no russia" policy through a loophole. There you go no more circle jerk of 'UK bad'.
Russian tanks desperately need imports from Western nations to be able to produce new equipment because they are reliant on those bits of equipment that they don't have the skills to make - sanctions have essentially stopped Russia's ability to produce military equipment in any meaningful way - they've been relegated to buying Iranian Suicide drones and North Korean artillery because that's all they can get their hands on - that's whilst loosing 10-20 tanks a week for example.
That's great. Send the same amount next year and you would match Russia's annual military budget. Then do the same next year and the year after.
You're pretending as if my point is wrong because we don't have all the variables - we don't need them, we just need to look at what has happened in the past few months, known facts about Russia's military capability and production power and from that we can determine strongly that Russia are retreating and have very little power to force a war which will keep going.
