It’s actually a real simple equation, the cost of labor isn’t some arbitrary thing it is made up of everything it costs for a person to be alive even more than that, everything it takes for a person to continue to work. So that means you simply add up all the food, shelter, water, clothing, transportation, entertainment, and medical care in terms of dollars spent in any given time frame and divide by the hours we think someone should work. We, actually have a term for this, living wage. If a business pays less than that amount, they are not paying the true cost of that labor, in fact that business would be paying them to die.
Really? The BEST? There can be absolutely no improvements? How about a federal requirement that minimum wage aligns with cost of living in each state? How about requirements for minimum amounts of sick leave, maternity leave, health benefits? Surely there are ways the system can be improved.
Now I know what you’re thinking, dying is a bit extreme and people don’t need entertainment and could skimp on food, transportation they could carpool or take a bus, they could avoid health insurance, at which point the laborer is no longer really partaking in a free exchange and are more or less becoming a slave, completely reliant on the job they work to just sustain themself and the moment they are unable to do that job, they will perish.
