Not necessarily. The three federal criminal laws that prosecutors cited as the basis for the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago -- laws involving removal of information related to national defense, hiding government records and obstructing a federal investigation -- do not depend on the information in question being classified.".

Several key differences actually. The first one is that the documents were locked up, so nobody else could see them, unlike the ones at Mar a Lago which anyone could access (and Mar a Lago is full of spies). The next major difference is that Biden immediately handed over the documents to the National Archives as soon as they were found, unlike Trump who lied about having the documents for a long time and refused to return them when requested. Trump broke many laws, whereas Biden did not. The third major difference is that Biden only had 10 documents, whereas Trump had thousands. The fourth major difference is that Biden likely left those documents there by accident and forgot about them. Trump knowingly took thousands of documents illegally with the intent to sell them.
