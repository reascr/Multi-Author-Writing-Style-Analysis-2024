I believe the only reason Bernie lost was because the majority of Democrats continue to buy into the enlightened centrist trope and get gun-shy at every opportunity that presents itself. Nothing more; just purely blind speculation that an authentic, passionate candidate wouldn't be popular in the general election. After Bloomberg literally ran to inject 1 billion-dollars in smear against Warren & Sanders in 2020 in defense of Wall Street, I rest my case. As a former rural Republican, I wholeheartedly believe Bernie stood a better shot at defeating Trump in 2016 than Hillary. (I voted Bernie in primaries and Hillary in general). In fact, we know there were many Trump supporters who preferred Bernie but not Hillary.
Economic recovery? What economy are you living in? Inflation is still running rampant and corporate profits are to blame, so yeah I guess that's a recovery. Gun safety is a joke, there hasn't been a week this year without a mass shooting, so if you want to give him credit for that go ahead. Not to mention death by cop, which is still a problem and the federal government hasn't even tried to tackle that one..
