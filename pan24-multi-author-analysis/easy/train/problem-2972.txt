The threat from this case clearly threatens the rights of our fellow citizens not to be discriminated against just for going to a business. While some people might be willing to accept the pain of members of the LGBTQ community, I am not. It is another chip into our freedoms as Americans, and if we don't do something to call out a cult member like Barrett for her active pattern of discrimination, there will be no one left standing when she subjects others to her "authority". This is part of what it means to learn from the past. Authoritarians like Barrett are seeking to implement a structure of control that is used within her cult, the People of Praise. If you only focus on one negative outcome at a time, you won't see the day coming when they raise their flags across the entire country.
Interesting. Thank you. I find unquestioning faith to anything a little terrifying. Too many horrible episodes in history lay at the feet of people who felt they had a moral mandate from on high.
Exactly. There is an existential threat. Call your senators and request that they ask the FBI to pursue charges of criminal conspiracy against the People of Praise!
Civil disobedience. Why play along with a system that gets to pick and choose which rules it follows?
