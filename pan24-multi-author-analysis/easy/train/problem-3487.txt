At 65, retire and get out of the way for younger blood. It's not perfect but it's the best I've got.
"There is academic research that supports the idea that term limits for MPs may have a positive effect in terms of avoiding concentrating power in the hands of a few professional politicians and fostering more accurate representation and increased responsiveness of the elected representatives toward the electorate. However, they also weaken the legislature’s power vis-à-vis the executive branch and diminish the legislature’s role, even when both branches are subject to similar limits. They also may increase the influence of party leaderships, as well as of lobby groups and legislative staff, thus contributing to a migration of power from elected representatives to nonelected officials, which risks impacting on voters’ ability to hold representatives accountable.".
People say they want term limits, but what they really want is a way to keep people from continuing to win elections despite the fact that they haven't spoken a coherent sentence in five years, or for someone with a terminal disease to win, just to drop dead during the middle of a political cycle and cause all sorts of chaos in their passing.
You are correct. They caveat that by saying, "they can increase responsiveness," and then come to conclude overall that the positive effect does not outweigh the negative effects, and recommend against term-limits on balance.
The corporate owned Democrats hate Porter. Trust and believe, they will support Feinstein over Porter.
