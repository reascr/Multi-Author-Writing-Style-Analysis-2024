He gets paid to do a job - it's his money for the work he does and can be spent (legally) however he wishes. If a fine takes a chunk of change out of that, it's actually sort of the other way around. He's paying for services that do work for the people.
Also w.r.t your example, maybe using the fundamentally flawed US prison system as an example of why legal gender changes should be ridiculously gatekept, baring in mind this law only made things slightly easier not free, from a massive amount of law abiding people (in another country) feels like an almost intentionally cherry picked counter example. Cause the US system already has a prison rape problem (even in the male-male prisons), on top of this limiting legal gender change, a fundamentally liberating and stress relieving process, owing one person who may or may not actually be trans, feels a lot like "guilty until proven innocent". Like imagine if everyones driving rights came under question everytime someone showed up in a court with a DUI.
