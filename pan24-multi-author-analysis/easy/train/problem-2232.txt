In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I dunno. Maybe I’m just sensitive and shit because I have a few friends in Ohio and Pennsylvania that are good people. It’s hard for me to accept them as collateral damage, just because their neighbors are c\nts.

Among the biggest relevant regulatory rollbacks Trump has conveniently remained mum over is the 2018 scrapping of a 2015 Obama-era rule requiring advanced braking technology on trains transporting particularly hazardous materials. That rule would have required compliance by certain trains by 2021 and others by 2023, but as Fortune reported at the time, Trump’s Department of Transportation decided that “the cost of installing these more sophisticated brakes outweigh[ed] the benefit.” While it has been noted that, technically, the rule would not have required the Norfolk Southern train that derailed in Ohio to have such brakes, some believe it would have if not for Trump. “He should be embarrassed,” Cynthia Quarterman, who helped craft the rule, said of Trump in an interview with Bloomberg. “Regulations force people to advance technology,” and if the train at the center of the derailment had had the advanced braking system, “there is no question the accident would have been less dramatic.” As Bloomberg notes, the Obama mandate, which was introduced along with a bunch of other new safety rules, would have forced trains to swap out what the then head of the Federal Railroad Administration likened to a “Civil War–era braking system.”.
