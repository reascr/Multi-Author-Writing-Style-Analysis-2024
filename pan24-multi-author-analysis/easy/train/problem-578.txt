I think so. If you havent' already, see wikipedia's entry for , specifically the part about Article 2. It spells out 5 acts, any of which constitute genocide. In my opinion, relevant is c, "Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;", which is satisfied by laws that would remove access to gender-affirming care given what we know about the relationship between receiving it and lower rates of depression and suicidality. Also relevant is e, "Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.", which is satisfied by attempts in Texas (maybe elsewhere) to treat affirming the gender of trans children as child abuse, which could separate them from their parents.
