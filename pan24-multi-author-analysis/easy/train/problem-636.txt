If there's justice in this world it will spark a war between the universities and the state of Florida as well. Imagine if the rest of the top universities like the UC schools, Ivy League, legacy private schools, all began to refuse to take Florida applicants on the grounds that they no longer viewed Floridians as sufficiently educated to qualify, or that they no longer recognize the validity of Florida school grades. What would that do to the economy of Florida in the immediate sense? Would you, as a business owner or investor, begin to think twice about putting money into a state where nobody local will have a top tier education unless they've chosen to move there after graduating? Would anyone with a top-tier education move to Florida anyways with all its regressive policies and diminishing prospects? My guess is a LOT of money would be pulled out of Florida pretty much immediately if those universities did that. Perhaps enough to make DeSantis sweat (more than he already does if that's even humanly possible).
