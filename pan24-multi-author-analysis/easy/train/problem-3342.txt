Elder millennial. I’ve been trying to leave the US since around 2005. I’ve had ZERO luck and I have a phd in biology and my other half is an RN. It’s extremely difficult. You basically have to have family there or a job that’s trying to bring you in.
Permissive? It took me twelve years after I made the decision to go for it, and I'm a white woman from a country that doesn't have any specific per annum limits.

I’m optimistic personally. The Celtic tiger years ended with a recession but did give us a raised standard of living and huge civil engineering projects like the motorways network and the tunnels under the Liffey, Shannon, and the Lee. Housing will be shite for a few years more but so long as we keep the pressure on it will work out, and when it comes to war, those don’t last forever either.
