Hi I appreciate y'all's input and academic expertise on the subject matter however I had a couple questions regarding credibility of such trials in the international community's eyes. Seeing how the United States and Russia are both not party to the international criminal court and the United States literally has a law that says if a US service number gets tried in such courts they will invade the Hague or they reserve the right to at least: so how will the credibility of such trials fair in the wake of the ukrainians being generally backed by a superpower that does not adhere to such guidelines itself in jurisdiction?
When will this war end? It is so sad and devastating. World is suffering. More the drag, weaker both these countries become. They both will be wasteland. No possibility of even restitution, as there will be nothing to provide restitution for.
