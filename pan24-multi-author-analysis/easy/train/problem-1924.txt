Well, I’m a female in the US and I have a spare room. If someone could get an Afghan refugee to me there would be free accommodation, free food, and paid work to do when they felt up to it. I would dearly love to get a woman out of there and to safety.
Well, aside from the fact this was always going to be a generational conflict if we wanted to actually change the country, a good start would have been building an Afghan military that wasn't entirely reliant on us for logistics, intelligence, procurement, maintenance, training, air support, CasEvac, you know. Literally every support function.
Was there in 2006, was real shitty. But, the people under the government and their tribal leaders were really astounding. That being said. There is poo everywhere, and it dries, then a helo lands or the wind picks up and you get poo-dirt in your mouth. Then you get the shits and sweat. Afghanistan is a hard place and letting it be only reminds the taliban that they can be dickheads, but reminders that rest of the world is capable of driving them back into the mountains weighs on their collective conscience (I understand that this is futile, but it’s their fragile “governments” reality).
