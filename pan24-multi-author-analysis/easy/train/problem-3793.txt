Re US, twice as much time is given to the Civil War than WW1 and WW2 combined. Not surprising about WW1 since the US was in it for less than 2 years, and having missed the monumentally asinine battles of the 1st 2 years when it seems no general from any European country had a fraction of a clue what machine guns could do, US casualties weren't all that horrible. Indeed, for the US, WW1 was a walk in the park compared to the still living memory of the Civil War. As for WW2, it usually comes so late in the school year that it's often handled in a single week: Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, US defeats the Japanese fleet at Midway, years of cutting off Japanese supply lines until we nuke Hiroshima and Nagasaki (2 days); Germany foolish enough to declare war on US, within a year Atlantic is a US lake aside from mopping up what remains of German U-Boats, wins in North Africa, Sicily, D-Day, blunting the German counterattack during the Battle of the Bulge, then on to Berlin to meet the Soviets (2 days); Yalta, Potsdam, Berlin Blockade, UN (1 day); done. In some places, e.g., Chicago, the invasion of Poland will get a fair amount of attention, but few other nations which didn't lose or wind up with permanent seats on the Security Council get much coverage.

Whatever. It'd be sufficient in a state like Virginia to give full coverage to Jim Crow laws, lynching and Loving v Virginia.
