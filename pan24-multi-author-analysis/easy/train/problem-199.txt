Sadly, you can't confront them about it. The response is, "I just want my property taxes to go to the local school. What's wrong with that?" And they'll dig in on not caring if the other schools cater to minorities or not... To them, it's the _locality_ that is the point. They'd be more than happy to have a black doctor or lawyer move around the corner. And, that is why they are not racist. Q.E.D.
If the police are spending millions on paramilitary equipment in their "war on drugs/gangs/citizens" then perhaps there would be less crime if some of those millions were spent to create opportunities rather than oppression. Noone believes that a society should be without some sort of police force, "defund the police" was never about abolition and the right-wing propaganda networks knew it when they misrepresented it as such.
Yep. Across the map, Paradise Valley/Scottsdale is noticeable. Lincoln, Shea, Greenway Parkway, McDonald, and Frank Lloyd Wright come to mind. Although FLW makes a bit of sense, as it leaves the grid after Scottsdale Rd.
