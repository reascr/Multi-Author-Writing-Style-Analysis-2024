Let me get this straight. A WNBA player goes to Russia with HashOil in a vape pen. An illegal substance. Gets convicted for violating the law and then some assclown in the state department says yeah trading a man who puts our citizens, aircraft, and military at risk is a great trade to get her out of prison. Who negotiated this? This is the problem with our country, we are more worried about the way this looks, then safety and security for all. What a bunch of crap. How many people will now die because of this exchange?
That would mean he'd still be on the hook even with this order then if I'm understanding correctly, which I think is what the other poster was saying, the federal government is unlikely to leave something at just possession of Marijuana if they're taking the case on regardless of the actual circumstances of the situation.
How? Russia needs its weapons, his contacts are at least 14 years old, and his photo is know and travel will be restricted? He cant do anything special at this point, a burned out asset.
Exactly! This guy has been in US custody for too long to be considered completely safe. I guess I just can't imagine there isn't an arm's dealer in the war Russia hasn't contacted.
