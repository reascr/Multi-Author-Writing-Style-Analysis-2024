It would also seem fairly straightforward to find it using a Geiger counter device, given how radioactive the thing is. Sure, 1400 km is a long stretch but this thing should stand out pretty starkly against the low level of background radiation. It is pretty ridiculous how the article downplays basic incompetence and obvious corner-cutting.
Wait a minute. It was loose inside a big wooden box? Something hit the box, a bolt fell out & this thing followed through that hole. Out into the cargovan containing the box & then managed to find a way out of the cargovan? WhoÂ´s the contractor connected to? No company name is out yet?
Post-9/11, the US government did a lot of research and technology development to detect radiation sources (example: I would think we would have shared some of this tech with close allies like Australia and might be useful in cases like this.
Ya i didn't read the artile. So rail makes it that much better. And the linking was mainly so it would just feed into a coputer and the big brains could look at the data a possibly see something that the individual people would miss if yhey were only looking at there own Geigercounter.
