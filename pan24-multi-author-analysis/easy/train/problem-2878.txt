this is probably too nuanced for a lot of you, so here come the downvotes, especially in this subreddit...... doesn't it set the drag and/or trans community (two different communities, i understand) back when a story of someone displaying hypocrisy with regards to one of those communities is used as a "gotcha" against that hypocrite?? it feels like it reinforces the stereotype from people who think it's "bad" or "immoral" or whatever they say that this is something that people should be ridiculed for, instead of celebrated or at the very least accepted... by pointing this out to the public, there will now be people who become more likely to call for his ouster than there would have been before they knew he had participated in a drag show, so this ultimately confirms their beliefs that "drag = bad," no? like, if the "other side" is bringing this up about his past, it must really be bad, you know? that's what i imagine a diehard MAGA person to be thinking when they see this.
