I’m an old woman. If the ladies room is busy, I don’t hesitate to use the men’s room. Sooo, then what? Going to sue me? Arrest me?
Now I’m not republican or democrat but the research I’ve done shows republicans want freedom (guns, property, ect) and little to no government control, where Dems what more government involvement and control (such as healthcare ect) so I think the freedom part would be leaning more republican and republican also focus more on creating jobs then Dems who normalize Medicaid and gov assistance. Just what I’ve noticed. I always get confused when democrats start spouting republican views and vice versa like do you not know your own direction? Or at least don’t label yourself a full dem or rep if you’re not going be able to get fact right one way or the other. It’s weird seeing people say mean things about a group who’s views their backing unknowingly. Do your research Join the libertarians.
