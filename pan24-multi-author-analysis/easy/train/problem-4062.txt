The Soviets repeatedly reached out to make alliances with other Western nations (especially France and UK) in attempted coalition against Nazi Germany. The failure of the West to reciprocate is the primary cause of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
Despite this betrayal of USSR relations by the West, however, the Soviets still sought out alliance with the West against Germany before signing the Moltov-Ribbentop Pact, but were rejected. National polls of Britain in June 1939 showed that 84% of the British favored an Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance against Germany. Western governments, however — particularly the right wing in the UK, who favored Hitler (e.g., Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry) — were not interested. In summer 1939, British, French and Soviet representatives gathered in Moscow to decide on political terms for an alliance. The Soviet leadership took the talks seriously, in contrast to the Western allies: Talks fell apart after Britain and France only sent minor military officials (Admiral Reginald Drax and General Aimé Doumenc), who weren’t even authorized to make decisions.
Oh yes of course. Letting soldiers that would later invade them train inside their lands. Or co invading the only defense to the the biggest threat they would ever know was one horrific mistake after another. Hindsight definitely turned out to be 20/20 for the Soviets. They honestly should have seen it coming.
