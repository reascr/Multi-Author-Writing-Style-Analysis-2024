It’s wild how many Americans still think the Contras were “freedom fighters” when the stuff they did is almost unspeakable. Murder, torture, rape, massacres. They targeted peasants, women, children, infants, nuns. That’s not even getting into the drug dealing. Not gonna say the Sandinistas were/are perfect but fuck… I am glad the Contras lost. Every one of them deserved what they got.
Depends on whether it's the book or not (unlike the film, the book has Rambo as a psychopath who murders possibly dozens of people just doing their jobs, Teasle - I don't remember him as any kind of bigot - originally moved him out of town because he correctly picked Rambo was trouble - I don't remember in the book that a friend lived there - it was the town where Rambo finally snapped and came back after being moved on unlike the previous towns - and Trautman had to be brought him in to put him down like a rabid dog after Rambo basically burned it down and killed numerous police officers - pre novel retcon, his last words about Rambo to a mortally wounded Teasle was something like "and that's why I blew his head off with this shotgun.").
