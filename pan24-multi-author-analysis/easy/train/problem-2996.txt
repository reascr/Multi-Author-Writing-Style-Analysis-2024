I'm not saying there aren't supporters still. But I'm doubting that each and everyone still sends coin that used to. And that automated cash withdrawal was a dirty ass trick by a conman. It was specifically implemented to take advantage of people who don't pay full attention to the bank/credit statements. They expect there supporters at best to catch it immediately, which guarantees at least another $50 from that month. What about the others who don't catch it immediately. They get drained for a good bit, all for what they thought were good intentions. Fuck Donald Trump.
Here in Alberta Canada it worked once, and a more liberal party replaced generations of conservative power for a term after the conservatives split because everyone assumed the trough was already in their hands. Even after reuniting our conservatives had damaged their brand and acquired so many Trump wannabes that they almost lost the next election, and it's degenerated to the point where they will probably lose the next one to. An interesting case study for American liberals to study I think, because there's a lot of US money backing our conservative politicians, provincially and federally. Our federal conservatives have tried to run closeted Americans for PM. Not hyperbole.
