You are not wrong. This mode of communication doesn't allow for much flexibility for arguments, or nuance, and leans towards absolutes, which are incomplete.
I lived in Asia for quite a few years. On the “expat scene” there were the inevitable Russian businessmen in and out of the social circles. I’m pretty forgiving all races/creeds but these guys just didn’t fit in ahd never even tried. All were bigots. All refused even to be at a table with anyone gay or black. One guy even told me he wouldn’t ever eat a banana unless with a knife and fork because it was just too gay to do so. None that I came into contact with had any world view and as far as they were each concerned they were the top dogs and were willing to show how tough/clever/powerful they were by fighting it out. Every single time we had a Russian in the house where there was alcohol, there would be a fight. Grown men smacking their way through social gatherings in a foreign country where wither were guests. Absolute bog-dwellers every single one of them. Yea, even their rich and famous. They deserve themselves and their ignorance. Just saying.
depressingly, with their invasion of Ukriane, and this whole "in too deep, no turning back now" mentality that all sides have taken, the "best" case scenario for an end to the war is Russia , a country of some 140 million people devouring itself in a civil war after Putin and his first few successors either resign, lose control, or get shot, and hoping that a progressive and diplomatic faction comes out on top.
