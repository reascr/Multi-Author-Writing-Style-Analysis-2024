However, and this is a BIG asterisk, to this day Georgia's runoff election is designed to suppress the vote. It's a runoff because they expect black voters to be less likely to vote a second time in a single race. They intentionally restricted voting days and the timeline for this election, knowing it would result in crazy multiple hour waiting times to vote mostly in high population areas where there are more Democrats and more black voters.
Very well said as well. Especially this election since they moved it back a month and right after a holiday hoping they could make it harder to vote.
Exactly. Runoffs in the south were set up because elections didn't reflect the preferences of the majority of voters. Yes, that majority of voters were racists, and in many cases were only a majority because of Jim Crow policies designed to stop black people from voting. That second not is what needs fixing here. Working decoration elections aren't the problem.
Look this is true. Black candidates would get a plurality while the white vote was split. And yes itâ€™s messed up to limit the power of black voters.
