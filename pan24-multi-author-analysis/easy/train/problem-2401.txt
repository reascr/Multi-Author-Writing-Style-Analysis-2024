Seriously, people who write these article simultaneously want zero military spending, zero weapons contractors, and the United States be able to do what it did for Ukraine.
Sour grapes. Normally when there's a problem needing solved, whether that be someone delivering food to my lazy ass, or maybe getting goddamn Russia out of Ukraine, it tends to happen a helluva lot faster when someone can make a profit doing it. Funny how that works.
And itâ€™s the privately owned defense contractors that are profiting the US military is taking on massive losses and investments (personnel, hardware, vehicles, you name it) just to transport all the shit and set up for defense if this war spills into another country.
