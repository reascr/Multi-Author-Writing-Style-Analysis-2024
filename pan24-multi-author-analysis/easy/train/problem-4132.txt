I’m Georgi Kantchev, a WSJ reporter based in Berlin. I started reporting for the Journal in 2014 in London, covering energy and financial markets. After that, I was stationed in Moscow where I wrote about Russia and the conflict in Ukraine.
ALSO corporations only benefit from said military’s terroristic actions. And govt policy is dictated by the govt officials prior to exiting those roles and entering said corporations. It’s not rocket science.
Your assumption that corporations would be willing to engage in international terrorism of the highest stakes (existentially risking their existence upon being discovered) in the North Sea, surrounded by European markets (as opposed to the jungles of Angola, the DRC, Myanmar, Brazil, and other "off-the-grid" locales) is... questionable. I am confident you do not have the decision-making capacity or risk-assessment skills of an average Western CEO.
Investigators haven’t yet identified who’s responsible. That said, some European politicians have pointed the finger at Russia - which denies any responsibility. What both sides have coalesced around is the idea that the blasts weren’t accidents but sabotage. Swedish authorities, for instance, have said that they had found traces of explosives on several foreign objects nearby. But experts say that such investigations take a long time because the evidence is underwater and because whoever did this would have been covering their tracks. It’s a real energy and geopolitical whodunit and it might be a while before we know for sure.
