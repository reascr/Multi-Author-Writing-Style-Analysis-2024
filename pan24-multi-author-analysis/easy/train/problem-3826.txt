Was reading an article on WaPo this morning about the current speaker election and I swear one of the first comments was something like "it appears to me that the Democrats could end this now by backing McCarthy." Like, the reps are currently turning the house into a complete clownshow and your first thought is "why don't the dems fix this??".
I'd love to get to a point that we can start tackling actual reform within parties to lessen the influence of wealthy people and corporations, but in case you haven't noticed, one side is trying to literally strip anyone who isn't a straight, white, heterosexual, cisgender man of their autonomy, their protections, their rights and their freedoms. Democrats aren't perfect, but they are the ones trying to protect those freedoms AND the ones trying to make what incremental progress they can while simultaneously staving off growing fascist aspirations across the aisle within a system that gives that foul minority an outrageously inflated influence over our government.
