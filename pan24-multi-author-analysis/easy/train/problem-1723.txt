My guess: Lithuania not happy that more level-headed EU nations were not going along with their proposed general Visa ban for Russians (because they actually read that whole "Declaration of Fundamental Rights" they all signed, and collective punishment being a big no-no in there), tries now to shut down western consulates in Russia with this workaround. No consulate, no visa application.
Have you looked at Russians history In the Baltic’s… they have good reason to hate Russia… and if Russia wins or gets away with this, Ukraine is very high up on their target list(based on the same intelligence agencies that earned us of the invasion, Russia was originally planning on invading the baltics first before Maiden happened)… for them this is a literal matter of life and death, so yeah they are going to take a very hard line, and they aren’t going to take kindly to countries that Stand neutral or on the side of a country that is an active threat against it.
Heh. Funnies. Russia can’t wage a war on one other country and win. Embarrassingly enough, the only country it can defeat in a war is itself.
