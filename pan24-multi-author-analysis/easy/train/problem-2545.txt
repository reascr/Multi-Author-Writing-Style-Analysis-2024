But non-pornographic deepfakes are okay? So some board of censors are going to have to watch videos and have discussions, like, "Hmmm... she is wearing a bikini. Let's see if she removes it... no. Nope, it's still on." -"But it is rather revealing." "Yes. Yes, I take your point. Let's continue watching." First Amendment standards are more sensible, methinks.
additionally, what about fanfiction? someone could write a long winded, vivid love letter about a celebrity, and that can paint a picture in your head as well as a deepfake. should that be illegal?
This is an interesting one as technology develops, and people essentially easily create their own fantasies and don’t post them publicly, like I wonder how many people get Facebook pictures of their gym crush and create deepfakes from it and nobody ever knows? And if their hardrive full of deepfakes was suddenly discovered, is that a lesser penalty than if you had distributed it?
Interesting. What about fanart? I know a lot of authors are not into their real or imaginary characters going through the same thing, it’s just another medium.
