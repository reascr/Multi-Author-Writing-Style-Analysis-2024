That is simply not true. The famous analysis of the effectiveness of Patriots in the Gulf War was faulty. First, it used direct strikes only, which is not how ground to air missiles work, they explode near the target to damage or destroy it with shrapnel. Second, the study only counted destroyed missiles, not missiles that were downed or missed their target due to being damaged. And add into that the Patriot had a software bug, a floating error, and needed to be reset every 24 hours. This was easily solved with a software update after the Gulf War. But the false info persists to this day.
Fantastic! And instead of constellations, the stars will spell brand names and other advertising. And when something breaks, there'll be the blue sky of death.
Absolutely untrue. Canada and Denmark just resolved a border issue recently. Additionally, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Romania, Estonia, all had border disputes before acceding to NATO (and sometimes, these stand to this day).
Croatia (acceded to NATO in 2009) has border disputes with Montenegro (acceded to NATO in 2017), Serbia (non-NATO), Slovenia (acceded to NATO in 2004), and Bosnia and Herzegovina (NATO Membership Action Plan since 2010).
