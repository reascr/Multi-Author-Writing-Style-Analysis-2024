Guys. Think donors and long game. Disney has opposed casinos throughout their existence. I’m willing to bet that Desantis is quietly cozy with gambling interests. In 5-10 years we’ll be beach Las Vegas.
Taxation without representation! It will be interesting to see what Disney does. Not sure I see how a district can have full taxation authority without those taxed having any say in the process. Plus, of course, if Disney wants to challenge it, DeSantis has been very public that this action was taken in punishment for speech protected under the 1st Amendment (as the course have ruled and the Republic support the idea that corporations are people when it comes to speech.).
