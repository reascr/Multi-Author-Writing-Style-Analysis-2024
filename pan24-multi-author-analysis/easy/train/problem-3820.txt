Batshit Republicans had the country running in a positive flourishing manner. Can’t have that. Let’s keep inflation at all time highs, let’s beg our enemies for oil instead of being energy independent, let’s let the border remain open so the flow of fentanyl, human trafficking, child abuse child trafficking, can keep flowing with the cartels in control, and terrorists from other countries running free, let’s keep crime and murder in the inner cities at all time high levels, let’s keep letting China be profitable, while removing all manufacturing out of America, let’s keep withdrawing troops from war torn areas and leave citizens behind as well as terrorists in charge of the country with death to Americans, let’s not be able to by food any more, or gas, and for sure let’s keep promoting EV so when the battery gives out we can run to the nearest charging center for a bucket of electricity, let’s keep touting climate change as a problem as if the climate has never changed before. The list is endless. Let’s not make America great again. Which should be the motto of the Left.
