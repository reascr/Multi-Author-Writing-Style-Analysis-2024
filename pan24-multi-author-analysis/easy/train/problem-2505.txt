She needed to have some consequences and may be incapable of learning anything. It is unfortunate that media sources fan the flames of this sort of delusional behavior on a daily basis. I still see people who should know better babbling about how there is a double standard in the media and that somehow overrides the law. Really? And how is President Anthony Weiner? Oh, wait, he got dumped and cancelled because Democrats have actual standards of behavior. Also, the last time I checked the courts are chock full of hard right Republican judges and prosecutors. Look, nobody should get a break on corruption, but either you have to argue that all the Republican oriented prosecutors and judges are corrupt liberals or got bribed by the thousands or you have to admit that maybe Biden and Clinton have managed to avoid doing serious intentional crimes worthy of prosecution. Also, last time I checked it turns out that the Republicans cheered at rule changes allowing media outlets to be biased without consequences and would virtually all fight to the death to avoid having a return to any media rules or any campaign finance restrictions whatsoever. Results are results and Republicans need to stop excusing bad behavior unless they want only nuts like Trump and MTG on their side using them like they are simpletons. Being pro-corruption and pro-fascist is for losers and American needs Republicans to at least try to police their own side and be winners. McCain and Romney were at least competent leaders and good men. More of that and less of the psychopaths, kk thx.
