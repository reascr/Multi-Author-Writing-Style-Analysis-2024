Public access for people not for the cattle to graze and cattlemen to use like it’s theirs. Hell I want to grow “corn” on public land …. Same thing. Graze my cows, raise my crops.
This asshat was the source of rampant corruption at the Department of the Interior when he was its Secretary under The Great Orange One, but, because Dear Leader was a master in blatantly breaking the law in broad daylight, Zinke flew under the radar. He was pretty much at the center of the largest corruption scandal in the DoI's history since Tea Pot Dome (you know, the one that likely would have ended the Harding administration had Harding not had to good fortune to die in office, which was also the largest political scandal in American history prior to Watergate?), and because he's a Republican that means he got a promotion and is now in the fucking House.
Mexicans? Those were the actual cowboys… I mean clearly the GOP thinks that they are bad. Or does he mean the Hollywood dudes? Because I thought the GOP hates those too?… Does he mean the Brokeback mountain Cowboys because last time I checked the Republicans weren’t fans of theirs either. Seems to me that the Republicans want to wipe out the American cowboys.
