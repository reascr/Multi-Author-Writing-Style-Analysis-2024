Yep. Trump is the golden calf for the media. Any downturn in revenue that the media has suffered they’ll gain back by making things a horse race. Besides that, Trump does have an edge over any opponent. He can say or do anything to an opponent and his followers(and the media) will love it. You can’t say that abt his opponents though. They have to treat Trump with kid gloves because they are trying to win over his voters. Oh, a few opponents will come out swinging (probably paid to do so) but I dk if it’ll matter to Trump’s cult following. The money will be on DeSantis but we’ll see what the polls will look like after Trump starts calling him names.
