The House Jan 6 Committee meets today at 1pm ET for it's final public session. Committee members will present closing arguments on their investigation into the Capitol attack, formally adopt their final report, and vote on both civil and criminal referrals in connect to Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election.
Wow. Democracy remains as the Law of the Land. We as a Country needed to see that Trump and his ilk have no business having any kind of power whatsoever. Today, for the first time in years, I am proud to be an American.
Trump himself is expected to face criminal referrals, reportedly for conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, and insurrection. Referrals are also expected for other Trump allies, including Republican lawmakers who refused to comply with Congressional subpoenas. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson has suggested referrals for ethics violations, legal misconduct and campaign finance violations may also be issued. However, the Committee's referrals are non-binding and it will be up to federal prosecutors to bring charges.
