I support term limits, but that has it's own share of issues that come bundled with it. It might make it even easier to buy off a an elected official if they know they're only there for 8 or 12 years, rather than no term limits and requiring 8 years to build up enough political acumen to even be taken serious by the party, nevertheless the money backing the party. It would also mean that with a revolving door, party policies themselves become more fickle, less set in stone as constant new candidates support or oppose this platform policy or that one, which can lead to even less getting done even when a party has a trifecta. It could also lead to more Manchins and Sinema style stonewallers when margins of control are slimmer. Diversity of candidates through term limits can also simply mean more division. Lastly, not many officials really accomplish a whole lot during their first term who aren't coming up from some other elected post. The job is complicated to learn and it takes time to establish the inner party networking to be effective. Term limits may exacerbate that situation.
Exactly. They're not dumb. Trump will have his day before Desantis, and if they get him to win in 2024 then they'll be free to have Desantis in 2028. They're excellent at the long game.
