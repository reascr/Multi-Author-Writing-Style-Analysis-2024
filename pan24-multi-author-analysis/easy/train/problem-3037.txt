Utterly bizarre how many people are 'shocked' at the idea that a major conventional war would last longer than a year, and there was no clear winner by 10 months in well golly we better just throw in the towl.
Absolutely not. Not even close. There are still so many things that shouldve been delivered months ago in the air because of stupid hesitant politicians.
Magical? Do you know the first thing about what happened after the fall of the USSR? It didn't magically appear. The break up of the USSR was a catastrophic event. I'm not suggesting corruption didn't exist in the USSR. It did of course. But the levels we are talking about is other world. It completely upended any and all order. No one knew what was going on and everyone was trying to capitalize on the chaos. Most every state, including Russia, was in complete and utter chaos and the worst of the worst took advantage and seized everything of value. It was the beginning of the corruption because there was no one to hold anyone accountable. And then Putin further pushed that by using it as a weapon. If he knew everyone was corrupt, he had leverage over all of them. There have been sporadic people "caught" for a reason. Everyone knows if they step out of line, they'll be "caught" next.
Also nuclear bombing isn't comparable. If that happened today it would just trigger an intervention.
