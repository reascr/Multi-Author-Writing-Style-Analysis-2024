It seems like an odd situation where we'd all be better off just letting the government use this law in this manner. The guy in the article was clearly taking real bribes with clear influence over how the government worked. But, if the law was written badly enough to not actually cover that, should the Justices not rule against it being used like this? They have to rule based on the actual law. I'm guessing the Conservatives, given an opportunity to pump even more money into politics, aren't twisting themselves in knots over this conundrum. But it looks like the liberals are because the "right" answer here might be that this count of bribery isn't supported by this particular law.
I don't think there's any indication that the judges want politician or government employees to simply switch titles, take bribes, and then switch back again. It sounds like the problem is the actual law being used in this case doesn't actually say that is illegal. This just sounds like Congress needs to pass a new law with clear definitions of when a situation like that is illegal. This isn't the kind of constitutional decision that stops them from doing that. The article has a 3-point test that might work and the government used, but it wasn't actually in the law.
Exactly. That's the core purpose of the John Roberts led SC. Eviscerate any laws that keep the ultra-rich from controlling our politics and our politicians.
