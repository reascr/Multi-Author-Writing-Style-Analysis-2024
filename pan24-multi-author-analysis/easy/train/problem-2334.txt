I've seen it too. Tech workers are mostly brahmans. Some lower classes snuck in because the government has affirmative action in India. Oh boy, it's rough. I've also seen them mistreat indian taxi drivers, etc. They know the caste,.for me.thwy all look the same. But yes it's a thing.
As a business owner, decide how I want my business laid out, decide who I want to serve or not/what projects I will do for them or not, decide how I want my employees to dress or wear their hair, decide if I'd like my employees to speak English the whole time they're on the clock, and a million other things that you should be able to do as a private business owner.
Absolutely. I’ve clowned these idiot owners in front of all their techs cos they’ve never spent a day in the field. Motherfucker wanted me and 2 other guys to rope a compressor up a 4 story roof cos he was too cheap to get a crane.
