Seriously? He was the first person to think transwomen in women safe spaces could be a threat to women? That seems unlikely, but I have no idea. My wife doesn't even ride in ubers anymore because of the harassment and threats she has gotten from men. I can sympathize with the fear some women may have with the idea of places that they actually feel safe having a change like this might be threatening. Maybe he was vocal about it? But I highly doubt he started it. It seems like a very rational fear, given what women have been through and have to put up with. It isn't fair to transwomen, and I think society will eventually be accepting of the idea, but I don't think every woman who is worried right now is a fascist or nazi lol.
