Yep. I’m more “Christlike” than any Christian I know. I’m kind, I’m charitable, Im empathetic, I live simply and humbly and try to put others ahead of myself in most situations and help out when I can. Most of all, I do this because it’s right, not because I’m trying to get into heaven or whatever. I don’t expect a reward for being a decent human and I think that’s the real difference between me and a Christian.

I'm not sure what else you expect. We'd rather be, marching with the poor, organizing food and medical care for the homeless, or registering people to vote than be standing in front of some fundy church trying to scream louder than they do. That's just not what we do.
