lol at the idea of us lowering defense budget or using saves for domestic spending, while i agree that is what should happen, it won't, military is pushing for trillion dollar budget as it needs 6th gen fighters, sidekicks, a mass of ships to arms race with china, plus Abrams x and drone vehicles and planes.
You ok bro? As a "pro Ukraine Republican", proud to be American, and stand up/humble citizen, none of this overgeneralized and uneducated stupidity applies to me. Over generalizing is dangerous. If you were to meet me, or anyone like me for that matter, chances are we would be friends and have interesting philosophical conversations even if our views differed. Your mindset is part of the problem, republican is not a one size fits all description. In all actuality, I hate the two party system and am probably more independent with a few more views leaning Republican. Either way, I am sure I will get roasted on reddit for this comment but that is the beauty of freedom and i do not hate you because you may or may not be associated with a different political party.
