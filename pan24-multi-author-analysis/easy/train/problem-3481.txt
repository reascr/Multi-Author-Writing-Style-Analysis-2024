There are intersex people who have had to be really confused why they had a masculinizing puberty when they have a vagina (because they had internal testes or a mix), or a feminizing puberty when they have a penis (because they had internal ovaries or a mix), and their parents never told them they originally had ambiguous genitals and didn't let them get to make that choice when they were older.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. And like every other gender-affirming care ban it also carves out an exception for genital surgery on intersex infants with ambiguous genitals. Those parents get to pick whether they want the child to have a penis or a vagina (and basing their gender on that choice) instead of letting that child choose later as an adult. Roughly half the time, the parents get it wrong.
