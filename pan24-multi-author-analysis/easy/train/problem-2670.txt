My point is more semantic, that Jesus (as a specific person) does not factor into the Jewish belief system, since the Christian perspective of his Divinity/his identity as the messiah is fundamentally incompatible with the Jewish perspective of what the messiah actually is.
2. Then you have your Enabler Parents Republicans. Good examples of those are Mitch McConnel, Mitt Romney, and others who know how to act like adults, and at least pretend to be cordial. They are somewhat reasonable people by themselves, but they are Enabler Parents because they always vote in lock-step for whatever the dominant crazy ones want to do since Trump (occasionally before Trump maybe, but never as prominent before). To be clear here, I'm only saying they act a certain way, they are just as evil, but prefer to appear professional and agreeable. These types have been beaten into submission by the Toddlers post-Trump, and is not a good thing since no one with half a brain is at the controls anymore and just lets their 8 year old drive the car.
