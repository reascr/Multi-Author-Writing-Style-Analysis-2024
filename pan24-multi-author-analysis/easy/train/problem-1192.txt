Increasing the price of a safety feature like tires would DEFINITELY result in people who can't afford tires waiting much longer to replace them, we're talking about paying the equivalent of 3-7 years of gas tax all at once on a tire with a 30-70K mile lifetime. They already do that because of how much a set of tires cost. Average yearly gas tax paid in TX is about $40/yr per car, with an average driving of 15K miles per year on a 60K mile warranty tire, we're increasing the cost of a $100 tire to $140 base, 40% more expensive.
The recent proposals in Texas have been a flat tax for alternative fuel that's WAY over the average gas tax paid by fossil fuel vehicles (something like $200/yr, when the average gas tax paid per vehicle per year is something like $40), billing by mileage would be much more fair.
you need a weight based measure. since weight causes most of the damage. just do miles driven X weight. done. if people don't want to give their mileage. fine, then pay a "maximum" of say 30,000 miles.
