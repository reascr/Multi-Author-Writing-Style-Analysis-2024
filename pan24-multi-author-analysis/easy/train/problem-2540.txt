“Socialism always fails” is the default, pre-programmed response pretty much any American is triggered to say upon hearing the word socialism without having and definition for failure or success. Take for instance how Capitalism is responsible for between 1.1 and 3 trillion deaths since the British Empire but no one seems to care. Or how market economies and the profit motive have destroyed our ecosystems beyond repair and have wiped out over 50% of pre-industrial biodiversity, a mass extermination on a multi-species scale that’s only ever happened 5 times in the history of the earth. Or take for instance how we have more slaves today than ever in history. How do you define success? Lifting people out of poverty? Over the past 40 years, 900 Million people have been lifted out of poverty, but 800 million of which were Chinese. So does that count as a success for planned economies over capitalist economies??? Do you take into account metrics like life expectancy, literacy rate, malnutrition, post secondary education, unemployment numbers, average calories eaten per day, and rate of homelessness? Because for that metric, socialist countries outperform 9 out of 10 capitalist counterparts at equal levels of development in all those areas.
How long ago was that? While some of my teacher friends can go on vacations, usually it's with a SO who has more money, friends to split costs or hostels. Don't assume vacation means financially okay.
Under Tito they liberated themselves from the Nazi’s, created a successful multi-ethnic state in the Balkans, fed, housed, and educated almost the entire Yugoslav population, maintained good relations with East and West, had one of the most powerful armies in Europe, and had many impressive feats of athleticism, scientific achievement, and engineering prowess.
