I know Warren is excited, but let's not copy MAGA by worshiping Dear Leader and giving him credit for our works. This victory is mostly because of women, especially young women, 45 and younger voters, Progressives (for starting to really turn out more reliably), and minority voters. If it had been left up to white voters 46 and older this truly would have been a red wave or even a red tsunami. The polls were so off because they didn't take minority and young turnout into their calculations nearly as much as they should have.
Really? We needed republicans - we needed to get Trump’s base - do you know how hard is to defeat an incumbent? I have a lot of friends that only voted for Biden because in their minds, they aren’t as much as a “socialist” as Bernie, Nancy or AOC. And they hate Hilary and Kamala. I really think you guys are missing the climate during 2020. Trump hadn’t gone all Jan 6th on us yet. It was a close race and Biden won by catering to Republicans - I don’t agree with you at all. But it’s fine to disagree.
