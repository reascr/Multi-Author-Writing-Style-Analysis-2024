Absolutely. It's pretty much how every nation _should_ behave. I don't think there is anything bad about it, it's just rational. Not criticizing that.
The way that you started this sentence talking about the maintenance of the Abrams and a showdown at the Republican held House gave me an amusing mental image of lawmakers having to ride tanks around on the lawn and organize themselves like they would in the capital with some getting stuck in traffic and making 100-point turns and backing up with beeping noises as they try to maneuver around assorted tanks and doing that always thing where you an someone in a small hallway almost walk into each other and your start mirroring each others movements and occasionally sticking their heads out of turrets to make statements and vote prettily firing on each other to try make it impossible to hear what their opponent are saying. Thank you for that.
Interesting. Somebody took and posted a video of a load of tanks on a train passing through here in downtown Denver this morning. Wonder if this is related, because that is not a normal occurrence here.
