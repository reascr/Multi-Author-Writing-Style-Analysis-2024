Pedantic: science is based on EVIDENCE, but new evidence can overturn old evidence. Science only demands CONSISTENCY, that is, theoretical models must be consistent with ALL evidence. And for the physicists here, science must also accommodate UNCERTAINTY. Which leads to a question for our philosophers here: is TRUTH consistent with UNCERTAINTY? Or for those who dabble in modal logic, what's the relationship between the necessarily possible and reality? [OK, that requires defining reality. Good luck.].
Science requires consensus. It's not accurate to claim that theoretical models must be consistent with all evidence. They must simply be consistent with logic. Theoretical models aim to explain evidence using logic. They hold until sufficient anomalous evidence breaks consensus. At that point new models must be sought. Thomas Kuhn describes the scientific process as periods of progress or 'paradigms' within which models are developed through the confirmational evidence of experiment, punctuated by revolutionary moments of characterized by extraordinary research and experimentation leading to the proposal of new models, which once acknowledged by consensus, form the new paradigm.
I even blame the Democrats too. They wonâ€™t do popular things and call out corporate greed because their hands are all in the cookie jar. They are just as corrupt as the GOP but without the murderous dreams of a Christian theocracy. The best defense against authoritarianism is economic opportunity and mobility.
