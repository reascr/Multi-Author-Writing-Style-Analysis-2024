It might be too late to do anything. We are in the midst of a self made extinction event that is massive and threatens our very existence. There is no way we continue long-term as we are now,.life as we know it likely will not exist in 30 years. The worst part is we have probably passed the point of no return and can't stop or slow it. Buckle up, it's going to be bad very soon.
That's partially disproved by modern archaeology. The vikings hunted and ate seal from the get-go. Livestock was certainly a priority, but was a matter of food security and prestige. Bone analysis now show that the vikings started out with some marine diet and increased it further as time went along - from 30-40% to 80%. The archaeological evidence shows how they organized hunts of harp seal by boat and then sold/distributed the meat to all settlements, including those inland. They also hunted walrus. It's not believed that walrus ivory could be what drove people to settle on Greenland. Walrus had previously been hunted to extinction on Iceland. Walrus ivory can be found in almost every viking settlement in Greenland.
