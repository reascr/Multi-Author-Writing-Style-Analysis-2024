I don't have a problem with your argument when it's phrased this way because it's intellectually honest. I only have a problem with the comparison to "PPP loan forgiveness" because it implies that the government is forgiving one loan while not forgiving another. You might think that's splitting hairs but the former is a sound argument while the latter is intellectuall dishonest because the PPP program is not an instance of the government offering a loan and then later deciding to forgive it, it's an instance of the government offering free money using the legal structure of a loan for functional purposes even though it's guaranteed to be forgiven upon initiation.
This is some Ayn Rand stuff. (Atlas Shrugged) Which is a hilarious take on the ‘genius’ and beauty of the wealthy and anyone not on board with that is a weasel, yes plus they have greasy hair. Anywho, the immigrant from USSR went on Social Security when she needed it. But before that, recipients were moochers in her opinion. Some say she was also in government housing, but not sure if that’s true. Bee-och! And people are still lapping up her ideology.
