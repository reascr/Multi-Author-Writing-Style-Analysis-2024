Things did happen in their lives. I have first hand experience and i know many like me. My parents were raised on "conservative christian values" by alcoholic, abusive, racist parents. ANYBODY who is not conservative, white, and religious are bad. I have no contact with them because i was also raised that way and do NOT agree with them at all. My brother did turn out that way. He is horribly racist and believes that everyone else is wrong and deserves to die. He has said as much to me, his gay sister. I am chosing to keep away from this toxic family dynamic. This is the type of trauma that carries on through many families. I would suspect that most of those who continue to vote for those idiotic monsters despite the fact that they are voting against their own interests, have some type of similar traumas in their lives. I would like to point out that for my family the christianity bit is just something to use to justify their behavior. I went to church with friends during my childhood. My parents, the "christians" did not attend. I know many of those types of religious folks. Has definitely led me to understand how dangerous religion can be. That's just my experience growing up in the South or "bible belt" as it is so wonderfully known. (sarcasm font needed).
