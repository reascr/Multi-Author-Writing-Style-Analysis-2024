Sure let’s just throw out the constitution and all the bill of rights starting with 2a..holy shit Batman that’s a genius idea So from now on let’s hope you are the first beneficiary of this wonderful idea since you proposed it So now free speech (1st amendment) is gone you have no right to say whatever you want and now you can be arrested for what you say especially if you speak out against your government. Now the FBI kicks in your door and arrests you for no reason at all and doesn’t have to provide a warrant and can search your house since the 4th amendment is gone(no searches and seizures and requires a warrant). Then since you are arrested you get no right to a lawyer and due process and a fair trial by a jury of your peers(the 6th amendment)..so then they can just lock you up and throw away the key as you rot in jail essentially legal kidnapping or simply kill you..good luck.
Seriously? Where's the work ethic these days? It's like no one wants to work anymore. If you want to do the crime, you're gonna need to put in the time.
