Well, MAGA is indeed preparing - 2 now former friends (because they went full-auto MAGA and fell into that Q-Hole; they were both Dems until 2016) of mine (they're both middle-aged women) have been amassing an arsenal of various guns, ammo, and other weapons along with survival food and water, and gold and silver bullion. The last time I heard from them (around 2 months ago - they keep calling me and coming over because they're trying to 'save me from Biden and Hillary and "Hussein Obama" and 5G and nanobots and eating babies) they said they're ready for war as soon as Trump gives them the word.
Illogical as expected. They have been working on it but very slowly and without purpose. Don’t know where the “ 1/6 committee was angry enough” is coming from but adds nothing to your point and in fact detracts. Literally.
Im prescribed Tylenol, does that mean I'm medicated? Just saying simply because 66% of the US is taking a prescribed drug doesn't mean it's all anti depressants, anti psychotic, anti anxiety. Could just be Tylenol.
