We even forced McDonald's into a union when they first entered the danish market. So when the unions heard that McDonald's didnt plan on unionizing no truck drivers wanted to deliver their goods, they couldnt get any local workforce to build their restaurants, they pretty much couldnt get anyone else than the regular restaurant staff to work for them, and even thoose workers was hard to get a hand on.
I was born and raised in Guangzhou. Because of the proximity to Hong Kong, I watched News @ 6:30 every day. Every year, on June 4, the Chinese authorities would cut away large sections of the TVB broadcast because before the National Security Law became law, people in Hong Kong were allowed to have a public "Day of Mourning" to mourn the people who were killed, but mainland China doesn't allow it. I asked my parents why, they only gave me vague answers about "something bad happened on that day in 1989" without telling me what. I am someone who talks about anything to anyone, regardless of context. My parents were probably afraid of getting arrested for sharing "national security classified information".
Yes. I been to China a bunch of times before covid. Most don't know and don't care. The rest know and care but using vpn as a local can get them in serious trouble.
