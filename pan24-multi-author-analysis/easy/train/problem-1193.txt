They haven't been in Oklahoma. 8 years of Fallin, 4 years of Stitt. Lowest voter turnout of any state. 1 incarceration of women, top 5 child hunger. Oklahoma is a perpetual embarrassment. We keep voting these Republicans in, because "Christian", even though they spit on the poor and working families every opportunity they get. They also are trying to force private christian schools that discriminate against non-Christians to receive all the money. Our education superintendent basically wants to eliminate public education for theocratic education. Oklahoma is a persistent failure. Living here all my life, I've never been more saddened by the state of affairs here. I quit teaching, and every single news story about Oklahoma education lets me know I made the right decision. I feel bad for the kids here, many of whom don't even have regular teachers. They are going to be ones suffering the most from it. It's amazing the Thunder are even here as a sports team. I'd have thought they'd have left for bigger pastures by now.
