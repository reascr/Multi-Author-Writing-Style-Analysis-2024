I don’t think it really matters who Newsom nominates, I think the problem is for him that Katie Porter has a fairly large brand for someone who is still relatively new to politics. Can you name for me one black woman of note from California who is not Kamala Harris? I certainly can’t. I think the problem is though that Porter has already announced and the only real way that Feinstein is leaving her seat is if she dies as morbid as that may be. Sure, I guess she could always walk back her nomination, but I kind of don’t think that’s likely. No one is owed a Senate seat, so even if they are the incumbent, I think many people would be very disappointed if Katie Porter did not run.
Really? Can you come up with anything about his politics? I'd love to see surveys of name recognition, because I would have thought Porter was doing better. I didn't even know Schff was from California. And I know nothing about him.

It's California. No Republican has a chance in hell of winning the Senate seat. It's a distinct possibility that the general election will be between two democrats.
