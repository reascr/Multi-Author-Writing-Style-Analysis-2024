Ah yes, 2016. The year politicians figured out they could lie to the American people and not suffer any consequences! Crazy it was never though if before.
I would exercise restraint when adjudicating someone's ethnic heritage in general, but being strict about name changes has a very weird anti woman context and specifically there is a very weird issue in America where everybody expects everybody from Mexico to fit a particular ethnic model. They have people with Polish and Germanic names in Mexico, too. The idea you change your name to something your constituents can spell and pronounce is not fraudulent or unique in any way. People are often really weird about Eastern European names in the US and there's a long history of that. Louie CK isn't lying about his ethnic heritage, you know?

Thatâ€™s embellishing. These people are straight up fabricating resumes, donors, and who knows what else.
