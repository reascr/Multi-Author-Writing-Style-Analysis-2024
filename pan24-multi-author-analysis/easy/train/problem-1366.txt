I'm generally pretty pro-workers and pro-union, but I wish they would be more pragmatic here. Innovation, efficiency, and growth are good for all stakeholders in the railway industry. That may mean short-term job cuts, but if it makes railways more attractive and leads to the building of new tracks, opening of new routes, re-development of stations and facilities, upgrades to hardware, etc. this ultimately benefits railway workers as well by creating new jobs. A stagnant railway industry with low margins and outdated operations will be unable to develop and create high-paying jobs. Unions should accept job cuts and focus their negotiations on salaries for those that will keep their jobs, and for fair settlements, including re-training, for those who are made redundant.
No they don't and they know this. Thats why the Taft Hartley act was imposed. All of those strikes you hear about in US history mostly happened before the Taft Hartley act. Ever since that act was passed it's been incredibly difficult to organize a strike. A strike takes participation from everybody. Job security and not being able to lose your job to a scab for example.
