"It is not accurate or appropriate to make generalizations about people who commit violent crimes based on their religious background. It is also not possible to determine the percentage of people who kill police officers with a religious background, as this information is not widely available and would be difficult to accurately track.
Violent crime, including the killing of police officers, is a complex issue with many potential contributing factors, and it would be inappropriate to attribute it to any single factor such as religion. It is important to focus on the individual circumstances and motivations behind each act of violence, rather than making broad assumptions based on religious or other demographic factors.".
Because Iâ€™m super fascinated w religious extremism/fundamentalism and how various societies have dealt with it across religions and eras - and yeah, carving out a kind of social silo for folks who are way, way out there seems to be the most successful model, no matter how unpalatable it may appear to the rest of society.
