Something to note but 'control' needn't be physical. We're not fighting old-school style from land, air and sea, but space too. 'Massing of effects' against an adversay without massing of ground forces to achieve US interests. US hardware and advanced weapons systems are playing a key role in controlling the terrain and frontlines without direct US military personnel on the ground. Harming a US president is an act of war and Russian planners would be foolish to draw first blood. Just imagine how fast the backchannels US and Russian military commanders use to communicate with each other during conflict will likely go dead and by a hypothetical tomorrow the world would be counting dead bodies from one and half superpowers.
What would make me hate him? Him trying to stop a federal election from being certified without proper reason. It's why I can stand his predecessor.
