I have always been fascinated that what we will find from Amazon. Some researchers estimates the population of Amazon to be in millions before spanish came and after that reduced to small populations. Unfortunately there is not much credible archeological evidence for this, it is simply too inaccessible and there is not as much funding as for the Mayan and Aztec sites.
Yep. Some of my relatives were stolen by Nazis. Still don't know where they are to this day but if they do 23andMe or some sort of DNA test, they'll (hopefully) figure things out quickly. I hope the same for the Ukrainians.
Making decisions based on practical knowledge instead of long term scientific studies is not the same as systematically murdering everyone. Most of the decisions can also be said to have been done in good faith, same is not true for Nazies. Killing birds to reduce the amount of crops being lost was a decision done in good faith. It caused a famine we all know so well. Was this famine similar to holocaust? Really?
