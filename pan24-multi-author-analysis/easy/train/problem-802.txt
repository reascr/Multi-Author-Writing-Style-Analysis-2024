Having a baby could cost around $10-30K depending on your insurance. On top of that, it costs $250k to raise a baby until 18. A lot of folks can’t afford that.
How ironic of you to congratulate immigrants on coming here to bring their culture and contribute to the country, just to turn around and saying that they don’t need to live in the very city that was once a massive ghetto and only revitalized into thriving a world-class city by working-class immigrant communities that you know, happened to live there.
No. Endless growth is the ideology of the cancer cell, as Edward Abbey famously put it. The US would be a nicer place if the population were to fall back to its levels from the middle of the previous century - around 150 million residents. There would be more land and resources per capita, along with technological automation which makes it easier to access and enjoy those resources. This is also vastly better for the environment than the 'endless growth' model.
