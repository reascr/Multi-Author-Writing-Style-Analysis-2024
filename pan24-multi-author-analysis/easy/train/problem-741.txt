We had a full-bird criticize President Clinton after Bush was elected but before the inauguration at a Commander's Call, he used the usual republican/conservative tropes about President Clinton. At least 4 SNCOs made formal complaints and that particular Colonel who was presumed to be ticketed for a GO slot retired within 6 months. He should have been dismissed without retirement pay.
As he is one of those vile people who wore the nation’s uniform as he participated in Trump’s unconstitutional curtailment of civil liberties, on the day he had a public park cleared with tear gas, just so he could hold an upside down Bible in front of a church he never, ever attended, in order to take some hypocritical, virtue-signalling campaigns photos, I would say “Fuck YOU, Mark Milley” and never believe a single word he said, Including his words today.
Makes sense. I'd have liked a scathing take from him (in his usual professional but blunt way). I was actually hoping his book would but I think that came too soon. I stopped part way through as it was more just telling what he did and little beyond that.
