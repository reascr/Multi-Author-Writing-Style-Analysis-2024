Far in the future, when people look back at this time, with all the crazy shit that has happened in the last deacde, Putin's invasion will stand head and shoulders above everything else in the catagory of "holy shit, that was dumb" and thats in a universe where the leader of the free world told us all to drink bleach to cure a disease...
I agree. However, despite remaining optimistic, I doubt that will be the case. Most anti-war protests have been “settled” by brutal oppression and mass incarceration, which is not something an average civilian wants, understandably so. Also regarding the civilians, a lot of people in Russia support the war due to being brainwashed by the state media. As a person living in an ex-soviet nation, I can see this phenomenon happen around me everyday and it is TERRIFYING how easy a grandma is made to believe that it is good to sacrifice her sons for a cause that is in truth utter bullshit. I do wish that you are right though, and people are able to stand up for themselves and for their country in the face of this tyrant.
