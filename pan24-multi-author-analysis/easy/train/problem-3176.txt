A lot of it would have to do with operational tempo, mission, and resupply. The US projects power and supply lines like no other. It's not a question for the US of 'How can we supply this FOB that was setup 30 minutes ago.' It's a question of 'Do we put a Burgerking or McDonalds on it?' and 'It's been 30 minutes, why have the SeaBees not finished building my parking space?'.
Edit: For context, 10% losses are considered enough to make you combat ineffective, and require serious reorganisation of the battalion. 25%? You're going to need some replacements, pronto.
Um, actuallyâ€¦. Decimation means 1 out of every 10. It was a Roman military method of discipline where 1 member of the 10 person cohort is killed by the other 9. (This is a sarcastic comment meant to illustrate the fact that Ukraine did much more than decimating the Russian brigade.).
If half of your battalion is combat ineffective, but recouping in high grade medical facilities, the rest of the battalion is freshly equipped, rested, and supported by 2 or 3 other battalions, then maintaining a suitable level of combat readiness to rotate them into second-line duty is feasible. 6 months of deployment would be refit time by US standards anyway.
