You know it's funny how in every post about Israel (even about Israeli internal disputes where majority of the involved are Jewish apparently) you a bunch of comments about how you'll be called antisemitic if you criticize Israel, but almost never see people actually calling anyone antisemitic.
Fun(?) Fact: in 1993 Israeli PM Rabin signed the Oslo accords, providing an end to the Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu rose to power as a radical who called for Rabin's assassination. And it worked, Rabin was assassinated by one of his followers. Inexplicably, instead of arresting Netanyahu he became Prime Minister and has been in power for most of the subsequent 26 years.
