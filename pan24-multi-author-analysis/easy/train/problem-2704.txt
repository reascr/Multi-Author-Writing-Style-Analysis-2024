This is gonna sound absolutely batshit insane, but I think the Democratic Party needs to poll their voter base, find out what they want, and attempt to give it to them. What do Miami voters want? What about Tallahassee? Pensacola? Orlando? Tampa? You want their votes, they have to want you. I don’t think there was any desire for Charlie Crist, and we learned that again this election cycle, didn’t we? Don’t run him next time! Try someone with original ideas that resonates with real Florida voters. I’m from Florida, regrettably, and while I would have voted blue across the ticket if I still lived there, I would be and am deeply mistrustful of Crist and would have preferred literally anyone else over another geriatric conservative-leaning compromise Democrat that hopes to get red votes by virtue of being as Republican as possible for a Democrat and hoping to “meet people in the middle”.
If one does, by all means go for it. But in the meantime, running more Manchin types (in a broad sense) can be better than nothing.
