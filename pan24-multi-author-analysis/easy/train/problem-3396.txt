According to various German articles, the tech in question is many decades old and completely outdated - which is why it was up for sale in the first place: Apparently, the seller won't be able to utilise the foundry for more than a few years from now. The options seem to be selling or closing.
You are talking about theft or illegal transfer of intellectual property, like, for example, a Chinese owned company violating trade restrictions to transfer the parameters of a key recipe or schematics for a tool to a person or organisation within China which is trade restricted.
It was the other way around, if anything. First the Chinese only got 5% of Hamburg port, then Scholz flew to China, and then China did their statement. I personally don't believe that they were causaly linked. China would have issued a lukewarm statement in any case, and the China / Costco Hamburg port deal has been going for quite some time afaik.
You are oversimplifying the situation. The Chinese export market is very important for German industries - going full confrontation would do much harm to German economy, and by that, to German people.
