How he does it? He’s mentioned some comments about using bots or in the case of Zuck, he had to see him getting off the plane to match the tail number to the transponder. But they would have to be able to track the transponder in a very specific way to know what those flights are after the alternate identity is known. ADS-B websites show flight number, plane model, and some other minor stuff, from my experience. Someone who follows SDR’s better than me could prolly provide more info. And you can find some interviews on yt, but he never goes into great detail with the media. To be fair, it was an interview that he said that on, but I can’t find it. Maybe when Tim pool had him on a couple months ago?

Really? You should read the comments below any of his tweets. People are out there saying if he'd won the nomination all our problems would have been solved and all the bad things would have mysteriously gone away.
