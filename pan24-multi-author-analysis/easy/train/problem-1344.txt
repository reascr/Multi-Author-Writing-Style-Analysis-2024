2. In the face of superior numbers, Ukraine is tactically on the defensive, at their pleasure. Estimates are that you need at least a 3:1 advantage on offense - speaking in terms of tactical defense on a localized battlefield in a vacuum, assuming all other factors are equal (like experience, training, equipment, weapons systems, tactics, and leadership). Other estimates say a 5:1 or even 10:1 ratio is preferred for an attacking force without significant force multipliers (like superior weapons systems). Russia is only barely meeting the minimum requirements for a decent chance at offensive success. By population alone then, Ukraine should be able to draw Russia to a stalemate if they don't make any major fuckups. But Ukraine actually has the advantage in most other factors.
Realistically they aren’t wrong. When seconds matter the police are minutes away and that isn’t a cut on the police but a statement of fact.
Maybe the police are near at hand and can get to you in two minutes. Maybe you live in a township and it’ll take them 10-15. Maybe you’re genuinely rural and it takes 20+.
