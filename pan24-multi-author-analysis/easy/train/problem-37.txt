CoronaVac contains inactivated whole copies of SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to many other COVID-19 vaccines, including the mRNA vaccines, which just present the spike protein of the virus to the immune system.
To estimate CoronaVac's effectiveness, the researchers focused on 2656 health workers who had taken polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 infections beginning in January, with the initial rollout of the vaccine.
I live there. It’s not an open border. I can drive to the crossing point right now and wait in line and if I have the appropriate documents I can cross back and forth. The armed guards ensure that I have the right documents for international travel. It’s easier to get out than to get in, but I wouldn’t call either a walk in the park. The crossing points themselves are kind of ugly. You wouldn’t vacation there. If I try to cross between points I risk death or detention specifically because it’s not an open border. There’s National Guard patrolling the border. CBP. Some individual “militia.” Crazy yahoos with guns. There’s not a moat patrolled by sharks with lasers strapped to their heads but that’s not the standard of what makes a border open or closed, is it?
