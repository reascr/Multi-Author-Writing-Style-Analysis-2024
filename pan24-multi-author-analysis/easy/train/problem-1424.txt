And to be clear, no one President should have the power to change all of our lives unilaterally. We habitually let Congress off the hook. Both parties have been all but outwardly glad to cede their power to the executive branch in the last few decades. Has McConnell been an obstructionist fuckwad? Yep. Have Democrats been inept in fighting it? Yep. I’m so sick of this back and forth the Dems engage in in which they whine about how they can’t get anything done because they don’t control the requisite chambers… except when they do, they whine about how they can’t alienate half of the voters by pursuing progressive ideals. But we all know what that means: can’t upset the corps. I mean for fuck’s sake, Schumer’s daughter works for Facebook. You think any long overdue regulation of social media is gonna happen on his watch? He doesn’t even understand the issue and if he did, the money flowing into his pocket ensures he isn’t going to do a fucking thing about it.

Government paying for infrastructure? Sounds like socialism to me. Those Texas residents should have just paid for a better power grid themselves on the free market.
