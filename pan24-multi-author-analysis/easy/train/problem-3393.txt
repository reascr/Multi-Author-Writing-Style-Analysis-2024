In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Sure. But while it may not be classified as a firearm, it's clearly a gun. And all that other stuff just makes it even better to be our national gun. Flintlocks for everyone!
Because the AR-15 is a super customizable platform allowing for an easy change of calibers frequently with just a swap of the upper receiver, is highly accurate with minimal investment, and one variant or another has been the base of the US militaryâ€™s primary service rifle for the last 50 years. They are also incredibly reliable as far as semi automatics come. The 1911 is heavy, fires a weak round, and can be finicky with rounds, and costs way too much for a decent quality firearm (a decent 1911 is over $1000, a decent AR-15 can be had for half that). The Springfield is just plain old and outdated.
