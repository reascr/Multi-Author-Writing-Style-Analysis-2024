Yea, a lot of us thought Qatar was going to use the World Cup as an international stage to show the West that they are becoming more tolerant to Western culture and open for Western business investments and tourism. In reality they are using this stage to show the other Middle Eastern countries how “strong” they are by refusing to bend to Western pressure and showing that they can go back on their promises and contracts and Western countries and companies won’t do anything.
Oh absolutely. It's just, being from Europe I wouldn't ever consider Russia a popular tourist destination. They have kind of bad PR and it's not solely related to their wars, so Europeans tend to choose other tourists spots. But Petersburg and Moscow do see some traffic.
