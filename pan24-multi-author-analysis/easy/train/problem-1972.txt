I need to buy some for “research purposes” and double check! Actually though I did think to myself last time I had some that they don’t taste like a prawn cocktail, but wasn’t sure what they tasted of. I put this down to living in a country where they don’t sell them unless they are in the international section of the store. (Which is very rarely) So I just assumed my taste buds had changed since I left the UK.

Wait what? Prawn cocktail crisps are actually ketchup flavour? As a Brit, who has consumed her body weight in crisps through the years, I am stunned by this revelation.
Interesting. At some point in the future I picture that women will be able to go and get a personal vagina chip made for them, this way they can test what will work for each person specific biology. Similar to how you can do a genetic test when taking new medications, you can exclude some drugs and try and use others based on how it would affect your genes or cover for the holes in them.
Very cool! Research on female biology is sorely lacking, and has been based on male biology for too long. Another great step forward in women's health.
