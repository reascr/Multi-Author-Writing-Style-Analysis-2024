Last time(really the last few times) the GOP tried using the debt ceiling to hold the country hostage, it backfired on them politically and they caved, and now that people already see them as a perforation party of outrage with no real plan for anything, I donâ€™t see it doing anything but the exact same thing this time if they try to do it again.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Guess what? If the GOP tries to gridlock the country so they can look at Hunter Biden's laptop, pass anti-abortion legislation, save Trump or do a hundred other stupid things...
