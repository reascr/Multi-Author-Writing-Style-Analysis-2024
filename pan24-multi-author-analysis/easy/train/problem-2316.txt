Is he honestly trying to foment some serious problems at home? This on top of bringing back Soviet style military training for teens, on top of the forced conscription and basically all western companies pulling out. I get that the Russian propaganda state is immensely powerful but for a lot of the country, when they go from a year ago enjoying life, to this and whatever else happens in a few months, couldnâ€™t that start to be a real problem for Putin?
Lol. Who wants to really live in a dictator state anyway? Literally any other developed western nation is better than Russia. Arguably even South Africa is better.
IIRC, Republicans under Dubya were angling for it to be a punishment for "assisting terrorists", with such assistance defined vaguely enough that unknowingly giving a terrorist directions would qualify.
No. Russia just legalized the drafting of foreign nationals and non-citizens into its armed forces. It just deprives you of any rights you may have theoretically had under Russian law.
