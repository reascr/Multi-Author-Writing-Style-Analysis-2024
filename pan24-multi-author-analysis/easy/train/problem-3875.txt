If you give a Ukrainian some intelligence and small arms, they’ll ask for HIMARS. If you give them HIMARS, they’ll ask for tanks. If you give them tanks, they’ll ask for planes. Moral of the story… Keep giving so that they can retain their independence and regain their territories.
Exactly. This is literally a win win for everybody except Russia. The eastern Europeans will also be getting newer equipment in case Russia wants to start more shit.
Seriously. If Russia loses they'll use nukes? So... just give up, because if defeat is inevitable then why bother? What bunk logic.
Though apparently incomprehensible to you, trying to avoid escalation can actually cause escalation.
Ukraine has wiped about a third of Russian military capabilities off the map in under a year. They did this with there existing stock, donated European equipment and about 100 billion in equipment from the USA. That means that for ONE EIGHTH of ONE YEARS military budget, they have crippled our most feared geopolitical rival. I don't know about you but I consider that damn good bang for the buck.
And if Hitler had possessed the largest number of nuclear weapons in the world then your logic dictates you would have appeased him by letting him exterminate all Jewish people and "undesirables" as he reigned over a global reich subjugating all unexterminated non-Aryans in perpetuity. Does that really sound better than risking nuclear exchange to stop an evil asshole in your head?
