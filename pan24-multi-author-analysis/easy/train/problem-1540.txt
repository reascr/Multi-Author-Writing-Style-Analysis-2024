This whole thing just goes to show, never disarm yourself in return for the promise of security. Ukraine used to be a nuclear power. Now look at them.
If this conflict utterly decimates Russia, and destabilizes it, I can imagine the USA doing something similar again, such as joint research into nuclear reactors, with the ulterior motive of preoccupying Russian nuclear scientists.
With either an impoverished, or even a fractured, Russia, being the inevitable outcome of this war, the next two decades have a sizable possibility of a new nuclear power emerging. From scientific experts bringing clandestine knowledge, to generals selling off their nuclear arsenal, nations with cash to spend may suddenly find themselves with functional nuclear programs.
But that's not what this is about. It is about the purpose for which each side entered into the peace agreement in Minsk. On logical reflection, there is no other reason for Russia to conclude the Minsk agreement except as a way to negotiate and solve the problem diplomatically.
