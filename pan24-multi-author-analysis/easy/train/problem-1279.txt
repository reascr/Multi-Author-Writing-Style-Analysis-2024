No no that only applies to the days off. Your pay during parental leave depends on your employment contract (well, strictly speaking on the "collective agreement" or työehtosopimus you fall under but I'm so not getting into Finnish labor law here) and your employer isn't required by law to pay you, but many do pay you _some_ percentage of your pay – mainly because unions. You can also get a… uh… "social insurance" payout from the gubmint during your parental leave, capped at a maximum 70% of your previous monthly income. If you're getting paid by your employer during your leave, that gubmint payout is paid directly to your employer so they basically don't take as big of a monetary hit during your leave.
Eh? Since when is having a parental leave an attack against a government in the Nordics? Like a half of the current Finnish government has been on a parental leave over last 3 years. Also Antti is from the Center party, which is not getting along with Marin, to put it mildly. They are pretty much an opposition party at this point, aiming for a ministerial portfolio in the next conservative government.
