The Romans respected the Greeks, spoke Greek, and some lived in Greece. But between the post Hadrian era and shortly before the war of independence, there were no Greeks in Greece. There were Romans, who identified as Roman, spoke Romaic (Koine Greek), thought of Aeneas and Romulus as their ancestors, had a centralised Roman state, and followed the Roman religion of Christianity. These people were the descendants of the ancient Greeks and the ancestors of the modern Greeks, but they did not identify as Greek (ie. Hellenes).
Assuming that Russia's nuclear arsenal is not full of duds (which is extremely unlikely given that it and the US held mutual inspections of each other's arsenals up until the COVID pandemic broke in late 2019/early 2020) and the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces don't mutiny when given the order to strike, the United States may be able to survive the resulting nuclear exchange in relatively good shape, but European NATO countries and especially the nearby non-NATO countries both in and close to Europe are unlikely to be anywhere near as fortunate.
