Demographics matter. These articles make me angry because they don't look at the vote changes between now and 24'. EVERY SINGLE DAY between now and election day 2024 8,000+ votes turn blue. Boomers are \dying\ and the young voters turning 18 find the GQP repulsive. Look at every single race nation-wide, especially all those close races. Then add thousands of blue votes to every single one, and 10 or 100s of thousands to state-wide races. The vaunted "red wave" became a "pink trickle" in 2022 due to young voters. We have.

Absolutely. And it's not unreasonable to be extremely concerned about 2024. It does seem like every election is "the most important election," and there is certainly truth to that, but the 2024 election is the most important by orders of magnitude more than usual. It will be extremely consequential (either way).
