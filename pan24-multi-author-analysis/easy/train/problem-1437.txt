You say that he was the most unpopular and divisive president in recent history like the voters knew that before the election in 2016. Independents didn't view Trump as that guy. Trump received that amount of the vote because he had every advantage that he possibly could have, running against an unpopular candidate in a presidential year that was historically bad for the incumbent party coming after two terms of a presidency for that party. He was a complete unknown politically, independents didn't know what kind of president he was going to be. Those same independents voted for Biden in 2020. You're assuming that they're going to vote for DeSantis who isn't a centrist which is not going to garner him support from most independents, and Joe Biden isn't Hillary Clinton. He's not anywhere near as unpopular as Hillary Clinton, and he's running as the incumbent president which is historically a very strong position and likely to end with him winning reelection. DeSantis is going to be viewed as Trump lite especially with his kooky book banning and culture war bullshit. Those things don't play well nationwide. The doom and gloom about 2024 is unwarranted. I'd be a lot more concerned if republicans had actually had a red wave in the midterms, except it was an utter disaster for them.
