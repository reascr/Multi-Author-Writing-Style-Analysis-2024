In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Totally delusional. It's not like we just had a politically motivated attack targeting the Speaker of the House. Or armed or civilians "guarding" ballot drop boxes and questioning people that they thought were voting illegally. Or a rush of candidates for positions managing elections who deny that Trump lost the 2020 election. Or an insurrection less than 22 months ago instigated by the at-the-time exiting President.
