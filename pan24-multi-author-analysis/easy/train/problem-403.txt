I agree it’s watching the death of a party in real time but I’m less optimistic about that working out anytime soon. Republicans have already been purging their own members like Liz Cheney for not being devoted enough. The party as we knew it is dying but what’s growing up out of the ashes is even worse. They’ll continue pushing out everyone in the party who won’t immediately fall into line for every horrific idea they come up with. Maybe those “moderates” will form their own new party like with The Lincoln Project or something, maybe they’ll just disappear. Outside of the two parties, they’ll have less power and influence. The new republican party will happily fight against democrats and their former party members. Their former members will be great scapegoats to blame all their past failures on and the base will excitedly demand harsh punishments for all the handpicked traitors. Their new party will have a much smaller base but it and the party itself will have only the most extremist elements left. Growing your voter base doesn’t matter if you drive out anyone who cares about rules, laws, or ethics. They’ll grow even more desperate to maintain and grow their own power and the only people left will be the ones who want to do the same thing.
