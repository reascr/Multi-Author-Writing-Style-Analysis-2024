It is arguably toppled. Their economy is fucked long term cause of this. The damage may not show yet, but its fucked in such a way it wont recover any time soon. Population issues were already a problem and now they'll be two fold cause of the war. Without people to work for you, economy is rip.
I think you either didn't read the article or missed the entire paragraph showing the relative difference: "Monthly tax and customs revenue from energy sales declined 46% in a year - reflecting the fact that, while the price of the global benchmark Brent blend was little changed, the average monthly price of Russia's Urals blend was down 42%, according to the ministry.".
A good example of this with respect to Russia is the rouble's performance; it's gone up in value which makes the economy look strong, but the actual driver of it is simply that Russia is still exporting but has been blocked from many imports - so roubles go into the country but don't come out. That sounds like a good thing until you remember that the whole point of exports is ultimately to pay for imports - since otherwise you're basically just giving away products for pieces of paper.
