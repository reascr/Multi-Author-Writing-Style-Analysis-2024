Poland should absolutely invoke Article 4 over this. Polish citizens, NATO citizens, EU citizens, were killed in an unprovoked missile strike. Whether it was an intentional attempt to push and provoke NATO while maintaining plausible deniability, or an erratic error on Russia's end, does not matter, because whatever their motivation Russia has demonstrated either through its bravado or its incompetence that it is a danger to NATO members. Swift and definitive consequences are needed, or else Russia can and will do this again. Strenh and NATO solidarity is what keeps the Russian state in its lane, a weak response can only embolden them to push harder. If we hadn't made this mistake with Crimea, Ukraine would be free and millions wouldn't have become refugees. I hope that NATO is brave this time, and gives Russia a hard punch to the nose.
There are intermediary options. For example shooting down all missiles within X kilometers of NATO borders to prevent such “accidents” from happening again. Would serve to annoy Russia significantly without outright war.
