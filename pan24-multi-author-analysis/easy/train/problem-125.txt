It's like I have said with others. We are seeing more surges in various diseases these days because vaccines and health care have been polarized to levels never seen. At least not in a life time. Why I said we will never see a shut down or anything like 2020 again because too many courts and people in power have fought it no matter if you are in a red or blue state. The difference is, more in cities and blue states will probably push for better cleaning or air vent units and UV-C cleaning units in places. Where people like DeSantis will be on the ground weezing away going: "no, I will not back down even though I can't see or breath anymore. Don't let them make you do the right thing." Then they all die on the floor and then that's when people would finally go: "Dammit, we have been lied too." but like I said, people have been given permission since 2016 to die on a hill that doesn't make sense just because you want to be a sore loser and blame other for what you did to yourself.
