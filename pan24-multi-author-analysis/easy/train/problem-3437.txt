If your intention is to hunt, well you have plenty of rifle options that are not military style, fully automatic, or converted automatic.
As of today though they are limited to rifles and shotguns with a range of action mechanisms. With that said, they also have enacted federal level safety regulations whereas the US is state by state. Denials are given based on criminal records, mental health problems, and any history of being the assaulting party in cases of abuse. There is no constitutional carry, courses are mandatory and a written exam. Their system of background checks is a minimum of 28 days.
It's not that gun advocates don't care about suicides, it's that things like assault weapon bans, registries, magazine capacity bans, concealed carry restrictions and universal background checks won't do anything to reduce suicides, so the only point in including suicides when talking about those proposals is to use them to drive up the numbers and promote an emotional response rather than a logical one.
