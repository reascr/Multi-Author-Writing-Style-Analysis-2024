Something he did while partying 20 years ago doesn't have anything to do with him as a politician now. I don't care if he did something stupid and racist a long time ago, believe it or not people can change in 20+ years so I'm not going to beat a dead horse over something 2 decades old. Calling other people racist because they're not constantly gobbling like turkeys about his blackface for the rest of eternity is just ridiculous and unproductive. What I care about are his policies and behaviours as premier, and like I said, I can understand dissatisfaction and disappointment if he isn't what you wanted, but I've yet to have a reasonable conversation with anyone who has a full-on hate boner for him and blames him for everything wrong.
Yep. After Trump lost the election some of my co-workers here in Canada were convinced the election would be overturned in his favor because it was rigged. Before that they were convinced he'd get a 2nd term. They also said BLM and ANTIFA were responsible for Jan. 6th.
