they should be allowed go, but must be forced to carry unloaded kalishnikovs while parading, let their people see how they are different from the rest of the world. 'carry your gun, and then you can run!'.
I assure you, it's far less of a reach that Russian companies simply rebranded existing stock (it's not like the clothes sitting in the warehouse goes with the companies when they leave, they're left behind) than it is to imply that companies faked the costly legal hoops just to rebrand themselves to not lose the (surprisingly small for it's size) Russian market.
Counter point. Guy who actually lives in Russia went inside the stores of said different brand and find out . What you said is a lie . The brand labels are actually on clothes with the only change being the store name . Before you say “what proof do you have ?”. Here you go.
There's a very clear difference between rebranding existing inventory and continuing to operate under a shell corporation to evade public eye. The factories and facilities for a lot of the companies that have pulled out of Russia are still there, even if their original owners are not - it's not like McDonalds is going to tear down every location they have before they leave, the infrastructure is still there. Just because Russia attempts to reuse existing infrastructure and product doesn't mean those companies are still operating within Russia.
Agreed. Sports are fine and all, but when we get to the point were hosting them requires 100,000s of slaves to build the stadium, for billionaires who don't even watch the events, it's gone too far.
