They launched a ton of Shaheds this time because they didn’t have nearly enough missiles ready for a big strike, but the vast majority of them were intercepted. Just in Kyiv 45 drones were shot down, I’m pretty sure there was just one confirmed hit on one of Kyiv’s energy infrastructure facilities, other missiles and drones were aimed at civilians. What is the point in hitting residential buildings? Do they still think that it will scare us? It never will, all it does is it reinforces our conviction that Russia must be completely defeated at any cost, there aren’t any people left in Ukraine that will settle for anything less at this point.
Exactly. I mean, 20 HIMARS (plus the M270s) is good, but even doubling that could end this much more quickly. Ukraine has at times been days behind on hitting targets we hear about. They surely have a very long list of targets that must be prioritised, and the same is said for their artillery. They're not hitting near what they could because they need to conserve ammunition.
