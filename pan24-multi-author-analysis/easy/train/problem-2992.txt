Umm, wut?!? What kind of freaky-deek thinks about 4th graders and anal sex in the same fantasy?? - and then tries to get his whole congregation to fantasize such things??
I don't think you can be a part of any reasonably-successful "Christian" sect in the modern world in good faith, because Jesus's advice on how to be a Christian almost certainly would have led to the quick extinction of Christianity had all self-proclaimed Christians followed it. No assets, no infrastructure, no centralization at any level here on Earth, no proclamations of faith, no resistance to any violence, no system to judge and/or punish wrongdoers here on Earth... need I go on?
Admittedly? At least this is marginally better than MTG immediately climbing onto the "but what about the opioid" crisis pulpit on twitter. Still is half assed and insincere, don't get me wrong, but could have legit gone worse with it TBH.
