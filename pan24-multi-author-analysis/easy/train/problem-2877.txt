Mormons are more serious about Mormonism. It’s the same shit different day, these wackos have their own conspiracies and are no different from MAGA IMO, specifically with the white house and a Mormon gaining control one day…. “The white horse prophecy”.
Not necessarily I live in a pa suberb which used to be super red everyone here is blue now even though everyone considers themself a conservative/liberal moderate no one is that radical on either side they see the new Republican Party and are scared of it so many people who are some of the most conservative/ I don’t like the govt and taxes type people are the most openly anti trump anti Republican people I know now. So Romney’s conservatism is alive but bc the republicans have moved so far right these conservatives tend to vote blue now. If Romney wins he will have support from utahs moderate democrats and moderate republicans for sure which should he’s. Good enough coalition to stop a trump backed candidate (if Utah has ranked choice voting he’d likely win).
