I feel like we're already there. I believe there are those in Russia that already regard the rest of the world helping Ukraine defend itself from Russian invasion as that existential threat. However, this latest invasion would be the THIRD in Ukraine (Crimea, then Donbas) and the world let Russia do it. Were the world to let Russia take all of Ukraine, I see no reason why Russia would stop there and the republics of Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia would be next. I have no desire to antagonize Russia, but the only other alternative Russia is offering is to support the defense of Ukraine or simply let Russia take whatever country it want and that is simply not an option.

Article 5 is the core of NATO. It is feared because and only because of it. Die to it, you can't isolatedly go to war with a NATO member: if you attack, you full-on attack each single country in NATO at once.
