Dream on if you think that the A4 protest has soften the heart of the CCP from imposing lockdown. CCP quash any protest. A recent example is the forceful put down of the protests in Hong Kong. A better reason for China's change of mind may be the rapid downturn of its economy and the ineffectiveness of Lockdown against Omicron. Lockdown was lead by Xi himself. The infection rate was climbing steeply in Oct and Nov. Xi cannot be seen to have failed and continuation of Lockdown will lead to total destruction of China economy. A4 protest erupted in the most opportune time to Xi an excuse of abandoning Zero Covid lockdown. Xi can see that most of the world have already opened up and living with the virus without much restriction. He just copy what US and UK have done in relaxing restrictions against Omicron without thinking that the west have gone through numerous cycles of infections that prepare the immunity of the population against Covid and the high effectiveness of the vaccines in the west. China now is suffering death rate and serious illness not typical of Omicron as experienced in the west. The Lockdown allows the deadly Delta to co-exist with Omicron in China while the slow evolution in the west has wiped out the Delta. Given time and enough death, China will recover from Covid as the chinese acquire their natural immunity.
Yes, obviously. It’s like you haven’t seen this happen in every single other country on Earth for the last few years, or did you just want a few upvotes?
