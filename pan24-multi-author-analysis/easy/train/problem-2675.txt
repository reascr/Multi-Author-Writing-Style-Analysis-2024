I love how these people still think “exposing” him as a bad person will suddenly change everyone’s mind on him. The dude was elected after being on tape bragging of sexual assault. He calls neo Nazis good people. He had like 30 sexually misconduct lawsuits against him and is in photos hanging with Epstein. He denied Covid and got like a million people killed. His two best friends in the international community are Slim Kim and Pesky Putin. He buried the mother of his children on his golf course. And he incited a riot that almost got half our governing body beaten to death by the dumbest people this country has to offer. What more does he need to do?? Accept it, most of his supporters are America’s trash and the trashier he is, the more they think they have in common. Case in point, an old friend was bitching about Mexicans coming here and suckling off the system on our dime. In the same breath he said Trump doesn’t pay taxes, not because he’s a bad guy, but because he’s smart. There’s no winning with these idiots.
Especially carry-over-losses that he’s STILL deducting, or anything related to his business that’s under investigation by NY.
Not today I woke up. I stood up. I walked a few feet to my bathroom. I walked in. I closed the door. Etc etc etc.
The part they left out is where he explains that the alligator story was just a big lie because he was too embarrassed to tell people is that in the late 80’s, he couldn’t afford medical insurance after Regan was finished stripping social safety nets, combined with untreated diabetes because of the price to see a doctor and afford medication, they had to amputate his hand.
Oh my god who gives a shit?! Fucking charge him already. We don’t need every fucking step charted out for some false sense of security.
