The current gerrymander isn't much more extreme than last decade's, they mostly focused on protecting incumbents. They could definitely knock out a couple of Dems with harsher lines but they'd risk it blowing up in their face if current voting trends continue to move towards Dems. If Abbott and Co. are banking on the state staying red enough to 2030, they might decide to go for the jugular and gerrymander out candidates like Fletcher or Allred. The lines will be hideous, though.
Realizing it doesn't directly pertain to state legislative districts, but gerrymandering suppresses voter turnout, and low turnout could (and should, IMO) be used as evidence of denial or abridgement of voting rights, triggering a reduction in US House representation, and, consequently, in the Electoral College. It may not be possible to force states to not gerrymander, at least for state legislative elections, given the current Supreme Court, but it should at least be possible to impose a cost for it on states and force them to choose between fair elections and full representation.
I'd prefer states opted for free and fair elections, but I'll accept them reducing their own power as a consolation prize if they're unwilling to be fair.
