Ever hear the story about the politician who told his campaign manager ti accuse his opponent of screwing pigs? When the manager said he couldn’t do that it wasn’t true the politician said “I know it’s not true I just want to make him deny it”. Could be the same thing say Putin is out and it will sow doubt and in a situation like they have in Russia where if Putin goes there will be a scramble to take his job, doubt in Russia is good if you are Ukrainian.If nothing else the more Putins media guys deny Putin is dead the more likely it’s going to sound like a cover up since their credibility is shit. Sure Putin can make an appearance but if he doesn’t look 100% the rumors will only get worse.
I'm talking idiomatically not literally. He's not saying Putin is "nothing" as if he's a loser like most people in the thread are implying. He's suggesting that Putin isn't the decision maker in Russia.
This is the second or third time in the last week that he has alleged Putin is dead or at the very least, not making decisions in Russia anymore.
It could be, but in this other interviews this week he more directly said that Putin is possibly using a body double to hide the fact that he's dead or dying.
One possibility? is that Putin is suffering some sort of disease that would be publicly visible, and forcing him to make a public appearance might make that visible?
