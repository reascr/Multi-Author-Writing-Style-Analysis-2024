What you're probably thinking of is ethnic cleansing, which is often confused with being the same as genocide when it isn't. Despite actually sounding scarier IMO, ethnic cleansing would encompass lesser acts like relocation. Even then, ethnic cleansing is done with the intention of replacing the relocated population with another, which I really don't think is Turkeys plan. I just can't imagine they're going to start shipping in Turks to replace the local populace, that'd be insanely dumb and impractical.
Absolutely this. YPG was convenient temporary ally. Kinda like Mujahideen was a convenient ally against the Soviets. And we know how that turned out....
Population relocation is undeniably likely and would certainly be illegal but that actually wouldn't be considered genocide under most definitions. It wouldn't be classed as such under international law, and most dictionaries like Oxford explicitly define it as the deliberate killing of a large group of people (or destruction, which relocation wouldn't constitute). Hell, the term genocide comes from "genos" (race, nationality) and "cide" (killing), it literally means the killing of a race.
