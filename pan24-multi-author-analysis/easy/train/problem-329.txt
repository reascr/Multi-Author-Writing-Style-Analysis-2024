It wouldn't though. You're way underestimating how much artillery it takes to actually level a city, and they'd need to do it in just a few volleys because South Korean counterbattery fire would flatten NK artillery in short order after they started firing.
Did you even read my comment? I literally never said a fucking word that I didn't think they would. My disagreement is on whether they could strike Seoul, and pointing out that there are hundreds of thousands of South Koreans living in cities much closer to the DMZ that are within range of a lot more artillery than the majority of Seoul is.
The hypothetical targeting of Seoul is a red herring that immediately makes me doubt the veracity of your claims, considering the hundreds of thousands of South Koreans closer to the DMZ within range of significantly more artillery. If the North Koreans were going to try and cause as much loss of human life as possible or use the potential loss of human life as a deterrent, those are the people getting hit.
