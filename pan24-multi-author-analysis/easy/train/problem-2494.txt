Putin expect something like what happened in Crimea in 2014, or in Donbass in 2014 - back then they have taken large swaths of territory quite quickly without lots of initial resistance from Ukraine army. Plan was to take Kyiv in 3 days.
Well, considering Ukraine is a Western-backed and trained army, along with being the largest army in Europe besides Russia, I would hardly say its military is comparable to that of the Taliban in Afghanistan who can't even operate their captured military hardware, or Iraq which suffered from the same failings of every other Middle Eastern army besides Israel.
Right. My point is just that we shouldn’t dismiss Russias military entirely for the failure of one operation.
Russia failed badly in its initial operation, but since then has adjusted to reduce Russian casualties.
Yes, Russia failed badly in the beginnin, but they have adjusted their strategy, and from what I’ve heard about Bakhmut, it is a rough situation for the Ukrainians. They are throwing everything they have at Holding Bakhmut, but still getting slowly pushed back.
