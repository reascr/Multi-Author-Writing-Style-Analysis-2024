I don't know about all that, I think it actually does make your entire body's nerves numb. I had a procedure done about a month ago that required general anesthesia; before I went under, the anesthesiologist warned me that people have a tendency to forget to breath, because their body doesn't give them distress signals. Sure enough, the first thing I remember waking up to was the sound of a machine's distressed beeping and her telling me to take a deep breath. I then spent the next 15 minutes rubbing my face and stretching my limbs just trying to get some feeling back. The next morning, I woke up number than I was when I went to bed, because the stuff was still inside me and it felt like it had somehow pooled when I was sleeping.
Not conclusively. Because those drugs are used to treat depression, emotional blunting could've been symptom of depression itself.
Exactly! When I went to a theater to see a movie not long after quitting a high dosage of Prozac and I cried for the first time in 3 years. I do still think it took away some of my capacity for extreme emotion though. 10 years later I still have a hard time experiencing joy the same but theres so many factors that go into that so it's hard to pin down.
