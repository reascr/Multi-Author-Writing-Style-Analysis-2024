From Bakersfield, it’s full of a bunch of racists who die from the bad air quality, bad hospital system/health care, bad criminal justice system. The higher education and school system is full of quanon nut jobs as professors and administrators. Agricultural and oil industry works hard to ensure education is hard to get and only want to partner when they have bad PR cases then they reach out to higher education to offer a couple of classes for their employees then when the publicity changes they go back to actively work against education except for their charter schools which they hope to raise indoctrinated kids (yup we have a charter school by an agricultural company). I have had swastikas drawn on my car where I work. The relatively cheap cost of housing comes with immense racism, misogyny, homophobia/transphobia and we have incredibly high crime and health issues. PLUS, we have absolutely nothing entertainment wise to do so you end up driving to LA anyway. PLUS, if you get sick no one here who has good health insurance utilizes our hospitals or doctors beyond just getting referrals you have to go to LA or Bay Area to get the medical assistance you need. We have had people move to Bakersfield then immediately get a job elsewhere as soon as possible as they realized that yes the cost of living is low economically, but the high cost of your health more than outweighs the relative cheapness of getting a house.
4. The beautiful “Padre Hotel.” Which features the only bar in Bakersfield that you feel even remotely safe in. My mom stayed there once. She said, and I quote: “I didn’t love it.” She didn’t say she disliked it!
