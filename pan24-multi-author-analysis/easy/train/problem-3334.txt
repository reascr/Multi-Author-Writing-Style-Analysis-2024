In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I don’t know. At some point it would not make sense to buy a politician. Say that each one represents 10 people. At that point the politician would definitely come on over for coffee or a beer, know the names of your kids and pets, know what you do and your hobbies. What your concerns are and what it would take for them to get your vote. That probably be true at 100 people also. After that it becomes more impersonal at 1,000, 10,000. 100,000. - 1,000,000 it’s just statistics.
Really? One only needs to look at the past 2020 election where there were any number of voter irregularities. Some proven true and others without standing and in the end a peaceful transfer of power took place. Politics can be a dirty game and one where things don't always seem fair. However, in our elections things are done in the open and sunshine is the best disinfectant.
Exactly. You need a veto prof majority of the senate and/or a scotus that is favorably disposed to the idea. Not things the forces of electoral reform are likely to have on hand any time soon.

We're a constitutional republic. Designed with checks and balances throughout every process to help ensure the WISEST POLICIES prevail. Not the MOST POPULAR ones.
Excellent response! I guess I am very dubious that the courts will let the States subvert the EC as long as there is a plausible constitutional argument. This Supreme Court is not bound by precedent, only politics and the politics are the reason we cannot remove the EC from the constitution.
