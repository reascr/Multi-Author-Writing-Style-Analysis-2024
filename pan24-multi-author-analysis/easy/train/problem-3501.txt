Iran for - all intents and purposes - (edit) already has nukes. They have the pieces. They have the scientists. They have already done the difficult enrichment. They are ready the second shit hits the fan to complete the puzzle. It’s not some grand mystery how to complete it where they are at. Giving them old Soviet anything wouldn’t do much but for an icbm/cruise missile that shows them how to miniaturize. That is the only thing that takes a while after difficult enrichment. See NK.
The thing is I am sure Putin has already decided on his successor and is keeping him well hidden until the day he dies , don’t forget Putin literally waited years to begin his invasion making sure every piece was in its place and that Russia had enough gold and money to survive the war sanctions , they are still going strong after an entire fucking year , I have seen videos of common Russian people and nothing has changed except for some brands leaving and being replaced by home based brands there . Putin is the emperor of Russia and if anyone disobeys him even oligarchs they die , 13 of them have died this year becuz Putin suspected them of disloyalty so his system is quite robust and efficient .
