We barely remember the multiple presidents and decades we spent ranting to our own European allies buying Russian energy and funding the current and multiple other Russian wars.
Dude did you read what I said? Democratically elected congress members are allowed to impeach a president, no matter the reason... Maybe it was unfair, or not enough reasons to such a drastic thing in your opinion, but it still was done by elected oficials, so you can't say its a coup...
You know, when the congress that was democraticly elected votes to impeach a president, its not a coup, even if you think the reasons of said impeachment are fake or weak, thats how democracy works, we should just accept even if we think it was unfair or stolen, just as trump and republicans should've accepted they lost...
Yeah which is a shady way to make it constitutional, I'm not disagreeing on that, I'm disagreeing on calling it a coup, for it to be a coup you will need to change the constitution so to make it not possible to change something from legal to ilegal like that again to abbuse the ''crime de responsabilidade'', which is something I would support, but I still think presidents should be able to be impeached at any time if there is enough votes for it, thats how the most stable democracies work.
