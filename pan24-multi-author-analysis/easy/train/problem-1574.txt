I’m thinkin’ Putin has been planning this thing for his entire time in “office”. Every trip down the stairs he takes makes him dig in his heels more.
Republicans? I'm not American but is that a synonyn for traitor who is paid by an enemy nation? Fairly sure a good investigation could end with half of the party being discredited.
Especially Ukrainians. Those guys are hard as fuck. Russia will need kill every one of them before they hand Ukraine over. They will and should fight to the bitter end!
"On January 26, the Russian Armed Forces delivered a massive missile strike by long-range air-and sea-based precision weapons and also by unmanned aerial vehicles against the energy sites providing for the operation of enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial sector and transport system," the spokesman said.
In particular, the massive strike disrupted the deliveries of armaments and ammunition, including NATO-supplied weapons, to the Ukrainian military in combat areas, the spokesman said.
"The operation of the production capacities for the repair and recovery of Ukrainian military equipment was disrupted," Konashenkov reported.
The world would be better at this point. Even if there’s another Putin clone taking his place, at least we’d have one piece of human garbage out of the way.
