Nice strategy. Putin slips up and calls it a war. Now, lawmakers can say: "War? We never agreed to a war Only a special police action Putin lied to us!".
Now, if you are an average citizen, if you believe a) that revolution is unlikely (while you believe the probability is high that being separated from your family and children, being tortured and killed in the process, is high), and b) even if the revolution succeeds, another (perhaps more corrupt and brutal) dictator will take their place, then it makes no sense for you to risk your life (and your familyâ€™s lives) only to throw it away, even if you wished to participate in a revolution that would make your country a better place.
The cat is out of the bag. Putin is punching himself in the nuts this very moment. "Special Military Operation" was much nicer sounding. Those three words could mean all kinds of things. You could spin bullshit all day long when describing all of this as "something special." War is a much uglier word. It is a word that represents what is truly going on at the moment. And a pointless war at that. Putin needs to go. Two in the head and two in the chest is all that it takes. Fuck him.
