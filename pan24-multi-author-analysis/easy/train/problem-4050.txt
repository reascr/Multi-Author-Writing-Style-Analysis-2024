How would you describe it otherwise? Asking as someone who has almost no knowledge on the subject (other than comparing it to what has been happening, for example, in Poland, where the government was basically trying to take over the judicial branch in order to exert control over multinational companies and investment).
Direct check? What direct check? There is no check by the people beyond causing economic damage. You are talking about a scenario where the legislative goes rogue. It's all over if the legislative goes rogue. They can institute state propaganda, outlaw criticism using loaded language to excuse the censorship, and you'll end up with a situation no different from any other "democracy.".
But the media likes to pump out garbage to make it as if most people in Israel are against this and that this is hurting democracy - while completely ignoring how the Supreme court times and times again used it's powers for its own agendas, rather than for the citizens (like what the ones who against this, are claiming - that they are hurting the supreme court's ability to help the citizen - but it never truly cared, only about people with their agendas and political side).
The reaction is not strong enough. Everyone should be protesting these 'reforms'. Just because Israel needs a Constitution and does not yet have one does not mean it doesn't need to be a democracy with laws and protected rights.
