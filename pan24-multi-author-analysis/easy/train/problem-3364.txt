I hate to break it to you but every generation thinks they’re the ones to move humanity forward while blaming the previous generation for all that’s shitty about society, but in reality it’s not about peoples age it’s about a perpetual class war and economics - has its been for centuries. Religion is inherently linked to fear (of death, of difference, of “the other”, of not being in control etc.) consequently lots of people “find” religion as they age, when their own mortality becomes inescapable, when the dreams their youth have all been dashed and they need something to pin their crappy human condition on. I’ve friends and family members who where never religious in their 20s suddenly talking this nonsense in their 50s. It sounds bananas but it happens.
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
Way better? You gotta be kidding me. Maybe for the nobility or the high clergy, but for the regular person life was - and I'm being generous when I say this - very shitty.
