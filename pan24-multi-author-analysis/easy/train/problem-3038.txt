No offense, but if he lied on his financials and his backround, isn’t that technically fraud to the federal government. In my opinion, and action like that should result in being barred from holding any honorable position, whoever does it. For the record, I think majority of the population believes in this. Main issue I have is that we as a people will pay his paycheck. I plead for the people of the US to not put him in office, and to pursue the proper actions necessary, that being an investigation and results. I think also the situation should be brought up and discussed live on air to find out who else in the government believes it’s ok to seat people who may be fraudulent. It’s one thing if it’s discovered when he’s in office, that’s a means for investigation and impeachment. Since he’s not in office, seating him should be stopped and these concerns addressed, and that is to ensure the American people aren’t getting screwed. Again, no offense to anyone who follows or supports him, just want what’s right for America.
