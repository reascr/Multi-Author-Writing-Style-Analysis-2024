A Russian website has over 10,000 confirmed deaths, mostly by visiting cemeteries and culling social media posts. But the Russian military is widely believed to be hiding large numbers of dead soldiers, and the Ukrainians have reported having large numbers of Russian bodies in freezers that the Russians won't take back.
Haha. Nono, those are the rich oligarchs whose opposition is more dangerous. A lot of the educated ones are just leaving the country, for some reason. ðŸ˜‰.
There was a bit of an epidemic of defenestration amongst Russian doctors during the height of the covid pandemic: complaining about the lack of PPE, questioning hospital administrators on policy, suggesting the numbers for Russia were unrealistically low, were all early symptoms of the disease..
You want to know what I think? Putin knows he is dying from cancer, and wants to leave a legacy for his name, no matter how many Russian lives it costs. He thought he could take Ukraine easily, he now realises he can't, so he is punishing the Russian people for failing to win his war for him.
