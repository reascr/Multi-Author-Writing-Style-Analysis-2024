>This is the direct result of years of conservative-led efforts to successfully defund, defang, and delegitimize the IRS. Over the past eight years, Congress has steadily reduced the agency's enforcement budget by billions of dollars, down 25 percent from what it was in 2008. And by cutting out only relatively small chunks at a time, the gutting has largely avoided public outcry. Unsurprisingly, according to ProPublica, the IRS is in disarray on the inside, resulting in "a bureaucracy on life support.".
But what would billionaires lose, without an educated workforce & educated consumers (can you imagine the internet existing with illiterate workers & consumers?), without roads, cargo trains, electric grids, dams, military protecting US interests all over the world (including shipping lanes), police protecting their private property, taxes paying for long term fundamental research out of pure curiosity (the kind that discovers non-profitable but game changing science, like mRNA tech, genom sequencing, general relativity, quantum mechanics, etc. Which then companies use to invent & sell new tech), etc.???
