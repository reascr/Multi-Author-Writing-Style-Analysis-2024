There are minorities in states that could vote for Dems in the general. Putting that early state money and organizing into a swing state could do a lot to build infrastructure for the general election and tip it blue for years. SC will be solid red for a long time.
Maybe evaluate why progressive candidates do so poorly when faced with Democratic voters demographically in line with the majority of Democrats nationally. If you can only win among white conservative Dems, then what makes you think you can win the primary or the general?
If it cooks progressive chances it's because they never had a chance with most Democratic voters without the help of two white unrepresentative states making them seem viable. Bernie 1.0 should have demonstrated that clearly. There were never enough voters for him to win and when 2.0 came around he never bothered to win over new voters.
Neoliberalism relies on capitalist realism, Thatcher's proclamation that there is no alternative. Sanders for a brief moment presented one, and so terror gripped the hearts of people financially vested in maintaining the status quo.
