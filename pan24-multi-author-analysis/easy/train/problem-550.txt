I generally agree but the game of chicken would get serious very fast if and when the US decides to sail through international waters or create a humanitarian air bridge , and when you look at how fast the threat of general civil disturbance ( rather than limited democracy activism) completely reversed their COVID strategy you wonder what might happen if the export miracle collapses.
Also who knows what NK would do. I don't mean to be pessimistic but I think there is a lot of brinksmanship and posturing going on right now and in that past that has traditionally happened before wars (though I'd love to be wrong!).
On the one hand the Chinese government ,though authoritarian , seems at least ‘rational’ and must be aware of how much their prosperity relies on exports and control of their population requires economic success. On the other they have built an ideological system that requires respect from the world , requires that Taiwan and the West play to an insane narrative that it isn’t independent and it’s very difficult to predict what they wouldn’t risk to maintain this ideology or to prevent looking ridiculous to their population.
