Usually for hydrogen production from water, electrolyzer costs are significant, but not unacceptable. As soon as you increase the downtime of your electrolyzers massively by only using them for energy peak excesses, the capital costs per produced kg of hydrogen will increase massively, making production economically infeasible even if electricity is cheap.
Good point. That's the whole problem with wind turbines. As they're so unreliable, we still have coal, oil and gas powered plants for the not-windy-enough days. So betting on wind energy has meant that we keep alive the fossil fuel plants as well. If we had nuclear energy we would have had safe, cheap, plentiful and reliable energy that would be Co2 neutral. Our bet on wind energy instead of nuclear leads to more Co2 generated because we still need coal, oil and gas power plants for the less windy days.
As someone living in the country with the highest amount of wind energy per capita, I feel I have to warn you. Wind energy isn't cheap. Never will be.
