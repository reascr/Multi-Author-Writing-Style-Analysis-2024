Exactly. This race will determine the Senate so both sides will be equally pushing for that. But because Kemp easily won it's safe to say that Republicans came out to vote for him and many either didn't vote for Walker, voted for the third party candidate, or voted for Warnock. Will that small but significant number of Republicans go back out to vote for someone they couldn't just a few weeks ago? Probably not. But really since this race is so close a small percentage of those voters deciding to not go back could be all it takes to get Warnock over 50%.
