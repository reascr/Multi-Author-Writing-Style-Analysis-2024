I want to see how the Abrams gun handles Russian armor. All the leopards being sent to ukraine have an updated version of the gun the abrams has but with a longer barrel. If I remember correctly the A3 variant was going to finally give it the long barrel but I've not heard much about the development of it for awhile. If the short barrels do good those leopard 2s are gonna fucking decimate. Especially with their autoloaders.
Or, maybe the DU will stay in. Who knows, maybe it's becoming outdated itself. It's over a decade old already.
But from what we do know about it from seeing non-DU Abrams of Saudi Arabia being destroyed by hits that DU versions survived in Iraq, and that export variant is regarded as an armor peer of modern Russian, German, French, and a few other tanks, we can deduce that the DU armor likely provides a significant improvement to survivability.
Yes. As in most modern wars, most casualties are being inflicted by artillery. Among other things, tanks are the preferred means of countering artillery.
