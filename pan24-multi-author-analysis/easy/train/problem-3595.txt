UnFing believable! These people have the most convoluted & sick idea about what they want to do to this country. How anyone of the "small dollar donors" cannot see trump & lake using their donations for personal gain would be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous for DEMOCRACY.
Subsequent cases? After the first, if a lawyer files suit with ZERO additional FACTS, they can be disbarred. If they find new facts - facts, not opinions - then sure, allow it to proceed and be ruled on. But if they keep litigating under the same bullshit reasons as we've seen so far: "I know", "I heard", etc.. full sanctions, fines and disbarment for those involved. As long as the lawyers are allowed to continue without penalty, you'll find the bottom feeders happily willing to keep filing these lawsuits indefinitely. Make THEM put their lives on the line? No one will touch them without REAL evidence beyond batshit crazy conspiracy theories.
