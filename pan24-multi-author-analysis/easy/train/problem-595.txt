The more russia whines about escalation and nothing happens the more likely NATO is to help Ukraine because russia never acts on their hollow threats anyway.
They are scared to death that NATO will directly intervene in Ukraine and threats is all they have and the only "diplomacy" they are capable of, because historically it has worked in their favor (like when the world just let russia have Crimea in 2014 because "you dont want WW3 do you!?").
His allusion to "our territories" appeared to be a reference to four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - that Russia claims to have annexed following referendums last September condemned by Kyiv and its Western allies as illegitimate.
Here's the thing. Russia has escalated every chance they've gotten. They didn't start out by bombing civs. But they are now cause they've an easier target. They've escalated the rhetoric. They tried to escalate the pressure on ukraine. So, at this point. We dont care.
(Reuters) - Russia's defence minister said on Tuesday that Western arms supplies to Ukraine were effectively dragging NATO into the conflict, warning this could lead to an "unpredictable" escalation.
