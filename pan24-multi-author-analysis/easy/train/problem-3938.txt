Ooh... I was out to dinner with a friend of mine the other day, and I mentioned that I had voted early and asked if she had as well. She breezily responded that she didn't change her voter registration when she moved to my state. (She said she could have registered when she was changing her license but, "she didn't feel like it.").

The biggest and most self-reinforcing issue of American political difficulties. Even when youth turnout is up, it's often still not enough, and never reliable. I like the optimism that after 22 it'll change "permanently" but I've lived too long to believe it, and of course the GQP will do anything they can to disenfranchise the young more effectively.
