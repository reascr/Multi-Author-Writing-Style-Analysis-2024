Pretty much. I mean there was news in China about how they are getting run with COVID now. People popped up saying: "Vaccines are killing more in China than COVID and it came from there." Many pointed out that China doesn't believe in vaccines and the one they have has been proven by other countries to be shit. Then they go to: "Well, I'm right and you are wrong, now excuse me, I have to yell at the dead tree I refuse to cut down outside my town. Dammit for dying!" It's moved into: "Old Man yells at cloud".
Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses are a smaller group, so fewer cases of abuse overall, but they probably have a more rampant and deliberate cover up process than any of the others (other than the flds and other polygamous Mormon adjacent sects).
You nailed it. These people spend an inordinate amount of time and energy thinking about pedophilia and pedophiles. They're downright obsessive over it. It's all a performance. Theatrics to distract from the extreme likelihood that they are pedophiles themselves. Combined with how they're always accusing others of the things they're doing and you just know it is true.
