The hatred and small-mindedness of conservatives makes me sick, sometimes literally. I always believed that this country could be a great place with a little bit of work; I still do believe in democracy and, for the most part, the value and good in much of our political and legal system. So itâ€™s been heartbreaking- as someone who believed in these things enough to dedicate my life to them, become a lawyer, and work in government for a time- to see a large segment of the population act so fervently out of delusion, ignorance, and misinformation to undermine and tear it all down in support of obvious fascists, racists, and grifters.
Somebody was talking about reach online. Have you seen Fantastic Four? There's this guy that can stretch out his arms like 20 feet. I thought I wanted to be the one made out of stone, but being able to stretch your body? I think that's who I want to be.
