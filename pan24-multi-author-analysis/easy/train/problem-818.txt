It is cruel in the way that the stock’s steep price increase is heavily correlated with the sudden scarcity of fossile fuels in Europe which is a result of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine that caused death and suffering of civilized Europe’s very Eastern frontier. Why did I even write this I am confident you could have connected the dots yourself.
Second, while I consider a mistake Germany closing its nuclear and not extending it's life for cheap, let's not forget that expanding nuclear building new plants has been more expensive than wind, solar PV, coal or natural gas for years already (again, France and Finland), so don't lump together costs of keeping nuclear and increasing nuclear shares on energy.
Not enough sleep. Anyway, what I meant too write was. If you smoke less you don't say your lungs get cleaner, they just get less polluted. You need to quit smoking before your lungs can heal. It absolutely is not the same with climate pollution, but saying that something is cleaner while still polluting the environment is what politicians would say while they are building a coal plant in a daycare centre. Shit, I really need some sleep. What an awful rant.
