The owners lose everything when their businesses fail. Consumers just move on to the next new thing or company.
It also helps that the media usually jumps instantly to report any news of environmental damage and it's effect on nearby communities, usually triggering an official response or investigation, because most of the time authorities won't move their asses unless someone lihs a fire under them and are shown as passive/incompetent on national tv.
Chilean here. It's quite a topic here, in one hand the people of las Higueras, main site of the project, vastly aproved the project, it did pass the environmental checks from the government agencies, however the project was given the green light during Sebastian Pi√±era government, and now is know that he has capital involved in it. Other environmental impact analysis disprove that the project won't have any impact in the penguin ecosystem and where the main reason the project was denied, however some say it more political based, it's stop was a promise from the current president Boric during his campaign. Like I say, is still a topic here that hasn't ended.
