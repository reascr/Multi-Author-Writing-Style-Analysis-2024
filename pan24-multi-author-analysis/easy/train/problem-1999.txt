I'll try to give a kid version but warning it's dark. Native Americans were all over America. European settlers came and claimed the land and for the most part took it with violence and shipped them off to the parts they basically didn't want....till they wanted them as well(Oklahoma). We now call them sovereign but its kind of like pissing on them in calling it rain. They have some autonomy but still have to operate within most federal and state laws. If you have any questions I'll do my best to anwser.

He is a disgusting human all around. Greed is evil and he is among the worst. Never thought my state would find someone worse than our last governor but seems my states gop is dead set on fielding the worst.
