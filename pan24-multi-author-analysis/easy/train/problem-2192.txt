So Europe can keep buying gas from Russia but India can’t buy oil from Russia even though India doesn’t have any skin in the conflict? That’s some serious double standards. If Europe can’t bring itself to halting imports of Russian energy, what makes anybody think India should?
Hmmmm. What did they do for a couple thousand years before electricity and the use of petroleum products for energy? I think they will be able to get by. Humans migrated there a and chose to stay.
Ok, and India is a developing country that desperately needs to develop its’ economy in order to provide citizens basic necessities which are taken for granted in Europe such as toilets, electricity, and nutritious food, so the cost of them giving up an economic opportunity is much greater than for the extremely rich EU (in comparison). I’m sure there’s many more arguments to justify or criticize the EU’s disapproval of India purchasing Russian oil while it continues to buy Russian gas. No two countries (or intergovernmental organizations) will ever be in perfectly comparable circumstances but in the grand scheme of things this just screams “rules for thee and not for me”.
