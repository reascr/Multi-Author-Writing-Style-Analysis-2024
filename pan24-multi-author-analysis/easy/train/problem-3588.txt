It might have encouraged them to vote for it if it wasn't a separate bill that had nothing to do with their own interests too. Why was it two bills again? Because democrats believed that circumventing labor rights was as simple as making it two bills so they could blame the Republicans alone. There should have been one bill, only if it was union supported, that got any attention from democrats. Instead they split it into forcing the laborers to get back to work and a useless bill they knew would fail about giving them anything.
Unlikely. The workers got a lot in this deal and a lot of workers wanted to sign it already. It is doubtful they will get enough to strike over this last issue.
Pure ignorant propaganda. The rail industry made like 25 billion dollars last year on a nearly 50% profit margin. The unions could have had 10x what they were striking for with no impact to the economy whatsoever, only an impact on the parasite class. How is the economy threatened by the investor class losing returns they expected? The constant claim that the laborers were somehow threatening the economy rather than the profits of the shareholders and investors has been the stupidest and most obnoxious part of this whole thing.
