I read it once, put the book down for a month, came back(bookmarked spot), and kept going. you think it's going to stop. it doesn't. You think George RR Martin likes floppy donkey dicks? He's a torture freak, too.
A simple answer to your question is: There is the opportunity for Congress to simply pass a clean bill raising the ceiling, but the Republicans often attempt to use the possiblity of default as leverage to cut spending they don't like.
I 100% agree. When it gets to September, Biden should announce that he will sign a clean debt ceiling increase and nothing else and dare the Republicans to refuse to pass one. As soon as the deadline passes, announce that since Congress already approved the spending, and since the 14 Amendment requires him to protect the full faith anc credit of the US, they’re going to just ignore the debt limit. Also observe that the Supreme Court can say whatever they want, but they better figure out how they’re going to enforce their rulings before they make them.
