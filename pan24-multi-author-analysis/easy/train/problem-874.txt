We need more protests like this one. Governments STILL aren't doing enough to mitigate the effects of climate change, so we need MORE PRESSURE like protests that block roads and fossil fuel business entrances. Only REAL PRESSURE that affects the economy is going to work, because most politicians only care about money. They don't care about normal peaceful protests that don't disrupt anything. They ignore those protests because those politicians being bribed by the fossil fuel industry. The only way for us to overcome the power of bribery is to prevent the fossil fuel industry from making money to make those bribes. It's time for the fossil fuel industry to pay for all the damage it has done to the planet and everyone's health. If our governments won't make them pay, we should make them pay by disrupting their businesses. Our survival depends on it.
Seriously. Life has felt dramatically different in that time span, could just be my age and really kinda realizing things as an adult, I guess. But even beyond that it definitely feels fucky as hell. I see and hear about what my parents did, and think.
