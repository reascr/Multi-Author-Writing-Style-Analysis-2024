With what? The VDV is in shambles, the officer corps is decimated, the nuclear weapons infrastructure needs revamping, the posidon "60 Megaton" torpedo can't deploy from its submarine, cannon barrels can't get maintenance-rarely accurate, HIMARS pushed ammo depots so far back the front line moves by meters over weeks, SU-25's can't be replaced and die to Ukrainian air defence in any proximity, deuterium and tritium production is reasonably suspected to be non-existent, tanks from storage are either vastly outdated-scrap-or in ill repair, hypersonic munitions stockpiles are vastly outnumbered by western allies, America alone has OVER half of the nuclear aircraft carriers... look at russias one carrier, 300K Russians fled as mobilization started, and end of the day you're struggling with JUST Ukraine given extra ammo.
All good. Lots of pop culture references to it in the states. Was around before South Park, but South Park popularized the joke and was referenced as nauseam after that episode. Youâ€™ll hear it every now and then these days.
