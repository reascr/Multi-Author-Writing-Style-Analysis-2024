We know it by the definition of an element. To phrase it as simply as possible, each element is essentially defined by the number of protons it has. The first element on the periodic table has 1 proton, the second has 2 protons, etc. A couple other properties (e.g., number of neutrons) change to accommodate this number of protons, but basically that's what defines an element. If you took hydrogen and added 1 proton to it (then corrected the number of electrons and neutrons), it becomes a helium atom. All the Renaissance alchemists who wanted to synthesize gold were unwittingly aiming to arrive at an atom with the correct number of protons (and neutrons and electrons to stabilize it).
Well, relative stability. A few minutes vs. a miniscule fraction of a second is massive in proportion, but we're not gonna crack open a rock and find it just chilling.
No, worstsupervillainever. I’m fairly certain we’re on different wavelenhs here. And just to be clear, I wouldn’t let you touch that alien rock with a ten-foot pole.
