Without Truml on his side, and I mean fully on board and campaigning for him, I don't think DeSantis pulls as many people as Trump. He's not even that popular in Florida tbh. He BARELY and I mean barely won in 2018 with a decent democrat candidate. (Won easily in 2022 because, well, it was goddamn Crist...) With all his fascist moves, I wouldn't be surprised if he's polling lower with key demographics across the state. I'm getting tired of hearing about him as if Floridians love him like they do Trump. They simply DONT.
A party no longer interested in ideas about how to better run the country, but operating entirely on vague notions and feelings — about how white conservatives are being targeted, how being a fucking asshole is a virtue and “woke” is destroying us, and how a country that’s objectively doing well by most metrics is actually doing horrible because that’s just how it feels to them.
Agree. Trump winning, after Jan. 6th, would result in the death-blow to US democracy. There would likely be a domino-effect of unforeseen events that I'm not sure anyone could predict.
