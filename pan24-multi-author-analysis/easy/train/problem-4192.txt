I for one hope he runs for and wins the presidency some day. He’s got plenty of time. We have had a black President (something I didn’t think I’d live long enough to see) and now we just need a woman and someone who is gay to be POTUS. That would be a signal that the US has reached a high water mark on sexual equality and, at least as far as politics go, perhaps we can start focusing then one all the other critical issues since we no longer will be wasting our time on something that ideally should never have been an issue in the first place: a person’s gender and/or sexual orientation.
Benghazi was worse. If you read teh DOD report, which 'exonerated' Hillary in as much as it needed to, the actual problem was that the unit set to respond to embassy situations like this was shut down despite protests from the State Department. It was shut down because the House killed the budget for it.
