Sure they will have tones of challenges and will still be behind but now that they have no choice cus their future depends on these chips any big country will do anything and everything to crack the pot. And we are not even talking about a new miracle invention. like if u get my point if a country thinks their entire survival depends on thins one technology …. They will get it or atleast get near it. Best example nuclear weapon. It’s only a matter of time money and will. And I believe China has shown it’s more than willing and patient enough to risk it For its survival be it nuclear weapon, aviation, space stations etc. but of course in all areas they are still catching up but u know they aren’t so far away either.
Comparing those two manufacturing techniques is nonsensical. As ridiculous as it sounds, manufacturing 1mm balls for the ballpoint pens is harder in some aspects than building the explosive lens for an implosion style nuclear weapon, which requires ultra high precision manufacturing and was done by the Chinese in the 60s.
