Safe third country passage or status is something that can be used as grounds for denial of asylum, but, and bear in mind laws and policies change often, this usually requires a treaty between the two countries and is often a case more akin to transferring jurisdiction in a court case. I.e. you first escape to safe country A then went on to safe country B, as A was the first location escape to it is the proper venue to hear your claim of asylum. At least in theory.
Ironic, isn’t it that red states have no problem with the migrant population of (mostly) undocumented, and vastly underpaid (“the federal minimum wage is a too high”) migrant farm and factory workers that they require to keep their economy going tho.
I agree. That was then entire rationale for the order. That's not to say the laws and international agreements regarding asylum and refugees don't need a massive overhaul. We should be helping people when they face war, ethnic cleansing or massive human rights violations. But not because they want to seek a better life or dislike the local political environment. That's the role of ordinary immigration.
