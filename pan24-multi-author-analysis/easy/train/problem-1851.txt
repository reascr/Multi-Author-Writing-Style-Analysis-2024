In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Californian here. This is a great and wise comment. I’d like to see a real liberal party left of dems here. And the dems can hold center. Let the right wing keep regressing out of relevance and we’re set.
Statistics indicate otherwise. Californians are moving to other states at exactly the statistical rate you'd expect based on their population. And Texas is a large recipient due to their size and relative proximity. There is minimal indication of a conservative exodus. GOP ideas just suck both in California and nationwide. You can't run a successful, prolonged platform on "the opposite of what my opponents want".

California redistricting is not gerrymandered. It is done by an independent commission. Part of the problem the Republicans are having in California is that their “Trump” fraction has pretty much taken over the Party. Inland rural areas are very conservative but they represent a small share of the population. In coastal areas, GOP primaries are often battles to see who can be the most Far Right ideologue only to go on to the General Election and get no financial support and less than 25% of the vote.
