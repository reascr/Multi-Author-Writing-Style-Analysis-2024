Look. I already expect to get only half of what current retirees are getting when I can finally retire. I'd like to keep at least that much. Conservatives have tried everything to prevent or destroy social safety nets. Any plan they put forward is put forward with that as the end goal. They've been pretty open about that. The only thing they care about is your economic value. If you provide none ... like you're retired or chronically ill .. you can just go die to make room for the next serf.

Ah yes, Rick Scott, famously fiscally-responsible defender of the integrity of SSI, who definitely did not head a medical company as CEO while it committed massive SSI fraud, said he would have done something about it if he'd known there was a problem even though public annual stock reports clearly showed the problem, and then resigned as CEO mere months after the inquiry into his company became public. Hero of the people.
Every program that has used means testing to determine eligibility is used to eventually eliminate the program. Those politicians opposed to it use the means as the precedent then constantly move those requirements/penalties until they get the desired outcome. It's really not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things and you did pay into it whether you're a billionaire or lower class. Just pay out that 12, 15 hundred a month to everyone qho paid in. If you're lower class it's spend boosting the economy. If you're upper class you do what you do anyway, invest it or pass it on to your grandkids. But means testing is a mistake imho.
