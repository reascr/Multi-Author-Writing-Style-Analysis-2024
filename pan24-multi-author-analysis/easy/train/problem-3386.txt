As you said it is blessing in disguise because india has self imposed ban on some arms from everywhere and may remove or increase the ban depending on how much success india can become self reliant as Stated in the article otherwise about russian arms they aren't bad Russia strategy was.they went with war on ukraine with WW2 strategy while Ukraine were taught modern warfare strategy by us and europe.same is problem with India too though.and that should be India's biggest concern since china might also use same knowledge or may be not that different at best for india (nobody can tell how strong china is except probably india and Russia due to there joint military training) but even then china has advantage of technology not to mention they are merciless as proven in Galwan.
The same india sees with the Russia(other than quality of course) it is to diverse it's sources of weapons as hass been mentioned before now india will have to scramble for spare parts.which are harder to get in Russian predictament (it created itself).the best way to cope with this is to rely on your own industry but the problem with that too is that industry in it's baby form being asked to compete with adults.now india will diversify it's sources while trying to nurture it's own arms industry to never face problems like this.the problem is India's arm's industry is a baby that was borned way before but was neglected because we could get weapons from USSR my point is even if USA weapons are far far better now there is no guarantee and even if there is a guarantee we will be bound to US like we are bound to Russia currently.
Seen three on here already... Two posts just today. I do find them interesting and appreciate the info. The direction of the tone of some comments is a bit skewed in my opinion.
