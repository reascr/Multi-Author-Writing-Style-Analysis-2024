"Work 12-16 hours a day or leave". I get where Musk is coming from. It works at SpaceX. Problem with social media however is that software engineers... don't actually want to work on them THAT much. Facebook salaries are among the highest in the whole industry exactly because you know you are working on something unethical that will lead to people getting depressed or worse. Twitter is not as fucked but it's at most lukewarm, not "you can advance humanity" kind of cool. It might be an effective tactic to abuse H1B Visa owners but other people will just leave. And left they did - apparently Twitter is down to like 15% of original headcount. This number IS dangerous for it's sustainability. Especially since first people to quit are the ones with most skills. It was apparently also pretty unplanned since there are now whole departments just... gone. This reads like Musk overestimating himself and feels like a bad action all over.
Precisely. Twitter isn’t going anywhere. He isn’t going to break it up and he isn’t going to be able to walk away from his debt. It’s not like he’ll get better terms immediately after buying the company. It’s just non-sense at the moment.
