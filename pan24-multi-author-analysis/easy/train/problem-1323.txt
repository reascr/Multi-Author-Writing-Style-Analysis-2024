First off... tanks require A LOT of upkeep... US tanks use turbines, and UAF aren't keen on maintaining or repairing turbine engined vehicles. That they excell at is diesel maintenance and repair, which is why the Challenger is a better fit for UAF than the Abrams. Secondly, tanks are very thirsty and would require refueling 3 or 4x a day, which means added trucks and soldiers are needed to keep fuel in the tanks. The Bradley is an excellent choice as it ticks all the boxes... it's diesel, it's armored, it can kill tanks (pretty easily if the Gulf War is any indication) and engage infantry alike, and can carry a squad of heavily armed and thoroughly pissed off UAF soldiers in the back. They are more agile and maneuverable than a tank, as well as more fuel efficient. I would argue more Infantry Fighting Vehicles is what is needed. IFVs and self propelled artillery will punch right through the front line even without tanks, I have no doubt.
Escalating what? The Ukrainians want the Russian rapists, thieves and murderers out of their land. They're giving their lives to the freedom of their people and we're giving them a chance to fight.
