If they get public funding they should follow public rules. Number 1 no picking off the cream of the crop. When I went to high school De La Salle was running a national record football win streak. Was it the coaching or was it because all of the students were male so a public school with 2000 students half male is in the same category as a school with 2000 all male. Or was it because they could choose players from any high school in the area and they were competing against public schools that only enroll students from a certain area? It would be an amazing story if they failed but not that they do better. What if they have a lottery admissions policy and had to take their share of problem students and not get to recruit?
Opioids actually. We’ve never had a problem with crack or even heroine from what I recall from my time in Lexinon and just paying attention to local happenings. Opioids and extreme pot usage are regular though. Can’t even go to Kroger without smelling cheap skunk weed these days.
