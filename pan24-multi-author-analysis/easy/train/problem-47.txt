That’s not what literally - in the modern sense - means. You mean he implied it. Which is fine. Because the actual quote says he doesn’t mean the neo-nazi’s and white nationalists, that they should be condemned completely. So he literally condemned them. But maybe he dog whistled or whatever you want to say that he meant to say actually. Like meant the opposite of what he was saying. Or, argue that by proxy, any people standing in proximity with white nationalists and not actively fighting them are also white nationalists. Either way, it’s not “literally.” To keep summarizing it as such is as much a misinformation statement that the right is accused of doing.

Exactly. If anything it's strenhening thier support for him. It's sickening to think he has a very good chance of becoming president again if people start writing him off. It'll be 2016 all over again except so much worse.
