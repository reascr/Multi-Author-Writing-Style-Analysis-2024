One of the incredible things about cougars to me is how much they resemble a house cat. Mountain lions don't really look like African lions at all, other than being solid colored. The "small cat" design is just scaled up to leopard size, so the proportions of their faces, bodies, and habits resemble "big cats" but those features still look like "small cats": big eyes, big pointy ears, kind of a sweet expression, a profile without the big cat underbite-looking chin. And they purr and meow, and unlike panthera cats who grasp their food to eat it and often lie on their sides to do it, cougars crouch over their kill like a house cat at a food dish. Beautiful and scary. Instead of making me want a pet cougar, it points out how much sense it makes that a small cat was domesticated instead of a big one. A labrador-sized cat would not only be dangerous, but also more expensive to feed than a dog, since cats' diet require a much higher concentration of meat. A small cougar requires 15 lbs of meat per day.
Yesterday's muckrakers are today's Netflix documentarians. Legislation is rarely passed because it's a good thing to do. It takes widespread public agitation to get something into the spotlight and convince legislators that it's worth the time and political capital to pass a law. In the past you did that with newspapers. Now you do it with Netflix.
Interesting list. That is all of Panthera plus cougars, which makes sense. Though not "Big Cats", cougars are big cats. Interesting they don't include cheetahs. They too aren't "Big Cats", they are about comparable in size to a snow leopard.
