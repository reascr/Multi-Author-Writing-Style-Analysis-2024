I actually logged into my nelnet account to show him what my interest rates are on my loans. His jaw dropped when he saw it’s more than twice as much as the interest rate on his mortgage. I told him how much I actually borrowed versus how much I owe now because of interest (spoiler: I owe more now than I owed when I graduated). He was outraged on my behalf but had what he thinks would’ve been a brilliant solution. He told me my husband should’ve used the very small business he has to apply for a big PPP loan which I could’ve then used to pay off the student loan debt, and then the PPP loan would’ve been forgiven later and all would be well.
Outstanding. Some smarter monsters would run against it, but then never actually do anything to remind the voters who hated their position. Not these fools. They intend to remind young voters every day for 2 years what pricks they are.
Congressman. Where were you when you found out that Joe Biden wanted to help with student debt relief? I would remind the gentleman from California that he is under oath.
