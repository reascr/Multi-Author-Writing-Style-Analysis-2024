It doesn’t matter, everything this guy just said is 100% correct. There is a hard water system used by one country that cannot produce fissile uranium and that’s Canada. Virtually any country with a modern style (1960 +) nuclear reactor can create a nuclear weapon within a month perhaps even a few weeks. It’s why no country ever makes nukes because if they actually needed them they could be created quickly, and there is only two sides to be on (I guess 3 with China). So your on a side that would protect you with their nukes which is just M.A.D. anyway.
Regarding chronology of the wars with Israel, I already used time posting it here in the thread, its in one of the comments next to yours, im gonna refrain from repeating it, suffice to say the narrative of an innocent Israel is completely unbelievable with the current historical sources available, of course western schools are largely at fault for deciminating propaganda instead of history, leaving many people dumbfounded when it comes to this subject.
No. They had Colin Powell talk about it. Saddam caused 9/11 and it was mission accomplished in like a couple of weeks.
