The old trump playbook. Keep telling us charges and indictments are two weeks away. Meanwhile the Jan. 6th committee is about to release all of their evidence they’ve collected over the years that will fall on deaf ears because the democrats have allowed a Republican takeover of the house. Now, instead of prosecuting the man who turned more people against our country than any previous president, we will hear nonstop wailing about fucking Hunter Biden’s laptop while people are still being shot at in clubs because of the hateful rhetoric coming out of the MAGA/GQP world. Fun times.
Undoubtedly the legal justice system in America is the most inefficient unreliable arm of our governmental system and must be fixed or we won’t see another 250 years as a civilized society.
How do we know? Because Trump, a private citizen, was caught with top secret documents including nuclear secrets that he swore he did not have and you still don't believe he's guilty. Are you expecting to be able to read these top secret documents yourself to verify his guilt?
