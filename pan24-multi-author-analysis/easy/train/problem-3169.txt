So they say just as they did in 2016 but ultimately they saw the way the party voters were turning and went with him. His cabinet and administration were stacked with Koch cronies, his Supreme Court picks came from a list drawn up by the Koch-funded Federalist Society based on attendance at Koch-funded seminars at the Antonin Scalia School of Law at the Koch-controlled George Mason University, and the core policies of the administration were straight from the Koch to-do list.
Progress goes in waves, two steps forward, one step back. Republicans already do gerrymandering and tricks to win elections, it won't work forever. Progressive movement will in time get upper hand, and the GOP won't be able to dismantle progress in the same pace it develops. Strong institutions and systems can survive periods of idiot leaders. If progressives give up on changing things because GOP dismantles it every chance they get, one can just as well give up. Progress is a long struggle.
