i did read news, where there was a minister recently died suddenly, maybe its this country. we'll at least they're still in one piece. for everyone, reason, will to survive is different. i believe not many will choose the harder path. & outcome of Ukraine choosing same path as Belarus. have to see what happens.
"I am saying this absolutely sincerely: with all the difficulties, if the Russian Federation—the leadership—wants to build relations with the sovereign independent state of Belarus, if Russia perceives us as a sovereign and independent state but a very close one, very reliable, where everything Russian—from the language to Russian traditions—is venerated, we are ready to build the relations," Lukashenko said Friday. "Yet we should always proceed from the premise that we are a sovereign and independent state.".
And if you think that you are a "free man", then i have to remind you, that in all countries government dictate you when you can have sex and alcohol, some forbid sexual services (here, in Ukraine you will be jailed for having onlyfans), most forbid taking various substances to feel better, and only few countries allow medically assisted suicide. Also if you will come live here, in Ukraine, you will have mandatory military service as a man, and you won't even be able to leave the country until the war is over. Your body is not yours, it belongs to the government, that are free to tell you what you can do with it and what you cannot, when and how you need to die for their interests, and if you refuse - welcome to the cage, you will live in it for the rest of your live, because people who want to be really free must be isolated from the society.
Do I? Most people aren't heroes. They'd lay down, adapt or flee rather than take the hopeless fight. You'll come to realize that once you get through that youthful idealism phase of yours.
