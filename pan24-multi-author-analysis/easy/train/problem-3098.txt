In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Absolutely. Joel Osteen and his wife (and his congregation for that matter) make a big deal of "we do not take any salary from the church", and implying that all their money comes from his books (which no doubt add a good chunk).
Routinely? It's been a constant for decades. Megachurches have seen evangelical conartists become millionaires all in the name of God and with the tax code helping them rip off their cult and the country. Mormons and Catholics etc all sit on massive amounts of wealth. Evangelical churches are where Christian nationalists are finding allies because these religious figures are literally using their sermons to preach hate, bigotry, lies, and are breaking the law by using their positions and churches to push right-wing politics. They're literally speaking about democrats being evil, doing harm to LBGT community, and pushing whatever FOX talking points that week there are. Separation of church and state has been under attack since at least the 50s so this isn't some surprise or post Trump reality. Google an Evangelical group referred to as The Family or watch the Netflix documentary and see how far their reach goes and how far back they've pulling the levers of influence, not only in the US, but globally with world leaders for decades. The Christian right isn't just trying to influence what happens here but worldwide. God is power and money and never fckn forget that.
