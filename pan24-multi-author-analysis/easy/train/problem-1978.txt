I’m starting to wonder if pretty much everyone would be able to get reparations. One of my ancestors was an indentured servant. Pretty sure, 90% of the population can prove relation to some persecuted in the past. I think the best we can do is move forward, stop profiling people, give everyone the same chance… we all bleed red and piss yellow(though does depend on how hydrated you are… so the clearer is probably better). Politicians do not have their constituents in mind They look out for themselves We should bond over that and work to replace most of them! Maybe I’m delusional. Sorry.
The only part that makes sense is the part about education related to the witch trials, which would be great and hopefully it will include info about the trials across Europe (and elsewhere really) to show the commonalities across cultures where these things happen and why.
Yeah. It's like...if we have the time, resources, and drive to make good on all the bs that's been done over the centuries - great! But how about we prioritise lol.
