This is the answer. It's not about being rational. They don't care about the meaning of words and, in fact, relish in the notion that we are not only listening to what they're saying, but giving time and attention and a spotlight to it as we critique it. They spout nonsense and, in our attempts to dismantle it, we give it a platform. They don't care about being accurate, they care about spreading their words to as many ears as possible, and it sticks to dumb people, so they don't care about the "nuance" of correctness since they just need to amass idiots who will follow and vote like good little cattle. For fascism to succeed, they need a large population of followers who don't think critically, and they need an "other" to blame for the shortcomings of the followers. When the words they use to identify the "others" has virtually no meaning because they're just codewords, it allows for idiot followers to fill in the gaps with whatever they want. It could be immigrants, Jews, LGBTQ+, northerners, young people, vegans, starbelly sneeches, black people, women, "beta" males, etc. It's similar to the way that young adult novels tend to be fairly nondescript regarding the protagonist so that a large number of readers can import their personality onto that character to identify with them more. Anybody with critical thinking sees through the illusion, but their target demographic is people who fall for it and want to maintain that illusion, so the fact that it's an illusion is irrelevant.
Seriously? This gets Republicans upset? Selling $99 digital trading cards? Yet most of them are cool with the Big Lie and the January 6th insurrection? What sort of bizarro world do we live in?
