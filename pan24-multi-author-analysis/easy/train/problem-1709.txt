I really appreciate your story! It is hard to speak up for people who are looked down upon in any situation, especially one in which you are publicly shamed for doing the right thing, and made to feel like the bad one for doing so. I try to live in the same way as you’ve described, often standing up for people who need to be spoken for, and sometimes failing to live up to it. I have no children, but my fiancé and I will soon, and I’ve given some serious thought to how I want to raise them in the absence of religion. I feel like standing up to those in need, as well as universal respect (not just for the powerful, but, for example, for the people who raise and prepare the food we buy for a low wage) will be fundamental parts of this. Even if that sham of a youth pastor tried to put you down then, your message probably resonated with more people than you know who needed to hear that, but didn’t feel they could speak up themselves. Young me would have been happy to hear from someone like you.
Historically? Well what about currently? Because currently governments are vastly better at educating large volumes of people than charities.
