I’m half Ukrainian and I was last in Kyev in 2018 before that 2014 before that 2010 before that 2008 before that I lived in Черновцах as an infant. Your description makes it appear as if you’re going into some dark cave where the only light source is candles and everything is very mystic and surreal whereas I found it to be way more mainstream and touristy. Basically you’re over-exaggerating.
But as a whole, the Church is not some Russian proxy. It is difficult to communicate the severity of their breaking with the Moscow Patriarchate back in May. Now they will need to figure out what to do vis a vis the Kievan Patriarchate (status conferred, controversially, in 2018 by Constantinople). Will there be a reconciliation? Continued schism? Who knows.
If such raids continue it could easily turn into large scale religious persecution against anyone who doesn't believe ukraine is perfect, we already see similar effects on a smaller scale here on Reddit, all who are not fully 100% supporting ukraine on all things or even criticising some of their actions are downvoted into oblivion.
What are you talking about? And lol at Russian population in Ukraine. That's like telling the Latvians, Estonians etc about their Russian population. Those Russians got there via depopulation and genocide of the citizens and then importing Russians in. Like they did in Crimea, Eastern Ukraine, tried to do in Kherson etc. No wonder they all ran from Kherson and Kharkiv once the Ukrainians retook their land because that shit may have worked decades ago but not now.
