Biden should step aside when the time comes and let someone else run. He did better than expected in the midterms, but I don't think he can beat DeSantis in 2024, and that's all that matters.If he steps aside he can go out on top. He doesn't seem like he'll be fit to be President in 2024. Aging is hard, but it's a part of life.
Absolutely incorrect. It predicts it in many conceivable ways. If you can't get a lot of people out to support you in the primary, it will be much harder to make them magically appear in the general.
Exactly. Biden has a real good shot to remain president. The Democratic party pushing him out would make them just as much a circus as the Republicans and would really backfire.
Exactly. If Biden can't take out DeSantis in the general, then no one can. I still think it's more likely to see Trump as the nominee. DeSantis isn't much better than Cruz was in 2015 and Trump mopped the floor with him. And don't think that will make the democrats life easier, any voter that's going GOP isn't gonna stay home cuz of Trump, they'll vote Trump cuz at worst the democrats won't get anything and they may get court nominees in.
