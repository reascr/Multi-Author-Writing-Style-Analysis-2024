Its not so much a question of facts as a question of emphasis. The history taught in high school (I graduated within the last 10 years) is overwhelmingly negative towards America and chooses to emphasizes its flaws. You could certainly write factually accurate histories of america that recognizes its flaws but emphasizes its strenhs. What subjective narrative you construct is far more important to how people will understand history than the objective set of facts that you use In the long run a negative understanding of the relationship between individuals and their community will destroy national solidarity without which the US will devolve deeper into vicious infighting and eventually civil war. Some feeling of national community and respect towards minimal political norms based on an idealistic view of american democracy is to me probably the only thing that holds back America's ideological factions from a viscous and eventually deadly power struggle which will destroy the country.
Get this bum out of the news cycle. He doesn’t need any press - it just feeds his agenda for free. Did journalists learn nothing from Trmp’s sensational manipulation?
That is why it is a very dangerous word. It is designed for one thing only and that is to dehumanize groups and make them targets for the inquisition.

Not particularly surprising right-wing media is particularly vapid and counter-productive. I don't really like the right. I don't want kids to be taught to hate their country and I don't really think kids should talk about sexual identity prior to 5th guard but I also not interested in going around banning books or not letting people make their own sexual decisions.
