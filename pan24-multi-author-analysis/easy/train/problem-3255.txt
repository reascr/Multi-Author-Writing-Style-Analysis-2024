I kind of empathize. The Democratic party is in a hard place with this. Every time they push back against the crazy, they get called out for woke-ism and the GOP uses this to push its culture war even further. Then the media perpetuates it, regardless of if it's Fox or more "liberal" mainstream outlets. What it comes down to is that media is not the friend of Democrats and is the friend of the GOP, and it's very difficult to get around that. I don't know how they effectively argue this except in live town hall meetings to people who are already politically conscious, which is only a very small percent of the electorate.
Exactly. It will never be enough. They will only be happy when we cease existing. I'm not going back in the closet. I'm not going to stop being me. I am who I am.
that's an interesting organization. I've read that they're good at walking the line and tempting their opposition over that same line at which point they sue and make bank. According to the article I read it's a business for them.
