Ukraine is different as it is under attack by a foreign power and the U.S. was asked for assistance by the elected government. I believe it's a righteous cause and has the dual effect of weakening a historical adversary and also strenhening American soft power in Ukraine, among NATO allies, and with western-aligned neutral nations. An argument could be made that Ukraine's breakaway oblasts would constitute an internal struggle that the U.S. should not be involved with but I disagree. Those conflicts were largely supported by and instigated by the Russian government who assisted a loud minority.
Bro. In august 2013, the US released classified documents that admitted to not only planning, but being in charge of the planning and execution. I don’t know how that is up for debate.
“All of China’s neighbors love them because they are peaceful and not using their economy and military to bully them into submission - anything you hear like this is just Vietnamese, Philippine, South Korean and Malaysian imperialist propaganda”.
Nah. If we have to go, I'd rather we hold out long enough to create A.I. that's smart enough to assess the situation and determine we need to go.
