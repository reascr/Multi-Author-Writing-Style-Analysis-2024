For me, I was split between a freak accident (the Russians shot down an airline after all) and a test of provocation. It would not be the first time Putin has done something small to test out what peoples responses would be.
Exactly. They basically tried to leverage the deaths of 2 innocent people to make political capital before any facts were known.
Zelensky? In no time i saw some posts on reddit saying that us intelligence knew it was a Russian rocket.
Absolutely not. I do not want Ukranians or Russians to die. Life is most precious and valuable. I pray that all of this is resolved soon. But there must be justice and rule of law. No country should be a bully to any other.
responsibility for investigation was delegated to the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) and the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), who concluded that the airliner was downed by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine. According to the JIT, the Buk that was used originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash, fired from a field in a rebel-controlled area and the launch system returned to Russia afterwards.
True. But what was the initial cause of Ukraine firing the missile? It was in defence of a Russian strike. And it was only a matter of time until this war spilled across borders. Russia blames Ukraine, Ukraine blames Russia. Thankfully, Poland and NATO are still level-headed and not quick to escalate the situation with reckless speech.
