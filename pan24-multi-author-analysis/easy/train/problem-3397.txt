I feel you, this week I hit a new level of depressed. Hung out with my parents & sister for the first time since Christmas. Went to church with them, got lunch, it was almost nice, then they starting complaining about the "terrible progressive liberals" with me right there, knowing I'm pretty liberal. The amount of hate & ignorance they displayed was so depressing. Then my dad said he knows his political views are aligned with God because the progressive liberals want all humans to be dead and have the planet free of us, but God told mankind to have "dominion over the earth". It was just a new level of low for them, and sooooooo fucking stupid too. I guess conservative media is telling them all liberals want them dead so the environment can be better, not surprised Fox News is pitching that, but the fact that my family buys into it.... so sad, I think they are fully lost at this point. They were well educated and mild mannered people, were....
Incredible. You’d think he would give up after the first flub, but he just had to double back. It’s so fascinating to me that they are so afraid of expressing anything approaching contrition that they find themselves having to butcher incredibly well known idioms when they recognize what they are about to say. Thanks for the clip.
