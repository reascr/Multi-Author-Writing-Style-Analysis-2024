Now I know not everyone has been paying that long but I can guarantee you that the money made off of student loan borrowers is still greater than the amount this would cost. Government should not be making money off bettering their citizens. I know Republicans think the dumbing down of society is great and all but in practice it's going to destroy our country in the long run and I don't even mean like 100 years, I mean like 15 to 20. We're already experiencing doctor and nursing shortages. You want engineer shortages too? Have fun in those buildings. Florida had military personnel teaching classes because nobody wants to teach there. You think Florida will bat an eye when a buildings start collapsing because people didn't know what they were doing? Forget about it!
I would have loved to have had any understanding of the long-lasting implications of taking on the student debt I took on when I went to College, when I didn't even care about going to College, I was just a kid who had been told his entire life he had to go to College, and College prep and applications was just a thing I was marched through by literally every adult in my life.
