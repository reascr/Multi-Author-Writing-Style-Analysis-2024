Not fictional at all. Look into almost any of the so called conflicts in Africa and there are mercenary forces employed to protect profits from the sale of natural resources. Often foreign or foreign led forces which will terrorize any public opposition leaders or protestors. They're above the law and know it. They are typically working under the euphemism of security forces and it's rarely a topic of western media. The Spice must flow, and we love low prices and don't care about people far away. Especially if they aren't "white.".
This law isn't so much to protect service members, but rather specifically to protect George W. Bush and members of his administration (and later Obama and later Trump) from the ICC, as there was fairly widespread belief after multiple wars of profit in the early/mid 2000s that he or members of the administration would never be able to travel outside of the USA again for fear of being arrested and tried at the ICC. So this law was put on the books to allow members of the Executive to travel and be part of the global community without having to worry about facing consequences of their wars for profit. If we had a service member arrested for war crimes and tried at the ICC we'd certainly just leave them there.
It definitely doesn't have an exclusively/historically sexual meaning. You're taking it very literally.
