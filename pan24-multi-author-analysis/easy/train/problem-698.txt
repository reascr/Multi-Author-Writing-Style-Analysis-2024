Trust me that only sounds good till you have food shortages. I don't think we should mess up with food prod that rather work. Keeping a production surplus only seem like a safer idea to me than risking hunger at the first bad years and international incidents pilling up on it (re grain stuck in ua that sent prices skyrocketing in some other countries. But we had stock to regulate, here.).
Additionally, the rice paddies provide an opportunity for aquaculture. Carp and Thai Barb are traditionally raised in these paddies, but one can also raise crawfish, tilapia, fresh water prawns, and such. Fish can and will feed off of bugs that fall into the water, helping with pest control, and their waste works with the nitrogen cycle to help replenish any lost nitrogen in the soil/water column for the rice plants to use. Crawfish and freshwater prawns feed off of dead and decaying matter on the floor, to help decompose and recycle the nutrients back into the soil/water column. Crawfish are also a highly sought after freshwater seafood for some cultures (crawfish are fucking tasty!) this source helps reduce the pressure on native populations.
