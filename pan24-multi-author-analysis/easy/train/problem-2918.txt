"Russia is willing to negotiate" only if they get to keep half of Ukraine and make the rest a puppet state of Russia. That is their inalienable starting point. A serious starting point for negotiations would be to first remove all Russian military from the entire country of Ukraine, including Crimea; then they can start to negotiate over war reparations and prosecution of war criminals.
Jfc do you not have google? Russia has about 14% of the world's gas supply. That's an insane amount. Look at the size and placement of russia on a map and you'll se why they have these resources. It would take you 5 minutes to google. The reason we didn't start off with numbers is that we expect people to have this basic knowledge. Even my 13 year old knows this.
As much as this is discussed, India really was lagging behind china and Europe, and in this situation, both India and China set the terms, so that's definitely not favourable for Russia, so I can see this move being a way to win Europe's favour in some way, obviously it doesn't look like it's gonna work out for them.
You are correct. Not sure why I thought Serbia was in the EU, probably from some half-remembered watching of their positioning/candidacy when I was in school.
