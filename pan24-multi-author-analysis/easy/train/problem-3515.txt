$3.1 billion in funding to be divided by states that sign on, local governments, and tribes. The vast majority of the funding must be used to provide treatment and recovery services to people struggling with opioid use disorder.
The proposed multistate settlement will provide more than $3 billion in funding, the vast majority of which will go to communities across the nation to help fight the opioid crisis. The agreement also contains significant injunctive relief, including increased oversight, and improvements to Walmart pharmacies' policies and procedures regarding opioids.
