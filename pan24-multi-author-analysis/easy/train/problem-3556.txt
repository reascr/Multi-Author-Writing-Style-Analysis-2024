Lol, this is an hilariously bad take. The US military has been in Ukraine since at least 2014 building up and preparing the Ukrainian forces specifically for this war and Zelensky was groomed for the role he's in. Even the Canadian army has been training Ukrainian soldiers for the better part of a decade. Trump was impeached for trying to interfere with American preparations for this war, all the BS about Hunter Bidens laptop was actually about javelin missiles. The Russians first surprise when they invaded was being contested or denied airspace thanks to air defense hardware and doctrine courtesy of their American patrons. On day one of the invasion amazon and starlink were already in Ukraine backing up government systems to the cloud and distributing satellite internet terminals. The west was NOT hoping for Ukraine to capitulate, I don't know how it's even possible to believe that, there's an abundance of evidence that looks more like the west was laying a trap for Russia all along.
Unfortunately it doesn’t actually work. It would be very satisfying, but it’s a huge strategic mistake.
