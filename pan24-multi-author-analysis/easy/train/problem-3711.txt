LOL. I do like the idea of President Biden putting VP Harris in a larger role that the media can see her doing positive things. Sort of like her speech yesterday in Tallahassee which seems to have tipped the scales and brought the Florida Supreme Court to rule on how it does or doesn't violate the Privacy Clause in the Florida Constitution. The nation needs to see more of her working on different issues. So often VP's are always in the background, rarely seen or acknowledged.
Exactly. Bernie is older than Biden and an Independent. He’s only a democrat when running for president. Expecting Enough democrats to vote for him nationally will never happen. His supporters really need to get behind someone else who can actually win a national election. Problem is they aren’t even trying and keep leaning on Bernie or others like AOC, who also is not liked nationally outside of far left circles.
Exactly. It's also such a stupid tactical decision. Quit pulling punches. Abortion and body autonomy are incredibly popular. Red state lunatics shouldn't be pandered to.
