Good idea. Zelenskyy knows Putin doesn't really want to negotiate, he just wants to offer shit terms and do some posturing. If its public, it shows Putin didn't do it in good faith.
How interesting. It'd be good if peace was negotiated. Everyone can save face. Finally, you can still pump Ukraine with finances and arms, and turn it into a second poland and probably stave off war for another decade or two or longer. Basically like Korea.
Trade they don't need anyways. Staying in Ukraine is the only rational option for him. To say otherwise is foolish.
Once Russia has paid for the rebuilding of Ukraine and compensated families of those raped and murdered then there will probably be a lifting of some sanctions but after the way Russia stole all the leased aircraft and 'nationalised' a lot of European and American businesses there will still be a lot of industry sectors that won't want anything to do with Russia for decades.
Winning? Its a glorified stalemate. It will take them a decade to take everything back at this rate.
