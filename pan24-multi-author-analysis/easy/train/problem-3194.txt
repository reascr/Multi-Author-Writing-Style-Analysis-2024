The very same group that "brought" stability post-communism is the same cabal of scum who bought up all the factories and state run institutions from the state for pennies (I am not joking or exaggerating for effect when I say pennies) and plunged the country into chaos in the first place. Maybe not Putin personally, but undoubtedly people in his cabinet and lackies. You don't just become so rich as him without being involved in that kind of shit. And his idea of bringing stability is visiting "underperforming" factories and businesses to dictate to them who to hire and what to do. On camera. Broadcasted to the serfs, so they can see how big vlad is on their side apparently. The same exact shit happened in my own country after the fall of communism as well except the PR strongman bullshit. Yet they blame "democracy" and the oh-so-wicked west for something they did to their own people out of greed and a lust for continued power.
Five generations? Try five centuries. This kind of attitude goes back to the time of the Tsars, specifically Ivan IV, or better known as Ivan the Terrible.
