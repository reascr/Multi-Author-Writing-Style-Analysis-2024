Spot on. I’d also add that’s been made worse by the new Twitter blue “innovation”. It’s become exhausting for the user to check and work out who is a legitimate verified source and who is some shmuck that paid $8. More often than not the former is buried under loads of the latter.
“Misinformation” has just been Nancy Pelosis fancy word for “We don’t want you to believe this” IE hunter Biden a laptop, or “this never happened” IE Ukraine used a Russian missile and “accidentally” fired it into Poland, then knowing it was theirs said it was Russian so they would hopefully start WW3, misinformation is absolute bullshit when one political party is attempting to control what is and isn’t misinformation when they have been repeatedly wrong on it.
Did you? Every message Twitter was asked to take down was a Hunter Biden dick pic. It would have been illegal to say no, whether it was Hunter or Trump's dick.
Content moderation will work slightly differently. Maybe Musk will be more open about certain policies than Twitter was previously. Maybe Twitter will have a sightly less progressive base. But, overall, most people will continue to use the platform as usual and non-US users will largely be unaffected by all the drama.
