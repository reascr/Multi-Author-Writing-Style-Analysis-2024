I think saying it's what is preferred is a huge and unfair leap of logic. Uprisings are hugely risky to those who participate in them, and Russia has shown itself to be very good and smashing dissent. People aren't going to rise if they think they're likely to lose and face a firing squad for it. There needs to be critical mass, which is difficult to guage when expressing dissent nets a jail term. Until the army or intelligence services perpetrate a coup or conditions worsen so much that staring down the barrel of a gun is preferable to the status quo a popular uprising is an unrealistic prospect regardless of how much people in the country hate living under Putin.
Guess what genius. One can be opposed to the Iraq war, and Russias genocide in Ukraine. One doesn't preclude the other.
With looming food/water resource strife due to climate change and general environmental collapse, i'd say, based on human history, it's most likely that the largest nations will begin tearing the small ones apart and engaging in levels of genocide not seen since the Mongols devastated what is now Iran.
