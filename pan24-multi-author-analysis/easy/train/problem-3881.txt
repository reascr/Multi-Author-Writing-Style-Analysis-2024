Yes—- but the test isn’t fair— like the avg European can’t point out Maryland on a map either. Our continent happens to just have 3 countries. If the Europeans had to name individual states on these world geography quizzes, I doubt they’d fair quite as well. Plus cultural export plays a huge role. Like what’s the last Albanian sitcom you watched? The last Moldovan band you listened to? We’d do better if these place left more of mark on our psyche ya know? And the poorer Eurasian & n African countries do do that in Western Europe. Plus the world is so far away for most Americans. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve known who have never been able to afford a trip further than Florida. There is no gap year for American kids etc. ya know? So yeah we do worse.but (imo), it’s not an entirely fair reflection.
Really? Cmon do we have to involve dumbass politics here? I get you are trying to make a joke, but time and place my friend. To me, this is basically achieving the holy grail of science fiction, or at least a major step towards it. Lets talk about that, its way more interesting than Putins limp dick BS.
