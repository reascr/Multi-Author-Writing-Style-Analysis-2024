Money up top isn't just about living a comfortable lifestyle or having decently nice things, it's about the ability to wield influence and holding power, a social structure based on being more or less wealthy than the other guy, and not just having "nice" things but rare things. The social structure varies depending on how much money you have. Just having the money itself really isn't what matters, because everyone in your circle has that money. At that point, you need other ways to put yourself up top. Networking and power.
