You must account for the logic that one plane has limited missiles to fire, most of those missiles are anti-aircraft, genius, and they are by far from "many" as compared to the very numerous literally-named "Aircraft Killer" missiles with much longer range on mainland China.
>Not plenty more by any means, and if the first two are incapacitated or sunk, then the others, with their same lack of range of effect compared to the more numerous anti-ship missiles with very much more range than American carrier-based aircraft from mainland China aren't going to do a damn thing. You are living a lie.
Russia being insecure doesn't justify occupying another country. Nobody cares if aggressors claim that something is justified. It's only for them and the result is a disaster in this example.
Exactly. USA carrier aircraft, at best, have less much less that one-third the range of Chinese anti-ship missiles, they would not even be able to make it back to an attacked/damaged/sunken carrier, not to mention the very fact that the carrier-based aircraft largely carry anti-aircraft missiles, which mostly does nothing in this given scenario.
