Hey, maybe God isn’t so perfect and is ultimately the one seeking forgiveness - a deeply sacrilegious sentiment of mine I’ve often considered. Or, more likely, the religion changed with the times. A loving God became more popular than a smiting one. But with that transition comes a change in how God’s powers were represented. Less on-earth punishment, more focus on your actions in this life receiving judgment in the next. More miracles, less smiting. But even those miracles become somewhat smaller in scope - no pillars of fire, or falling walls of Jericho. Now it’s centred mostly on Jesus, with the multiplying of loaves and fishes, curing disease and the occasional death, a little walking on water and tiret returning from his own death. All of these are helpful miracles, with the only exception I can think of being the blighting of the fig tree - a bit of a step down from locusts and endless night.
