In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Humorous article. As if neo-Nazi DeSantis is more moral or less corrupt than trump. As if Pence isn’t driven by his insatiable lust for power, much stronger than his lust for Mother, and hellbent on inflicting a draconian hellscape on the American people with his fanatical, hateful, intolerant, bigoted ‘religious’ feelings. As if these Evangelical charlatans aren’t really just money-worshiping, power-seeking leeches on the most needy and vulnerable people in society. Of course they will dump with their useful idiot and align themselves with a less ignorant but more evil wannabe dictator.
Exactly. Christians should take a hard look at why their pews are emptying all over America. Right now they want to point fingers and blame others, but the church itself is the problem, and not just specific sects or denominations. The whole church. Every Christian.
