“Addiction” results from “repeatedly seeking pleasure” involving chemicals that are not biologically part of the human body, resulting in the hijacking of the human dopamine system and a resulting physical dependence on chemicals the human body does not produce.”.
No, it's not a lie. And you can find many discussions for it in the industry. TikTok will show you what's popular, even if none of your friends posted it.
I would like to point out one thing: TikTok's one-click-clip is not a social network. You never see other people's comments, you don't see friends' content. (In theory you could, but in reality that is not the case).
Addiction involves withdrawl. That’s a chemical condition that can kill you. If I kidnap a porn addict and an alcoholic and tie them to chairs in a basement the porn addict is going to be annoyed, the alcoholic could die.
If a porn addict robs a gas station for porn money they stuck a gun in someone’s face because they can’t help that they want to feel happy.
