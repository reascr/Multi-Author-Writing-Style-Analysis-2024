Lenin's own rise to power came from a civil war between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, who argued on this very point. The Mensheviks were populists wanting to bequeath direct control of the transition to the workers. The Bolsheviks thought differently, forming around the idea of a "bourgeois intelligentsia" that would function as a benevolent upper class of revolutionary leaders. Obviously, this doesn't really jive well with a classless society.
Economically, yes. Belarus and Russia have somewhat consistently relied on each other both politically and economically. Belarus’ wealth comes largely from refining oil and sending it into the EU. Sanctions bit and now both countries see an opportunity to merge economies, supposedly whilst holding onto Belarusian sovereignty. The future will tell, but it’s likely that most big businesses in Belarus will be ‘absorbed’ rather than a loss of territory or movement into the Russian Federation. A single currency might even begin, which would be wildly unpopular as most Belarusians save in dollars and consider the ruble on either side as unstable.
