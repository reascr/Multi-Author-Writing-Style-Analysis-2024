Even if DeSantis doesn’t win the fact that you have a party with so many voters thinking a DeSantis or even a Trump which more Republicans have said would no longer be their first choice but they would vote for given the choice between him and a Democrat is a problem. Hell Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the Governor of Arkansas and her very first act as governor was to outlaw the term LatinX. Her response to Biden’s State Of The Union was to talk about people not being able to tell the difference between a man and a women. There was plenty before she won based on the fact she was Trumps press secretary to know what she would be like. Granted Arkansas may not be the model for the country when it comes to voters but this is a movement that has way to much voter approval if you ask me.
