I think so. Maybe all losses are deductible so I hope the IRS zeros in on the losses, because they’re HUGE Enough lii out she’s that great pays very little in taxes. The TAX CODE was written to favor the rich It needs a complete redo. If there was a flat rate for taxes and no deductions allowed, the deficit would be gone in a short amount of time. Make companies pay taxes on the billions they are making in profit. That way the wealth goes in the Federal coffers, and is redistributed to the social programs like Universal Healthcare, free college, better roads, bridges, and subways, libraries, schools, etc. We have our own Oligarchs right here in the US. They need to pay a lot more in taxes because the middle class will not be able to keep the US afloat. We’re paying too much for politicians in office too! Where in the entire world can a person armed ONLY with a high school diploma earn a base salary of $174,000 a year. Think of George Santos, MTG, or Lauren Boebert who didn’t graduate from high school but got a GED instead. We need to change the requirements for candidates, and require a vetting process for anyone running for public office. We need to change the laws to eliminate former felons from ever holding public office. There should be a morals clause for every politician and the right for voters to recall an elected official that is found guilty of a crime that proves a lack of morals.
