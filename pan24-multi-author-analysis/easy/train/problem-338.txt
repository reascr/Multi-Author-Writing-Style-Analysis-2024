Davis' example does not excuse the republican party of becoming a neo-nazi party. Republicans are allowing this to happen or are actively making it happen. They can choose to kick the nazis out, they can choose to make a new party without nazis, or they can accept that they are now a nazi party. Saying that republicans allow nazis but republicans are "really" "trying" to change them is not an answer, it is an excuse for belonging to a nazi party.
When you are at a place or in a party that is welcoming and inviting nazis, the only moral choices are to demand the nazis leave or leaving yourself. Saying nothing and continuing to identify and associate with that party is to tacitly endorse and be complicit in that parties associations and promotions.
