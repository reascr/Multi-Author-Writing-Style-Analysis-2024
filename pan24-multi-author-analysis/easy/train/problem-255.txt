It’s going to mean they knuckle down and get to work on bullshit, taxpayer-dollar-wasting investigations of Hunter Biden’s dick pics, pointless committees and investigations designed to make the Biden admin look bad in any way possible, and other similar nonsense.
As for schools? demand parents have more of a hand in the curriculum by convincing them things are being taught that aren't. Despite the curriculum for public schools is completely available online and from the admin, most teachers don't have a lot of room to alter it without consequences. You do all of this knowing that the people who will be most likely to go all in are the religious and poorly educated. Gas them up to run for previously apolitical positions like superintendant and school board. Eventually you'll have enough hands on enough levers to start reforming the system to the point that it becomes an obvious and abject failure. Privatize it, and subsidize religious schools with taxpayer money by making the "free" secular schools offered bad enough that even non christians will send their kids. All it's going to do is make segregated schools with extra steps, but most of the poor religious parents that are falling for this shit don't realize their kids will end up in the poor school too.
