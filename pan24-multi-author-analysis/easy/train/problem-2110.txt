Indeed; Biden could have done the right thing and stood with labor, allowing the people operating critical infrastructure to have some sick days, UNPAID, and greatly boosted people's views of the party and brought out more union endorsements in 2024.... all with the unwanted consequences of a single-digit hit to the net profits of a handful of railroad barons.
Instead Biden protected those profits by destroying all bargaining power rail unions had and forcing a contract with no sick days on people who voted it down, in disgraceful betrayal that ended the pro-union claims of the party and showed his true colors as a servant of the elite.
My point is.. he was wrong. That doesn't mean he is anti-union or a president bad for labor movements. This nuance needs to be understood. As a whole, he has been a positive advocate for labor movements.
Really? Seems more like "I'll claim I'm your friend but stab you in the back the minute you actually risk impacting anything other than yourselves; I support unions so long as they don't hold any bargaining power beyond self-immolation; also even a tiny expenditure of political capital is too much to ask.".
