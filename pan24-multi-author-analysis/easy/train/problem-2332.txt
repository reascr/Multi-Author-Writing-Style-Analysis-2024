I have to imagine she has been through an extreme amount of bullying. Ted seems to enjoy getting dunked on, is always in the news for idiotic reasons, so imagine your embarrassing dad, except your embarrassing dad makes the national news at least once a month, add a heavy dose of social media. That age of your life is universally brutal in my opinion even without having Ted as your dad. I really feel bad for her, and I hope she gets the help she needs. Some of us have a memory long enough to remember how bad Chelsea Clinton got it. That was horrible. If Ted wants to continue his awful craze and lust for being an idiot, his wife should send the kids to boarding school in Europe. Wouldnâ€™t be the first time wealthy and powerful people have done that.
