The 1028 120 mm canister may be a round the US uses, but it falls far short of being her 'bread and butter'. Nothing comes close to the standard 105 and 155 mm rounds with some good old-fashioned high explosive. It's more than effective enough at raining steel without carrying a specialized loadout that limits your carrying capacity and, by extension, your operating efficiency.
I just saw some videos from this attack. The most impressive thing - it wasn't a kamikaze drone. It looks like it's a long range unmanned vehicle that launched two missiles with at least a few km range. Russians shot down one missile, second one hit the target causing fire. We know about 3 people killed and at least 4 more hospitalized. Looks like the drone itself wasn't destroyed.
It's working on the political extremists that were predisposed to like Russia: the far right that likes Russia's "traditional Christian values", and the far left that likes Russia's "standing up to 'Western imperialism' and restoring the Russian sphere of influence.".
Modern high explosive fragmentation weapons explode a large explosive core, ripping themselves apart and blasting out fragments of the shell (called shrapnel despite that not being technically accurate) at hypersonic speeds via the explosive force.
Shrapnel shells stopped being used because they were inferior to high explosive fragmentation shells which have been the standard munition for well over 100 years now.
Old timey Shrapnel Shells TM worked as basically a box of musket balls that ripped open like a pinata when a timer reached 0 and fell down at supersonic speeds with inertia. Basically a shotgun shell that doesn't open until its in flight. Almost no explosives inside it.
