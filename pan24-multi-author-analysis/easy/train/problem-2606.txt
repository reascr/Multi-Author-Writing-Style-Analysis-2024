I’m sure that you, in your profession, get annoyed by people posting surface level takes that are entirely wrong because they simply don’t understand the underpinnings that actually frame the reality of the situation, right? As a lawyer, and specifically as a lawyer inside the federal government, your takes throughout this thread have the same effect on me. The Office of Legal Counsel derives it’s authority from the Judiciary Act of 1789, which authorized the Attorney General to author legal opinions on behalf of the executive branch (overly simplified, but it’ll do for purposes of this convo), as well as various later acts Acts delineating powers and organizing DOJ. OLC opinions are generally considered binding on the executive branch unless overturned/rejected by the Attorney General or the President. Put these things together and what you’re left with is that, as far as the executive branch of the federal government is concerned, unless a higher authority intervenes, OLC opinions have the force of law insofar as they apply to and direct the actions of the executive branch.
A big fucking deal. This guy has way more relevant experience that garland certainly, but the vast majority of prosecutors at DOJ. This fucking guy prosecutes renowned war criminals. Buckle up, don.
