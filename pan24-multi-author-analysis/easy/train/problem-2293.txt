A friend of my mom's gave birth to her second child when her first was about 3 years old. The baby boy seemed perfectly healthy, breathed well, ate well, and met all his growth and developmental milestones, until he was about 5 months old. Then he started to lag behind. By a year old he was having seizures and gradually became blind and deaf, and his head swelled, and he was clearly in constant pain. The baby was diagnosed with Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic neurological disorder for which there is no cure and no treatment. The child died shortly after his third birthday, as do all children with Tay-Sachs. The mother had a nervous breakdown from stress and grief, and her then 6-year-old daughter became clearly depressed and withdrawn and also required extensive therapy. The father struggled to be the strong one and keep the family together. It was a horrible tragedy for everyone.
