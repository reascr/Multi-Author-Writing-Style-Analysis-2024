If you do want to understand a bit more context: Putin recently responded to russian moms on the death of their sons by simply asking them to have more children. That should be enough for you to gauge the level of support. There is also a lot of "whataboutism" unjustly comparing russia and the US in a way that tries to justify what russia is doing. So people, including myself might react hastily when something like that is posted.
The west literally doubled overall Soviet supply of a variety of equipment and resources, and western companies & engineers were closely involved with Soviet domestic manufacturing as well. (The Americans literally shipped over whole factories in pieces, including a Ford tire plant.).
Yes, the definition of mercenaries under Geneva is extremely broad, and basically meaningless since anyone who is formally part of a country's armed forces is excluded from being a mercenary, which provides an easy out for anyone looking to employ mercenaries.
I think what they're trying to say is, "A. Thank you for your service. B. We should treat you better, yeah. but C. come on, get a grip, this is not the same thing AT ALL.'.
Since they're mercenaries they aren't covered by the conventions of war as combatants: "Mercenaries are not entitled to the status of combatant, prisoner of war (API Article 47), or any of the categories of protected persons provided for by the Geneva Conventions, unless they are wounded or sick, although they must always benefit from humane treatment. In conformity with the Geneva Conventions, they can be held criminally responsible if they commit war crimes or other grave breaches of humanitarian law. They are entitled to the fundamental guarantees established for all individuals." Note that even insurgents are considered combatants and protected as such, not that anyone listens too much to the Geneva Conventions but that's a whole another thing.
