Why is this nonsense upvoted? The world doesn’t work like this. They can’t predict his death to the day, and what purpose would wiping records serve really? Whoever is going to take power already knows it. Why speculate such ridiculous tom clancy nonsense when the simpler explanation of a targeted attack to disrupt russian infrastructure checks all the boxes?
Yes! That ukrainian infrastructure survived the cyberattacks, which were integral to Russias hybrid warfare concept, was a surprise only second to Russia still not having air superiority.
Utter chaos. An insane amount of debt is used as collateral. Burn debt and margin calls will follow and massive deleverageing triggered by liquidations that initiate even more fire sale of assets. This is how money and wealth are quickly destroyed on the wealthier strata but affecting everyone.
However. Lots of really powerful, awful people are going to enjoy this as well. So it kind of cancels it all out and is another step towards chaos and corruption.
