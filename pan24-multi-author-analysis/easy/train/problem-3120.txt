I don't think DeSantis will run in 2024. He sees the writing on the wall - the base is still enamored with Trump, and he risks alienating them if he fights Trump. So he waits, knowing that (1) he can cut a "deal" with Trump not to run, earn Trump's good favor (for what its worth), and not battle with Trump and alienate Trump's base; (2) Trump could be indicted (or die for that matter, as he's pretty old), and he could slide into the slot and pick up the disillusioned Trump followers of Trump somehow weren't able to run; (3) If Trump loses, it will weaken him further, and he'll be even older and a weaker candidate in 2028, so DeSantis stands an even greater chance of being the nominee; or (4) If Trump wins, he can claim to have supported him the whole time and position himself as the heir apparent.
No. Of course not. But I’m also not drooling at the mouth to see the potential shit show of their debating. They’re both monsters and any tearing down of one will inevitably help the other. I don’t want to see either on any path to success.
