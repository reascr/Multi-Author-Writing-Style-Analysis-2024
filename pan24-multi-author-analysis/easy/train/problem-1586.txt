I love teaching. I tutored a lot while in uni and I was pretty good at it. Recently I even tutored a good buddy of mine after he decided to get a community college degree. I taught this guy who couldn't even do basic algebra high school physics.
Meanwhile, they've seen the funding for learning support cut, money inequitably funnelled into private and grammar schools, the entire sector privatised through academisation, teacher retention at an all time low, respect for the profession diminished due to demonisation in the media, larger class sizes, more responsibilities (particularly with regard to social care, since the social care sector has been chronically underfunded). I could go on. "They knew..." is a ridiculous notion.
Seriously. Teachers are literally the people that mould our children for a damn good portion of their lives, and these are the people someone would argue we shouldn't pay?
Competitive pay means competitive applicants. If you want good teachers, you gotta make it an attractive job.
