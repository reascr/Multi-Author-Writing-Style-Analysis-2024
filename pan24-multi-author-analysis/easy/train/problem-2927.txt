The Republican pundits laugh at how “self destructive” the Liberals are, the way we’ll turn on our own. Meaning that if we find out that a candidate is doing something corrupt or scandalous we hold them accountable. That’s called integrity and yes it causes some losses, but it is not a weakness. They on the other hand could have a guy go up on stage and say that he worships the devil, rapes children, and promises to be the most corrupt politician ever and if he’s the only R on the ballot every single one of them will vote for that person anyway.
The Constitution specifically says inhabitant not resident. The founders debated between inhabitant and resident before agreeing to the term inhabitant and voted against adding a time period to the requirement.
Wrong! No requirement for residency. Only needs to inhabit the state when elected. Article 1 Section 3.
Yes it is smart and dumb, only in that it is a winning strategy, but dumb cause the bumpkins that are waving their confederate flag and feel like they are winning cause they can swing their guns around in public and say whatever racist thing they want, don’t realize how hard they are shooting them selves in the foot cause Liberals are actually looking out for the little guy while republicans are only looking out for the top 10%.
