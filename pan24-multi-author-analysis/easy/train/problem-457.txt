That sucks you had to run. Hope you can return soon. If you want to. If not hope you never expierence anything like that again.
Compared to what they’re getting (most are fed and equipped better than an average russia soldiers) and what they gain (barely a few kilometers in months) and their enormous losses, I’d say they’re not doing much better than the army, so giving them ammunition is most likely wasteful, those gain may have some propaganda use but they’re also depleting the already in shortage munitions that army hasn’t got and already goes to Wagner, the thing about an army of terrorists is that their usefulness and existence is dangerous too, so they don’t want to have them to feel to comfortable.
How am I spazzing? You dragged in whataboutism. It’s a goofy angle to take if you want to argue anything of substance. That sounds like an awful lot of projecting on the mental issues though- seems like a weird thing to bring up, but then again if you are fighting a losing fight (or playing devil’s advocate), you move to the “well what if Mexico became china’s ally?”, then on to accusing someone of being unhappy or mentally ill because they think a nation isn’t justified in invading their peaceful neighbor then raping kids and old women. Which one of us seems like they have mental issues? And I mean honestly, if you took a step back and read this thread between us as a third party, don’t you think you’d look a little silly with all of this?
