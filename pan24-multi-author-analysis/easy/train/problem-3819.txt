Also, let's no pretend the people writing the laws are ignorant. At every turn the Republican party is promoting ideas of groups like Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council. What's something the head of the Family Research Council successfully advocated for? Putting gay people to death in countries like Uganda. What's something he advocates for in our own country? Jailing gay people. Not only that, but the Family Research Council has a five step plan to eliminate trans people from American Life that they list openly on their website. Do they get punished for this? No Tony Perkin's gets appointed to the Religious Liberty Task Force. The United States under Republican's make him an International Ambassador for Religious Freedom. With his track record they do that. This is not a good sign for the US, and it isn't a stretch to compare this to early Nazism.
The Republican government is showing concern by banning above individuals from exercising their rights and placing restricting on individual's bodily autonomy.
