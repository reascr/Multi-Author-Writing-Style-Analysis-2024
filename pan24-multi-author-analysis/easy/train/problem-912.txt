You really under estimate the effect of group think. The GOP will let trump and Desantis fight it out and then everyone will pretend the winner was always the one everyone supported. The loser will either be cast out or bent his knee to the new king. It won’t matter much who is the top dog. Trump was not the cause of the problem with the GOP, neither is Desantis. They are both symptoms, they are just cogs in a machine that is not under anyone’s direct control. It is so fascinating, how the various parts of the machine work, pushing everyone further to the right, because the only consistent ideology from any republican is that the democrats are evil and they must be stopped at all cost, no matter what they are doing.
No. Because left vs right is just a smokescreen to obfuscate that the real fight is rich and powerful vs everyone else. At the end of the day the haves will always unite against the have nots and protect their own, because if it’s shown one of them can be held accountable it means any of them can be. Trump will get off Scott free because the status quo depends on it.

Exactly. I know Ted Cruz is a historical weasel but recall that Trump called his wife ugly and implied that his dad assassinated JFK, and he turned around a few weeks later to publicly kiss Trump’s ass.
