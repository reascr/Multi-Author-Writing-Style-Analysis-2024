This is the false equivalency you posted and what I was responding to. And comparing Israel to Nazi Germany is so beyond insane that it can’t possibly be what you mean. The Germans killed six million Jews because of their ethnicity. Palestinians have had five offers of statehood but have refused every single one. You’re dense.
Especially in a unstable parliamentary government coalition like israel who has had six government coalitions in three years, the political fringe often gets an overwhelmingly disproportionate power over the political plurality because they have the final say in every single government decision.
Good. You live in a rump state because you attempted a genocide preceding the creation of a Jewish state and continue to promulgate that viewpoint. The path to peace is renouncing slaughtering people based on their race and faith.
“Interesting. You support victims of the holocaust even though they wouldn’t let you date their daughter. I guess you want a new Jewish world order” - you, 75 years ago.
