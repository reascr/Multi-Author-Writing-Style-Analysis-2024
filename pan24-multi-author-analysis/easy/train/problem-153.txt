"Stricter rules on trains" vs "would have applied" is important to me. Obama stood for appropriate regulation and respect for human life and the environment. Tfg stands against those values. He has only mockery and contempt for them. He stands for dishonesty and personal gain. All you guys have is word games.
The Obama administration enacted a rule in 2015 requiring high-hazard flammable unit trains to be outfitted with electronically controlled pneumatic brakes by 2023.
Idk seems pretty fair to me. The advocacy group made a claim abou the Obama enacted brake policies and Trump era rollbacks in the context of the spill. While those policies were enacted and rolled back by the administrations that the advocacy group claimed (the truth part), the claim was framed in a way that asserts that the rollback was, at least in some part, to blame for for the tragedy in East Palestine. This is not true because apparently, even if the policy was still in place, the policy did not apply to this particular trainâ€™s specifications.
