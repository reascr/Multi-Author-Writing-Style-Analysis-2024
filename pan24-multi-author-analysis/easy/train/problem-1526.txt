That's fine, I also don't need to refute scientists who deny climate change. We can go after every fringe scientist ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Also, I didn't give any advice... who are you responding to? Lol...
What happened was that when Israel declared independence, after having ethnically cleansed the majority of the land of natives in the prior 12 months, newly independent arab countries "attacked" their offensive forces deep inside the palestinian side of the supposed partition.
Sort of. It seems to be a relationship based on necessity rather than good will. For instance, Jordan controls the Temple Mount complex (holiest site for Jews, third holiest for Muslims), but it's Israel bargaining with Jordan that allows Jews (and Christians) to have limited access on certain days between certain hours. Otherwise only Muslims would be allowed to visit, as seems to be tradition in Islam (non-muslims cannot visit the city of Mecca or the the Prophet's mosque in Medina). Imagine if Saudi would have to negotiate with India to allow Muslims to visit Mecca.
