That’s part of the issue. USSC nominees were supposed to be bipartisan for their nomination by a majority vote, but the polarization has become so ridiculous over the past few decades that of course favors will be made behind closed doors. McConnell saying a judge can’t be nominated during an election year, then doing it is just one example. Also, the original comment I replied to was in regards to the Federalist Society. They fucking groom their picks. “I’ll get you a seat but you have to dissent whenever we want you to.” It’s all transactional and fucked up. Even Obama caved a bit with his nomination of Garland, a moderate conservative by today’s standards, and was shut down just because a president with a “D” nominated him.
Probably? Most definitely shouldn’t. In fact should be impeached for his actions thus far considering his wife’s involvement and his coverup of it and refusal to recuse himself from the cases.
