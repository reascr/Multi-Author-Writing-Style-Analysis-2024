Really? Don't forget ⬆️grocery $$ due to ⬇️ crop yields due to Climate Change-efforts reversed/blocked by Trump & Repubs. Gas ⬆️too. Too dependant. Many Chinese products are ⬆️ due to Trump Tariffs. Trump corps have ⬇️ production & ⬆️ prices because want to keep Trump 40% corp tax cuts. Amazing how product stock levels are back in time for the Holidays, staple products stayed in stock and gas prices went down right after the election in just in time for Black Friday and the holiday season. Hmmm... 🤔🤔 Calling B.S. on Biden created inflation. Haven't even talked about min wage the same for 12+ years and the standard wage in a majority of states. That would help, but no desire to raise it. What could be the motivation? Corporate tax cuts? 🇺🇸🗽⚖️🗳🌍🏡🧬.
