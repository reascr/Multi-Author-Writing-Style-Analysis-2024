Absofuckinglutley! Trumps list of crimes is long, but I hope he is formerly charged for each one. Trump’s irresponsible handling of top secret documents amongst them.
Excuses? He shared to the entire world the imaging capacity of our spy satellites, not only that he potentially revealed what satellite took the picture. Incredibly stupid on Trump's part.

Incorrect. We do not know the classification of any of the documents, just that they are classified, just like we didn’t know about this for months until the Biden administration informed us. I was speaking in generalization, specifically that if there were NO Top Secret documents, I’m certain the Biden administration would have already stated as much in regards to the mishandled documents.
