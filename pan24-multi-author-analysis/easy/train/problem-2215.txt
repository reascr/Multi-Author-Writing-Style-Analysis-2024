Thats so annoying but youre 100% right. People are way too focused on paying their bills so they can maintain the quality of life that they have. Even with all the problems we have, if people have a roof over their head and food in their bellies, theyre not going to be fighting for change in the street. ESPECIALLY if theyre just barely holding it all together, and fighting for change means putting what they DO have at risk. Thats why the whole “own nothing and be happy” strategy is effective at quelling the masses. Its also why the US uses sanctions as a way to instigate regime change. Thats why all of this is allowed to continue.
