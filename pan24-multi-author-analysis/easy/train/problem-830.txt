Yeah, but a certain party supported PPP loan forgiveness, but turned around, screamed, and fought when students were about to receive loan forgiveness. They shopped around for a sympathetic judges and paid very high priced lawyers to block it. I'd call that hypocrisy.

Even people being investigated by the FBI for fraud received loan forgiveness. It will never be known how much money was simply pocketed by many of the people and institutions receiving those loans.
