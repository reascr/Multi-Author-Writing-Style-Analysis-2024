I have no idea what you're talking about, in NK you are only allowed to visit the "good" parts anyway. Meaning you won't actually see anything bad. In China if you go to the rich parts you won't see anything bad either. Same with Russia. I mean when you go to a place as a tourist do you visit the "good" parts or the "bad" parts? There's plenty of bad shit in say the US of A but if you go to Las Vegas or whatever the last thing on your mind is a ghetto in Detroit. Am I wrong?
Imagine France protest but 1 and a half year long, economy come to a halt, opportunistic gangsters forming into urban war band serving each political spectrum, police using lime grenade(the less lethal pineapple grenade) on grenade launcher shooting directly at protester, countless color themed mobs and protester forming into different group.
the UK which has a monarchy. The Palace of Versailles gets more visitors annually than any of the UK palaces or royal sites and we all know what the French did to their kings and queens. People would still go to Buckingham Palace and Windsor and all the other places even without a monarch living in them, because theyâ€™re of historical and cultural significance and hold in them vast collections of art, plants and flowers, architectural features.
