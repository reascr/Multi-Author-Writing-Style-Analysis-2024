The main issue isn't that SK could kick NKs ass easily. The main issues are China coming to NKs side again and the fact it will be much bloodier than the 50s. Those are some of the main reasons SK hasn't gone in. Seoul is home to almost 10 million people and the metro area is home to 25 million. Seoul itself is only like 20miles from the border while there are large suburbs and cities between it and the border filled with more people. NK has a massive amount of long range artillery and rocket systems pointed towards this general area. It would most likely be the largest exchange of fire the world has seen if it happens. Last time I read something on if was a RAND release and their estimations were 100k to 250k casualties in the first hour.
Insofar as ship driving, military discipline, maintaining their equipment, basically anything associated with executing a standard procedure, they were phenomenal by comparison.
This is bullshit. A contingency plan maybe, but unless they’re already at war with us, they’re not touching Japan or any US ally. It would be suicide.
Logistical? They would have direct support. From multiple countries, but specifically the U.S. That includes the use of nuclear weapons if Russia used them or became an existential problem.
