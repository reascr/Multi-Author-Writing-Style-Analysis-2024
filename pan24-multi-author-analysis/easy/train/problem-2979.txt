DeSantis doesn’t have the charisma to win a primary. He does really well when he’s on message and using his canned responses, but the second he’s thrown a curve ball he shuts down. Look at how he responded during his debate when he was asked if he would serve all 4 years as governor or if he would run for president in 2024. He falls apart when something goes wrong and when you’re running for president something is guaranteed to go wrong as some point. He’s also going against trump who is the absolute master of forcing people off message. What happens when MAGA accuses him of being a deep state sleeper for letting Mar-a-Lago get searched? An explanation of separation of state and federal power won’t cut it.

Probably. They’re both outside shot candidates. This is going to be a 2 horse race, but if there is going to be a big surprise I would bet it’s a revolt from the center that goes to one of those two.
