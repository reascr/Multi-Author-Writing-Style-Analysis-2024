I can back up your assertion. Had a guy yesterday day without any evidence that said“the left are more like Nazis than the right,” which I knew to be him making the nazis=socialist connection, so I linked him a copy of the 1923 Hitler interview where Hitler literally said “our socialism is not Marxist socialism. We’re taking back socialism from the Marxists.” And dude just… refused to read it or even listen and sat there making excuses for how 2022 USA is not 1923 Germany. Told me and I quote “I don’t care what Hitler said,” and then repeated his claim that the left=socialism and socialism=nazis. It’s stupid, and I don’t know how to overcome it at this point. They’re so far down their own little rabbit hole that I’m not sure there’s any way back for them.
Then the appearance arises that the task is to map “liberalism”, or “progressivism”, or “socialism”, or whateverthefuckkindofstupidnoise-ism, onto the core proposition of anti-conservatism.
I hate this so much. Fuck them I live in COS He and the the other customer are considered hero’s here He didn’t “take” his family anywhere. All these consenting adults went to an establishment to enjoy a show. This is the freedom that he served for!
