I mean one of the healthiest diets you can have is vegetarian or pescitarian as those have been linked to a longer life also banning white bread and only allowing whole grain seams also preaty good as it is undenyably healthier. For cheese you can just buy the block instead of buying sliced cheese it also doesn't exclude cottage cheese if I am not mistaken. Maybe because I am European and even people on wealth fare can afford everything they need but I can not realy see a problem with that go for fresh produce or frozen produce not shure if that is still allowed with bread and canned fish and you should life a preaty healthy life style. I mean no fresh meat kinda sucks for a lot of people.
People need to understand that having the states administer federal programs is a holdover from the Jim Crow era where southern racists were absolutely against any assistance for black people and the only way you could get those racist politicians onboard with any program that helped poor people was to give the states the opportunity to keep those programs out of the reach of black people.
