>radiation and nuclear safety; food security; energy security; release of all prisoners and deported persons; implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the world order; withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities; restoration of justice; countering ecocide; preventing escalation; and finally - confirmation of the end of the war.
Wonder how they didn’t? They paid pensions, allowed humanitarian access, done withdrawal of heavy weapons (which was also done under control of OSCE), done prisoners exchanges, approved laws demanded in minsk agreements, done amnesty for separatist participating in previous events, demanded constitutional reform was approved as well, except Ukraine still was forced to retaliate at peroodical separatists fire, and never get access: to border control, taxes collected on occupied territories, participating in elections, ah yep and and no acess to banks vaults so not really regaining control on banking sector.
Russia has not kept it's word on anything even from before the war. They have played the FSB game of statecraft. That cannot be a diplomatic policy, your words must have meaning atleast to some level when it's the world stage.
