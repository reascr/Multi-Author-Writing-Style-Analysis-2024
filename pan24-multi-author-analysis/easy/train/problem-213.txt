Actively supporting? How? Scholz is still phone calling putin and waiting to back to business. Do you remember begining of war? When europe supported ukraine with weapons germans were sending helmets for few months because they cant find address. Now germans pooping themselves to dont help ukraine at all to keep good relationships with russia. They focus to promise a lot and do even less. Germany is actively blocking sanctions over russia. German chancellor is one of most trusted putins people, head of gazprom. And why war started? Because germans built nord stream to sabotage europe energy system with russia gas.
Literally meat. Their next strategy is to try to overwhelm Ukraine with sheer numbers - 150,000 conscripts, 1.5 million reservists. Poorly armed, poorly equipped, but maybe too many to easily stop. That's what Wagner is doing and it's sort of working for them.
Russian propaganda is actually german propaganda. Russians used german government to spread this propaganda. For bribes, sure, but isnt this german propaganda now? And was from years? I never heard of russian ecological fundations, but i still hear about german ones. They divide europe, not me.
