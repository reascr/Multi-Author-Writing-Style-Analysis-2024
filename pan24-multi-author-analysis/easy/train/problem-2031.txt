It reminds me of when the new Colombian President shit on the US in a speech to his base then met with the CIA director the next day and asked for money. Lula just wants to be anti-west for the sake of being anti-western and because it’s a pathetic attempt to get a dig at the west (at the expense of Ukrainian people); he has no other coherent rationale for how exactly it’s Ukraine’s fault that they got invaded because Russia doesn’t accept their sovereignty or ability to make autonomous decisions regarding their future. It’s the classic global south mentality of “I want pity for my history of colonization, and you should be standing up for me, but if another country gets colonized by an imperialist power, you’re insane for suggesting I condemn it when I can profit off of it (in this case by buying cheap fertilizer) instead”.
