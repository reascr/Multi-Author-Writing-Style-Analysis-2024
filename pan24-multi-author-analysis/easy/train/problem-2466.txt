And yes, please do tell who would be the big enemy that these three would have trouble flattening together. Entirety of Africa? Or south America? Or EU could stand a chance at all? Maybe if an independence day scenario happened we'd see that kind of cooperation between these nations.. but you're assuming way too much and crediting powers to a president that he simply doesn't possess. If nothing else cultural differences alone wouldn't allow for unity. The world requires these big nations to be at odds in order to maintain a balance and keep citizens fed. Big difference between diplomacy and intricacies involved in negotiations between nations for a more united (self interest focused) world and a full blown alliance and cooperation.
Second that. We'd be less likely to be an Axis power of WW3 than embroiled in another civil war. Probably following several months of attacks and assassinations of politicians, improvised bombings, etc.
Who can tell the future? All we can say is, factually, Trump did so, so so much more to help Russia than almost anyone realizes, and spoke openly about leaving NATO, spoke openly against Ukraine LONG before anyone thought Russia and Ukraine would go to war - he had knowledge of what Putin wanted to do and was actively attempting to align the US to help him in his goals.
