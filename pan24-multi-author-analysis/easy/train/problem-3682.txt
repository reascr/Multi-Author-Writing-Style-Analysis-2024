Even during WW2 diplomatic communication persisted. The Germans sent representatives to Britain while their bombers attacked British cities. You have to maintain avenues of communication for when the war eventually ends. The same goes for preventing wars as well. The fact that Macron recorded and then later released the calls covers the West's ass because it demonstrates that efforts were made on the part of world leaders to try and talk Putin down. He was told NOT to do any of this, warned, and he did it anyway. It's clear cut that there's no one to blame but Putin himself.
