But you agree they don't have a shortage of men then. And the only thing it takes for them is to actually supply the necessary training over months. Which guess what goes back to one of my original thesis time is on russia's side not Ukraine's. And Russia is now figured that out and is shifted to a wartime economy. The reorganizing of the army. Most people aren't really paying attention to what the fuck is going on with Russia now and they are completely changing tactics. Even on the ground, the way they are performing combat missions is shifting. And guess what? They have to be defeated. That requires Ukraine to be given the weapons and combat power to do it. Protracting this only helps Russia only hurts Ukraine.
Exactly. People fail to see that China has chosen sides very recently and has aligned to the same rhetoric that the Russians have had for many years, that is calling out America as imperialists, warmongers and instilling western values to countries around the world. China has now taken the leadership position in the global south in regards to calling out America and its plundering ways. What’s interesting is that many countries outside of western allies are aligning to China, this is what’s worrying to the west. Countries have choices now, it’s not only the American way, they can consider other options.
