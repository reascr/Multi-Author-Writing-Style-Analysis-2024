Prighozin and wagner are sactoned an their shit taken if they had any assets in the west and probably nobody is allowed to work with them or else they too would be sanctioned. Prighozin would have probably been captured or assasinated if he stepped in to a place with US precense. wagner soldiers are already legitimate targets in Ukraine and elsewhere they operate.
Its all theoretically possible. Not a good idea though. Blackwater was a glorified security company that never saw "combat" (offensive fighting, like on a frontline), but saw insurgency and ambushes. They would best excel at internal security, with only a few crimes (or massacre's) while they're at it.
However. When both parties are getting increasingly restricted access to others, having increasing costs, then you have natural shit where climate change is wrecking havoc on food stability and a myriad of other issues, all while you are blasting through money in a weapons war of attrition against nato and friends and the American war machineâ€¦.
