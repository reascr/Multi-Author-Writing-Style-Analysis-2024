The pontification, fall, and eventual incarceration of Trump, feels like the campaign subject of another populist push. Making use of his crying would incite the remnants of his base to vote for a gop populist who would inevitably pardon Trump or at least promise to issue one. Seems like they've concluded he's such a liability it would be much easier to unify the movement under martyrdom at this point. Break down his ego now ahead of an indictment. The idea of Trump holds a lot more value than the megalomaniac that routinely sabotages his own gains through insufferable validation seeking. What that entails is honestly kind of terrifying. There was a lot of speculation around Epstein and a similar circumstance with Trump would give someone like Rupert Murdoch the controversy to sell a lot of headlines and give gop free-reign to generate whatever narrative they wish to whatever ends they wish to justify in their authoritarian pursuit.
1. He announces he's forming the "MAGA Party", because obviously the GOP isn't pure enough ... or now they hate him ... or whatever. He'll spin some bullshit on the reasons why ... and the MAGA base will eat it up. They will be tripping over each other to be the first to empty their bank account into his, buying stupid "merch" ... whatever.
