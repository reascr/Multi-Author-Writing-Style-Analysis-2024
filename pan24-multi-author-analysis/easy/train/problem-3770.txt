While I agree, we also shouldn't praise people for basic human decency. It's outrageous that other religious leaders, from Pope Francis to the Dalai Lama, are officially anti-LGBT. We should hold them to a higher standard.
Well gay marriage is not criminal in india it is not recognised there is a difference, you are not a criminal if you are living together and sharing assets and liabilities with your partner regardless of the sexes involved but you don't get the legal protections like settlement on divorce by default unless you sign a contract amongst yourselves, the problems associated with recognition of gay marriage in india lies in how personal law is defined with there being a special (secular one) personal law and religious personal laws and you can choose which to use the , there are talks in progress to add gay marriage in special marriage law but Hindu, Christian and islamic personal laws still define marriage to be between a man and a woman, there is also a push that has been going on for scrapping the religious personal laws in favor of a unified civil code with the current draft recognising gay marriages. Currently same sex marriages are treated as live in relationships and are not registered with the government.
