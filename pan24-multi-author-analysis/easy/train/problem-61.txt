First...definitions. Basically, any gun that's not a hand gun is a long gun. So rifles and shotguns are long guns. By virtue of the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934, long guns must have at least an 18" barrel. No one knowledgable about guns would ever talk about a "long rifle" except as an adjective to describe one type of .22 ammunition - that's a different story.
Itâ€™s education. And education doing its job of lifting people out of poverty. Always has been. Solves nearly everything. As we fall deeper off the WWII Boomer wealth cliff and defund/hijack education this will only get worse.
