This is a bad example though. This is just a single employee being a complete asshole. A better example would be one of the multiple cases where someone has explicitly stated they actually want to live but can't afford accessible housing and are applying for assisted suicide before they end up homeless.
Stop being such an idiot. It's in no way similar to Alan Turing or Rosemary Kennedy. They didn't ask for anything to happen to them, they didn't want anything to happen to them. With MAiD you have to specifically ask for it and have it approved by multiple people. It's not like a doctor just reads off his clipboard and is like "Says here you're depressed. Well, you know the drill" and shoots you on the spot or anything.
As difficult as it is to accept, we must accept the fact that there are a minority of people who experience severe suffering, and have exhausted all possible resources, techniques, and strategies known to medical science, and simply have no other option except to continue to suffer or die with dignity.
