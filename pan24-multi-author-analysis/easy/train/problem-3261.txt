Yea it's no good any way you look at it. I do think thos is the the societal pushback you can expect from a people who has been put in a corner and kicked for too long. I mean the settlers shouldn't be there to begin with. Not that I condone murder.
It’s “funny” that “leftists” Israeli who blocked highways and burned some woods in the middle of the road last Saturday night to opposes the Israeli government anti democracy plan were called as anarchist and throwing tantrum and all the bad stuff by probably the same people who supported this settlers violence behavior burning random cars on the street. And they probably praise this settlers behavior as an act of heroism.
Exactly. That’s why there are jewish archeological sites in Israel/Judea and Samaria that are dated thousands of years before there was any Palestine. LMAO.
Location based subreddits are not an accurate representation of that location’s demographics or consensus. I live in West Virginia, one of if not the most conservative state in America, yet if you just went by r/WestVirginia you’d think the state was super left wing.
