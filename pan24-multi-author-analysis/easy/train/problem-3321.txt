Most if not all American cars are built with a mix of parts from around the world. Just because the car is assembled in the US doesn't make it " made in USA" as with a lot of other items. Basically built in USA with foreign parts. We are dependant on china,mexico, south Korea and others with no foreseeable way out. Corporate greed caused this. Corporations looked for ways to maximize profits making it hard for us to end our dependency on china. Imagine walking into your local big box store if we did end our dependency. The shelves would be mostly empty.
China has a dominant market position from paying low wages, the ability to forcibly move rural populations to manufacturing centers, lack of safety oversight, widespread human rights abuses, a centrally planned economy, et al.
Yep. Ford is basically getting help from this Chinese company, who is one of the best at what they do, set up a factory in the US that is completely owned by Ford so that Ford eventually gets the expertise to do it themselves, all 100% in the US.
Did it? Or did our corporate overlords just pocket all the profit and mark things up just as much, if not more than they were before?
