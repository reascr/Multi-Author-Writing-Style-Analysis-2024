Intelligent design and religion are the same thing, and no, neither one has been banned. They are comparative religion classes and Bible as literature classes that are taught in public schools. Intelligent design is religion so it can’t be taught as science but it could certainly be taught in a comparative mythology class. I’m not sure what the purpose of doing so would be, but it isn’t banned..What government schools can’t do is promote religion because it’s a violation on the 1st amendment. Eugenics isn’t banned from any curriculum. It is important to understand how science has been used for evil as well as for good. And what counts as science isn’t for the government to determine but for scientists to determine. Government deciding what is and isn’t science is absolutely fascism. As is government deciding what is or isn’t history. Are you suggesting that having government mandate what is truth somehow not fascism?
