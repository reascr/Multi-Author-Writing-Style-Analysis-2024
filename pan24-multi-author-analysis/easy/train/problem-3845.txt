Actually, the F-35's RCS is reportedly smaller than the F-22's now, it has a more advanced AESA radar, it's capable of performing both the EW and AWACS role on its own, it has unmatched situational awareness, and it has that $500,000 HMD which allows the pilot to see through her aircraft and target anything she's looking at and kill it with HOBS missiles. This means that it can kill anything at a longer range than the F-22 because it will see it from further away, it can't be detected as well or as far away as the F-22 making it more survivable, it can target assets on both ground and air and share it with other aircraft, it can jam the adversary's radar, and if by some mistake it enters a WVR dogfight it can still kill anything more maneuverable than it with aforementioned HMD and missiles. Ironically, the F-35 is the real air dominance platform now.
absolutely. but the USAF isnâ€™t going to retire all the F16s and replace them all w the F35. the increased cost of maintenance and flight hours would be enormous.
