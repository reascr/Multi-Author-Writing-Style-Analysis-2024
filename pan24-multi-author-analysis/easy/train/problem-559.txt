Andrei Medvedev, who fled by crossing the Russian-Norwegian border on Jan. 13, says he witnessed the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners taken to Ukraine to fight for Wagner.
Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has previously said that Medvedev had worked in a Norwegian unit of Wagner and had "mistreated prisoners".
1. All war is terrible and terrible things happen in all wars. There is no clean war and there is no sinless army. A world with no war would be infinitely better than ours, if only humankind wasn't far too violent to build that world. That being said...
OSLO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A former commander of Russia's Wagner mercenary group who fled to Norway told Reuters he wanted to apologise for fighting in Ukraine and was speaking out to bring the perpetrators of atrocities in the conflict to justice.
3. Some forces have no problem committing atrocities, but they employ enough PR, political lobbying, and operational secrecy that their reputation is bad, but nonspecific. Blackrock is in this category. UN Peacekeepers are. Wagner is not.
Kripos, Norway's national criminal police service, which has responsibility for investigating war crimes, has begun questioning Medvedev about his experiences in Ukraine. He has a status as a witness, police have said.
