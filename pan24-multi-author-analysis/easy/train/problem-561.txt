mentioning the coup attempt isnt opinion. Some people thought it was good, most thought it was bad. Either way it did happen and stating something along the lines of "with Trumps efforts to overturn an election that led to the events of January 6th" isn't an opinion. It happened.
Well-off liberals who dismiss the worsening economic conditions for those outside their social circles as just being right wing gripes or the concerns of the ignorant inherently offer no viable alternative to the populist appeals of fascism which allows it to develop as a movement. When the fascist takeover is completed these same people will wholeheartedly go along with it to keep their status and the flow of treats they're accustomed to.
Exactly. Trump was exciting. All the fraud. Constitutional violations. Every day, another moronic tweet to laugh at. Coup attempts. Death threats. Graft. Grift. Treason. A thrill a minute. This new boring competent guy is a snore.
