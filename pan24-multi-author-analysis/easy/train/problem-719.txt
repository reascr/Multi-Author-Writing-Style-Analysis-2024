On the topic of conspiracies, I honestly do believe there were major dangerous forces that might've tried to force an extradition of him if he'd gone to Sweden at the very moment of the original meltdown. A sort of shock-and-awe where whatever forces in Sweden that got pressured could've pretended "Oh we were just following protocol!" before anyone realised the complications of his extradition. It's empirically highly doubtful, since Sweden ranks some of the highest in the world in Rule of Law, respect of human rights etc. but the whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth. Call it intuition and entirely fallible. But after all the reporter-murders, Epstein-associates getting murdered, I've genuinely started to doubt the ironfacade of our legal societies.
