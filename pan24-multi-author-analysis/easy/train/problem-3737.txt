Moscow isn't going to commit suicide anymore than Washinon D.C. is. Putin may be crazy enough to issue the order (which I personally doubt, but whatever), but Russians down the chain of command would not carry it out. They would either ignore it or remove Putin from power to save their own lives. They're not going to kill themselves and Russia just over a territorial dispute that may go their way if they try again in the future. Russian understanding of history is long.
Actually, no. Ukraine is killing about 5 Russians for every dead Ukrainian. Even factoring in civilian murders, Ukrainians are still killing a lot more Russians. The number of civilian casualties is between 7000 and 40,000. I think the real number is probably about 13K-17K, which is roughly double+ the UN's minimum estimate. Their number of troop deaths is probably in that region as well.
Seriously. I remember at the start of the war they would issue a new threat every week and I was a little worried about what would happen. Now they’ve done it too much and the threats aren’t credible.
