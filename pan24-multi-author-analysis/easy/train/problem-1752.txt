India definitely does not want to be a Western lapdog-- a lot of Indians do seem to dislike the US and West as a whole, which makes sense.
1) Global health infrastructure, health financing and digitization of service delivery; 2) Digital public infrastructure and tech enabled development in education, livelihoods 3) Disaster resilience; 4) Fight against economic crime; 5) Reform of Multilateral Organizations; 6) Leveraging the blue economy; 7) Climate: Financing and the Green Hydrogen Mission, Accelerated pace of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implementation; 8) Energy security and transitions and 9) Womenâ€™s empowerment.
Yup. People forget just the massive amounts of trade India has with China alone. China exports fucktons of shit (billions, largest importer by far) to India and makes nearly billion+ in profit from this.
This is one reason why China is a fast growing trade partner to India, and will likely reap even more gains from Indias growth as it exports massive amounts. Whilst some Indians online claim to hate China more than US, their money sings a different tune and we should pay attention to that.
