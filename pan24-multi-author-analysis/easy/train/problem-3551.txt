Which is frustrating, because there are two separate overarching constitutional legal principles beyond any prior case that the justices are just going to handwave away in favor of using taxpayer money to subjugate girls and provide them with a lesser public education in the name of fucking “chivalry”. Like bite my fucking ass federalist society and the piece of shit activist justices they’ve hellspawned, you don’t just get to set fire to the equal protection clause and title 9! Fuck OFF.
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievance.
Yup. These same groups coming up with these bills (Alliance Defending Freedom) seem to think that they can stem the tide of America becoming less religious by forcing and compelling people to do things. It's backfired once before, and it will backfire again. They always claim "Jesus is a gentleman", but they want to force you against your will to pray?
