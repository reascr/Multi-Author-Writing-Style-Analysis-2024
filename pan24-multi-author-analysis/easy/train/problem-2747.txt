There is a distinction between the ideology that personally drives Putin, and the ideology that is presented to the Russian public as part of the justification.
What? Montana held a vote to make a bill about selling itself to Canada for $1trillion in response to a growing petition to do that very thing. It passed the first time around, but due to a procedural issue they had to do it again in which it failed. Former State Rep Forrest Mandeville at the time said it was “good to take a little break and laugh.”.
Really? Are they seriously trying to gaslight the world into thinking Russia "didn't" invade Ukraine in the first place with the entire goal of "liberating the country from Nazis?".
Yeah, Yeah, We all know that if Ukraine completely and unconditionally surrenders, Zelensky is removed, Formally give them all the annexed territory (Even the area's Russia has never had control over), demilitarize and basically just start kissing Putins Ass, The war would be over.
No, it's not oil. There was no real threat of those gas and oil fields being developed - Ukraine has been trying to convince Western oil companies (who along with China are some of the only people with the skill and experience in developing shale oil fields) with no success. All prior projects were cancelled when Russia created geopolitical instability in 2014.
