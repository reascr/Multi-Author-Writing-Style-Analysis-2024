For example, just a few months back Russia and China were doing a couple exercises up north, semi close to Alaska. Russia snuck in 2 more subs to participate than they said were going to. The US not only printed articles about it, they were able to provide the names of the exact 2 extra subs that were there. These kinds of articles don't ever really get any major air time because it's just business as usual and people just shrug them off. But, when you read between the lines, it means that NATO is not only able to detect their subs, they're able to identify them strictly by the noise each makes under water. NATO has sound sensors underwater all over the world and even the smallest sounds travel incredibly fast and far underwater.
