Fair enough, I only had experience with the Dutch higher education that placed an emphasis on practical knowledge over book-learning, and I got to experience Hofstede power distance dynamics in action; the sincere and interpersonal relationship between students and lecturers was a new experience that I found positive, although it took some time getting used to.
Total half truth. Covid stopped a lot of this, but Indian, Chinese and other nationalities are filling that gap and paying higher fees. I dont know about other places but Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield - LOADS of foreign students.
The things you have mentioned they are the truth but you are over looking the entire thing, like for example the French fishing also fish a lot in British waters what they will lose that right in 2025 meaning renegotiation will needed to be held, this is where things will change, universities in the UK is attracting less people from Europe but it is still continuing to attract people from outside of Europe, I think you got this from the recent report what I have seen but that article only highlights the European countries, when looking at the international data we still ain't doing too bad but of course it isn't has good has when we were in the EU, the fact that the UK is not in the EU anymore is pretty much the reason why the UK isn't the "best friend in the EU" we are no longer in the EU.
