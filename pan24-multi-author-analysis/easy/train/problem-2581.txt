On what grounds? Asking how their citizens are doing? Asking if they've heard from their family recently? Nothing that they are doing is provably illegal. They aren't openly saying "go home or your parents get the ax!" They're informing their parents that, coincidentally, after a few attempts to convince the person to return to China, their parents have come into trouble with the law and that it wouldn't be a bad idea to go and check on them. The operations that China is running in other countries is not illegal. To expunge them without proper cause would only cause an outcry from China. Seeing as how the victims of these operations are generally Chinese citizens, host countries often don't see the value in intervening on their behalf.
Yeah, they do. But, when they go on holiday, they don't receive a creepy call from the government reminding them to “stay loyal” to America. The CCP make America look normal.
These are state sponsored scholarships, it’s basically a contract - the state invests money in the student's education abroad (usually $250k to $400k for a master’s and/or a PhD), in return, the student must return to China and work in a designated institute or capacity for a certain amount of time.
This is so bizarre. Imagine going on holiday or going abroad to study and the government insisting you need to pledge your loyalty to the country. The CCP are fucking creepers man.
