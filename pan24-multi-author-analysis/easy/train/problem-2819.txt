...Ok, well, liberals really need to work on actually recasting Jesus for a new era then. In this country, the vast majority of the population is religious and the vast majority of the religious population is Christian, so it's hard to win without religious and Christian folks, and it's not necessarily that hard (in theory at least) to have a liberal interpretation of Christianity that dovetails pretty well with broader liberal politics. I know some liberals and progressives just want religion out of politics altogether and that even a bunch of liberal Christians really don't like to wear their faith on their sleeve and prefer to be outwardly secular, but I think that's really leaving something on the table there.
Edit: I got lucky. Just noticed that Jesus seems to have been replaced by Planters Peanuts and Peacock TV. They can stay.
Even if the Christians are folks who support economic policy to help the poor and workers, effective climate policy, and social policy that protects women's right to choose, protects women, racial minorities and LGBT people from discrimination, supports humane immigration laws and civil liberties, and supports a secular state?
Yup, they went away immediately. I haven’t noticed yet what they were replaced by, but hopefully it won’t irk me like Jesus did.
