I have a relative that lost their home because they bought a house on a cliff by a lake and soil erosion took it. He tried begging for the township to stop the erosion but there was no budget for it. The sad thing was he put cables around trees and other objects and attached them to his house. His house still fell into the lake.
That's what's so hard to get people, especially conservatives to understand: It's not about when the "worst" ecological impacts of climate change hit, it's about when just enough shifts to make the way we do things inviable (like mass changes in rainfall making regional crops fail) or put too much weight on already rickety systems (like forcing the world to swallow mass-refugees from vast geographical areas all at once while we're also already paying 3x more for groceries than we were 10 years ago).
I'm 20. This is why so many elderly people in the government annoys me. It feels like they go "we don't care if society collapses after us, we have our own interests to worry about".
Energy independence is a national security issue. You don't want to depend on Russia, the Middle East, etc.
