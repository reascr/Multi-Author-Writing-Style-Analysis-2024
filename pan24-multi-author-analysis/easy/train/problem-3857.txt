The case with the Speaker's office is totally different. Although it may be likely, it is not guaranteed that Kevin McCarthy will (ever) become Speaker. Before yesterday, there was a presumption that he would become Speaker due to his position as the leader of the majority party. However, that presumption was shattered as soon as he not only failed to reach 218 votes, he didn't even win a plurality of votes. Moreover, there is, in fact, an "alternate" Speaker-designate who, as of right now, has a better claim to the Speaker's office than the thrice-defeated McCarthy. I speak, of course, of the person who actually got the closest to 218 in the most recent Speakership election, i.e., Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.
It seems correct that the Speaker's office ought to be vacant for now and, if not, the person with the strongest claim to it is actually Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who's come in first in all three Speakership votes so far.
