There's a huge difference between someone who went through the original process of getting a check on Twitter which required full authentication of the person's ID and relationship to any organization they claim to be representing saying some stupid untrue thing pretending to be true and anyone with $8 being allowed to pretend to be anyone they want, getting the same Twitter endorsed/verified check and saying things pretending to be others that are misinformation.

This one is 100% on Elon and Twitter because only a complete idiot didn't know this was coming as soon as it was announced that anyone with a few dollars could get the checkmark without the other requirements such as submitting identification and other forms of proof verifying your identity or relationship to the company your account claims to be from.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
