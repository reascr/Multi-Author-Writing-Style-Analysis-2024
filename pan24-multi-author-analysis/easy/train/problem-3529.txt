Hungary is not Turkey. Hungary is a weak, irrelevant country in the middle of nowhere, Europe. If they try to blackmail Sweden and Finland abusing their NATO status, which directly benefits Russia and hurting these two EU members, the EU will punish them, and the US will probably have a call with them explaining why they are too young for adult games like this.

Not same yes Erdogan is corrupt but he makes sure at least the army receives all the maintenance and is in top condition to make you doubt clear NATO conduct military exercises to see the performance of all national Armies along with a check in their equipment and Turkey has shown to be the fittest after the US plus their armies are battle harden and have brought result in the battlefield in Syria and Iraq in the past few years. Just because the Russian army performed badly doesn't apply the same to Turkey they are a force to be reckoned with and actually have competent commanders that will not throw soldiers in the meat grinder.
