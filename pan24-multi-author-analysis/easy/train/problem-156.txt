Yeah, I think that's a fair complaint, but also one that's hard to reconcile against military need - you want your combat solutions to be both cost effective and technically capable against peer competitors, and most environmentally-friendly systems fail the first one (if not also the second.).
Either way even if the US gets involved directly, that might make it no longer proxy by textbook definition, but it would still be the US effectively relying on TW to do the bulk of the fighting against the US's greatest adversary, or the US using another nation to attack it's enemies (and I don't want to make it sound overly manipulative, because obviously both Ukraine and Taiwan desperately want the aid of the west, and the west wants to aid them, but there is truth to the US wanting to use other nations to do the fighting if at all possible while instead supporting them financially...).
Let's not invite Turkey to this one. They're in NATO as a strategic ally against Russia... but Russia is a joke so fuck 'em. (Fuck erdogan, love Turks).
I just think you calling out the other guy for his comment seem overly pedantic to me, you surely know what he means, we all do and we all thinking the same thing in regards to how this is basically with Taiwan in mind and in anticipation of a potential war situation like Ukraine, except this time the US has sworn we will get involved directly, but until that happens you can't know if it's a deterrence based military bluff or not, especially when we don't even know who will be in office and what their stance will be at the time CN chooses to act.
Even basic fuel efficiency has improved a lot in recent decades. It's not the first priority, but for example the new Abrams tanks are like 10x more efficient than the original from the 1980's.
