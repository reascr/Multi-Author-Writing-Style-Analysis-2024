That's a lot of buzzwords you've got in that one sentence - never mind how problematic each one is. It's like you've completely ignored the fact that the Ottomans colonized the area, then the British, who split it between the Palestinians and Israelis, and then a war of bigotry that had 5 countries attack one budding state all at once, only to be driven off. Then the decades of threats, repeated invasion attempts and terrorism by militant groups and the refusal of any surrounding country to take responsibility for a group of people they themselves helped disenfranchise....
If Palestinian people were able to install leadership that didn't devolve into a kleptocratic dictatorship with a penchant for terrorism, then maybe there would be a path for statehood. So far, there has been no evidence that this is possible.
The human rights council is made up of Arab countries that have flagrant human rights abuses who for the most part still don't recognize Israels right to exist, countries include Qatar who killed more migrant slaves then Israelis/Palestinians combined who have died in the past 25 years, Saudi Arabia and UAE who has killed many times more civilians in Yemen then even Qatar, Afghanistan, Algeria, among others who have not only historically persecuted their Jewish populations but are committing way more egregious violations. It is because they hate the Jews.
