Yo are paying an ad tax on every product you purchase. The marketing costs are baked into the product price, and that price effects the costs of other products within the system. In theory (though certainly impossible in practice), bereft of advertising and marketing expenditures, products would costs less, competition between equivalent products would increase, and consumers would pay less overall, freeing up your money to pay in a more direct fashion to smaller entertainment venues.
That is great. Does that include television commercials. They show them over and over. Beautiful people, huge steaks, everyone laughing and smiling. But they donâ€™t show the person crying because they lost their home.
Just saying that while the current system benefits those who rely on ad revenue, the ad revenue itself shapes the product more than the product itself, including those smaller market or independent entertainers, rather than the consumers having direct influence on the type of entertainment being made.
