Conservatism - in all times and places - is the political movement to protect aristocracy (intergenerational wealth and political power) which we now call oligarchs, and enforce social hierarchy. This hierarchy involves a morality centered around social status such that the aristocrat is inherently moral (an extension of the divinely ordained king) and the lower working class is inherently immoral. The actions of a good person are good. The actions of a bad person are bad. The only bad action a good person can take is to interfere with the hierarchy. All conservative groups in all times and places are working to undo the French Revolution, democracy, and working class rights.

Philosophic understandings include criticism. The Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify generalized/small c/populist conservatism) includes criticisms. Involving those, we can conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan Horse at worst.
