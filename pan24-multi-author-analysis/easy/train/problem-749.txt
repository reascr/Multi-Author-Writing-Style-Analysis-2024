Are they disappearing mysteriously? That would be something worth spending more than a couple seconds on. Look, we'd all like our groups to be more represented, but it's a state of the union address.

Priorities people. Priorities. Weâ€™ve had hundreds of food processing plants/warehouses mysteriously burn down, our farmers are facing fertilizer shortage, chicken and egg shortages, inflation out the roof while wages stay the same, four toxic spills in as many days.
