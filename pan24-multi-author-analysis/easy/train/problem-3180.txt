If you borrow money, you have to pay it back, UNLESS the one you borrow from says you don't have to. It's like if you borrowed money from my father to start a business. Some time later, my father has passed, and I'm the sole heir to his estate. You've been paying back for a long time, but your business don't go so well and I can see you're struggling. I can then say "Hey ZanzibarColtrains, I'm cutting the last 10 grand off the debt you owe me, go buy your kids Christmas presents and food." If someone else has paid off their debt already, that doesn't mean I have to give them money back, or can't forgive the debt you still owe.
Besides, there are already other ways to have your debt reduced or forgiven entirely, and a lot of these loans don't ever get repaid. So, the actual cost of this program will be much less than estimated. In addition, the money the borrowers save will most likely be spent in local businesses, generating more tax revenue, further reducing the net cost of this program.
Nope. It’s bad when anyone doesn’t repay money they borrowed. I could care less what your political leaning or party is. If you take out a loan, of any type, you are obligated to repay it. Going to get to the point where responsible people who pay back their loans won’t be able to get them because everyone decides to default because life is hard.
