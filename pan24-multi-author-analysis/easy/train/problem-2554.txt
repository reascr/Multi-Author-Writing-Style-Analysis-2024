What if a neighborhood organizes a communal flag recycle burning session in a public park in an effort to reduce carbon from multiple individual fires?
Well, well, well... They don't have resources to attack us, so I'm not worried. But this is a long problematic tradition. That's how Russia has always behaved. They are very sensitive about everything happening in Finland.
No, this flag thing is just Finnish culture. This is not some oppression thing, because all nations have some kind of culture. That is not oppression. Existence of a culture.
But cultures are what they are. Why should we be like the others in this thing? Who says that they are right and we are wrong? Who can be the judge? I personally like it, that people are forced to show some respect at least in some situations. And this is not a big thing for me. I just can't see any real reason to change anything, because people will survive even if they are not allowed to burn a flag. ðŸ˜Š.
Given the Russian-dominated USSR seized and ethnically cleansed Finland's then-second most populous city Viipuri in 1940 and annexed it into Russia in a war of conquest, they have earned the burnt flags.
Nar. In the free world you can burn a flag to express yourself. As long as nothing dangerous happens it's fine. It's no different to criticising the government. Burn away my pyromaniacs.
