And I think you are wrong in doing so, because no organisation, religion or mindset that people follow (including yours and mine) is free of downsides. We have to pick and choose what is good and what is bad, but not only in its entirety but also on a more defined smaller level. I'm sure you as a person, like everyone else, has done some bad things, do you think it's fair to define you only on those things or do you believe we should also see the good things you've done, when we judge your character? It's the same with religion. Even the abrahamic religions have caused things that I would consider good, even if its just a small thing like opening a school in some remote place and teaching some child math and writing skills. Doesn't make the indoctrination that comes with it better but it's still something positive that otherwise would not have happened.
