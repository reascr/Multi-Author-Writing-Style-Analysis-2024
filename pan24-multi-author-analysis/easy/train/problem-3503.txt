It does suck and I'm pissed off like you wouldn't believe. But definitely not lazy. Been opening accounts at other social sites and hoping people move over to one and Twitter can be forgotten. It just will take time. The outreach Twitter has is massive and will take time to move so many people to any one new place. Atm I'm at the mercy at where a lot of clients want to go. Which I have no control over. I could quit my job, sure. But I love what I do and I love the people I get to work with. Sucks to lose that, but I know people are taking steps to leave Twitter. It just can't happen over night for some people, is all.
So I truly am curious how you plan to do anything in your life without spending money with someone who has a Twitter account Good luck with your day to day life functions, such as using local utilities, buying food and toiletries, purchasing replacement parts for anything, using government services, or even using Reddit.
Nope. Guilty by associating only works if the associated party carries a lot of weight on said platform. Reddit is just one account among millions. Try harder next time. This is just silly.
