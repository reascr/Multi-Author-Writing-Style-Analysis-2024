It may spawn more smaller businesses to soak up the gap being left by these giant corporations but the rate in which that will happen over the loss in jobs is probably not going to be fast enough. With social media, you can just pump all this negative content against ways to fix it (like pro capitalism/anti socialism) and tell the poor that alternatives are the doom of our economies…even though Britain has a social healthcare system for several decades (which the government are trying to slowly dismantle) and people received UI in 2020 lockdowns and realised ‘we can actually do these jobs at home, why do we need an office?’ In the same way women realised ‘wait we can do these jobs that only men can do…why haven’t we been allowed to do them?’ In WW2.
Are you kidding me? You can't honestly complain about the quality of social services in the United States and then hold friggin China up as your counterexample. They have worse EVERYTHING. Their healthcare is pitiful compared to ours. Social security too. And despite what you're implying, the poverty there is worse than it is here, not better. They just have a different line because they're a developing country and we're not.
Absolutely the opposite. UBI would enable the next generation of free thinkers and entrepreneurs a way to to focus on on things other than serving you fries.
