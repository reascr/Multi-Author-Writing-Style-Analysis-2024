So now, they also don’t understand why to take Crimea was ok, but why to take all Ukraine is not. It is still some sort of political game for Russians brains like “yeah, of course, like last time, they will just pretend that they’re angry with us about Ukraine, throw some sanctions, then cancel them, but our great putin already have agreements with west, so we will just pretend that this was war and we will take Ukraine, as all previous countries and everything will be ok again”.
I'm a bit on the fence though. I'm curious if the analysis also sees a longer dip after the increase. Basically, are the "copycat" suicides truly, "Oh crap, I wasn't thinking of this before, but now I am" or, "Well, I was thinking of doing it at some point, but now I'll have company"??
I worked with some Russians that said there was some Russian saying that basically translated to "life is suffering", which to me sounded as about the most Russian thing ever; I don't think saying life is overrated is particularly strange for a Russian to say.
