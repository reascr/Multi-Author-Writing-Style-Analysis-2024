You know what also happens when you restrict immigration? There are not enough people to build houses. There are a whole lot of immigrants that build houses down here. Not enough houses equals inflation because there is not enough supply. It is truly remarkable that you do not understand this basic fact. This country does not have too many people that cannot find jobs it has too few people to work the jobs. Have you been living under a rock the last year? There is a reason this dipshit has the highest housing inflation in the entire country. It will take some time but it will become apparent what he has done. We do not have an issue with too many workers. The issue is there are not enough workers. They just hiked energy prices by 20 percent in a god damn state that can supply their own power with solar panels. There are now huge chunks of this state where you cannot even buy homeowners insurance. You are going to start to see people leaving here over the next 10 years. It reminds of when people in this country thought George Bush was doing a good job. We saw how that ended up. Jfc.
I assume you intend to mean "give 50k dollars to 240 immigrants " instead of investing 12m into infrastructure that could recruit future Americans into quickly adjusting to residential status amd becoming contributing taxpayers.
