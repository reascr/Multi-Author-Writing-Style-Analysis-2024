I'm not racist I'm a realist. Nothing I've ever said has been racist. You can go anywhere else in Canada and be served in French because that Is the law of the nation you live in. Quebec decides to ban all services to anyone in English unless you are a historic Anglo. Unfortunately, when you go online there is no filter that allows for you to enter your parents kindergarten registration. I respect the rule of law. I respect the character of human rights in Canada. I respect your right to be exclusively French. I do not respect creating a language police with rights to illegal search and seizure of small business and homes. I do not respect limiting places in post secondary institutions under the preface of protection of language, when these actions are not supported by research, science or communal support among educators. Every action being taken now will drive away the majority of the next generation of quebec youth. Thank God there is the process of natural selection. The French monoculture is going to die out in 2 generations. The regions industries are already failing due to the highest aging population in the country. The youth move away for a less repressive regime..Voila. systemic collapse. Just like the 70's.
my impression when visiting it was always that the linguo-cultural conservativism there is also supposed to push against politically conservative anglo-american ideas, and to get into closer contact to the political ideologies of other romance-speaking languages in Europe and the Americas.
