Arming and supplying a generation of hostile youth whose land you invaded, in an area of land your being pushed out of, by the countryman of those you plan to arm... what could possibly go wrong?! Operation: Let's lose faster?
Technically, yes. But unfortunately, “technically” doesn’t mean a lot in international diplomacy. I wrote another brief comment here about why “yes, it is”, but also why “yes, but who cares.”.
Hostile territory, essentially. Mines, shelling, drones, just angry Ukrainians with guns (assuming these kids have no white flag above their heads, but even then, its not always going to save them, especially since russhists used white flag for deception). Lack of food and heating will not help them either. And if they are unlucky, they will have squads nearby formed specifically to prevent them from escaping. Either they'll be captured or killed.
Bahaha. Clearly, you've never tried putting a 5-year-old to bed. You may think "case closed, " but you've forgotten the water break, the pee break, the "I don't like this color of night light" get up, the whole recollection of their day to only be recited well after bedtime, among other excuses...
