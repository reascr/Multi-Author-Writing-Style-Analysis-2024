Anything Republicans are for people should be immediately against. Until Republicans prove otherwise. That’s not being mean. That’s reality. That’s history. That’s their platform.
With the exception of a few games, like poker, where there can be bluffing, and players are competing against each other instead of all playing against the house, all casino games have known, fixed, odds, and known, fixed, payout rates, and gamblers can just find or figure out the odds and decide whether to play or not. There's no volatility in the odds, except in sports betting, or the occasional promotion at casino where they pay better odds than normal to get people in the door, eg, casinos sometimes change the odds for craps for certain types of bets, but those usually have fixed durations (eg, Monday only, or weeknights from 8-10, etc), so the odds aren't changing in real time, and you certainly can know them before placing a bet and can lock them in, even if they will later change.
SS will be exhausted by 2035. Changes do need to be made to SS to keep it solvent for future generations. Anyone saying otherwise is lying. I think all options need to be on the table - whether that's reducing the COLA increases, increasing the age, or increasing the income level that's taxed. Sometimes they have to put on their big boy pants and make big boy decisions in DC.
