Not really?? If you actually know who she then you know that this isnt really a celebration time when it took giving a literal arms dealer mid war called “the merchant of death” to bring her back… griner’s cool but realistically all she does is play basketball and complain like from the nba to the government she just has problems w everything, and it just kinda leaves you thinking “was this trade really worth it?” and you gotta remember she didnt have a life sentence she had 9 years, the arms dealer we traded was already in for like 15 and still had a life sentence for a list of violent crimes… dont get me wrong either im happy for her, but i dont think any of this was worth it and imo it only happened bc she went on a press tour when she got arrested.
Neither am I. The whataboutism of Trump releasing the 5000 prisoners is getting tiring also. Yeah I get it, that was a way worse deal. And Trump was a way worse president which is why I voted for Biden. But pretending that getting Griner released is some master class in diplomacy is bullshit. Should’ve let her and Whelan stay in Russia.
