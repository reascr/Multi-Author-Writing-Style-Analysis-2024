Not necessarily. There are a lot of unknowns, like who would be assumed to be powerful in such circumstances. Would people still use US dollar for a while, and so people with a lot of money would still hold power? If not money, then would power go to those controlling the most resources, and so would rich people with private security forces be protected? Who would the military take direction from? Would workers still show up, and how would they act? Especially things related to water, sewage, food and transportation? All of these things would have a huge impact, and none can be predicted with accuracy. The only thing that is certain is that this scenario would cause massive suffering and destruction.

These monumental victories absolutely matters to right wing authoritarian and Republicans. It damages them immensely. They don't have control over the most powerful seat of government to ever exist. Democrats do and that absolutely hurts them. Republicans didn't take both houses in the midterms and all of Trump's MAGA candidates lost badly. That hurts them and they care about that.
Under independent state legislature theory, Presidential Electors can be decided however the state legislature chooses.
It's funny. The right wing always preached about the importance of being well armed to stop potential tyrannical governments from taking over. And some where along the way they became the very tyrannical government they warned us about.
