PCRM has raised concerns about Neuralink in the past. Last year, it wrote to federal officials about alleged animal-welfare issues during Neuralinkâ€™s research partnership with UC Davis, citing another set of records it obtained. A federal prosecutor in the Northern District of California referred PCRM's complaint to the USDA Inspector General, which later launched the federal probe into Neuralink, Reuters previously reported.
The fuck are you on about? There was an ACCIDENT. How the fuck else do you think we transport dangerous chemicals long distance? We put it on a train. Yes we are worried about it, thats why we have fuck tons of regulations in place regarding the TRANSPORT OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS. We also care about the transport of infectious diseases. WHICH IS WHAT THIS COMPANY IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR. I feel like I have to yell at you to get this through what is obviously a serious lack of the ability to think critically. You seem to think that an agency can 1) prevent all ACCIDENTS and 2) cannot do two things at once.
