The big thing I took out of the whole COVID experience and I think relates to this is just how selfish some people are and how many of them exist. If I do not benefit from it directly I will oppose it. If it inconveniences me, I oppose it. American individualism is wonderful and all but we live in a society and there are trade offs. We should just be happy that our government is doing something to help people of need regardless of whether or not you belong to that group. They have been pumping trillions to corporate America for decades and the average person's quality of life has deteriorated significantly. What we are doing is not working, time to switch it up.
The President is attempting to forgive the debt (from an accounting perspective it's largely the same) of people who are overwhelmingly supporters of his party via a tortured understanding of a section of law meant to allow the President to forgive the publicly held student loan debt of Soldiers serving in wartime. He's essentially acting outside the law in this, the real fight is about who has standing to challenge it in court. I expect only Congress does.
