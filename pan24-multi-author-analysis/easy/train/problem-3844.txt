Man, I really want to be in the engineering lab which is trying to figure out the best way to actually capture these things somewhat intact right now. For the smaller, lower altitude ones, it seems like they could hook it from a C130 trailing some sort of cable trap or net. That could probably be whipped up and tested pretty quick with the right resources. Or if there is concern about that generating too much drag, they could try to hook it with some ballast to force it down. For the massive, high altitude ones, maybe they could have a U2 or Global Hawk drop a tracking puck onto it to make recovery easier. Or try to get it tangled up with another balloon which can get up that high.
International waters. That balloon had already traveled thousands of miles. The reason they shot it down literally as it cleared the beach is a.) shallow water recovery, and more importantly b.) if it lands in international waters we can’t touch it. We needed to make sure it was down on US soil (so to speak). B is an oversimplification, but we didn’t want the Chinese to have a semi legitimate argument that we wouldn’t be allowed to recover it. Basically they couldn’t afford to let the thing come down slowly.
