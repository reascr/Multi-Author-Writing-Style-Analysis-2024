From what I can tell about most of this article, it is emphasizing risks of the medication, while not considering that virtually ALL medical treatment carries some risk, and that the factor that determines whether a given treatment is beneficial or not, is the risk versus benefit. It also emphasizes the accounts of a small number of doctors raising doubts and a small number of cherrypicked case studies in the article (all of which conveniently stop short of showing long term effects) over the experiences of practicing doctors, each of whom individually probably treat many times the amount of patients mentioned in the article (and from a more representative sample) and who have far more experience and education on matters of medicine.
Yeah. I work in a convenience store in a very right leaning area. I've found that showing the more reasonable people that you have things in common makes it more likely that they'll be an ally. People I never expected to be kind to me have been so in a way I'm equally as lucky. Honestly it's hilarious having people that would normally be against trans people will say stuff like "if I ever see someone harassing you they'll have a problem with me.".
