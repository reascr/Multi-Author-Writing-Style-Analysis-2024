A bunch of idots in the state decided that they could simply do a referendum with the citizens to create a non-partisan redistricting committee and set the rules for creating the boundaries. Utah's constitution gives that authority to only the legislature. Once the citizen initive passed there were two choices. A) it would have gone to the state courts and found in violation of the constitution. B) Legislature could amend the new "law" to make it an advisory committee ONLY. That's what the legislature did. Went to the state courts because the group behind the initiative got their feelings hurt that the legislature passed a new law amending the one passed to make it constitutional.
Part A) State courts have a constitutional duty to see if the law (redistricting) violates the state constitution or other state laws. Federal Courts have a constitutional duty to see if the law (redistricting) violates the Federal Constitution.
What do you mean by this? Since Rucho, courts have said gerrymandering doesn't violate the federal constitution.
Agreed 100%. If anything, it is seeming like a 6-3 vote against this. I think Justice Jackson's part in the oral arguments had Barrett very confused on whether she heard David Thonpson right. These oral arguments are actually turning out to be pretty interesting.
