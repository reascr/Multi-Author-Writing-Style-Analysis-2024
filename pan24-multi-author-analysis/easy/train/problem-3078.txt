I believe you. I’ve been to Russia a few times myself (even spent 3 months living in Saint Petersburg). And I haven’t had any issues at all. Russia is a pretty fucked up place at the moment and the actions of the government are inexcusable, so I understand going there now can be a bad idea, but there’s still great people there and amazing things to see, do and experience. I’m really grateful for having had the chance to travel there myself before things really hit the fan. It really made me lose a lot of prejudices I had for the country. Reading the comments on this post (and others) about how Russia is nothing more than a grey hell hole and that people would never even consider visiting is just sad and ignorant. I truly believe the world would be a better place if people saw more of the world and their cultures, and dared to question their beliefs and prejudices even if it’s about “the enemy”.
Entirely ethical? Maybe not. But we're talking about Russia, who are currently attacking a sovereign nation and are not above poisoning people with radioactive capsules. So I dunno.
