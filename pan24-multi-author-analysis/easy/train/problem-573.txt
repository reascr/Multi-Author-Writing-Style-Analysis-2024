There seems to be a phenomenon in the lgbt community where critique regardless of context is re contextualized as have speech, people who dislike the notion of children transitioning are entitled to hold that position.
Yeah, no. I didn't elect her. She's not my district representative. I voted for Neguse, who is our district representative. Do you know how districting works for the House of Reps? It's not statewide.
Edit: Or, even better, insisting that males wearing clothes and makeup associated with the other female sex is "blatantly sexualized characterization". Children have certainly never dressed up for fun in unconventional ways before, of their own accord Exposing them to adults dressing up is DANGEROUS and EVIL Drag shows explicitly limited to adults only, for being raunchy, are basically equal to a male in makeup reading a book to kids.
Move those goal posts. Now it is alcohol laws and not the Drag show. Once again age appropriateness is the Parents purview and not yours. "Think of the children".
