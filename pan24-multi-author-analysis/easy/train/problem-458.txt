Republicans would have absolutely TANKED this deal if it was sent back and delayed. I don't know how else to make that clear. Republicans would not have cared at all if they were at fault....they would ignore it, their constituents would ignore it...even conservative leaning rail workers getting dicked over by their own party would fall in line and blame the Democrats.
They're blaming Democrats no matter what...there are ZERO scenarios where something is not going to be blamed on Democrats, no matter how perfect it is. The power of their propaganda has too many damn people assuming Biden turned his backs on these workers...it's depressing to watch.
Please don't fall for the propaganda pushing the idea that Biden abandoned rail workers. Take time to understand how frustrating it is to collaborate anything with Republicans right now...they would have killed the bill entirely if paid leave was in there..then would have sat on their hands blaming Democrats for the fallout even though Republicans would have been directly responsible.
