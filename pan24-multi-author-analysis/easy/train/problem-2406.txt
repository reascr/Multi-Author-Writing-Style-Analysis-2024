Really appreciate your engagement. Most of what I speak about is really a hangover from previous administrations and forced compromise for Biden. It will take significant effort to change the thinking. For example, I am an advocate for social programs more focused on giving people an opportunity to be self sufficient rather than a give away. Additionally having personally witnessed abuse of the PPP loan program and it's consequences, we need to be better at thinking the problem and SOLUTIONS through more carefully. Giving assistance without a commitment from the receiver to do what they are capable of doing to make their own life better not only diminishes the value of the help but also creates an environment of entitlement. Flip the script, same goes for the successful elite.
