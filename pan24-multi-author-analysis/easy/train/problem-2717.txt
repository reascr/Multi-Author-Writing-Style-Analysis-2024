"Oh, you want more arrow? Find stick. Break stone. Kill eagle. Is easy Ukrainian forest full of ammunition Too bad for you is also full of Ukrainians.".
Theres an interview with one of the vdv prisoners of war,what happend was west intel told ukraine who was coming and where,the russians plan got countered and ukraine grinded them to dust,once the vdv commanders figured out they where boned they abandoned their own men to die,the other elite dudes i know of was putins private police army he sent in got stomped hard it was surreal they actually charged tyhe front wearing hand cuffs and had vans packed with riot gear,from what ive read the real special forces also suffered heavy losses but details has been very little from both sides but i suspect they got used like infantry and not what they are supposed to do,but since then its been very little noise about them.
That doesn't sound very elite. Perhaps it takes more than vodka, a spetsnaz badge, and a willingness to rape and pillage to create elite soldiers, but we'll never know because they're dying faster than they can be replaced. What a shame.
