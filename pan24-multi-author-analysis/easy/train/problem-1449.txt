What Serbians? The majority of the population absolutely does not believe that. If your frame of reference is the minority ultranationalist population, then that's like taking the opinions of Trump supporters and extrapolating that to all Americans.
Hi, dweeb here. They're called small arms because we categorize guns by caliber, and weapons meant to be used by individuals or some that are crew served are considered small caliber (proportionally speaking to shit like battleship cannons).
No we dont. I dont know how people in this sub constantly fall for Serbias bluff when it comes to Kosovo problem. Serbia (or Kosovo) do stupid shit oftenly and escalate tensions so they can use that at negotiating table (so when they deescalate they can look at EU or USA and say "see, im cooperating and making concesions, now its his turn").
Absolutely not. Open conflict would immediately draw NATO in, and NATO firepower will end open conflict as soon as it starts. There'd be nothing to gain for Russia to throw bodies in to that action.
