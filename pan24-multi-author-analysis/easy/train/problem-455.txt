When Pence was the governor of Indiana, the University of Notre Dame hosted major Holocaust conferences, with leading Catholic cardinals from around the world, Jewish leaders from around the world, and many prominent American Protestant leaders in all denominations, as well as leaders from non-monotheistic traditions -- and many, many Holocaust survivors who were still alive. It hosted part of Steven Spielberg's Holocaust Project. Spielberg worked closely with Notre Dame, and particularly with a very senior rabbi who was tenured at Notre Dame, to host theological conversations about the Holocaust, at Notre Dame. He was worried that if those conversations were held at Yeshiva, they'd be ignored; but if they were held at Notre Dame, one of the leading Christian theological institutions in the English-speaking world, they'd be respected and heard.
Yes. A good apology should fix it right up. He spent four years with the man and still doesn’t get it/ Trump never says he’s sorry. NEVER! And Pence is a ponce who lives off Trump’s earnings. He has no there there on his own.
