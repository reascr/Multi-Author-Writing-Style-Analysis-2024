In 2018 the polling predicted a blue wave and it was right, but Democrats also picked up seats in unexpected places and bright red districts, in that cycle Democrats over-performed in the election as compared to the polls.
And now, in 2022, the polling seems to have indicated that Democrats were dead in the water as far as the House was concerned, and might be able to retain their tie in the Senate, then in the actual election Democrats did surprisingly well in the House and might even end up gaining a seat in the Senate.
In 2020 the polling suggested that Trump and Biden would have a tight race (which they did, sort of) but also that the Democratic party would pick up something like five seats in the Senate and win a clear majority, instead we saw Republicans voting for Biden at the top of the ticket and voting for Republicans at the bottom of the ticket, and the Senate ended up with a 50/50 tie.
Hi! I actually just voted for Warnock about an hour ago. . My question: to what degree do you think the current statewide political landscape is directly attributable to Donald Trump turning off so many moderate Republican voters? I do not understand how the state went from having uniform Republican control statewide to having Senators like Warnock and Ossoff in such a short amount of time.
