This might not be clear to people living outside the US, but Fox news is the most watched "news" channel on US television. They've systematically brainwashed people to the point where they legitimately do not have a reasonable conception of what is happening anymore. Beyond that, we have even worse right wing propaganda channels that literally come with cable packages. In general, average US citizens have next to zero media literacy, at this point. And now CNN has been bought and is being tilted rightward. Further, Sinclair Media Group has been purchasing local news organizations in big bundles across the country. They're cornering people with propaganda. And this is following decades of AM radio and newspapers and on and on and on. It's bleak.
