The issue back when this was killing people in the 80s was they were feeding the cows their own byproducts, like brains. That was causing it to spread so I assume this practice has stopped.
Incineration. Burning at very high temperature breaks peptide bonds in the protein and turns any organic material into carbon. This would be a much higher temperature than your typical autoclave meant to kill bacteria, viruses, and spores, which is usually up to 135C albeit under pressure.
