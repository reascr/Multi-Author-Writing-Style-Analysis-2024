We could try and cut down the suicide rate by improving health care. We could try to cut down on violent crime. Or we could focus on a class of firearm that's used in a very small percentage of violent crimes, while alienating people like myself for whom this is a sticking point for fully supporting Democrats, and gleefully feeding Republicans all the dumbass scare tactic headlines they want.
Expensive? Yes. Though in this situation dangling a large juicy carrot is far better than hitting people with a big stick. That comes when the amnesty ends and all of those firearms are definitely illegal.
Citation? What the buyback was meant for - lowering mass shootings worked really well. 13 in the past 18 years before the ban. Zero afterwards.
I'm a very good shot. I used to be part of a Junior Olympic marksmanship team. On my wall, I have 12 medals from sectionals, and two State bronze medals. The sport taught me patience and discipline. I still go to the range regularly, as it's fun and relaxing.
