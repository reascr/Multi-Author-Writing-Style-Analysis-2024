Conservative Independents may go back if DeSantis is the candidate and Republicans are making visible changes in policy, but looking at them right now, it would seem that they'll stay tainted with far-right MAGA supporters for some time still. In the meantime, I expect Democrats will be looking to both enact a more progressive social safety net, but still court Conservatives behind the scenes with neo-liberal policy proposals that will ultimately drive Democrat voters away again.
I expect the Democratic party will probably take on a lot more conservative qualities since Republicans will probably continue fleeing their party and having nowhere else to go. So, there might be more compromise within that party, but outside of it will be no different. If not worse.

Exactly. We only defeat these people if we stay engaged. They are determined to turn the US into a fascist hellscape. We need to be even more determined to stop them.
