This is not what US officials are saying at all, people need to stop posting just for headlines and actually read. All the US is saying is they want Zelenskiy to drop his stance of not negotiating with Russia while Putin is alive. Thatâ€™s it. This is the dem letter all over again.
Idk, maybe at the collapse of the Soviet Union we didn't increase the size and expansion of NATO, reasonably dealt with the corruption of the 2014 Ukrainians coup that ultimately lead to the allegations from Trump in the 2020 elections, circumventing all this war-hawk talk and 18+ billion in aid through diplomacy. But instead we doubled down on our global "one super power/global police", increased our military budget and expansion (meddling) focused into destabilizing the region (Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Turkey, Afghanistan, etc) and paved the way to only lead to war.
