Well Guiliani et al got disbarred. I say that's deterrance since a lawyer doesn't want to get disbarred. Trump could hypothetically bring a pro se complaint without one, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that would be so hilariously incoherent, the judge will bust out the unintelligibility canon, the rule that says if the text is truly gibberish, the judge can ignore it basically. Okay I kind of lied, unintelligibility canon is for statutory construction not poorly written complaints. While a pro se litigant is generally given more wiggle room by a judge, its not infinite. Like if the pro se litigant writes a motion to squash not a motion to quash and otherwise doesn't use the perfect terminology but still gets the idea right, the judge will interpret it as the right thing. This goes to the idea of to not hold form over substance. The law cares about what it is, not what you call it.
South America countries and having their democratically elected socialist leaders dethroned and executed by American-supported military coups.
