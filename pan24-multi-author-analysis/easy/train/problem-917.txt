My comment stands. Charges for murdering and torturing people says nothing about whether or not authorities support the environment, so summarizing it as a win for the environment is both an unfounded claim, as well as an insensitive one to their families/supporters who almost assuredly see this first and foremost as a heinous crime against their loved ones rather than nature.
I can't. not anymore. I dont belong on this side of your fenced in chemical orgy. I dont even care if I'm blamed by the people for coming from this nightmare factory, I just cant do this anymore. When you come to a point where you don't believe in the direction and aims of your country, what do you do? Where do you go? I'm not fighting anyone but I am happy to be a human shield against the mindless violence my people inflict on the world as if they're doing it a favour.
Rhetorical questions. My thoughts are that poverty needs to be addressed. There is nary a better motivator than hunger.
Enjoy extinction. From what I've seen, it's a fog of nightmares that settles in and leaves nothing but parasites and decomp behind. Silence except for the chewing of termites, all so we could play Jetsons for a human lifetime. Nice job.
