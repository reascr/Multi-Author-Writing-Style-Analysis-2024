This finding may have resolved that dilemma. First it's evidence Homo erectus went fishing. But more even more important: wildfires typically burn at temperatures of 800 C/1470 F. The chemical structure of these fish teeth remains is evidence of a lower temperature burn, under 500 C. The chemistry probably can't pinpoint the temperatures closer than that, yet it's good enough to rule out natural causes and place this in the range of cooking temperatures. And it's near what seems to be something like a fireplace or a fire pit.
I really love all the migration periods/discussions. Part of me (no proof) thinks that there was probably far more interspecies relations between various homonids during various migrations, complicating the subject.
Parasites…. Uhh… look, ancient humans definitely got parasites from their food. It didn’t kill them though, since parasites tend to want to have a host that is alive, but it definitely contributed to a low life expectancy.
Lastly, "premium" membership options. You give out most major news for free, but lock certain things behind a premium. I think these types tend to make most people upset, but wanted to bring it in as an option.
