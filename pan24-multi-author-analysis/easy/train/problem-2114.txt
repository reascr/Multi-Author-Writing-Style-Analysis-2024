first Putin knows that the longer he waits, the better the Ukraine Army would be, second he thought US will abandon ally like Iraq. Third, US is posing great threat to his dictatorship by willingly accepting Ukraine to NATO and spreading democracy( I mean why would he care about that, Russia will forever be under his rule until hes dead, in the next 20 years no democracy is strong enough to dethrone him, why risk having so much headache, is being the richest people on earth not enough for him?). Fourth, he thought that Covid seriously weakened US. Fifth, he thought that Zelensky is a comedian with no ball, too bad he messed with the Joker. Sixth, he sorrounded himself with yesman who thought he can win this war fast and easy, but his subordinates are inept and dumb.
Absolutely. We may look back at this last year from some time in the future as the year when Russia was removed removed itself as a threat to western civilization just because, ulitimately, of this administrations handling of the invasion of Ukraine. Sure, the other allies have played a huge roll too, but if the US hadn't put its foot firmly down, they would not have had the confidence in the outcome to have stood onside.
