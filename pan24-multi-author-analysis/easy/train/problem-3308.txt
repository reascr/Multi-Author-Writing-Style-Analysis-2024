If it is a weather balloon, I accept that. But I think China would warn "hey, a civilian weather balloon went off track and will end up North America. So relax." Or maybe they did but it's not being reported. It also doesn't make any sense that it would be a spy balloon since everyone saw it coming. Also if it was a spy balloon why not shoot a down? I keep hearing "because they don't know how to". Trillions of dollars of military equipment and you don't know how to shoot down a balloon? I also hear "its because they want to study it, intercept its messages". But why would China send a balloon that everyone saw coming just for it to get hacked?
Informed consent is an important ethical consideration in scientific research. Chinese scientists should have requested US government consent to collect their own US weather data as part of whatever scientific interest they have in global weather patterns. Why would Chinese scientists ignore the importance of informed consent? Any weather data is already likely to be distorted by any unknown US interference, which would be bad for scientific research.
