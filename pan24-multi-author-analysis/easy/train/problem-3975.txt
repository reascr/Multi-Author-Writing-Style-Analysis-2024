Yeah, it's almost impossible to predict how states will swing - it was thought that Alaska would be a blue state and Hawaii a red state, for example - but it's also important to note that PR allows you to vote in either primary rather than having to register for the party ahead of time. So it could also be that some people thought it was more important to vote in the Dem primary. And in 2020 the GOP didn't run a primary in PR, just polled the party leaders.
Hispanic essentially means “from a Spanish-speaking population”. That includes people from Spain and almost every North American and South American country except Canada, the US, Brazil, Haiti, French Guiana, and a handful of Caribbean islands, as well as the descendants of people from these populations. “Hispanic” is an insanely broad term encompassing many different people and cultures. “Mexican” just means from Mexico. You’re example with “Asian” vs “Chinese” is similar, with both “Mexican” and “Chinese” referring to a country and people/things from that country, but “Asian” refers to the continent Asia, which is more like a geographical distinction, whereas “Hispanic” refers to “Spanish-speaking”, which is more like a linguistic distinction.
