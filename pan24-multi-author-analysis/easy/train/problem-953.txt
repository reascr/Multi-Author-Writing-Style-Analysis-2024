Let the enemy tire itself out simply trying to supply it's troops at distance in enemy territory, raiding supply lines and probing defenses until they appear weak enough.
HA! This is business as usual for the Russian navy. Read the prewar maintenance report from the Moskva. As a sailor, that was horrifying. And the deemed it a 'Pass'.
Even if we take at face value the claim that Russia can mobilize more people and deliver them to the front, this also helps explain the Ukrainian strategy of attacking supply lines rather than enemy formations directly: if they have such a large quantity of people, how are they going to feed them?
Thank you. We have now reached the 50,000 mark on postings of the "Russian ships are now or will soon be submarines" joke. You have put us over the top. Congratulations!
No, but the roles dictate it. Carriers are usually the flagship of whatever unit they're attached to. And a heavy cruiser such as the Nakimov is the biggest class of modern ship after carriers. They would be the ship the the Admiral sets up his command in.
