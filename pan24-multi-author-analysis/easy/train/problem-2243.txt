Hannibal used something similar against the Roman's in the second punic war. Fabius, the Roman dictator, had him boxed into a valley with only 2 exits. When the Roman's saw him approach an exit, they reinforced it with troops from the other exit. So one night, Hannibal strapped torches to all the pack animals in his army and marched them to one exit, while his main force went for the other exit with no lights. It worked and Hannibal broke out of the valley to continue running laps around the Romans in Italy for 15 years.
Wow interesting. Love when people up top blame their failures on the people on the bottom. Sounds like everything that is going wrong in the world. And to make matters worse it involves death. Fucking evil bastards.
edit: as other users have pointed out, serfdom was not reinstated per say, but core aspects of it were kept in place (Alexander II's successor canceled plans for giving the peasants elected representation in government, their education/enpowerment was not supported or encouraged, and most significantly, in 1893 they were legally tied back to their communes and could not leave without permission).
