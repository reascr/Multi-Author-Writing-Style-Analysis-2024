Nope, my post contains 0% cope and 100% ridicule. I can tell you why. There is a Twitter Space that has been running 24/7 since the evening before the invasion. A psychologist checks in every now and then. He likens Russia's nuclear posturing to a person threatening suicide. In a way it would be, but not because we nuke them back. In the beginning you put the patient on suicide watch, the longer they keep talking about it the less measure you take because after a while the chances are pretty much zero. Russia has been talking about it since the very early days of the war and we are closing in on a year now. For that reason alone it's not going to happen. But there is more. Russia is not backed into a corner, never has been. They fight a war of choice. They can choose to stop it any time. They have laid out the narrative why they lost already. They wanted to fight Ukraine, but they found out that all of NATO has troops on the ground (they don't) and that's why they can't progress in their "special campaign". They also totally control the narrative inside Russia anyway.
Exactly. They don't comprehend that Trump is running again and that he is still preaching the big lie and crying about how every election is fraud now. Meanwhile, Hillary lives rent free inside all their heads and she is completely powerless and isn't seeking power anymore.
