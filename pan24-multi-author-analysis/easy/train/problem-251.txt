Corporations have essentially legalized monopolies in the digital world. They point to the fact that they have multiple competitors, but if those competitors donâ€™t have level access to the same marketplace (Amazon Prime, Apple App Store, Uber Rideshare, etc) then the Marketplace essentially becomes the monopoly, not the product or service.
