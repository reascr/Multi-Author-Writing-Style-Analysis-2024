The only S-300 missile that those fragments fit is 5V55. It's a SARH missile, so it homes on a target that the ground radar is locked on. It can be used in that mode as a ground attack missile, but there is one small issue. The target and the radar have to be in a line of sight. Ukraine doesn't have any other means for a ground attack with this system. If the missile was homing on let's say another aerial target, at the very moment the computer registers "miss" and calculates that the missile doesn't have enough energy to reacquire - it self destructs. Exactly for reason to NOT hit the ground in one piece. If the auto destruction fails, the missile crashes, but usually doesn't explode (usually it's already out of fuel and the warhead needs a detonator to explode) and you can pick a pretty big parts. For identification purpose.
Eh.. I get it, and I agree with Meloni that it doesn't matter whose missile it is - if it was a Ukrainian s300 then it was still a result of russia's attacks. But denying it after allies have established the facts is not a good look.
