The thing about projection though is that the idea provides a tool for understanding people's psyche, and an important part is that it is an unconscious impulse. The way I understand it, it can either be expressed as a defense mechanism defending one's own deep-down known faults, projecting the same motivations on others — "yes I do this, sure, but look, everybody does" — or maybe it's just because they think that way and so just assume everybody does: when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail.

Russia was only successful in bombing a theater, a shopping center, hospitals with expecting mothers Schools playgrounds etc. The Ukrainian army is very intelligent They know exactly how the Russian leadership thinks and what they're capable of doing. There're no rules For instance, the so called cease fire on January 6th and 7th. That was an ugly joke. Everyone saw through that one. Justice is coming.
