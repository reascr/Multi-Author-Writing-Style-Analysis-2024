I did not get that impression at all, and it doesn't seem like people who investigated her thought she was a sociopath either. She grew up in a wealthy family and was pressured into succeeding, she idolized Steve Jobs and had similar ideas to revolutionize Biotech in University, to which her professors thought were impossible. She persevered with her blood test idea, while knowing it wouldn't work she thought she could keep going and buy time until it finally does. Entrepreneurs do take similar risks, when the iPhone first launched it really didn't work and the network couldn't support it, but that didn't stop the iPhone from becoming the biggest smart phone. Her risk obviously failed and may not have been a good risk to take, but her reasons for not backing down tie back to her pressured upbringing, arrogance in her abilities and embarrassment that made her reluctant to admit she was wrong and move on. Instead of coming to light with the embarrassing truth, she tried to keep the prestigious lie going.
Exactly. Rich people only go to jail when they steal from other rich people. And when that happens, they get their ducks in a row to make sure you go away for a long time.
