I work for a municipality that tried to do municipal isp with a fiber optic network in the early 2000s. This would have been a huge benefit not just in providing low cost high quality internet but it would have been a huge boost in economic development. AT&T and others came out in force with massive marketing campaigns against the project basically saying you don’t want the government to see your browser history(porn). The campaign worked very well and the community didn’t get an option for commercial fiber until almost two decades later. Not sure the calculus that goes on in peoples brain that figures it’s better if a massive corporation has my data rather than my local government when the corporations have every reason to sell you information to whoever including the government.
3. Amtrak trains under a certain lenh are required to be partially funded by state governments, even in situations where Amtrak has the money, interest, and capacity to fund it themselves. This has somewhat changed under Biden (these days I think for the first five years Amtrak is allowed to subsidize the cost to run the railway), but it has historically been why in some of the regions where rail/HSR would be a no brainer (for example the Chicago corridor, Florida, or Ohio) a single Republican governor could show up and kill an entire project and no one could do anything about it even if the population was in favor and voted for it.
