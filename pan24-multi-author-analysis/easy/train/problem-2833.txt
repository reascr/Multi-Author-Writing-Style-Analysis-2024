Then the society is left with choices. Target the destructive behaviors (quell the rebellion) or target the underlying sense of hopelessness. I'm not surprised that throughout history the first option is much more common. Society tends to want to maintain its structure which caused the reaction that needs to be addressed, and addressing the underlying causes is usually really expensive (both monetarily and politically). Eliminating slavery would end slave revolts, but it would also tank the economy and cause a massive political reaction at best (for example - although Lincoln was opposed to slavery it was not clear he had the political capital to actually eliminate it until the south rebelled over fear he would and even then he only personally abolished it in the rebelling states because that was an easier lift).
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
