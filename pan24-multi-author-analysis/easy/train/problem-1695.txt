irrelevant for the argument. If they want to win, going nuclear is not an option. If they want to survive, going nuclear is not an option. If they don't care about either, then going nuclear is useless as well. Either way, Russia has nothing to gain from using nukes.
If Russia hits european cities with nuclear weapons, do you think we still should avoid any response to it? I mean, the issue would still be the exact same.
Im just saying and Im pretty sure Russia does not need this right now, i also read on some news that the missiles are from Ukrainian army but majority of news blame Russia, and as i said whatever shit happens now it would be on Russia and thats the path you go if you want to spread this war on a much bigger scale, but i really dont know who's gonna profit from this if we start a nuclear war, and we are getting closer.
I don't know. For me personally, the border has already been crossed much earlier. When Russia started shooting passenger jets and assassinated civilians in our streets. When Russian troops invaded another country, killed thousands and sent us millions of refugees. But I guess, let's learn nothing from WW2 and simply repeat it Let's have Russia prepare their army properly so they can hit us in the most effective way possible before we ever do any consequences.
