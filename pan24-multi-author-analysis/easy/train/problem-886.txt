It's important to be objective regarding the Balkan wars. What Serbs did to Albanians, Bosnians & Croatians is not much different than what Albanians, Bosnians & Croatians did to Serbs. In the Ottoman times, the occupying Turks used Albanians as auxiliary troops to massacre Serbian civilians. In World War II the Albanians and Bosnians had their own Nazi SS units (SS Skanderbeg and SS Handschar) which again slaughtered Serbian civilians. You speak about genocide denial, where were the Nuremburg-esque trials for Croatian Ustase regime who ran one of the largest concentration camps in Europe - operated so damn brutally that even the Italian & German Nazi officers were abhorred by the torture & slaying that occured there (imagine a Nazi being abhorred by war crimes!). We all remember the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, where Serbs killed Bosniak civilians. What if I told you it wasn't the first Srebrenica massacre? Sometime around 1992, Bosniak militant (Naser Oric) committed a similar attack on the Serb population of Srebrenica. Actually, some of the first casualties of the Bosnian war were Serb (where Ramiz Delalic slaughtered the father-of-a-groom at a peaceful wedding in 1992, or where 12-year old Serb Slobodan Stojanovic had his organs cut & shot in temple by Elfeta Veseli in 1992). Even after the NATO intervention in 1999 to protect Albanians in Kosovo, Serb civilians & children were continuously attacked and/or slaughtered (Podujevo bus bombing, Bistrica beach atrocity, Staro Gracko massacre, slaughter of Dimitrije Popovic & even within the last 30 days [Stefan Tomic, Stefan Stojanovic & Milos Stejanovic]).
Ha! I mean they funded your war to commit atrocities and ethnic cleansing through out the Balkans. So now that they want something in return you have an issue??? How very Serbian of you. Line up your boys and send em off.
