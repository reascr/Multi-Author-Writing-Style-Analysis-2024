In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Absolutely agree. I love some of the Sufi poets and artists and that Muslim community has been persecuted and oppressed for centuries. It’s not Islamaphobic to ask some Muslims to not murder other Muslims. It’s pro an expansion of Islamic cultural understanding.
Nope. Anyone can try to censor something. If someone rips pages out of a book they don’t want others to read it’s censorship. If the book banners take books out if your library they don’t want you to read its censorship.
Outrageous, truly. We cannot give in to religions zealots whether they are from Utah, Alabama, Israel or Saudi Arabia. We cannot let those who hate secular learning destroy truth in the name of mythology.
