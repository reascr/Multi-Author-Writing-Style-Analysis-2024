Notice all the new details that have emerged? He kept classified documents in his garage beside his corvette. But somehow, this is justifiable? How can Biden’s mishandling of classified documents be more justifiable than Trumps mishandling of documents? Why did the National Archives request documents from Trump but not Obama and Biden? Today it was announced that more documents were found inside Biden’s home. This makes 3 separate locations that classified documents were located. Do you think the FBI will raid Biden’s properties to look for more? How was the National Archives aware of all missing Trump documents and unaware of Biden’s? Not to mention, Trump was President and had absolute authority to declassify documents at will. Vice presidents do not have this authority. Whether you see it or not there is a double standard. As I said, both sides are F’ed up. But I find it very annoying when one side acts more righteous than the other.
