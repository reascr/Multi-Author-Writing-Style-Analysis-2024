...where large companies gradually take over governments with their own police force, army, legislative institution, lobby or rather direct influence that effectively controls politicians, and so on.
You're not wrong. But as a practical matter Russia is already set up this way (Putin "owns" Gazprom and simply allows it's CEO to act like a minister in his government or a trusted subordinate). You'd never want the official head of a country to also be the official head of a company because running a country takes a huge amount of work and you ultimately will need to delegate every kind of sub-division to someone else. Minister of Education, CEO of State oil company, Minister of Defence, etc. etc. etc. etc.
If Russia this seems quite similar, the advantage those systems have is that if for example their leader would be very much into environmental protection or far better nutrition for all their people (I mean healthier people) they would just be able to make this a government priority and everyone's issue by law.
