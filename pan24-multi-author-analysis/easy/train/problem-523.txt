In my country you won't get money from government if you, in your accounts, have what amounts to more than roughly 2000$. You'll get it as soon as you don't, though.
Here is the real problem, at least in California: with me currently not working and I haven't worked since the beginning of the pandemic I currently receive medical which covers every single doctor of any kind and all my prescriptions my urologist my optometrist my glasses my dentist and my root canals and fillings and cleanings my appendicitis and er visits my absolutely every medical bill. my depression medication my psychiatrist my psychologist my rehab, I received $350 a month in food stamps which also allows me to receive the lifeline program which gives me a free 4G phone with 10 GB of data and unlimited talk and text. If I start working and if I make more than $1,400 a month which almost every job forces me to make more than even if I don't want to work that much as I am going back to college, I either entirely lose my benefits or I partially lose them and have to start paying out of pocket so even though I'm actually making cash, it all goes to deductibles and prescriptions and doctors visits and food and my phone bill.
