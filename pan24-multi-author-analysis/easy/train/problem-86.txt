If we do that we will sink into a bottomless hole. Why are you phrasing it as if it's some sort of conclusion? It's completely the other way around: there is a very good understanding of right and wrong, and which countries are on that spectrum on various issues. The ones that are on the wrong side, ideally, would not have a say. Of course, the UN is not built this way.
Armenia, Argentina, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Eritrea, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Libya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mexico, Montenegro, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, Pakistan, Paraguay, Poland, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uzbekistan and Venezuela.
