Well, probably you didn't do enough, but did the others? Do you have a right to voice this hypocrisy? When even now not all sanctions imposed against Kremlin and Russian elites, but to satisfy angry mob western governments take pseudo-measures that target regular russians only.
And speaking of which sanctions target regular russians specifically, already mentioned travel ban is prime example. Regular russians don't travel much due being, well, quite poor and for them it was mostly a way to escape from Russia, especially during mobilization, while many russian elites still enjoy second citizenship or permanent residency in countries of Europe.
Maybe. There are various reasons - money, elderly parents, disabilities - that means some decent people canâ€™t leave. Some people might actually want their home to change and stay and fight in some way. Not all Russians are horrible people, anymore than all Americans are (although as an American, I think the vast majority of the majority ethnicity here are completely spoiled and far too comfortable to get that most people in the world actually face hardship).
