After this lithium jackpot, America is gonna keep India in higher priority than ever before. Any quasi-governmental/terrorist outfits would think a million times before making any move. India has become way more powerful even in the last 9 years. Any unilateral attempt at changing the status quo by terrorists will be met with the wrath of Rashtriya Rifles whom I believe in. RR will hunt em down like hounds hunting game. If at all the army intelligence picks up sus activity, Iâ€™d suggest the army to initiate corp exercises along the borders with all the artillery, and other heavy arms, just the sight of that will make Pakistan tremble with fear. All that being said this whole situation it self is highly unlikely in my POV.
Serious question. Most of the Kashmiri Muslims who have escaped so called persecution and run away are settled comfortably in England while wanting to unite with Pakistan. Why not hop across the border and go to Pakistan?. Why was there no issue in Kashmir till the 80s when Pakistan decided to send extremists there? In fact Kashmir on the Indian side had top notch universities and was the crown jewel of Indian tourism. Can someone point what exactly has been done on the Pak side of Kashmir? Crickets.
