Though this has also fallen on the back of a separate sort of issue that happened as a result of the "war on political correctness" and well... racism. Which is simply this. The Republicans defeated political correctness, political correctness was at least an attempt at accountability and actionable consequence for doing bad and wrong things. They waged a war on it and defeated it to enable them to do terrible things with little to no political consequence and it worked. They suffer practically zero movement of the proverbial political needle when doing AWFUL things even things that hurt the very people that are propping them up. Now what that has to do with racism is that it essentially enabled the fascism in broad daylight. Their ability to say with a straight face that attempts to highlight and combat racism as a force against racism being used to call those people and entities racist has essentially turned reality over and has created a shroud with which conservatives can go full authoritarian/fascist because and this has been very observable... they can just call anyone fascist who dares identify and call them out as fascist. When you can unironically call a person the thing you yourself literally are... that creates an insanely comforting environment for the worst of the worst.
