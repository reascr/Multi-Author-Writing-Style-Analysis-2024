Holy shit! It’s widely been believed that Ukraine would prefer to not push across the Dniper and move south back towards Mariupol. If anything this means Russia isn’t capable as the West believed at holding off any river crossings. (Even if this is a small one).
The biggest part of this is that the West (particularly intelligence agencies and militaries) planned around the basic assumption that they would be facing an opponent that was logistically competent, with vehicles and equipment that were approximately equal in capabilities (T-72/90s being about the same as Leopard IIs and Abrams).
Like, this is flooring the hell out of me. Russia’s superpower/great power status has seemingly evaporated.
I say this as a Westerner. Sometimes our governments stick our collective noses where they have business being and pick fights which are not ours to fight. Be wary of all politicians.
I’m starting to question if Russia’s nukes are even operational… My personal conspiracy theory now is if the US gave Ukraine a Patriot battery and wasn’t worried about escalation because their Intel might have suggested Russia already attempted to carry out a nuclear test (underground or in the arctic) and it failed.
