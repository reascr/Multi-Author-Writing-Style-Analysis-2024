Aside from the fact that you’re signing away your 4th amendment rights when you home grow, the maximum is reasonable. But home growing just isn’t an option for a lot of people. I have 2 teenagers so it’s out of the question for me. When they’re older I’ll probably go that route. For now I’m happy with my med card until we can pass better legislation. But it doesn’t matter. It’s polling at like 62%, it’s definitely gonna pass. And now my quiet little med dispos are gonna be jam packed.
We had the chance to be a national model until greed and the dishonesty about minority inclusion so this continues a long history of corporations and white people showing predatory behavior towards specific demographics in our society. And we're gonna help usher that in smh.
A small hope, an imagined possiblity, is that as all the states surrounding Missouri eventually give into the economic and poplar pressures exacerbated by their neighbor's decriminalization, and decriminalize marijuana themselves even more liberally (in a classic sense), Missouri's extant pot Walmarts and corporate masters have to give in and contribute to effecting change once more so Missouri remains economically relevant in the post prohibition US. I apologize for that beastly sentence, but I don't regret it.
