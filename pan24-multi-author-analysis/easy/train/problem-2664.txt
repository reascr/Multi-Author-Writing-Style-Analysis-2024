I just won an almost three decade-year-old bet with a family member I haven’t a relationship with any longer. There’s nothing all that satisfying about it now. It wouldn’t be a wise-mind activity to gloat, and that’s just poor sportsmanship as well (truly 1 I am sorry for the sexist word). I’m gonna to simply leave this bit below here and that will be the end of it, because it’s not about winning. It’s just not about winning.
The megaraptor remains they found "also include some unusual remains of unenlagia, velociraptor-like dinosaurs which likely lived covered in feathers.".
“Jan 16 (Reuters) - Scientists in Chile's Patagonia region are unearthing the southernmost dinosaur fossils recorded outside Antarctica, including remains of megaraptors that would have dominated the area's food chain before their mass extinction.
Fossils of megaraptors, a carnivorous dinosaur that inhabited parts of South America during the Cretaceous period some 70 million years ago, were found in sizes up to 10 meters long, according to the Journal of South American Earth Sciences.”.
I won and I WIN. Twenty-nine years later it must feel shameful for you to read this (not that you are or anything).
