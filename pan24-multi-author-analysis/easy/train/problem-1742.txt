Only thing though about the nut jobs screaming about Greys as you say is. Do you or can you prove this is all bullshit? There is you . Then there are literally thousands of people that have claimed to have been abducted by Greys. Might not be Aliens from another planet . Possibly an ancient advanced civilization or dimensional beings but there is definitely something going on in this world that has been discussed for 75 years. By everyone from Joe blow out in the backwoods to Congressmen, Senators, Astronauts, and even presidents. ðŸ‘½.
Extraterrestrial, dimension hopping, Atlantis, time travellers... I've seen people claim all of the above. There is no real general consensus because for every rational person that is open to the possibility of extraterrestrial life there's a total nutball screaming about "Greys" conspiring with Eisenhower to be allowed to kidnap a set amount of citizens every year.
These balloons are big. A few .50 rounds wouldnt pop it like a party balloons. Holes that size would only cause it to lose gas at a rate so slow as to be almost inconsequential.
