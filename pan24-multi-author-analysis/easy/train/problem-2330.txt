Gore didn’t contest the election. He asked for a hand recount in 2000, something he was entitled to under Florida law. Bush went to court and stopped it. Later recounts by the press indicated Gore might very well have won. Hillary Clinton did not contest the 2016 election. She conceded once the states were called for trump. Jill Stein fraudulently raised money purportedly on Hillary’s behalf (not supported by Hillary) for recounts in some of the close states, none of which ever happened. Hillary advised Biden not to concede until the votes were counted. She said nothing about a contest.
It wasn't the first time Republicans made that claim, it was visible with Merrick Garland (a merely American president can't nominate judges to the Supreme Court), congressional subpoenas (Republicans routinely ignore them) and the ACA (right wing health care reform, but illegitimate and intolerable because it was enacted by Americans).
Everything. Hillary didn’t say trump didn’t win. She won the popular vote. She conceded the election, so wtf are you saying she said he didn’t win. Also Al gore didn’t do what you said.
