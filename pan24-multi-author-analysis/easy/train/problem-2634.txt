How do you balance an affirmation of multiculturalism with the unspoken presumption that western liberal values are simply better than other cultural values? If you can argue that the women in those cultures have all been brainwashed, then you can just as easily make the argument that women in the west have been brainwashed by liberalism, unless you are operating under the unspoken assumption that those women from non-liberal cultures are tantamount to naive children who cannot think for themselves without the help of re-education from the west.
Crab bucket. They don't want to see people having an easier time than they did, so they drag future generations down to their level. It's a fairly common human thing, pulling the ladder up after yourself.
The west can't even ask itself questions about what meta-cultural human values might be, or what basis we might have for even believing such values could have validity, bc the west has essentially abandoned the concept of genuinely real moral objects, even though we operate under the unspoken assumption that such moral objects do indeed exist.
