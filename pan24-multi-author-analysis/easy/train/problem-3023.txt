The Republican party is very tied to the defense industry. Lockheed, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Boeing... they all all have lobbyists and they are very good at what they do. If you think for one minute that the defense industry doesn't have that level of influence, go look at the defense budget. It also helps that most defense contractors hold conservative values about patriotism both at the company level as well as the employee level. It's not all of them, but it is a majority. The only Republicans that would vote to stop funding Ukraine are hardliners that are doing it just to make Biden look bad. If they win, that wont be a priority anymore. Only thing that would change that is if Trump becomes president, but it looks like a lot of that party is moving on from him.
Highly unlikely. Especially when you consider the weapons Ukraine will already have by then, there’s little to no chance the US our allies would then put Russia in position to capture some of these technologies. If anything I can see a hypothetical Trump sending more aid just to gain polictical pts to turn around and say Biden didn’t do enough and he could have prevented this.
