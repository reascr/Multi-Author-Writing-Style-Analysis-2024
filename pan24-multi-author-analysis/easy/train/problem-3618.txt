And yet, by basing admissions on ethnicity rather than any of those other factors, the bar is lower for a black student whose parents are doctors or executives and who went to a private school and had tennis and music lessons and tutoring and belonged to a country club than for an Asian student who immigrated and whose parents eke out a living running a shop, or a white student who grew up with a single disabled and addicted parent in a trailer in rural Appalachia. You’re making the assumption that because someone is a minority, actually just certain minorities but not others, that they are disadvantaged. My kids have plenty of friends who are white and whose families are upper middle class and who are otherwise indistinguishable from the majority or in some cases even come from wealthy families but who have a z at the end of their name (or in some cases not even that, but their mother or grandmother did) and so they’re Hispanic. Do they really need a hand up over someone with Italian or Bulgarian ancestors? The truth is that someone in these categories that have been created may be more likely to be disadvantaged but the ones you are lowering the bar for may not be the ones who need the help. Why not instead control for the actual factors in question if you’re trying to correct societal ills and select for potential rather than just taking the best students on demonstrated performance. Take into consideration income, income level in the neighborhood, quality of secondary school, access to enrichment programs, stability of home life, etc. to level the field.

Asian discrimination??? Asians got a formal apology from the United States government for the few years they spent in internment camps in CA.
