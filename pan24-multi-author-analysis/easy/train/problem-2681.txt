I'm not sure if codifying NFU is actually even credible, I think it's more just for show. Something tells me if push came to shove, where China or India were absolutely getting clobbered in a conventional war, they'd use their nukes anyway. Russia and US' official stance is probably the most realistic and honest.
Its deliberate to leave people unmotivated, uninterested and disengaged. It makes the spaces people think and act in smaller. All that big stuff is too confusing (deliberately). Its only when things start to directing cause ripples in their lives (mobilization) that people start to care. But they only care about the ripple that is effecting them, not the stone that caused it.
Exactly. I totally agree. This policy is so wise. This is about the only way to disarm manipulation. The best is they are continuing and using it wherever appropriate, so it seems to be a central political position of this administration regarding external affairs, something I don't remember seeing before from the US or from anywhere else.
BS. US and China co-operating to send 1200 strike forces that will succesfully complete their missions before russia launches their nukes? Not gonna happen.
