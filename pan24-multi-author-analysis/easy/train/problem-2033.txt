It’s up to the Senate. They can package it as one bill, but they’d have to send it back to the House. Since the House sent it as two bills, those two bills have to be individually passed or consolidated and re-approved by the House. The Senate can’t just combine bills the House has passed. It wouldn’t count as an enrolled bill.
For a lot of these people, it's just what their petty and shallow ideology demands of them, it's very black and white, one-dimensional, no nuance, no depth or real insight, just blind contrarianism and antipathy for the sake of itself, well, for the sake of their feelings of superiority and validation for their beliefs, narratives and prejudices is more like it..
I agree. It's a slap in the face. But gotta celebrate tiny victories to keep people fighting the war. This is just the beginning of the things they will be giving hard working people.
