Don't fool yourselves guys and gals....War is big business.. period. The more you do it the better you get at it. Countries use war as an excuse to other means. Depending on who the players are in that war. They use war for land grabs (resources). They use war to advance their capabilities at conducting war. Trying to keep up with the "Jones'". This war is no different. Putin should have never went into Ukraine (2014). The response Russia got then is why we are here today. Russia has to win this at all costs. This only ends with Pootin dead. Even then that's not a given. Russia has way to many men and boys to sacrifice for this to end conventional. Imo this eventually becomes a bigger war with more countries sending troops. Either Pootin red flags Belarus or one of his other boot licking countries to draw NATO in. Like I said he should've never broke the agreement. A lot of war crimes and hell to pay afterwards.
Attempted assassination of leadership is very much interfering. (it's pretty much an act of war, and frankly, was the cause of WWI, which also didn't work out very well for Russia).
Surrender. Pull your army and equipment COMPLETELY out of Ukraine, even the parts you claim are Russia. Immediately start paying Ukraine 1 trillion dollars in reparations. Then report to Siberia where you will be given Navalny's old cell while you await trial for your many many war crimes.
