I grew up a JW (I feel like Mormons and JW's are cousins even tho they believe different shit completely lol) and had a conversation with a neighbor about her homeschooling her kids cause of some random book in the library that talked about sex. I told her I come from a conservative Christian family and she asked what church. I told her and she straight up said oh they are not christian they don't believe in Jesus. I was like uhhhh I am not one anymore but yeah they do they just believe he is the son if god not god himself. Sure they could be wrong but don't tell me what I spent every Sunday Tuesday Thursday and Saturday being taught. Everyone thinks they have the right beliefs and that's what makes America great. Freedom of religion and freedom of choice.....wait oops scratch that choice thing.
It's totally indefensible. It's not what the constitution says, it's not what the founders thought (for those that think that matters), it's not a good idea on it's own and it is totally un-American.
