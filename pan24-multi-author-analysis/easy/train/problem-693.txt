Biden helping Putin absolutely destroy his Legacy after 4 Years of Trump being Putins lackey is some serious karma for the history books. Love to see it.
Mr. Biden’s comments, which came in unscheduled remarks to reporters at his hotel, seemed to reference a remark by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, who had complained of Republican “candidate quality” in Senate races around the country.
Greatest term in history? I can’t think of a larger list of accomplishments.. Russia is about to crumble, soft landing is happening in the economy.. The US is back.
Mr. Biden reiterated an argument he had made throughout the campaign season: that Republicans lacked a real platform and were more focused on cultural controversies than kitchen-table issues.
House Republicans did put forth a platform for governing during the campaign, but it was relatively vague, with most Republican candidates concentrating on criticizing Mr. Biden and Democrats rather than talking about inflation, crime, immigration and other hot-button issues. Republicans also had to contend with Mr. Trump dividing the party and publicly toying with his plans to announce a run for the presidency in 2024.
