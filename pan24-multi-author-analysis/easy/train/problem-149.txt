NPR had Newt Gingrich on air to “give his opinion”. Newt Fucking Gingrich. Of course it went straight into election conspiracy bullshit. He’s not in office. He’s not on trial. Why the hell would anyone care what he has to say? Oh yeah.. gotta got the “both sides” viewpoints on air… no. Just no. Report the news, and the facts. The election was fair and Biden won. There is no “other side” to proven facts, and giving any air to election lies and other right wing conspiracies is harmful and dangerous.
The father of modern right wing conspiracy theories and strategic obstruction. The man who decided dysfunction and public insults should be the norm of Washinon politics. He paved the road for Trump. The only bright spot is he’s old, and he can’t have that many years left.
So what this article is taking about isn't really bOtH sIdEs bullshit but rather points out that acting like the opposite viewpoints held by each party have equal merit and chance of being correct is damaging to true and accurate discourse/reporting and voter knowledge of issues, because one side continuously relies on falsehood and made-up scare mongering/emotional appeals and the other uses facts and figures to support their position.
