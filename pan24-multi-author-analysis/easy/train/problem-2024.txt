Many kids at my school actually hoped to get kicked out of class, because they could be with their friends during in-school suspension. They would also be able to get out of class and go to what we called TRAICE to be with their friends, where they didn't have to do any classwork or finish any projects. Then, we'd have to go visit them in TRAICE on my plan to help them with work. That was my plan which I used for my IEP Meetings for (over 35 IEPs by the way). They wouldn't do anything. They just liked sitting there and being out of class, so they wouldn't have to do any of the classroom work. They saw being placed in detention as a reward, because nobody was making them do any work. They just got to chill with their friends.
Exactly. If they lowered professional qualifications for doctors and nurses to fix the shortage, how do you think that would end? Funny there’s never a shortage of CEO’s. Wonder why that is.
