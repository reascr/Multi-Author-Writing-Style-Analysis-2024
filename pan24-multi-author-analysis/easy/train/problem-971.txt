Look I don't hate Christianity itself, I don't hate any religion, the followers or the preachers are the issue, Christianity itself isn't a bad thing, but it's incredibly easy religion to tweak or it's east to throw in your personal "beliefs" or "desires", that's how a lot of cults end up getting started, people start out as a small Preacher, alter their views and repeat what the people wanna hear, then throw their own shit in there, and soon it turns it to its own thing. I think religion and spirituality have much to offer, they may not all be right but I think in at least some small ways none of them are wrong. I've learned a fair bit from buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, spirituality and even not too long ago I even tried looking in to satanism for a bit. I honestly think it may be a good thing about their being a decline in Christianity, not because the religion is evil, but the people that get put in such large positions of power end up abusing that power for personal gain, but I don't think this is something to celebrate, I think it's possible that some people have left the religion after not getting the help they need, if anything now is the time to help those who've left Christianity find a new path, if they choose to do so.
Step 1. I'm a materialist through and through. Bricks and mortar, petrie dishes, law of thermodynamics. I still could invoke God, but only within the confines of the divine order of the universe. Life is the universe observing itself. An indivisible whole. You and I are divine, as is every moment in time, grain of sand, and tear shed.
