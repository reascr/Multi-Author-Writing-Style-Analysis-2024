Republicans have controlled governorships and state legislatures for long enough to gerrymander a lot of districts. The Senate already tends to favor smaller red states over populous blue ones (though that's shifting). The House is clearly fickle but with gerrymandering will likely favor republicans in the short to mid term. The goal I think is to also ensure that when republicans control congress, they can rewrite what they want and slash benefits and cut taxes for the wealthy, and when the democrats control congress, they'll have to raise taxes on the "job creators" to get social security, medicare, and medicaid back to where it needs to be to fulfill obligations.
Planes cease to fly. Ports close. The status of the armed forces becomes unclear, but the supreme court is in hiding, so no decision can be made on that point. The president declares martial law, just as state governors activate their national guard units. There is a stand-off in Tallahassee between the national guard and the FBI. More than a hundred people are killed.
