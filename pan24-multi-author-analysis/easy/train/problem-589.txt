To say an entire party is unfit to govern and we therefore should hand all control over to a single party that seems to consistently be putting on a show just feels scary to me and id much rather see a third moderate party form from both.
Exactly. While this group of 20 says it’s a trust issue with McCarthy, it has little to do with him and they’d be making the exact same demands of any other GOP speaker candidate because it’s a power grab, plain and simple.
Aurora Borealis? At this time of day? At this time of year? In this part of the country? Localized entirety within your kitchen?
I’m not saying I’m right and I do understand that at best it’s a “good on paper but…” situation but I guess what I’m saying is that more and more often lately the right looks like a drunk guy with a machete and the left looks like Little Finger from GoT - in the near term I’d much prefer the one that likely won’t gore me but my gut tells me that I’m playing into somebody else’s game (though I suppose that’s politics in a nutshell).
That’s the elephant in the room. Finding a candidate that’s actually willing to give up future political aspirations and knowingly choose to try and control this clown show for the next two years. That job description alone weeds out most reasonable candidates. I mean, are we sure Democrats even want Jeffries to step in as SPOH under these circumstances?
I have no doubt they view Jeffries as a future SPOH, I’m just not sure this shit show is the right trial by fire.
