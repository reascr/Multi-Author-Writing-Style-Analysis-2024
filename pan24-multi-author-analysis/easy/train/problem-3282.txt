Exactly. Itâ€™s fucking sad how it makes people act. Seen it with my old boss, started with him out of high school, humble take his shirt off his back for you type of guy, went through some really successful years over the next decade, and it just became a shell of his former self. Became petty, narcissistic, entitled, etc.
They are nice to you. They are probably not nice to another set of people. In 2016 I learned a lot of the people I grew up with that I thought were good people ended up being extremely shitty people once Trump was elected. Turns out they were only good to me and because I was like them - I fit in the "good" container in their minds so I wasn't in the "bad" container that had the same people Trump wanted to attack. They also did not know I was atheist or Democrat.
