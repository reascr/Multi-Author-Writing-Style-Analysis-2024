Also, bilateral relationships tend to normalize over time. Remember how Trump met with Kim Jong Un a few years ago? It would have been unthinkable for a sitting US president to meet with the North Korean regime back in the 1950s, but here we are. Russia is playing the long game.
"In an article for the Columbia Journalism Review, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Trevor Timm, wrote that "barely any follow-up reporting has been done to corroborate or refute his [Hersh's] claims", and that Slate, for example, "ran five hit jobs on Hersh within 36 hours".".
This has dramatically increased American influence over Europe at the expense of Russia's influence. I don't understand why people are so confused about this.
I really don't follow your logic my dude. How is Russia benefiting from blowing up an expensive piece of infrastructure that they paid for while closing off one of the largest markets for their natural gas for the foreseeable future? Their ideal outcome would have been to win the war and continue selling natural gas to Europe.
