Good question and I’m not 100% sure on this. I think the west wanted a break from fighting massive wars after 1945. It wasn’t 100% successful as Korea was happening pretty quick, and the US missed its chance on China too (the CCP/PLA went to war against the nationalists almost immediately and won in 1949), but no one had the willpower to invade Soviet territory (this happened after WWI actually, for a short time, and was not successful), and the US almost certainly felt it could act with impunity as it was the only nation, for the next 4 years at least, that had nukes. And we used that dominant position to establish the UN and Marshall Fund, which are both certainly great accomplishments that helped prevent another Great Power conflict and rebuilt the global economy as a solidly-US-centric one.
Yup. For decades there's been this fear of unstoppable waves of Russian tanks steamrolling across the border. Turns out there wasn't much to worry about when they all run out of gas and break down fifty miles later.
