We will find out how much money he got from Russia and other countries. We will find out more of the scheme behind the New York lawsuit of overvaluing his properties for loans and undervaluing them for taxes. But the most important thing we will find out is the true net worth of Trump, which is more than likely far, far less than he claims and will show us that he possibly is not a billionaire, but in massive debt.

Really? Trump didn’t know that the fraud was saving his company hundreds of thousands of dollars in employment taxes (illegally)? Trump didn’t know the totality of his CFO’s comp package? Bullshit! He knew everything because he’s a control freak. He probably came up with the schemes. I’m sure Trump has perpetrated one tax fraud scheme after another over 50-60 years. People like Trump believe everybody else pays taxes, not them. That’s for the stupid poor and stupid middle class—-the looooosers. Not a high functioning genius like him. What a dipshit.
