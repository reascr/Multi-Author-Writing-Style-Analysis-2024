The day before the sale to the third scrapyard, on September 24, Ivo, Devair's brother, successfully scraped some additional dust out of the source and took it to his house a short distance away. There he spread some of it on the concrete floor. His six-year-old daughter, Leide das Neves Ferreira, later ate an egg while sitting on this floor. She was also fascinated by the blue glow of the powder, applying it to her body and showing it off to her mother. Dust from the powder fell on the egg she was consuming; she eventually absorbed 1.0 GBq and received a total dose of 6.0 Gy, more than a fatal dose even with treatment.[11][12].
There's also the Goi√¢nia incident, where a Brazilian radiotherapy clinic moved but left a bulky radiotherapy unit behind; when it got stolen from the disused facility, the Cesium radiation source inside was retrieved and shown off to friends and family of the scrapyard owner; this led to over 200 exposures, 40 or so cases of Radiation Sickness, and 4 deaths - two employees of the scrapyard, the owner's wife who'd started wearing a piece as a pendant, and a friend's daughter who'd found some bits of Cesium dust on the floor after her dad brought it home, and used it as makeshift glow-in-the-dark makeup.
Yeah. But if it was that radioactive, it would be noticeable before killing the rest of the family.
