Keep going, keep going -- are you talking about the "official" inflation rate as published by the government, or the "real" inflation rate calculated by a group of independent economists (who are probably risking prison terms for their work)?
I don’t need to. Just knowing that you are a sympathizer and a supporter of a terrorist organization that’s killed tens of thousands of civilians including babies of both turkish AND Kurdish ethnicity is enough not to respond to you, massacre loving son of a bitch.
Like when we brokered the grain deal? Or when we closed the Bosphorus to Russian war ships? Or when we sent the Bayraktars?
It's actually really hard to say wtf is going on here because where most people have humanistic opinions on the matter, the scale and relevance to most people's day to day lives is nigh non-existent It's a very easy thing to have uninformed opinions on even if you are a Kurd in the region people call Kurdistan because, again, the Kurds aren't really unified in a common cause. Depending on where you are, you have revolutionaries fighting the good fight to revolutionaries looking to build their own regressive state like the Taliban. All the while you have innocent people sandwiched between Assad in the south and Erdogan's tinpot ambitions in the north. For Turkey, in particular, things get even more complicated with Turkish nationalism and the disconnect between what that means on paper and the realities that it's really hard to argue Turkey is a multi-ethnic nation-state for all people under a common flag when the very name is "Turkland.".
