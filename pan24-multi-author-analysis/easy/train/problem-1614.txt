But the sitting president of the United States explicitly at a rally with written out plans passed & communicates months in advance directing his supporters to the capital and explicit vocal instructions to attack the capital, he totally is not responsible.
I guess I would turn that around. Are you satisfied with the "official narrative" when so many key actors have yet to be publicly identified and interrogated? Those pipe bombs didn't materialize out of nowhere at that specific moment. Those fences didn't cut themselves prior to Trump's speech even being finished. That mob was clearly directed by people who have yet to be identified. Were all those people agents of Trump? Is that the conspiracy theory I'm supposed to believe? Do you believe it?
The "questions" you're asking all seek to create a sense of doubt in the "official narrative" and plant the seed that what could have happened is that the nefarious left choreographed the entire course of events that culminated on J6 in a grand plan to create the illusion that Trump and his supporters were attempting an insurrection and then punish them accordingly.
What I do know is there's a lot we still don't know. One thing beyond dispute is FBI plants exist and they're used all the time, so that conspiracy theory is at least reasonable even if not proven. We'll know more when we know more, which is why I hope the J6 committee continues and turns it's attention to other dark corners.
