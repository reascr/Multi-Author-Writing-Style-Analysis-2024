Doctor is a hero. AG is a putz What gall he has to even bother the doctor on this one in any way, shape or form? Disgusting example of politics taking over from normal brain functions. He should be drummed out of office. Total waste of skin!

Exactly. The role of prosecutors is very much necessary. But the way prosecutors are positioned in our justice system is entirely malicious and meant to give them power over others, especially defendants. I know because Iâ€™ve been the defendant on a few occasions. The judge just does what the prosecutors demand and defendants are forced into accepting plea bargains that prosecutors often stipulate, or risk getting a much harsher sentence. Basically you are punished for having the gall to insinuate your innocence.
