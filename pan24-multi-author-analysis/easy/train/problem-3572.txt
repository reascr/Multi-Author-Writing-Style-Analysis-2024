It’s really quite simple, the pseudo “Christian” Religion in the US has extensively laid the groundwork for generations to train people to believe in authority figures with unverifiable stories instead of science and data. It also primes them for, and is built upon, perpetuating racism and fearmongering towards "others". Once people see you as an authority, you can start fabricating any reality or conspiracy theory you want your followers to believe and everyone else is therefore a liar, even in the face of incontrovertible evidence. Basically, it is mental abuse from an early age that suppresses critical thinking skills. This “religion” combined with an intentionally weakened public educational system, provides the framework that has spawned this cult of ignorance.
Yeah. Probably a fabricated story to begin with but I have heard of a Jesus birthday in September and also in April based on either events described in the gospels or astronomical calculation for when "The star of Bethlehem" might have been observed. Definitely a church hijack of the older winter solstice observance though.
Absolutely. Abbott and everyone involved should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Add this to the list of things Paxton should be disbarred over.
