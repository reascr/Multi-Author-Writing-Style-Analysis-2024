3) traditional conservatives, like Rockefeller Republicans. They are by-and-large christians so they'll be mostly OK with this. We've seen again and again that when republican party values and actions change in ways that some republicans previously said were unacceptable, they still end up falling in line and passionate defending policies that they'd loudly proclaimed were unacceptable and that the republican party would never do, only a short time earlier. We saw this most recently with Roe v. Wade. I can't tell you how many republicans laughed at the idea Republicans actually would ever overturn Roe or even wanted to over turn Roe, and angrily declared that democratic insistence that republicans would start jailing women was just classic evidence about how crazy and out of touch democrats were. And that republicans would never ever ever ever want a rape or incest victim or underaged girl to not have access to abortion, and certainly abortion would always be available for the health/life of the mother. And the as soon as Roe was overturned, everyone fell into line with supporting politicians who talked about jailing women and voting to make abortion illegal in all cases and discounting the absurd notion that women would ever be denied an abortion for her own health or life. Even as those things started happening everywhere.
Absolutely. I think republicans know if they don’t win 2024, that they won’t be re-elected for a long while. That’s why gerrymandering and the Supreme Court cases have been in full swing. Scary what lenhs they will go.
2) libertarians. They mostly aren't on board with it being a Christian nationalist party but they'll fall in line unenthusiastically as they see it as their most ideologically similar party and as long as they keep taxes low, it will meet their goals well enough. They share the common desire to put power into the hands of white men.
