Crimea is surrounded by water which is both a blessing and a curse. It means there's approaches from land but that also means it can be difficult to supply. So pick your poison I guess. Suppose the Kerch bridge is hit again and Ukraine takes back the land bridge. Then what? The aquifer will be cut off again and no land bridge means stuff can't be taken in by road. That would be a pretty crappy win for Russia. And quite frankly if they do manage to cut the land bridge I don't see them just giving up without Crimea. As for the population I'd imagine Russia has sent a lot of people from the mainland to live there. I am not sure what the right thing to do is in that regard but Crimea is rightfully Ukraine. So those folks would have to move back to the mainland or just accept living in Ukraine. It isn't a fun thing to think about but ultimately the blame is not on Ukraine for retaking its own territory but on Russia for making such a brazen move to begin with. And they probably would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for them invading in 2022, in which establishing a land bridge may have been part of the motivation anyway. So kind of seems to me like ferries and the kerch bridge weren't good enough as it was.
Exactly. All I see is that China has just been "handed" an ultimatum that ensures no peace unless Russia controls Ukraine. They now have justification for escalation and can say "well, we would have preferred Plan A but you guys all saw how that worked out, so we had to change course".
