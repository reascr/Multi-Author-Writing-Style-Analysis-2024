In 1865 the US civil war ended. 800k casualties had been sustained by each side, 1.6 million Americans in total, 650k of which were dead. This was in a time when the US population was 10 times smaller than it is today (US pop in 1860 was 31 m, this includes 4 m slaves, one could argue that pop should not count slaves, or one could argue that slaves should be multiplied by 3/5 if you want to be historically correct in the worst way). Scaled to population US total casualties would be 16 million. Southern states had rebelled violently and lost.

Terrible headline. She won her appeal to avoid paying 700k against her defense for a frivolous case, and the 33k is just to pay for experts she called to testify on her behalf. This is a loss for justice, not a victory.
It's a symbiotic relationship. They each give the other what they want. Some people are just attracted to bullshit that supports their idiotic preconceptions.
