It’s quite rare for certification or licensure not to exist, but the standards vary significantly from state to state, with the average officer spending 21 weeks in training before going on patrol, far less than in most other countries. In some cases, it is less training time than for a barber, cosmetologist, or manicurist. One of the big problems (in addition to the aforementioned lack of adequate training time) isn’t so much the lack of certification, but the obstacles to decertification. Some states lack decertification authorities altogether; and among states with decertification authorities, only 61% of certification authorise can decertify for failure to meet training or qualification requirements, 57% for general misconduct, 39% for termination for cause, and 11% for any misdemeanor conviction. The only state which seems to take decertification somewhat seriously is, surprisingly, Georgia. Compounding the problem of these shockingly toothless decertification measures is the fact that participation in databases of certification/decertification status, and notification to those databases when an officer has been fired, is very, very patchy, so the fired officers will often just bring their “skills” to the next town over. And even when such databases have been notified, being decertified in one state does not automatically make one ineligible in another state, so decertified officers will often just move to a state with laxer requirements.
I am surprised. MGS getting the Punisher treatment never hit my radar. Hard agree on fuck Konami though. They did more to tarnish my boy than any amount of right wing nonsense.
