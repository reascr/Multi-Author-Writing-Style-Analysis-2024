I say it again - this is to be expected a lot more now. Because this ultra far right govt will fuck shit up now and stir things up. Hardliners will now be emboldened more than ever. The Two state solution discussion is now dead for good and things will be bad for next few years for the region, esp. for Palestinians. These incidents are just a start.
Incorrect. The reason the mission was carried out in the first place is because the subset of Judaism practiced by the Ethiopian Jewish community was determined to indeed be Judaism. The current Aliyah minister in Israel (responsible for encouraging Jews to immigrate to Israel) is literally an Ethiopian Jew. Hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of Ethiopian Jews make Aliyah each year.
Threatening? What combination of words implied that I threatened you? Classic leftist snowflake, crying about everything and constantly self-victimizing.
2. Hmm Israel conquered Judea and Samaria as a result to a war it didn't start. If you know how to fight - you should know how to lose, that's the point of a war. In that case, why Israel shouldn't built in areas it owns?
