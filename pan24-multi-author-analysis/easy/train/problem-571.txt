>White-collar investigations often take years before they result in filing a criminal case. Thus, prosecutions last year were significantly shaped by what investigations were ongoing before President Biden assumed office.
Yawn... its adorable you think the system isnt totally broken. What do you think all the Cons do when their in office? Bill barr is a perfect example, dude literally slathered his lipstick all over drumpf's tiny pecker... not to mention the supreme court which is now packed with cons who either actively participated in Jan 6 or were complicit in overturning roe... so remind me again how it's not broken? It's so cute when liberals act like we should be above getting in the shit with these monsters. And just to show you I'm equal opportunity how come eric holder and Obama didnt prosecute anyone other than countrywide for driving our economy off a cliff in 2008?
