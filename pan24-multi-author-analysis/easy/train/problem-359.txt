The article claims that Putin is afraid that Kadyrov will lead a revolt in Chechnya. I don't know how likely that is, but there are a lot of Chechens who lost family members to Russians. It is entirely possible that one of them will lead a revolt against Putin and Kadyrov both. In fact, I'm a bit surprised that they haven't yet.
Meanwhile Putin has to keep supporting Luka because luka is his best chance at absorbing Belarus (his rule is pretty unpopular so it is likely if luka is overthrown then a much less pro-annex government takes power) but Luka has to continually undermine Putin because if Putin accumulates too much political control he can force the annexation.
What a load of bullshit. More like Kadyrov isn't being the lap dog that Putin expects him to be. How is Putin, the very person who has allowed Kadyrov to stay in power afraid of him? Putin is still the only reason he remains in power.
Didn't the annexation basically begin today? They are creating a combined military unit, which I imagine is just the precursor to complete annexation. By March the attempt will at least be made.
