Agreed. I can't even keep food in my house. Transmission went out in car a year ago, had to get rid of it because repair was more than the car was worth. Couldn't afford the repair, can't afford another car. and I'm disabled. I can't even get to the nearest bus stop, so I'm a prisoner in my own home. Tried to get a volunteer to pick up for me at the food bank, that was a no go, and some asshole assumed I must be a homeless person, and started mocking my request for help picking up food. I blocked him, but really I was so mad I wanted to track this asshole down and wipe that sarcastic smile off his face My son and I have had zero money since before Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving was the saddest its ever been. I have 4 grandkids, and 3 kids of my own. Since I'm disabled, I live on an extremely tight budget. Usually, I can at least get a present for the grandkids, but I can't get anyone even a small present this year. I feel like such a failure When I say I have no money, I mean just that; I don't have some savings account I just don't want to touch.
In December 2008, nearly a dozen Ethiopian religious figures (including the leader of Ethiopian Muslims and the heads of the Orthodox, Protestant and Catholic churches) adopted a resolution against homosexuality, urging Ethiopian lawmakers to endorse a ban on homosexual activity in the constitution. This included Ethiopian Catholic Archbishop Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel.
