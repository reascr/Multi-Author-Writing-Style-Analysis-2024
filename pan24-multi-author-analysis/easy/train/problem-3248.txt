In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Disgusting. This would diminish the gravity of the punishment for possessing or distributing ACTUAL child porn, dealing a horrible insult to the victims of that sick industry, which many Republicans patronize themselves.
I know Maia Kobabe. They said literally that the book isn't meant for anyone under 16. They literally state that every single time. They also stated that the parts of the book people keep bringing up like you did were about their experiences with agita from being asexual (which I am). The part about their first sexual experience is something many asexual people (like me) relate to, being pressured into a sexual experience that's unwanted. That's what they were talking about. I was pressured into a similar situation (thankfully nothing happened of it), but yeah. This is why it's important to read the book and understand the context and the backstory as to what transpired.
