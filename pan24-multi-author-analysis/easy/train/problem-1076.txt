"Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization. I say your civilization, because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization, which is of course what this is all about. Evolution, Morpheus, evolution. Like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You've had your time. The future is \our\ world, Morpheus. The future is our time.".
Infantino. Even his name is Dr. Evil. I bet he has 2 soccer balls where he rubs his hands on his FIFA throne. You wonâ€™t get away with this infantino. I already have Commander bond.
Privileged idiot? More like cynical, corrupt bureaucrat who wants to keep his Qatari oil money while pretending to give a shit about Western mores. Out of touch? Yes. Idiot? No.
