I was hoping someone to grab onto this. Very hard to deny or just ignore. Of course they can just do whatever and ignore it, but at least it looks really bad.

100% agree. I think that Putin hoped that the withdrawal from Kherson and the arrival of winter would bring about an operational pause so that Russia could pull its shit together and get ready for a spring offensive. But the AFU is grinding down his infantry faster than anticipated and HIMARS is wrecking their logistics so Russian artillery has lost its edge. We’re seeing more and more NATO gear coming into Ukraine, Putin’s nuclear saber rattling hasn’t worked. First HIMARS, now Patriots, what’s next? I imagine that they’re thinking that Western MBTs and aircraft are in the future. A few NATO equipped and trained combined arms Ukrainian brigades would be able to punch through just about any Russian defense line. Putin is starting to run low on everything, especially time.
Reperations, accountability, and repercussions are necessary. Russia can be welcomed back, but I don't see how the Putin regime can.
