That is the origin of the courtship between Russia and the GOP. Early in the Obama years Putin went all out on persecuting homosexuals. Evangelicals were instantly in love with him. Since the GOP is an oligarchy it needs the religious / culture war contingent to have actual numbers. As go the Evangelicals, the rest of the party eagerly follows, no matter how hypocritical or stupid. By 2012, the Russians had used the World Council on Families (an International version of “Focus on the Family “ with family as code for anti-gay) to totally infiltrate the bulk of the party. The remainder was through the NRA and plenty of Kompromat and undoubtedly, straight up campaign contributions and cash.
Insurrections. "National Divorces". Many calls for secession. Lionizing fascism and autocracy. Openly supporting Russia and North Korea. The GOP have made it crystal clear that they are enemies of the United States.
Yeah because the history of Christianity is one that doesn't involve Christians monopolizing political authority and using that authority to violently oppress their perceived enemies.
