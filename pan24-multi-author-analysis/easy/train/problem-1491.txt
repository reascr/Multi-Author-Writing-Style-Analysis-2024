You need an entire logistics and maintenance infrastructure and those need training. All of that takes time.
This is why I ultimately see Ukraine getting them eventually one way or another, the IFVs being sent soon are part of that process, the UAF is being transformed on the fly from a Soviet to NATO standard army and these are part of the process of building up these strike groups, once the IVFs are deployed and in theatre the heavy tanks are the next step as the defence philosophy is that each part of the unit from infantry to artillery to ivfs and tanks are organised to compliment and cover one anothers weaknesses.
I don't believe in this. Just adding material won't change the time frame. There are just too many Rossiyane that Russia can still sacrifice in the Ukrainian meat grinder.
Exactly. I'm willing to bet Ukrainians are currently all over NATO training on Leopards, Abrams, F15/16, Apaches, and whatnot. Every new technology needs time to be learned by the operators, assimilated into their logistics, and integrated into their fighting force. That's why the first western supplies were idiot-proof ATGMs and MANPADs, progressed to simple tube artillery and eventually HIMARS, then advancing to AFVs today. I'm even sure more advanced equipment will be delivered once all the necessary groundwork is laid. Remember that what killed Russia's initial momentum was not a lack of technology, but their insufficient logistics.
