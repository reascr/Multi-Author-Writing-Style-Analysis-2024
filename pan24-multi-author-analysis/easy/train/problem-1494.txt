The one and only positive of the Republicans retaking the House is that the public will see how dysfunctional the Republican party has become. Driven by the insane conspiracy theories of their base, beholden to big money oligarchs, constant infighting, inability to govern constructively. A competitive primary for president in 2024 will only bring out the fissures even more. I can't wait.
If you are an oligarch or otherwise profit from the exploitation and enslavement of huge numbers of people, the last thing you want is for people to have an effective government that takes care of its people, or for the masses of people to otherwise realize the power of collective action.
People realizing the scam of the system and taking power over their lives back is one of the nightmares keeping the neoliberal plutocrats, kleptocrats, and oligarchs up at night, and why they fight so hard to keep people down.
Part of the neoliberal scam is to reduce the public's institutional power to just one narrow avenue, which is itself controlled by the ruling class.
