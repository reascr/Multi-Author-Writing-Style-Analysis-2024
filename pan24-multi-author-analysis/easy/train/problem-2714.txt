I just had possibly the worst flu of my life, checked for covid but nope. 104 fever, aches that made me feel 100, night sweats so bad my bed felt like I hosed it down, throwing up. Sore throat that felt like a cheese grater made out of glass. Lost ten pounds in three days because I couldn't eat. People should be masking. I got the flu shot, but they said there would be multiple variants this year and hoooooo boy were they right.
Seriously. I’m 33 weeks pregnant with our first baby. People (friends and family) are already trying to make plans to visit her as soon as she’s born. I have a hard time with boundaries, but I’ve made it very important for myself and my husband to remind people we need to protect ourselves and our newborn with how bad this winter is shaping up to be. I mentioned everyone needs to wait at least 2 months, be vaccinated, and mask up until she’s a little older. Some are understanding and are willing to wait and take precautions. Some…are not and have been very rude about our rules.
