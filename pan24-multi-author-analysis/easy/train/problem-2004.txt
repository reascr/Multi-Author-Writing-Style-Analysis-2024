But it is probably also a case of them being good at what they did, and not having proof or records of any of their clients. Without an actual client list, and someone to testify to its authenticity, there isn't much to go on. Especially not with sexual offences, which are already very difficult to prosecute. Throw in unknown and/or uncooperative victims (particularly those who were complicit in other crimes), a main witness (Maxwell) who even if cooperative is not likely to be much use before a jury, and it becomes very difficult to pursue any sort of charges.
Please stop with the teasing already. This has been going on for years. Hope im still alive to see the day he gets fitted for those XXXXL orange overalls...
With Maxwell and Epstein, part of the problem was the non-prosecution agreement signed by then US Attorney and later Trump Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, which purported to give immunity from Federal prosecution to any of Epstein's co-conspirators pre-2008, in exchange for Epstein pleading guilty to some lesser charges.
