Here’s a thought. Have the candidates do a closed interview. Have everything transcribed. Have actors read the interviewer’s questions, and candidates answers. Only the actors will be indicated as interviewer 1 and candidate 1, and so on. That way only the questions and answers will inform the voters at this point, and not the party of the candidates, or their popularity.They will be asked what their qualifications are to hold the office, then why they want to be in the office, how they would react for different circumstances which other elected officials who what been in the office have had to deal with. Finally, theoretical questions on what mite happen while they are in office. All candidates will get the same questions in the same order. Think of the old days of interview shows. Two people, two chairs, one asks question, the other answers. The only difference no audience to sway a voters opinion.
