Like this comment means anything to any of them. This type of argument works on people who truly want to understand things and have been being lied to, which for politics and Republicans it means it might work on a few teenagers and twentysomethings who are just now getting into politics and have believed what fox news and Republican leadership claims to be part of their morals and agenda. For the rest we know it's active manipulation, they use these terms not a all because they believe in them but because it disinforms the lay people who hear 30 seconds of politics a week in a way that benefits Republican leaders as a whole.
Oops. Yeah, I can see now that my comment can be interpreted as me being defensive, or even claiming that you're making stuff up. That is absolutely not the case. I'm completely against this sort of censorship and am well aware of what they're trying to do with this, as well as its historical ties with the actions of the Nazi party. It's a road that we cannot allow ourselves to go down any more than we already have.
