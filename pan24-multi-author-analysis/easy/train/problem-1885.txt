Good then weâ€™ll have bipartisan support for applying the 14th amendment. But make it a package deal for all the congressmen involved too. Or risk fracturing their base and losing the presidency by a lot. This will be fun.
September or October of 2015, they made him sign a loyalty pledge, saying that they would consider him a Republican candidate only if he swore to not run as an independent if he did not get the nomination. He signed it. It looks like a Denny's kids club menu.
What amazes me about this report, and everyone commenting on it, is the apparent foregone conclusion - that apparently everyone has alluded to - that he will not only be a viable third party candidate, but also NOT barred from holding office AND not in prison.
100% bluff. He's hoping they'll see him taking half the GOP base with him and making sure they won't win any elections for the next decade. He won't do it, though, because he knows that he'll not only lose every election he and his candidates run for but it'll also come out of his own pocket. There isn't much money in small party.
