Until a few years ago, nobody would pay for it, because the return on investment would be too low. Then the Artemis program came along, where Congress forced the worst and most expensive possible combination of hardware to send people to the Moon in the form of the SLS rocket.
SLS was meant to be the goto heavy launch rocket for Congress for crewed missions to asteroids, Artemis, deep space probes and new space observatories like LUVOIR.
Those facilities still exist in those states and have been used to build the Space Shuttle and the SLS rocket.
One SLS rocket engine costs as much as one whole Falcon Heavy launch, and one launch is poised to be more expensive than a Space Shuttle launch.
This means in total we might see those 5 SLS launches, before switching to Starship, which can do the asteroid missions, deep space science missions, etc. because it's designed for it.
I half convinced that this disclosure around NASA and other government funded science projects are just a psy-ops by the Medical and Pharmaceutical industries, and the Neo-Liberals to move the blame for the failure of American healthcare and social programs from them to the public funding that could actually help people.
That's it. It's not an Artemis mission, it's one of the milestones for the HLS (Human Landing System) contract SpaceX won. Still part of the Artemis program, but not a numbered Artemis mission by NASA.
The Artemis program is the moon landing missions. Gateway and SLS predate it and Gateway isn't even on the critical path for the currently planned missions. If Starship fails, at least Artemis III and IV fail, if not the whole program.
