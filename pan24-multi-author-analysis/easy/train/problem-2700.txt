We’ve got two implacable foes at loggerheads with no solutions visible. Escalating conflict seems the only course open to them. Ukraine needs to join NATO to have any sense of security. Russia can’t have NATO on their Western border, it would be like having a Russian allied Mexico on ours. Ukraine can’t continue to wage a purely defensive war without denying Russia safe mobilization harbors. Russia can’t allow attacks on its soil without responding with increasingly painful attacks on civilian infrastructure. The threat of Tactical Nuclear Weapons will test the resolve of Ukraine’s Western Allies. Hanging over all is Winter with bitter cold and war ravaged civilians trying to hold on. Complicating all of this is the need for support and munitions from Western allies with energy concerns and domestic politics of their own. We’ve got a House whose incoming leader has already said there will be strict accountability and “no blank check” for Ukraine. I see no clear solution for the end to this conflict, unfortunately, but I hope I’m just being too pessimistic. 🤷🏽‍♂️.
Your answer will be "conventional weapons", and thus Russia's nuclear capabilities cannot be rationally considered to be the "terrorist capabilities" that they are using in Ukraine.
Russia's terrorist capabilities aren't their nukes, because the second they use one against a non-nuclear country (all the ones in Eastern Europe), they become a pariah state worse than North Korea.
