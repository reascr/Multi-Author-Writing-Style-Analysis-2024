On the cynical side, it allows the grifters to drag the process out and waste much more money. It also lets the establishment decide who will pick the winners. Clearly Biden wants to start somewhere that will get him a win, not somewhere that progressives have a foothold.
Absolutely. And even if we do have primary reform and some sort of official cap it won't matter unless the FEC is given teeth, which also seems unlikely.
Absolutely this. People vastly underestimate the role that funding plays in the presidential primaries (not to mention other elections).
Is he? As president he did whatever the Republican party wanted. He didn't veto the "moderate" corporate tax cuts that Republicans and now Democrats support. He could have until he got wall funding or something he ran on. He didn't.
Frankly, I prefer the parliamentary approach of the party selecting the executive nominee. We (the US) place way too much emphasis on selecting the executive who has relatively little power in our government.
Not symbolic, but the attention given to the Presidential election is way out of proportion to the Presidentâ€™s power to deliver on policy. Meanwhile Senate and House races often boil down to what letter they have next to their names.
