The tiny number of challanger 2 tanks are not going to do much of anything. The crews likely have not been trained to use them and even if some are there new crews so not going to make good use of the tank yet. The logstics of using the Chal 2 is going to be fucking hell for them since its not like the old Russian tanks there using now. The upkeep and repairs needed to keep them working is going to be hell since even us in the UK we have a hard time with it most due to a lack of parts. It needs its own ammo and again not a lot of it is going around nor is it able to fire EU ammo or the old Russian ammo so odds are once the ammo that is shipped with the tanks is used thats it. Hell the Chal 2 is likely to heavy to even be used in Ukraine and be only useable in a fairly small area over all.
It's a pretty interesting situation. I would not be surprised if it turns out a few have been hit, and I also wouldn't be surprised if the war ends and none were hit. In the latter case, I'd bet that russia got lucky enough to get some shots off at the right time, they just missed.
