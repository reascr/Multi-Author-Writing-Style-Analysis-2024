Yeah. Russia is a failed state and cannot demographically repopulate itself. Without immigration, it will die. And since no one wants to immigrate there except Steven Seagal, they have to steal humans. Look at the HIV infection statistics for people under 40 in Russia. And keep in mind, it's all untreated infections, affecting approximately 15-20% of that population. So yeah, this is how failing dictatorships work. China will start doing the same thing, if you don't consider what is happening to the Wiegers that same thing already. These are not global superpowers. Russia and China are countries and populations on their way out the door. Russia is currently the most sanctioned country in the history of mankind. You don't even need to fight them anymore. They will simply die on the vine if left alone.
I think the people that do are still under the stupid influence that “Ukraine technically belongs to Russia” and these people are taking out of the fact that russia is committing war crimes and inhumane acts just to TRY and win even though they have been driven into the ground through their economy and the soldiers they have lost.
this! he’s moving people to a region where they will be completely dependent on russia for everything and then he’ll cut them off from food and water. at this point it is no different than the holocaust.
