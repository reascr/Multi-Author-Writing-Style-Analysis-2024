What is it I’m missing? What’s something key that republicans did in the last 20 years that you think embodies “Republican ideology”?
But please (not trying to be a dick here) what is it about “Republican” policies that makes you call yourself a Republican?
So, let me ask again - what is "Republican Ideology"? Financially they still seem wed to the ridiculous notion of trickle down economics. If you want to tell me that giving the wealthy huge tax breaks will somehow help everyone else, I'm going to point you to my earlier point about denying reality.
Look I don’t want to seem snarky (well ok I do a bit) but “your solutions” in the time I’ve been an adult aware of American politics seem to be nothing more than tax cuts for rich guys, and denying reality. Oh and sticking it to minorities.
