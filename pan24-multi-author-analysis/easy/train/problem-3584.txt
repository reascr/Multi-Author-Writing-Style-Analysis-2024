Opened up COVID vaccine patents to allow international manufacturing, forgave tens of billions of dollars in student loan debt, established a 15% minimum tax on corporations, passed a massive stimulus package that got America back to work after COVID faster than nearly any other nation on Earth (and right now we're at a near record low 3.5% unemployment rate), resumed funding for the Affordable Care Act resulting in the highest health insurance coverage rates on record, passed a trillion dollar infrastructure bill, signed off on hundreds of billions of dollars in climate spending, and that's just the stuff in America, he's also practically ended drone strikes and air strikes, he's restored foreign aid to nations like Yemen, he rejoined the World Health Organization, and we're no longer keeping migrant children in indefinite detention away from their parents, so, you know, some stuff.
