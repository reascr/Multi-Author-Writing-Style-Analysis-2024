No. Because nothing--not their children's health, not their parents' poverty, not their own lack of a future--NOTHING matters to them as much as making sure someone else suffers as least as much as they do. Particularly if that someone is brown or female.

Post-Trump Republicans are largely against foreign military entanglement. They want to regulate banks, tech companies, and big pharma.
Also, immigration? The immigration system wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for policies in Latin America that has led to destabilized countries, which both Republicans and Democrats have played a hand in.
