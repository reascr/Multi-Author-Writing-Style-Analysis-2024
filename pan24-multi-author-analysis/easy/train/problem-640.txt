No. The defendant was found guilty on federal robbery charge of controlled substance. Which is up to 20 years. If I understand correctly, the armed part of the conviction tacks on 5 more, so up to 25 years. (The murder part would have allowed up to life). The 19 year sentence is within the scope of what is allowed by law for the charge that they were convicted for.
The key point being if the sentences are both within the range allowed for the crime that was convicted. Now, if the sentence is adding on extra time beyond what is allowed for the convicted crime, taking some from the acquitted crime- that isn't right.
