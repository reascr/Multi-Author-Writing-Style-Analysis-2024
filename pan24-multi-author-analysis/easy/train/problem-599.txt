Yeah, your blanket “run moderates in swing districts” statement was simplistic, and that’s why I commented. It depends on the district and candidates as well and the issues they choose to lean into. You have to run good candidates that campaign their butts off to connect with their constituents. Purple states are just big gerrymandered districts, so I disagree with you on that. Same rules apply. Turn out your base and run on a message with broad appeal everywhere in the district.
Republicans also represent Capital, but nowadays are more absorbed with representing the interests of Hegemonic Identitarian Dominance than Capital overall since they're leaning harder and harder into Fascism rather than Capitalism.
The sheer amount of buzzwords. "Corporate democrat" literally just means "democrat I don't like" to common dreams. The fuck does "CIA agent" matter? Is "CIA" literally all that is required to criticize someone?
