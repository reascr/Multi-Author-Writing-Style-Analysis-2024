Trump also pardoned his pal Steve Bannon (who they arrested on his yacht out on the ocean) after Bannon was convicted of fraud in a scheme where he defrauded Trump's own supporters. The Trumpards were told they were making donations towards funding to build THE WALL that Trump promised to build. If you recall all through 2016 Trump insisted he would make Mexico pay for THE WALL Lol. Millions and millions and millions of $$$. Bannon got to keep that money minus his lawyer fees. So Trump pardoned a dude who screwed his base over ripping them off $$$$ That's our Donald.

Completely unethical. A blatant disregard of separation of church and state - not to mention the complete lack of both ethics and common sense. These justices must resign immediately.
Wait. Isn't HL a corporation? Don't corporations have "personhood" that is separate from its ownership? Can a corporate "person" have religious beliefs?
