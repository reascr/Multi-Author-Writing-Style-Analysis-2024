PRC is obviously already restricted from exports by US defense manufacturers. But now “bans” what they cannot have.
You are severely underestimating China's Navy. Check out this video from Sub Brief where he talks about some of the capabilities of the newest ships they have produced(and are producing more of.).
Lockheed sells to Five-Eyes, NATO members, related allies, and even some "restricted" countries through both Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) that they organize and market, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) that are jointly done with the US DoD to ensure allies have interoperable equipment. Both those kinds of sales go to customers that are not the US Government. Source: I have been an export restrictions and compliance engineer at multiple defense contractors since 2011.
Irrelevant. The US doesn’t permit sales to other nations via the company. The government brokers the sale and gives permission for companies to sell anything. They’re government entities that have high classified clearance for employees to even work there. This sanction is pointless. Especially since the world sees china as a threat to peace.
