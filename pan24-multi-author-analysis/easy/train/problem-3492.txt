Because 20 years ago when another country invaded yet another country based on lies and bullshit you probably would have gotten insulted and screamed at for even remotely suggesting something like that. You probably still do.
OK you miss the point, a lot of misinformation is spreading like wildfire, one thing we can guarantee is that ukraine military is being fed with weapons and ammunition from 50 countries, lost in the stupid amount of reports over the leopard tanks and Abraham tanks was the reports of close to 500 upgraded t72 tanks being delivered, not just promised.
They chose what they chose. I do not feel bad for them, because their choice comes at the expense of innocent Ukrainian civilian and military lives. Their military didn't start the war, they are only fighting to defend their country. Every UA military loss was an innocent Ukrainian doing the right thing and standing up for what's right. Every Russian loss was a pawn who was afraid to do the right thing and died in the process.
Excuses? Let me get this straight: The West supports Ukraine as it fears more escalation towards Moldova and other smaller European nations. It's not done exclusively because we like the Ukrainian people, but because it is also in our own interests to do so. If you wish to be aggressive against that attitude because people are dying, go ahead. Nothing is going to stop that, as long as Russia upholds their aggression. A new gun in Ukrainian hands will not stop that. And throwing terms like "excuses" around is not going to increase support for your case.
