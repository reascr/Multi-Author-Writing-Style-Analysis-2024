That's fine. That's the gops fault then. If they impeach Biden 2 or 3 times like the nutters want, they will look like fools and lose 2024. Gopers are not celebrating what is happening right now for good reason. A slim majority in the House is worse for them than the dems now, they have right wing crazies stirring up all sorts of trouble which the American people are very clearly tired of.

I don't know what the actual election results have been historically for the south Texas counties but in my experience usually if a Democrat is winning a congressional seat, it's because it came down to some rich republican white guy who's stayed within the relatively small and insular Anglo social circles his whole life until the election, vs a Hispanic conservative Democrat who everyone knows and would fit right in with the republicans, but they or their parents have been blue since before the party shift.
God right? It should be a no brainer but this is the same party that voted fucking Roy Moore. They don’t care about walker or his abusiveness or abortions he’s forced women to have. Just that sweet sweet ‘R’.
This is anecdotal but I'm from South Texas and in my lifetime most Tejano families have been very VERY republican because many Hispanic families are extremely socially conservative, extremely racist, and small business ownership is a big part of the culture (and for some reason pop culture has decided that Republicans are the party of small business???).
