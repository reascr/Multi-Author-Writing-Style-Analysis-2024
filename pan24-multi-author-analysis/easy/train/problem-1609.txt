I'm not a tank enthusiast either but I assume that "throwing a track" means that the track came dislodged from the wheels (like a bike chain coming off the gears). Being thrown on the inside means it came off and ended up on the tank side of the wheels, which I assume is much more difficult to fix than if it were on the outside. The outside would mean that it would just be laying on the ground next to the tank. Inside means it's snagged and caught up in all the other moving parts and difficult to access and get a hold of in order to reseat it. Plus it's really heavy.
Not effectively. That's most of the reason the US was hesitant. An Abrams tank isn't a big truck (like some other shit we sent). It requires a lot more training and complex upkeep, as I understand it.
You're confusing politics/politicians/appointees with career service people. The career service folks definitely said don't go to war in Iraq (i.e., there's little evidence of WMDs) and certainly said that more time was necessary for a withdrawal from Afghanistan. Politicians forced their hand.
