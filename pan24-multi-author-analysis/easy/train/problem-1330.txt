Sweden is trying to join NATO because they feel threatened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Turkey's close-enough-to dictator Erdogan is vetoing their NATO application (along with Finland's) because Erdogan wants to extort concessions out of the US and other NATO partners by using Finland and Sweden's safety versus Russia as a hostage.
