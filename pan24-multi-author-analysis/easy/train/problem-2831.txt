Well, in Canada our life expectancy is higher, we have a much lower infant mortality rate, and nobody has to fear going bankrupt over medical bills, but our system isn’t perfect. Unless your condition is life-threatening, you’re probably going to be waiting awhile for treatment. I remember around 2008 or so, the GOP were trying to claim that Canada had ”death panels”, where a small group of people decide if a person would live or die. This has never been true, it’s a horrific, inhuman idea, and the GOP are loathsome scumbags for trying to scare people into voting against their own best interest like that.
Exactly. Its a bunch of systems who understaff their medical records departments and dont communicate between offices. Then when you finally have an appointment its 15 minutes. Doctors cannot provide good care in that time. Im caught in this loop now and am giving up. The only reason I've kept up this long is because I have a visible rash and face swelling under my eye. They can't see it on ct so it must not exist, despite it being easy to see just by looking at my face. Im going mad.
