So since then, Japan has laid claim to Kunashir and Itorup too, on top of Shikotan and the Habomai Islets. Russia controls all of them currently, but has repeatedly said that they're willing to give Shikotan and the Habomai Islets back if Japan at the same time rescinds all claims to Kunashir and Itorup.
Finally, it's a historical fact that Russia has repeatedly offered to give Shikotan and Habomai back, in return for Japan giving up all claims to all the Kurils.
Definitely. It’s a unique opportunity to weaken a common enemy and cause political unrest without really getting your own hands dirty. The aid to the Ukraine is more than just doing a nice deed. If that were the case, the west could be helping a whole lot of places.
Really appreciate your comment! I am not of Indian descent so obviously can’t understand as you do.
Did you conveniently forget all nonsensical negotiation proposals from Russia's side? You know, all that "we're going to stop only if you leave us half of Ukraine and promise complete demilitarisation" bs. Such a reasonable, good faith diplomacy, you can definitely reason with them /s.
