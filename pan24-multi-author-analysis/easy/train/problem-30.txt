For half a century, Newsweek was owned by the Washinon Post and was a well-respected voice in American journalism. In 2010, the Post sold Newsweek to 91-year-old businessman Sidney Harman; Harman bought it for $1 and assumption of its liabilities. Ownership turned over a few more times, from Harman to Barry Diller. Diller regretted his purchase and sold Newsweek in 2014 to a group called International Business Times Media. IBTM changed its name to Newsweek Media Group. Its owners were tied to a small Christian college (Olivet University) led by a charismatic Korean pastor, David Jang. Jang also was founder of a cult called “The Community,” according to this report in Mother Jones.
Nope, hospitality. My handwriting has gotten worse over the years. When I was still in highschool, it was legible, but at some point over the years realized if I want people to be able to read what I write, I have to print it. Same with signing. Both my parents are/were deaf, and my ability to sign to where someone could understand me has deteriorated over the years.
