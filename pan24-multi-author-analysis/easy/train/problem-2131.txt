For example, one might ask if smoking causes lung cancer. Science will provide tons of data showing the links to a point that really anyone can come to the conclusion that yes indeed it does, but it is hard to say "John's 3 packs a day is precisely why he got lung cancer in 1998" when technically there are tons other causes of lung cancer that could have done it. The Tucker Carlsons of the world would say "well it could have been air pollution, or chemicals from his job, or the asbestos in his house? I'M JUST ASKING QUESTIONS!" and now half the country doesn't really believe smoking causes lung cancer.
Seriously. They cheered on a guy that was effectively the poster boy for big business douchenozzles in NYC. How any Americans ever got excited for this guy is beyond me. Especially when he went on his “drain the swamp” tirade when he was the epitome of said swamp.
Do republicans realize how unpopular election denialism is? I am not even that big of fan of democrats, but I will vote for them aggressively when republicans behave like this. I am now voting to oppose Christian extremism, anti-reproductive rights legislation and election denialism.
