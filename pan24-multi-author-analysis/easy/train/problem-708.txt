The criminal portion is if you can prove the documents were intentionally kept or withheld, if the documents were taken for malicious purposes, or if gross negligence occurred in the keeping and dissemination of said documents.
Yeah for real. I would like to see two things happen that would be amazing. All of congress dems and rep checked for classified docs and have their tax looked into. Boy that would be exciting.
As we find more documents it’s concerning that it was able to happen, but he was also in office conducting legitimate security business for 40 years, it makes sense some documents go mixed around, we still need to investigate how it happened to prevent future occurrences. Nothing I’ve seen however suggests anything criminal. He followed all the proper protocols when a classified document is found misplaced, he is openly allowing access to his previous offices and his homes for the DOJ to look for additional documents, and he’s in no way making claim to said documents or trying to hide them.
