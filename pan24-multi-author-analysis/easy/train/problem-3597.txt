He was mostly ignored in the end, not in the beginning. A suburb of my own city, Århus, had unrest for five days in a row with trashcan fires and rocks and fireworks directed at firefighters even though his protest occurred in Copenhagen at the time. A guy from another suburb of my city was shot in the leg by police when he tried to stab Paludan. He was also escorted away by police in a third event when he was outside a shopping mall in my city when someone tried to hit him with a car. A part of Copenhagen, believe it was Nørrebro, had unrest and was on fire before the election 4 years ago, and that's when he had most succes as a politician. He only reached 1.8% of the national votes, below the 2% treshold, so he was never in parliament.
Who's responsible is whoever benefits. The far right in Europe and the States seem to be toos of the Russian FSB. But it's the media and pundits in the islamic world who either out of ignorance or intentionally neglect these details and more directly serve Russian/Anti-Nato interests. Hungarian leaders could care less if holy books get burned. These Russian curated performances are for the benefit of Turks and they ate it up.
Certainly. The key thing he did here though was because he wants attention and publicity clearly, which will make him more popular as he gains supporters who otherwise didn't know he existed, locally and abroad.
