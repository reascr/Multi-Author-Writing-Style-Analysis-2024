Well, in 1992 Democrats won the House, the Senate, and the White House, then in 1994 Republicans won the legislative branch and held onto it until George W. Bush outraged the American people enough to give Democrats another chance fourteen years later.

So if past is prologue Republicans will win the House and maybe the Senate in the midterms, lots of governors races and local state legislatures, they'll use their power to prevent Democrats from moving on their legislative agenda and roll back what progress they can where they can, they'll run sham investigations into potential Presidential candidates and hold open Supreme Court vacancies to tempt their voters, then in 2028 the United States will elect a batshit unqualified Republican President, and Democrats will get another chance at winning local elections and legislating as early as 2032, but possibly as late as 2036, assuming we're still having elections by then.
