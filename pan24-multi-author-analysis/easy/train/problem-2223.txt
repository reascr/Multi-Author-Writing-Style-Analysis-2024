Yep. As an independent though, how the Dems tackle every hockey stick graph of their making starting Jan 20, 2020 remains to be seen. The list is long and y’all know the issues. Good luck.

Yeah, but all of those currencies exist in forex pairs where both partners underlying valuations are based on the spread from the currency reserve, my only point here is that manipulating the size of units as the FED is doing isn’t the same as actually altering their value - in other words, we are still using dollars in everyday application at their appropriately devalued rate, the cost increase at the pump and market are real and that’s where the value is actually lost. Take a look at how the Bretton Woods gold backed value system negatively affected the value of the US dollar regardless of it being the strongest currency in the pact, as with all systems of value you can move the negative value around but can’t just snap and make it go away….
