Right but we trade on a global market and that’s why what Russia is doing is screwing us , because European countries decide to trust a country that should have never been trusted , not we all have to pay the price because they liked their cheap energy and makes them look good because they have no greenhouse gasses that their producing but their outsourcing , so now European countries can say “look we lower our co2 output” , just how the world uses China as a factory.

There's no benefit in issuing a judgement against the ruler of another country - it might feel good morally, but it wouldn't materially help the US or Khashoggi's family, and wouldn't harm MbS unless we were willing to take substantial financial and potentially military action against the country of Saudi Arabia.
Idk. It's stupid. It's not possible to sue government entities in the US. Period. It's been our law of the land forever. Allowing this to happen would be precedent changing, and a deviation from the world order.
