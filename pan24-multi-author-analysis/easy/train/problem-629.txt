In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Classic suburban bubble ideology. I deal with it all the time (I have relatives on LI). With that being said, thereâ€™s still a large swath of educated professionals who work in the city and some immigrant communities that contribute towards a strong Democratic base in that district. It has a very good chance of swinging either way.
Politics is decently moderated. Conservative's very horrible. Conservative's mods ban people they don't like and if they even smell the tiniest hint of liberalism from anyone; Conservative is basically the_donald version 2.
