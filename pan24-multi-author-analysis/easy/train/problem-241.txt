Edit to add: kick EVERYONE except Native Americans out of the USA and send us back to where our ancestors came from. Let NAs decide to keep the infrastructure or destroy it. Fuck yall, our grandparents grandparents genocided them and shat on their graves. We shouldn't be here lmao send my ass to Poland.
The native American tribes by any available evidence were constantly at war with each other, they practiced slavery, torture, and rape even after European colonization- suggesting that much of if not all the territory inhabited by natives was claimed via military conquest. Essentially if your goal is to kick out every foreign invader from every country, it's a nearly impossible task since the inhabitants prior to the current occupants were also foreign invaders at one point.
Yeah, I am. How about this? As a Muslim, I donâ€™t think Muslims are against Jews visiting the mount either. They have in the past at times.
Yes we can return Crimea to Ukraine, and Russia can give up all annexed territories, as well as the asian territories it currently encapsulates (of which China has been wanting to control since ever) to hopefully create independent nations instead.
The catch is that its not going to happen. The entire point of countries is to assert a boundary it decided on itself at the expense of any other groups that want a claim to the territory. If Russia stays in Crimea long enough it will de facto be Russia- which I agree is totally bogus.
