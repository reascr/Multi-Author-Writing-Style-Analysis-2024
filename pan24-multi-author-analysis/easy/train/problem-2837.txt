We'd have to do both. One or the other doesn't work. Taking out supply chains only creates favorable conditions for victory on the ground, but you have to have boots on the ground to take advantage of those conditions. If you don't you are only slowing down the enemy, not stopping them or repelling them. You could, however, only throw infantry at the problem and eventually grind away the enemy assuming favorable casualty exchanges and/or far superior numbers. If you have armor they must also be supported by infantry (at least) since unsupported armor is actually fairly vulnerable given how portable and accessible anti-tank weapons are (and in the modern age, the prevalence of IEDs).
1. Check latest chinese official media - they are pointing fingers toward collective "west" for supplying weapons to DEFENDING Ukrainians and their rethoric swayed toward accusations.
No. That doesn't work in urban environments. I don't know how you can look at the war in Ukraine and then come to this conclusion. You clearly do not understand how troops were utilized throughout GWOT.
Supporting sovereignty isnâ€™t a radical or controversial ideal. Ukraine was illegally invaded. Russia has no ground to stand on. It is black and white.
