It's the same problem as with religion: fictive items remain fictive, yet not unreal for those who take it not for fiction, but as fact. Of course we are all looking forward to a world where money is obsolete, but this cannot be achieved with trollish idiocy regarding the currency system, nor without a proper revolution. I do not see any evidence that you follow through on a personal level - I highly doubt that you would voluntarily pile up ever more debt because "it's all made up". You also perfectly illustrate why internet anonymity is a massive societal problem: people like you, proven ignorant on financial systems, go around screaming bullshit (which they probably just lapped up from some random internet idiot, perhaps a bot even), and cannot be hold accountable for that bullshit it real life. It is disgusting that internet idiots cannot be shamed or shunned because of anonymity. I highly doubt you would have the courage to post your drivelling nonsense under your clear name, as I would be delighted to forward this then to any of your acquaintances, bosses, co-workers etc. to illustrate your stellar cognitive abilities.
Sigh. Just because the currency isn’t backed by an asset like gold or silver doesn’t mean you can just do whatever the hell you want with no consequences.
