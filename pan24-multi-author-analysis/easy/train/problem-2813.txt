The tensions didn’t prevent Biden and Putin from following the lonime diplomatic tradition of exchanging gifts. In Geneva, Biden gifted Putin a pair of his trademark aviator sunglasses and a crystal sculpture of an American bison, the national mammal of the United States. And Putin gave Biden a miniature Kholui lacquer writing set, valued at $12,000, according to a report published Thursday by the State Department’s Office of the Chief of Protocol.
Putin’s gift was by far the most expensive Biden received from a foreign government or head of state in 2021, according to the report. But the price in this case would have no correlation to strenh of their actual relationship. Eight months later, Russia would invade Ukraine, launching the first land war in Europe since World War II. Biden has since repeatedly cast Putin as a threat to democracy and the global order, while Putin has accused Biden of helping rally the international community against Russia.
