sorry that i am barging in, but this message needs to go thru as message in the top section of the post to spread awareness, they won't release ANYONE, it is propaganda.
It’s absolute propaganda. They may be pardoning people, but none of them were protesters. If anything, they want to save up as much space for protesters as possible, because they, the IRI, know they’re hated. This is the only way they will stay in power.
it is as follows, they will pardon people who haven't committed fesad fel arz "corruption on earth", moharebe"waging war against god", participating in protests, harming of government agents, resistance against soldiers and agents of the government, people who have a crime history prior to their last criminal act, people who bave been sued by a private individual.
Oh please. Stop your nonsense. What do you expect them to do in the U.S.? We are going through tough times here. We cannot control the U.S. government. Why are you not in Iran helping your community instead of living the good life here in the West?
