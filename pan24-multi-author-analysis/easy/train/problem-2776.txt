Anecdotal, but when I was in kindergarten, I vividly remember my mothers dad and wife (extreme evangelicals on the highest level) kidnapping my mother, sister, and myself. They took us to live with them,and while my mom was at work they would take me to the church school. After school, I was beaten by them for the sins of my father (manufacturing and distribution of meth in the late 80s-early 90s) and locked in a empty room with a bare mattress. My mom and sister have never told me about their experiences in that home. I blocked a lot of memories from that time, it was easily the earliest traumatic period of my life. Fast forward 25 years and the wife cheated on her husband with someone even more looney. My moms dad ran into cancer and tried desperately to salvage any relationship with my sister and I. I didn’t even open the messages, I didn’t attend the funeral. I was happy he was dead.
Profoundly unchristian. The psalmist vituperatuvely prays for the death of his enemies. The way of Christ, the new law, is to pray for one's enemies. She misses the entire point of the New Testament.
