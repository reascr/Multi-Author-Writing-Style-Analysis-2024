no offense but I would trust WHO over some Indian pharma companies…the Indian officials are equally likely to protecting their financial interests by denying the claims…interesting they don’t say none of the compounds were found in the medicine, they just say the medicines complied with specifications….
Nope. Checked it(i am an indian). WHO is not providing clear facts for complete investigation and indian officials have t found anything wrong in syrup. Its commonly used in india.
So The Gambia reports some child illnesses and deaths and find it’s related to one companies cough medicines, they test it and it shows toxic chemicals are present which exactly line up with the symptoms the children are experiencing…The Gambia stops all sales of that particular medicine and the deaths and illness decline…thats pretty clear…so I’m not sure how this is a conspiracy of the WHO…how do they benefit from this??? As per you Covid-19 comment…can you please show the WHO press release from Nov 2019 where they stated that Covid-19 is not contagious…since it was only first reported by a doctor in Wuhan on Dec 1 2019 and reported to the WHO on the 31st of Dec 2019..and it was in the public eye until Jan/Feb the next year..
