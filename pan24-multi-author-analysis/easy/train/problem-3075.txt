Is it really? In Indonesia we pretty much have stopped counting the infection cases and live back to normal. For sure there are still people get infected by the virus, but the hospitals around me at least are working like it was like pre-pandemic. Stark contrast with the scene from last year when Delta and Omicron first hit. So in my view vaccines did successfully prevent death and hospitalisation, so far. And yes, China's no covid strategy also confuses me, you would think with their economy in the slowest y/y growth in decades (excluding 2020) they would keen to loosen the restrictions and get the economy going. Also the party Congress had ended already, if they had used the restrictions as mean of movement control.
The Congress is ended, Xi is already secured his third-term, imo it is a little bit daft to control people tightly now, don't you think? Their economy is not hot either nowadays.
Yes, they dramatically reduce infection. Boosters increase that protection, especially in older populations. In Ontario less than half of the people per million who are infected are vaccinated with 2+ doses. Fact is, it's not going to be to the degree we saw early on, but we were told boosters would be required in April or May 2020. We were also told that each booster would likely confer longer immunity than the one before.
