Yes this. They started off demanding a change in Ukraine's government and they choose the prime minister (the audacity), demilitarised army etc. The demands stayed that way for a while but now as they withdraw from each region it's slowly changing. The range of demands is shortening. It needs to keep going until they will be happy for just a lease on Crimea (which shouldn't happen imo as Ukraine shouldn't let them anywhere that peninsular.).

Mine too. I keep explaining that it isn't money that is going, but the value of equipment and munitions that was bought and paid for long ago, and had the sole purpose of being used to fight Russian aggression. They listen a little bit, but I think they are humoring me.
Economy crashing. Sales flatlining. Specialists that know how to maintain equipment leaving the country or were sent to the front. Equipment manufacturers and spare parts dealers leaving the market.
