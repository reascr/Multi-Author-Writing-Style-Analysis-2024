I am tired of seeing the whataboutism on Ticketmaster. Breaking up monopolies is a different kind of important. Bringing out the antitrust laws is a step in the direction of holding corporations accountable for their predatory practices. And god knows we need to hold pretty much every corporation accountable. Record profits on account of record prices and stagnating wages is not the move. If Ticketmaster is the straw that broke the monopoly camel’s back, so be it! Someone said ticket sales weren’t in the Bill of Rights, and I agree, but life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness certainly were. Concerts are a part of the pursuit of happiness. The whole shtick of the United States is that you can come here and even on the common man’s salary you can do shit like go on vacation or gasp… see a concert. So, fuck Ticketmaster. May they be a gateway to breaking up many monopolies.
