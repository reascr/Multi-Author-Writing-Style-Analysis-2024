In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yeah. I've got a trans coworker and they make absolutely zero fuss about it. They dress and pass as their chosen gender and as opposed to an attention-seeking mix of the two, like this nitwit.

While stealing luggage is definitely despicable and worthy of prosecution, I’m left wondering if you’ve criticized the previous administration similarly for appointing, hiring, and colluding with several convicted criminals.
Man that is some next level spin. BTW MSN seems to disagree. As the position is a role in Civil Service it was hired rather than appointed, regardless this person was undeniably elevated into their position in the DOE under direction of the Biden Administration that is not debatable.
As the DOE is a cabinet level agency and Energy Secretary was directly appointed by the president, the administration (if not the White House) directly is responsible for the hiring of this individual. Any attempt to distance the White House from this is a pretty clear attempt at deflection.
