Neither Herschel Walker nor his handlers have yet explained how he can claim to be a genuine resident of Georgia running for the Peach State’s open U.S. Senate seat, while Walker receives a property tax exemption on his $3 million mansion in Texas, which to qualify for the exemption must be the homeowner’s “primary residence.”.
Why? Zero experience? Unenviable IQ? No leadership ability? Hasn't had a job in 20 years? Pathological liar? Wholly unqualified? Comically under-vetted? Just curious what your reason is. I mean I see a lot of "women for Herschel" signs and they can't all be from homes with battered women, staring regretfully out the window above the kitchen sink. At least some of these signs were placed by strong, progressive women who just feel like they have too many liberties and yearn for the great America days before suffrage, when they could just put on a corset and some impossibly tight heels and be eye candy for their breadwinners.
He was a freak of an athlete; no doubt! But compare NFL stats to . He had potential but didn’t put up the numbers. Smith had 100 more TD’s than Walker and around 10,000 more yards. And Smith can STILL make an intelligent coherent sentence.
