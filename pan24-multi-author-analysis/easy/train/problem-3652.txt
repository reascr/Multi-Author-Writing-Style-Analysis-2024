This notion is clear from the nation's laws up through the 20th century. When throughout US history jurisdictions banned certain firearms within their state and city limits, prescribed loyalty oaths as a prerequisite to possessing firearms, or banned the public carrying and display of firearms not connected with militia service, nobody argued that such laws were unconstitutional, because it was well understood and accepted that states had the authority under 2A to set their own firearms laws and regulations.
Maybe, maybe not. But I'm gonna trust the people that just got done fighting a war against their own country that basically said "Hey, the British government got out of control and we were lucky to be able to defend ourselves and secure an independent nation. To ensure that this newly established nation doesn't get out of control and that the people have a fighting chance, we are going to establish an individual right to keep and bear arms.".
It changed because the GOP, with the help of the Federalist Society, installed a wholly corrupt conservative supreme court majority that actively did the gun lobby's bidding by expanding 2A to include a right of firearm possession for individual self defense.
TL;DR: The GOP and FedSoc invented a right to possess firearms for individual self defense under 2A and this American hellscape we're trapped in today is a direct result of their craven pursuit of power and profit.
