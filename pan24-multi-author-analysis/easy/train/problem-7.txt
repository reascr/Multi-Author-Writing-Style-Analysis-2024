Strains are spreading in the west yes, but there are new strains in China that are spreading and we don't know if our vaccines will work with those strains. We know the Chinese vaccines have a low efficacy rate and we know they are not mRNA vaccines which allow for easier adaptation to new strains. Making travelers with a Chinese passport take Covid tests at any and all airports is not racist or even unfair - a reminder that China has been relatively hard to travel to for the last 2 years because they were locked down to foreign travel as well. This is simply good policy from a public health measure, and you not wanting to see that for what it is and instead attribute it to a nascent American hatred for China is laughable. the World Health Organization estimated close to 800 million new cases in China in the next few months, with another estimate 4 million deaths and countless new strains coming out during that period. This is about protection populations, not punishing China.
