Once they purge the essential supporters to a small, controllable number and prove that they can deliver the goods consistently, the dictator is extremely likely to survive. In practice, once a dictator has been in power for 8 years (might be less, I can't find the number right now) they are nearly invincible. Most don't make it.
The Mongols were nomads uninterested in ruling or economy, so when they invaded Russia (which was a collection of principalities at the time) , the system was straight forward, the population works, the princes extract as much of that product as possible, and they pay it as a tribute to the Mongols, else they just get beheaded.
