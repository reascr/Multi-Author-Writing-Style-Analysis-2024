I feel like I can call you Vlad because you and me are so alike. I'd like to meet you one day, it'd be great to talk about fascism. I know I'm not as great a dictator as you but I think you'd be impressed with how many people I've oppressed. Do you like my hair, I can run real fast. Did you have a good relationship with your father? Me neither. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have no been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did. I hope you write back this time, and we can become good friends. I am sure our friendship would be tha bomb!
Hmm infrastructure bill; upset republicans. Insulin cap; upset republicans; rail safety bill instituted by Obama; upset republicans to the point of repelling it and allowing it to happen; 4 day work week mention to allow for more time with your family; upsets republicans. Funding education; upsets republicans.
Right. Major Taylor Ham can actively call for sedition but this is unAmerican. Promoting democracy and freedom is unAmerican to them. Thatâ€™s about right.
