Even if Putin fucked off right this instant and there was peace in Ukraine within the hour, two years would still be impossible. There are so many requirements to fulfill, even countries that are a lot more stable than Ukraine wait for years and years until they're ready to join. I don't think it would be in Ukraine's economic interest to join so quickly, too. Sure, it would mean safety from another Russian attack. But western investors would rush in so fast and get a hold of the country's biggest assets. In the short term it would be great for rebuilding but after that they wouldn't be in control if what would make their country successful in the long term anymore. And then comes the brain drain thanks to the right to live and work all over the EU. It's good that Ukraine wants to start the process and Europe should help them with this. But the long term goal should be to do this properly so Ukraine can eter the EU as an equal to the other nations in it. It shouldn't be rushed.
