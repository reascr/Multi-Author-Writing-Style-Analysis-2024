I'm not discounting the significance. I'm saying the significance is negligible. They've been fighting over it for six months. Something akin to 50k russian troops have died for it. Pure insanity.
And I am listening to the soldiers on the front line. Wagner is basically at this point the mentally ill and prisoners running into a meat grinder. T1 equipment? Russia couldn't supply its vehicles with tires, and its Tanks are now as old as its conscripts. Everything I see is just dead Russians wearing Rags. There is no narrative, its the truth. I don't know why you want them to lose so bad that you're making up excuses. You sound like the crazy conspiracy theorists who say 'wake up sheeple.'.
Putin doesn't care how many of his own country's soldiers die fighting this war, what on earth would make anyone, but especially Ukrainians believe that if they "surrender" Putin isn't going to continue to attempt to exterminate them to the last individual?
I donâ€™t know how you know that. Yes, they are weapons of war, and they will kill until they are destroyed, break down, or run out of necessary resources to the operation of the vehicle.
