Sigh... Oprah, like Obama is ulimatily a conservative. Both are very well spoken and everything, but still conservatives. In the old days I would have thought of them as liberal Republicans., which used to be a thing. Until they all changed after Carter, and Democratics became the party of right leaning conservatives I hardly recognize led by Bill. Everyone seems to think that the difference between being a liberal and a conservative has to do with whether you support Woe vs Wade or the Christian right. It is really all about whether you support economic policies that leave no one behind or you don't. Oprah is filty rich and supports very conservative economics policies and conservative personalities who think and travel in the same circle as her. This doesn't make her a bad person just not very economically intelligent, unless it is about how to make more money, which is easy when you're rich. There is an entire huge industry in America devoted to advisers who will tell you that it takes money, to make money and how to stay rich. Ask Oprah she owns eight homes.
I'm neurodivergent and naturally my executive functioning is a total joke as a facet of my condition, but I don't feel so bad about that anymore after seeing some of the most politically powerful and influential people of recent years.
It's the framing. There's an air of condescension to how Ray addresses her audience, and that's what Bourdain seems to be addressing here. It's why I never liked her when my mom watched her.
