He’s playing the debt shell game. I would bet everything that if you add up all of his assets then subtract all of his debt his net worth is negative 9 figures. It’s musical chairs and the music is slowing as fewer and fewer entities are willing to loan him money. That’s why his grift has gone into overdrive, I don’t think he’s lying about 2020 or running for 2024 because he wants to, but because he has to just to keep the ship afloat.

Totally. $99 a piece, max of 100, so 9900 total someone could pay him and $10k the amount needed for the IRS to look into it.
Absolutely. And those embarrassing NFTs. that totally reeks of desperation. I guarantee that play was about releasing some of them and hoping the secondary market would drive the price up to 4 figures then dumping the rest at the inflated value. He’s probably only going to get 1/10 of what he was hoping for out of that fiasco. Another epic trump fail.
Now if you want to use that money without having to sell the stocks (which would force you to pay taxes on it), it's easy for wealthy people to take out huge loans with extremely low interest rates (1% or possibly even less) using their massive portfolio as collateral.
