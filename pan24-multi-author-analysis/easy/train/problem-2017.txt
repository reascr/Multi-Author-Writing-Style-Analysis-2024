Honestly we are about to get 2 solid years of the hunter biden laptop select committee drivel and wall-to-wall coverage by the conservative cinematic universe. I am very skeptical that anything will come from these recommendations. Republicans in congress will do their very best to fillibuster the department of justice by a 24/7 stream of testimony from any and every DOJ person that might be part of the investigation into Trump and/or his co-conspirators and/or anyone who acted on their own to interfere with the 2020 election or were involved with the 2021 insurrection. They will deploy the firehose of controversy method that serves them well when they are in power to prevent the system from holding anyone accountable.
Insurrectionist?? Give me a break. People hate Trump so much that they will go to any lenhs to keep him from running again. You really think a couple of people with flag poles and sticks can take over the government? The rest of the people would have had to resort to fisticuffs to do the job. This is the same as the attempts at impeachment that never went through.
