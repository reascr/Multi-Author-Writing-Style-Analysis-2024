In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly. If they were serious about freedom of religion instead of "freedom to only do what my interpretation of my religion says" than I can just make up my own religion (like every other religion anyways) and just do whatever the fuck I want. It would be anarchy.

Absolutely. Alito's opinion was faux religious outrage. It was a xtian only approach to politics. The satanic temple should instantly have been granted a religious exemption. According to the article followers of Judaism should have been granted the same. They were not. Instead the state laws often included language to protect rapists and abusers (no exemption for rape or incest).
