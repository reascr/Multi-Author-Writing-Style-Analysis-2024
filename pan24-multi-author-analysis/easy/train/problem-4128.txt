That's a very broad statement in regards to millennials and gen z. As a millennial, I remember the Clinton administration. And I know I'm not the only person under 40 who is politically aware- not only the current political climate but the past as well. It would be extremely short-sighted if two entire generations were only are aware of current politics. I remember Trump being a slime ball. I also remember his gaudy New York apartment. Anywho, generalizing people is not nice...
No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.
