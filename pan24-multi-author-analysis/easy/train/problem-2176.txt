Geez, Arkansas. I mean, y’all elected that no-fun Trump-pandering Sarah Huckabee Sanders (one of her first “actions” at the seat of power was to ban the use of LatinX) as governor … Now this? I’m not gay, or a cross-dresser, or a sexual explorer by any definition … but dayum my opinion of Arkansas is flushed down the terlet. Buncha sexist, self-righteous, sanctimonious doofuses. Live and let live, like Jesus implored you! smh.
>In mid-1932, a crackdown on homosexual subcultures in Prussia began after Chancellor Franz von Papen deposed the Prussian government. Some homosexual bars and clubs in Berlin had to shut down after police raids. In January 1933, the Nazi Party took power; immediately, their real and perceived enemies were the subject of a violent crackdown. On 23 February that year, the Prussian Ministry of the Interior ordered Berlin police to shut down any remaining establishments catering to "persons who indulge in unnatural sexual practices". This order was extended to other parts of Germany. In Cologne, almost all gay bars were forced to close. In Hanover, all had closed by the end of the year.
