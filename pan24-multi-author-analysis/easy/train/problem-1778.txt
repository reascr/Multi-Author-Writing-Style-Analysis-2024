Flynn will have to appear and testify. He'll almost certainly plead the Fifth. Fani Willis knows that. But he then can't testify for Trump. Same with Lindsey Graham. He'll plead the Fifth at grand jury, then he won't be able to show up at trial and make excuses for Trump. (Or himself.) Same with all the fake electors. By process of elimination, Willis will leave Trump with no defense witnesses. She has Brad Raffensberger and the notorious "I just need 11,781 votes" tape, White House witnesses, people in GA who knew about their fake electors scheme, documents. Plus a lot we don't know about.
“Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.”.
Agreed. Flynn is the martial leader of the Christian Fascist movement. In his speeches and rallys he openly advocates imposing a fundamentalist type of Christianity on government, schools, citizens.
who cares? it’s not like anything will happen. let’s ask a few questions, look mean and imposing and threatening, say some strong words, then nothing will come of any of it.
