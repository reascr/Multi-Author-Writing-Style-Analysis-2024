Fourth, one is a (hypothetical) order, and the other is a statute. To the extent they're in conflict, which one wins? Statutory law takes precedence. Arguably, it's constitutional law ("all executive . . . Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution", in which case there's no possible way for anything to the contrary to take precedence. So, the hypothetical order to let the coup succeed fails against both the statutory and constitutional obligation.
Third, even if he were given such an order, and even if we pretend it wasn't unlawful (it would be), then the order to let the coup succeed, and the obligation to prevent the coup from succeeding, are clearly in conflict. If you can't obey both, you, necessarily, have to violate one to uphold the other. So, there's an argument he at least had discretion, since it wasn't possible to fulfill both obligations.
Example. Yesterday some guy on Facebook said to me Zelinsky has a war on Christianity. That was a new one for me.
