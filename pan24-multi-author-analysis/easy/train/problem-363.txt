In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Oh yeah. So, we should actively protest gun shows. We should punish businesses that carry guns, or allow gun owners to do business there. We should target schools that have guns mentioned in their criteria and ban that. We should refer to gun owners as dangers to our children. Maybe start calling them groomers. We should absolutely make kids show if there are guns in their house before they can play in sports. We should try and limit services to gun owners on religious grounds. Let's bully gun owners until they are forced to commit suicide. And while we're at it, let's have national level discussions on which bathrooms gun owners can use.
