Uneducated voters lean heavily Republican therefor no one should be surprised that DeSantis and his compatriots are gutting schools and universities. Stupid is as stupid does.
All true, but even conservative businesses get HR violations that result in expensive lawsuits… and kids who go into businesses without groundings in working together, an issue that schools have noted is getting increasingly bad, are more likely to get into those lawsuits AND to work so poorly together that it impacts businesses bottom lines.
When people ask where I'm from these days I tell them "Old Florida". This dystopian, authoritarian, fascist transplant infested shithole isn't what I grew up with and I want no association with it. Its embarrassing.
Even if that doesn’t cause a dent all it takes is a few studies about how students from Florida aren’t getting into higher paying jobs. Conservative parents might care about conservative issues but at the end of the day they care more about money.
