They haven't lost their mind. They have decided to be tabloid politicians. You know, like tabloids that publish made-up stories and sensationalize regular news to outrage their readers and entice them to buy more of their fake stories. These election losers are the political equivalent of tabloids, making up stories and sensationalizing non-events to aggravate their followers into wanting more and more outrage. Not insane. Just tabloid politicians. It pays the bills, I guess.
So basically the GOP is trying to say she suppressed free speech by reporting misinformation about election information to the appropriate authorities. Lol.
This particular thing that this article about is especially ludicrous, especially since people like Tucker Carlson and MTG are calling for a federal investigation. The big thing they're all upset about is that the day after the insurrection, back on January 7th 2021, a German Twitter account asked if America's elections were being run by foreign entities, and Katie Hobbs (as the secretary of state for Arizona) noted to a nonprofit that they should be flagged or removed as election misinformation. They're claiming that something Katie Hobbs did in her role as AZ's SOS nearly two years ago while Trump was president warrants a federal investigation into a governor's race that just happened. It's truly bizarre.
