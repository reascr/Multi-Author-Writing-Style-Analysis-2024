They say we choose them but in reality, government give candidate to people, most people don't want them as their representative so they don't vote, the 10% of population that support ( get paid by government) vote so they get choose and tell the world they are from people but they are not, you can't find single person in iran government that people actually wants.
That was interesting yeah, you know the whole purpose of Islamic republic was to destroy iran, before so called revolution iran had some political problem but people life was fine they had freedom of choice if you ask people who was alive and mature back there they will tell you, they admit that they been tricked, the minimum reason for a revolution didn't exist but it happens anyway, now if this government don't end Iranian people basically can't live so there is no choice for us.
Oh damn. We need to tell them that is not right. They need to know that protests happen because something is wrong with the system. Politicians get egotistical and think their way is the only way. But thats not how humans are. Theres an infinite amount of ways that were still learning. Not knowing theres extra possibilities leaves you to be a belief that eventually dies due to the lack of viability.
