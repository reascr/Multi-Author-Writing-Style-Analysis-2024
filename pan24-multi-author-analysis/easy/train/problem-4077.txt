Yeah after the small minority of senators that killed Caesar, Brutus was their choice of successor for purely how close he was in public to Caesar. After his death was announced the entire city of Rome went fuckin crazy and went all of the city trying to find the people who murdered him. The difference being Caesar was immensely popular for his lavish games, events, and these all gave out free food and drinks. Which is huge for back then (we don’t even get that treatment). Putin though I wonder if the average Russian citizen would be relieved or scared for the power vacuum that would happen. As I can’t see him being popular in the same was Caesar was especially with the mobilizations that are for sure killing a lot of Russian teenagers / young adults and making a lot of mothers very angry/depressed as the male sons in Russia are more portrayed as keeping a family lineage from being extinguished.
I agree! It’s also not like they haven’t fought a war on this land before. It’s a shit-show. A mercenary army fighting for money will never defeat a people fighting for their lives. Just ask England.
