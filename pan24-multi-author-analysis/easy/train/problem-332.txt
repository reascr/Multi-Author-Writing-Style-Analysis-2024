Ukraine really is the resilient and creative road runner in this situation while Russia just keeps throwing all this manpower, effort, and technology that just isn't getting the job done at it and blowing up in their faces Wile E Coyote style.
Hi. I'm a Cold War 1970s baby.... you ain't seen nothing yet. This is a minor pissing match. I was a kid during the days of Strategic Air Command and nuclear subs and the massive dick measuring via our defense budget under Reagan. Hell a too big portion of those people are STILL in Congress today at 70 and 80.
Uranium and plutonium aren't actually that radioactive. Weapons-grade Uranium's half life is 700 million years. Unless they fission, nuclear warheads won't create any fallout and the radioactivity from the fissile material in the warhead would also be minimal. Furthermore, nuclear warheads are complex enough that they won't detonate from the missile carrying them destroyed.
Fascinating! A part of band of brothers that stuck with me was the part where the US army had to hastily leave a location because the russian army was coming, and thought that was strange since they were on the same side?
