This isn't really about China. It's partly about North Korea, but also about what happens after the war in Ukraine ends. If Russia loses and undergoes another political disintegration, nobody wants some rogue general in Magadan or a sub captain in Vladivostok starting any nonsense in the North Pacific.
This is true. I contract manufacturing for my company worldwide. The Chinese manufacturers consistently offer contracts that are 30% cheaper than American manufacturers and even more than European manufacturers. While they deliver products at or above specifications, and meet time lines, I'm sure they must be cutting corners somewhere which is indicative of corruption, and if I see it in one sector of manufacturing it must pervade their entire country.
No, its not. All the US has to do to ruin China is park a carrier group on the Indian Ocean side of the Strait of Malacca. That cuts China off from most of its customers (assuming the US also initiates its own embargo), almost all of its oil, and most of its fertilizer (though the Ukraine war is doing that on its own). Their economy would implode in a matter of months, and their military wouldn't have the fuel to even move troops to put down internal rebellions, much less engage in an amphibious assault on Taiwan or air war on Japan.
