Yes its difficult to replace the dollar with the Yuan or the Ruble, but its possible to replace the dollar with a currency basket. Actually, it might benefit Saudi Arabia more financially than the dollar, but we (Saudis) will lose the American favor, which is still worth something even though its not what it used to be.
Example. South Carolina wanted to build a nuclear plant, but it failed, partially because there wasn't enough of a skilled workforce available. They had to outsource labour from South Korea.
Additionally. Rather than using philosophical theories as a justification for coming to a conclusion, I'd recommend using them more as loose guides to help identify the important parts of a problem, as those are far more likely to lead you to a statement of fact, rather than a misguided justification for your claim.
2. Which country does not have capital controls (for fear of wealth escaping the country?) Ruble? Yuan? USD?
According to real life, Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda hate the guts of the Saudi government, one of the main goals of Al-Qaeda was to remove the Saudi monarchy because it allowed US troops and American military base in Saudi Arabia. Something very Haram in Osama's mind.
"A formalization of this idea takes the form of an Ockham Theorem: A theorem that shows (under appropriate restrictions) that an inductive method finds the truth as efficiently as possible for a given problem if and only if the method is the Ockham method, that is, it selects the simplest hypothesis consistent with the data. An Ockham theorem provides a justification for Ockham’s inductive razor as a means towards epistemic aims.".
Right. I agree. I just want to add, Ockham's Razor leads to the simplest answer given the data. It does not mean that the answer will be simple at all. And the process of going through the data and applying Ockham's theorem to said data is not a simple process in itself.
