The thing a nazi fears most is having their true intentions exposed. Think of the famous Arbicht Macht Frei or work will set you free sign on the concentration camps. It's such a sadistically dishonest saying that captures the pure dishonorability of nazis perfectly. They always told people they would be perfectly safe in the train cars knowing full well, they were to be sent to their deaths. What's the singular characteristic that every modern republican displays daily? It's dishonesty. They lie about EVERYTHING and it's to confuse the masses and make people unsure about who they are following.
Targeting civilian infrastructure, Targeting the media, Targeting healthcare facilities, Food and medical warehouses, Residential neighborhoods, Powerstations, Water treatment plants, Markets, Schools, Mosques, etc.
We CAN do both. We have the ability to help US citizens while also sending aid to Ukraine. But the GOP doesn't want to help US citizens. They don't want to help anyone but themselves.
