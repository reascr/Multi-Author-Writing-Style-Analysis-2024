The problem is in one end we have Governor brownback in Kansas who kept in letting taxes more and more promising that it would actually increase revenue, and that provided revenue increase never came, only further deficits and lots of government services, and in the other hand, i can't recall a single time the Laffer curve had ever been proven true. Hypothetically, if there was a 100% tax rate, then I suppose lowing the tax rate to 90% would probably lead to a revenue increase since people would actually be willing to work, but in real life, even with the extremely high tax rates of the 40's and 50's, raising tax rates, even to extraordinary high rates leads to revenue increases and letting the tax rate, even on extraordinary high rates leads to revenue decrease.
Is it? Or is it that the Dems do do some shit, but the GOP takes the cake. For example, when it comes to sex crimes, the GOPs crimes heavily outweigh the Dems, yet the Rs blame the Dems. When it comes to spend, the GOP has consisentley increased the debt but blame the Dems. Wars as well, taking away freedoms, etc etc.
