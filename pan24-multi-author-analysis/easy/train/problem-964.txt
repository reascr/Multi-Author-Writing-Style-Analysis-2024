Where is the proof Biden is knowingly keeping these documents? The documents were not in demand by the archives, and some are apparently dated from when he was VP, which means they haven't been in demand for quite some time. They are also likely of no particular importance, if they weren't in demand, and so the logical conclusion is that they were misfiled and forgotten about. Now they were found, and Biden did everything he needed to do with them, and is also making sure he has no more somewhere else by voluntarily searching for them. Biden didn't ship boxes full of documents to his house, he didn't deny having them, and he also didn't lie to the archives about them. There is no equivalence here, what Trump did is far worse in every regard. Biden likely isn't even committing a crime, as it would have to be through gross or willful negligence to have these documents. Misfiling is not gross or willful.
