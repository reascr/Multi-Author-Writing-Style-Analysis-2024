There are not enough people in the US available to enforce the laws 100%. Not enough border agents, judges, court clerks, lawyers, bailifs, case workers, guards, transcriptionists... etc. People like you seem to present this "fix" that if we only followed and enforced the law exactly as written then it would be perfect. Except to have your model work we'd have to significantly shift taxes to border control and have huge staffing increases and the people to fill those positions just are not there. We'd have to train them or get them in school and wait for them to become available. In the mean time all other parts of the economy suffer from a similar lack of labor. Which could be solved by any sort of sane immigration reform i.e. understanding that many workers would be fine as seasonal migrant workers and return home if they were given the ability to do so easily.but the process is over complicated, the quotas too low, and many businesses that rely on the migrant workers would rather it stay that way to benefit from gaming the system for low wage workers that won't get into disputes over wage theft, safety, or workers rights. You are simply trying to fix the wrong end of the equation.
