IMO I don't know of any other solution aside a military sweep to deal with the cartels. They'd need to be shut down hard and fast with overwhelming force. However, that can only be done if it was a joint operation with the Mexican government. Without their support in the matter (and likely internal cartel corruption vying against it) there would be no avenue to persue with the military. Yet, without both countries banning together to handle the violent & corrupting threat that is the cartels, the cartels will simply keep doing business and become more entrenched in more places and business ventures than they already are.
Oh my God! How could a species going extinct from being killed by fisherman in the California gulf possibly be tied in with a sanction of buying fish from thoes fishermen killing that species in the California gulf. Oh well got to keep thoes $0.40 cans of tuna coming.
Mexico doesn't regard Mexico's sovereignty either. They let cartels run ramshackle among the populace: Mexico's government had totally lost the monopoly of violence from which sovereignty originates.
So? That’s Mexico’s business. The United States doesn’t have the right to interfere. Then again, when has the us cared? Otherwise, millions of people would still have their homes. Hundreds of thousands of civilians wouldn’t have been killed.
