That is part of the point. Many of the deals that were made were set up for the countries to fail. The result of the failure is that China would then take full ownership. China would not have been able to build a Chinese port in the continent, but they would happily be allowed to build a “Somalian port”, which would eventually/legally later become a Chinese port. It is pretty messed up. Many of those countries could just say fuck off and tell China to do something about it. We will believe China’s power after they send in troops to protect their interests.
Exactly. Anyone claiming a negotiated treaty that doesn't start at restoring Ukraine to pre-2014 borders to guarantee peace is either ignorant or taking Russia's side.
Edit: If Russia gains anything from any treaty, it will just mean it is buying time to invade Ukraine or another nation later. It would be rewarding invasions. Classic appeasement.
You didn't read the plan. Ukraine would be conceding all of the land Russia has already captured and all of the land on the right side that they haven't yet, also making it a "demilitarized zone". Because we all know how well that worked out the last time right.
