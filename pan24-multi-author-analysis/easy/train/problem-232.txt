To be fair, US government intelligence has been fairly accurate. Obviously the US has an interest in Russia losing and Ukraine winning, but they correctly predicted the start of the war saying in January that an invasion would take place in February, even though Ukraine itself refuted that. Then the US correctly predicted offensives in the east and south, which is why Ukraine was able to prepare for that. As far as casualties, the US claims Russia has lost over 100k in battle but they also acknowledge that Ukraine has lost over 100k too (which aligns with EU and UK estimates). Meanwhile the Ukrainians stopped counting after 10k and the Russians after 4.5k. If you remember back to the beginning of the war, the US government had a policy of trying to call out Russia’s actions to attempt to put pressure of the kremlin. It was surreal because the US would claim something would happen, like troop movements towards the Belorussian border or something, and then it would happen (albeit a week or so late). CIA director burns has flown to Kyiv several times to give zelensky intelligence reports, and part of Ukraine’s success on the battlefield isn’t just US weapons but also that US intelligence has been able to predict troop movements within the country.
1. A slow approval of aid packages by world governments. So far Ukraine has received a constant flow of aid but it's been relatively random half the time, they get some serious equipment then miscellaneous items then serious equipment again. This could cause openings from time to time.
