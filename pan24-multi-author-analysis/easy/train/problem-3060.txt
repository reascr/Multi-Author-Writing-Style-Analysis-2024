You are thinking about Brazil in terms of the past/present, though, things may be MUCH different in not even the far-flung future, but the immediate future... South Korea may be openly considering acquiring nukes because of NK's nuclear expansion, according to this article, but I bet almost every developed nation is discretely considering acquiring them given the geopolitical shitstorm that is the world today; with Pootin threatening to nuke Ukraine, a non-nuclear power. Because if Putler actually does nuke Ukraine at some point, non-proliferation dies instantly, and from that point on every country the world over will see that the ONLY definitive deterrence against being nuked by some rogue nuclear power will be having nuclear weapons of their own and the threat of nuclear retaliation against that rogue nuclear power.
Right? This is totally on China. They've enabled that regime of xenophobic sociopaths for decades. Well now they're gonna have a nuclear Korean peninsula as well as a nuclear Japan. Well done.
