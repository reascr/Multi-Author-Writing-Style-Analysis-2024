And it's not just a medal lost, too. Winning a medal in Mr. Olympia gives you hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money (and not to mention sponsorship deals). And he was in the top 5 in Mr. Olympia every year from 2017-2022 (except for 2018 due to the travel ban). So it was like his whole year's salary was robbed from him as well in 2018. And there's only so many years in your physical prime that you can be a top contender in Mr. Olympia. So in a way, he was robbed of a good chunk of his lifetime earnings.
Exactly. The death of Mahsa was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. The hijab issue that this began with is just a symbol of the total oppression by the regime. We are talking 43 years of kangaroo courts, imprisonment, torture, and killings, whilst the regime squanders Iran's wealth on state sponsored terrorism. We are talking thousands executed in 1988 when now-president Raisi was on the "Death Committee". 1500 more in 2019 when they blacked out the internet and killed citizens. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The Iranian people have had enough... The difference is that now, they're past being scared anymore.
