Harvesting and accumulating the data isn't the hard part anymore in the interconnected world, the new challenge is how to utilize it and monetize it effectively because just selling it off doesn't make that much. Look at .
They’re collecting very detailed data on our way of life, how we react to things, and manipulating the algorithm to show us brain numbing content - I don’t know what they’re planning either but I definitely know I don’t want my adversary to have such intimate information on how my brain literally works.
Oh, come on now. You named the two biggest companies that are attempting to do exactly what I mentioned Amazon failed to do in monetizing the data they've collected. Facebook and Google in particular no longer NEED to sell data wholesale and be simple data brokers, as they've transitioned their revenue models into advertising algorithms. Now they're the ones BUYING data either directly or gain access to it from everyone else to supplement their existing ability to harvest user data.
I don't know. That's why I am asking, in a somewhat flippant way, because I mostly assume they are just making money.
