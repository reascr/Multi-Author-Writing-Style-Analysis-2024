So now not only are you going to pay for your water service, you're going to pay for Aqua Penn to work down THEIR debt in the newly acquired water plant AND hand a fat stack of cash to all of the shit bag business folks running their company but not actually doing anything to provide water.
Dumb and short sighted. Everyone living in Pennsylvania should already know better then to allow this to happen. PA state government did this with the Turnpike under assurances the company who bought it (100 year lease I believe) wouldn't change anything, excessively raise prices, etc. Which clearly was a just a flat out lie.
Rather than privatizing the entire thing, lease operating rights for the equipment and water distribution to turn it into a continual revenue generator for the local district and leaves you with the ability to throw out companies that try to use their monopoly to price gouge.
What don't you understand about what I said above? They will pay EVEN MORE if a private company takes it over. It's literally a requirement for aqua Penn to remain a viable entity.
