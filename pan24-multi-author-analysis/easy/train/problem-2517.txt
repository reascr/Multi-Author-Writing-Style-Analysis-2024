It's pretty widely accepted that Gillibrand lead the charge on the Democratic side which lead to Franken resigning. I think there are lots of people out there who believe with a Senate ethics review (what Franken was asking for) more details would have come out highlighting the situation Franken was caught up in was a right wing hatchet job. Instead Gillibrand tapped into the current MeToo movement (of which Franken was a huge supporter of) to instead mobilize a group of Dems to push Franken to resign to boost her profile as a Presidential candidate. No she absolutely did not have the power to oust him as a Senator but she did have the power to portray him as a hypocrite and predator which did lead him to resign rather than putting himself in a no win situation between the both the trolls on the right and the progressives on the left. If you don't think a candidate (edited from woman because either sex could/can do this) elected to the Senate has the power to emotionally manipulate a colleague into doing what they wanted for clout you are drastically underestimating the savvy of a person who convinced 4+ million people to vote for them.
In Canada we get 12 months. Or 18 if you're OK with spreading that same amount of money over a longer period. As a father I even got my own 5 weeks so I could help my wife.
