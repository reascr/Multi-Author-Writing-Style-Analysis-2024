If you take the full 30 years to pay your mortgage you’re fucking up. $100 extra/month principal payment typically shaves off about 8 years from your term. Dump your income tax returns into additional lump principal payment annually, you’ve already earned that money, may as well save on interest long term. Buy your house, pay that shit off in 15ish years, save to retire. You don’t need millions of dollars to cover bills and housing and shit when you retire. You need to minimize/eliminate payments/expenses. It’s not hard, stop buying stupid shit you don’t need. You don’t have to be rich to make this happen, you simply have to break the addiction to unnecessary purchases. Those little $3-$5 bullshit items can add up to thousands over the course of a year.
Absolutely. If any Presidential candidate even hinted at trying to limit corporate spending on real estate, that candidate would have their donation spigot dry up overnight and their party would ensure they never take the stage in another primary debate.
