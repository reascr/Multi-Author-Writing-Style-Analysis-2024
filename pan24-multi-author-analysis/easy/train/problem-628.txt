Allgood. Speaker of the house has real political power. First Lady can move in broader ways outside of Washinon. The First Lady can really get involved with things that everyday people deal with. Eleanor Roosevelt took an airplane ride with a Tuskegee airman to show itâ€™s safe to fly with a black man. She also flew with Amelia Earhart when few woman could get jobs in aviation. Many more first ladies used their position of privilege to make a positive mark on our society. Think what you want about Nancy Reagan , but I remember her hugging children with aides on tv. Trump agitated divisions in our citizenry. That plastic bimbo did nothing but physically stand behind him.

Yeah, definitely. I just see that the first step to proportional representation (which is what I think you're getting at), is to first get a voting method in place that doesn't result in "lesser-of-two-evils" voting.
Exactly. Putting in some kind of approval voting is much easier, as it doesn't require anything beyond simple laws to enact, and it's at least a starting point towards a system where the only logical voting choice is one of the two major parties.
