Definitely not just a UK thing. Like most JW children, I grew up carrying a "No Blood" card that was a daily reminder that if I were ever in a serious accident or developed leukemia, my parents would let me die rather than allow for lifesaving medical treatment. There was never any question about it.
You are clearly indoctrinated, and uneducated. You would benefit the most from the education you so ardently reject.

I feel bad for the kid. He's a combination of their genetics after all. Pretty much encoded for failure in life on top of being raised wrong if not removed from the home.
Serious question. Given that the parents have already shown themselves to be crazy, will this affect how much they love their child? Will all they be able to see is a living blob of vaccine?
Interestingly, I've never met an anti-vaxxer or conspiracy theorist who wasn't incredibly pretentious or arrogant. Hell, there's at least one around here talking about "tainted blood" and blah blah blah.
