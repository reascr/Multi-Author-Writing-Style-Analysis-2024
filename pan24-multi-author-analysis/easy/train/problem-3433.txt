Before Trump was mocked for his comments regarding ingesting disinfectant and "somehow bringing light into the body", he was taking charge of the whole pandemic response after it sort of took off despite attempts to ignore it since December 2019. It's quite possible he was just putting himself in the pandemic response so he'd be in more of a position to put a stop to it, but I wouldn't put it past him to align with the anti-vax/mask/lockdown people just because the more intelligent people were mocking him for his attempts to suggest solutions to people who are much more knowledgeable on the topic.
That was then. This is now. That was when DeSantis was running for (what turned out to be his first term as) governor and needed Trump’s help. Now he doesn’t need Trump’s help. His reelection victory margin was much larger without Trump’s blessing thanit was 4 years earler with Trump’s blessing. DeSantis has ambitions to be POTUS. While it suited him, DeSantis was a MINO (Maga in Name Only).
Seriously. I see people bringing up that idea and it seems absurd. Not only would it ruin his brand, but Trump literally tried to get his last one killed.
