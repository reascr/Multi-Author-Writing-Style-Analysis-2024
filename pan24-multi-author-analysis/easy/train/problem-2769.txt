'Even during the last years of Reconstruction, Democrats used paramilitary insurgents and other activists to disrupt and intimidate Republican freedman voters, including fraud at the polls and attacks on their leaders. The electoral violence culminated in the Democrats regaining control of the state legislatures and passing new constitutions and laws from 1890 to 1908 to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites. They also imposed Jim Crow, a combination of legal and informal segregation acts that made blacks second-class citizens, confirming their lack of political power through most of the southern United States. The social and economic systems of the Solid South were based on this structure, although the white Democrats retained all the Congressional seats apportioned for the total population of their states.'.
Considered abstractly, Conservatism and Progressivism should by rights be paired as what I've seen referred to as "The Shield of Tradition and the Sword of Innovation", alas in practice Conservatism all too often devolves into "The Crab Bucket of Do-Nothing Know-Nothings" and Progressivism is forced to pick up the slack and put a lot of its time, attention and effort into preserving the things Conservatism is neglecting (for instance, environmental conservation).
