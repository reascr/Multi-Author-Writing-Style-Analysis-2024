I don’t like socialism. I especially don’t like communism, they’re wonderful ideas in theory but i know for a fact they won’t work without mass indoctrination over generations of humans, I sure as fuck wouldn’t still be an engineer if I could get basically the same amount to do jack shit. I hate the overtaxing that most progressives want. I don’t agree with deregulated abortion, I believe there should be limits placed, a 30 week fetus is not the same as a 6 week embryo and should be treated differently. I don’t believe in neopronouns at all, or the excuse that adhd and autism make you experience gender differently, I have pretty severe adhd and a friend has autism, neither of us feel like we’re actually a cat gender cloud or some dumb shit. I want the government as far out of my life as possible, I don’t want them watching what I do daily. I want to be able to protect myself, I don’t want to be held accountable because a criminal broke into my house and fell down my stairs that don’t have rails (this actually fucking happens in Australia and the criminal wins the court case every time). I don’t want dumb shit like misgendering someone to be a jailable offence. I believe in protecting borders from people illegally entering the country, whatever country that is. I ABSOLUTELY NO NOT believe in the abolishment of the police, especially if you want to impose anti gun laws as well. I do not believe men should be collectively held responsible for the actions of a few dumb fucks. The list goes on.
