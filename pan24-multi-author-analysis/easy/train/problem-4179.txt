As much as i would love to argue that clicks shouldn't matter when presenting unbiased news (which is in very short supply), you are unfortunately correct. I wonder if the AP is going down that path as well ðŸ¤”.
In all, he has made the cartels more violent, was an actual anti-vaxxer during the early Covid days, practically overspends the people's money (they had to cancel Mexico's version of the Academy Awards), attacks journalists and dissidents, has splintered relations with the US, and supports authoritarians like Putin/Maduro/Castillo.
What the fuck? That's MASSIVE news. How is this not on top of everywhere. He slammed an entire nation and BLASTED a US official and there's no outrage?
Itâ€™s complicated. For one, heâ€™s an outsider. Came from a poor farming background. He made a lot of promises to bring prosperity to rural areas and hasnâ€™t been able to do that. So that has cost him some support from his base. From what Iâ€™ve read, heâ€™s gone through dozens of cabinet members, many of whom were unsuited for their roles. A number of accusations of corruption. The political elite in Lima want their power back. Etc, etc, etc. In other words, politics as usual the world over.
