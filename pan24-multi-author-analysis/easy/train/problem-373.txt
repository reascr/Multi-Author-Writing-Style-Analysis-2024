This is how the whole hydroxychloroquine thing got legs. There was a small study, which shortly proved to be wrong, showing that HCQ was effective against COVID symptoms, and the Trump administration latched on to it, hopeful that it could turn the tide of the pandemic. Trump rapidly hyped it up so thoroughly that even after it was proven to be ineffective, he didn't want to lose face by admitting that he'd been wrong (even though, uncharacteristically for Trump, he had been wrong for a completely innocent reason).
This. People are confusing them losing interest in Trump with losing interest in their extremism. Turn on Tucker. It's alive and well and getting worse by the day. They just realize he's not capable of inflicting hate and evil they want onto libs if he can't takeover the government, either legitimately or not. They tried both, and both failed.
It still amazes me that after a doctor gave him a dementia test while he was president, in which he had to identify that a drawing of an animal with a hump was a camel and that a drawing of an animal with a long neck was a giraffe, trump subsequently went on TV to brag about how he had been able to correctly name the animals.
Cut through the noise. Trumpism is too encompassing a word. Ask your family this weekend if they really think homophobia is the next winning strategy. Push back.
