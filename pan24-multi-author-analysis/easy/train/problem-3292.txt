When Russia purposefully kidnaps children and has them rush adopted by Russian people(among other atrocities), yeah I’d say that’s a pretty apt comparison.
Incompetent? I would be taking away your food and stop you from getting more (by buying it, leave to get more or prevent other people to send you food). My intention would be to starve you to death and I would take direct action to ensure that outcome. Now amplify that to a country scale and tell me it isn't targeted murder.
Russian economy is trash, the military is depleted, fatigued, hopelessly uncoordinated and completely demotivated and demoralized. What defenses they have left in the east must be thinner than rice paper.
Disgusting and inexcusable. But we also need to remember that Ukraine also committed their own massacre on Poles when the shoe was on the other foot. Still inexcusable and incredibly sickening what is happening today. just sayn to give some historical context. And Poles are still willing to open their arms to Ukrainians.
