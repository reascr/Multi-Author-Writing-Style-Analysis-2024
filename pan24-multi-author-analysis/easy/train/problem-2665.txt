OMG you just legit blew my mind. My parents (who both died before I became an adult so I never could ask them about this) never spanked me. Which, at the time, was highly unusual. And I grew up to be an outlier with my fellow boomers. I’m open minded, politically progressive, and I feel way more comfortable with young people than with my cohort. I’m resisting the idea of living in senior housing because I worry I will be surrounded by people completely unlike me in every way. I’ve struggled to understand why so many of my generation are right wing trolls, but you have certainly provided a possible reason. I’ll definitely be giving this a lot more thought.
It isn't imperialistic though. Moldova is Romania, in the same way Wallachia is Romania. Moldovans, Transylvanians, and Wallachians are all Romanians. My entire family is from Romania. My mother is Moldovan, just because she is from the Moldova that is still part of Romania it doesn't make her any less Moldovan. Her parents were Moldovan before Bessarabia was stolen by the Russians, does that make them any less Moldovan?
