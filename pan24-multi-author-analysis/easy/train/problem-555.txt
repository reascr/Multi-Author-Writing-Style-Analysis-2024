30mm autocannon is not a tank gun. But its a big gun, far bigger than any infantry can reasonably use. Because of its relatively small size (for a vehicle), it can fire 600+ rounds-per-minute (10 shots per second), more than enough firepower for any infantry related task.
10-shots per second of a huge 30mm 25mm round each is also more useful than 1-tank shot every 5+ seconds, like from a proper M1 Abrams.
The rounds are smaller (allowing the M2 Abrams to store hundreds-and-hundreds of shots). M1 Abrams only has 50 shots (because the tank shell is just so freaking big). The chaingun still has fancy features: airburst and other such features. The rocket allows it to kill tanks (though not as well as a proper tank can).
In practice, the guns / rockets USA puts on the Bradley have given it the most kills of most vehicles. IMO, its best to think of it as a jack-of-all-trades glass cannon. Bradley has every tool needed to kill everything on the battlefield. But maybe not the most efficient / best way.
Over time missile harassments become pointless, counterproductive to national defense, expensive, and embarrassing.
Here we go! I've theorized that M2 Bradley is a __FAR__ more important vehicle than M1 Abrams tank for Ukraine.
M2 Bradley is an IFV, infantry fighting vehicle. Its primary goal is to provide infantry support. Squads can load / unload from the vehicle. Squads can shoot from inside the vehicle. A rocket-launcher (including Javelin-like systems) and small 30mm auto-cannon equip the main armament.
