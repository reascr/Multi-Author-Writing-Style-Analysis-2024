Yes. Even just Polish Soil would be enough for them to invoke Article 5, however on a practical level they may be unlikely to do so over soil. Dead people on the other hand… that’s a much bigger deal and much more likely to consider it an attack. Which mean they would have a right to invoke article 5.

No we didn't. You for some reason think this was an attack. There isnt any evidence that is the case. They don't even know who fired the rockets. Only that they were Russian made which isn't really a confirmation of anything given the age and model of the pieces of the rocket found at the scene. Some are saying it's one of the hundreds of rockets Russia fired at Ukraine today that steered off course, some are saying it could be Ukraines missile defense system missing a target and not detonating in the air. A tragedy and almost certainly an accident regardless. But most certainly not an attack.

Sure. But NATO already made it clear to Russia than any fallout from attacks on Ukraine that reaches NATO soil would be considered a red line. This certainty qualifies under that standard, even if on accident. And NATO is right to do so, as it’s on Russia to ensure their ordinance hits its target.
