It's really not similar though. The particles used cant reproduce like cats and only slightly change the albedo of earth. It's a good idea I just don't think it should be done by a startup it should be a world wide governmental effort so we can accurately measure the amount to particles we are putting up there. If we put exactly the right amount than it will effectively eliminate all climate change which is objectively good. I know its kinda scary changing the atmosphere like that but it's no scarier than the future we have right now and the consequences of climate change.
Hmmmmmmmmmm. Or, we could just not? If it really comes down to HAVING to do something like this, it should be a government project and not up to some rando startup. This is going to open some dangerous doors if they aren't bullshitting.
Totally. We need a snappy company name that either makes us sound like a 2014 MLG Call of Duty gamertag with lots of Xs, or includes some kind of pun on what we do, and then we can go on the Joe Rogan Experience and get high while talking absolute bullshit.
