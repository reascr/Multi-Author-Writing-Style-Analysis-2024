It is very possible that he will pull some shit if he loses. They lost Istanbul in 2019 mayoral elections and they wanted a reelection saying opposition has cheated, since the difference was less than %1 and then, they lost by %9 percent difference. Turkish people don’t really like crybabies I guess. They might do the same thing if the results are very close. Other than that, he might try to go for the Trump/Bolsenaro kind of shit to rally his supporters. Again we don’t know how will army react in such cases and I think it is very crucial. If the army does not support him and tells him to fuck off, I don’t think there is much he can do. All his big boy supporters are also with him because he is a winner. There is no way they will support him if he is likely to lose. But he does not have more than 40% support at best and I would like to believe they are not that stupid to go against 60%. So, hope for the best. And you can ask if you have any other question.
imprisoning political opponents and intellectuals, banning opposition figures from election, freezing the assets of opposition parties..
