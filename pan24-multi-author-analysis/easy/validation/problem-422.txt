Increased efficiency from less bloated bureaucracy (physicians make up a much smaller portion of healthcare costs than ever before despite Medicaid reimbursement being more generous than private insurance was just a couple decades ago), preferably mixed with an across the board increase in reimbursement for government healthcare (whether it's Medicaid for all or a completely new system of payment).
Is it a good thing though? We have some of the highest tax rates (even compared to NYC) and we have failing schools, severe homeless, substance abuse, and tents/trash everywhere. We pass these things and then have no competence to implement them while nonprofits reap millions. We are ranked 49 for mental health care services, coming in right above Alabama. The grift game is strong here, unfortunately.
