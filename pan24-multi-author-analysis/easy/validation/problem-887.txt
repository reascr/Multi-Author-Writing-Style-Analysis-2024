Why? The good news is we only need less vaccine than covid because people will catch it on purpose for "freedom." If it is deadly just dig a couple mass graves and toss the trash in there. It'll save us a lot more time and money that way.
I have a science degree in Ecological evolutionary and organismal biology as well as a science degree in Environmental studies. There are plenty of sources regarding population dynamics/biology and infectious disease. Ill throw a few for you to read based on various illness/diseases. Hope you actually read them. These are based on our species in the modern era. Doesn’t take a genius to observe in nature though. If you plant a field of wheat without fungicide or any gmo strains you will quickly see many fungal, bacterial, and viral infections run rampant in said field as well as insect damage. This is because it is unnatural. Nature doesn’t like monoculture. Hell look at CWD in deer populations. Cwd is a prion disease but I believe it is due to high numbers of deer in North America.
