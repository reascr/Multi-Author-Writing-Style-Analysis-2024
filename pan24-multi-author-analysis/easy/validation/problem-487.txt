what are you talking about? the only way yall get any chance at throwing the tories out before 2025 is if you make them too scared to remain in government. what are you gonna buy or not buy to trigger a GE?
Well when you go through 3 leaders in a year, two of them failing due to massive amounts of ineptitude, and two of them being elected by the party rather then the people, with the current one being a rich bastard who is already in a huge disconnect with Britain (likely due to being rich and not having to worry like the rest of us) and then combine that with there not being an actual election until 2024, itâ€™s gonna make people not give a shit.
What about this makes things better long term? A one time pay increase is going to be inflated away shortly. Not allowing workers to be laid off makes the government less efficient. Both requests obviously increase inflation.
That's the spirit. I show up at any strike I can make it to on my days off. I fully understand why I have those days off and am happy to give some of them back to the cause.
