The primary leaders of the Mujahedeen formed the Islamic State of Afghanistan following the defeat of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The biggest outcast from the Islamic State of Afghanistan was Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who now instead of waging war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan waged war against his former Mujahedeen allies.
The Taliban, literally Students, came about from Kandahar province under the leadership of Mullah Omar, a former low or mid level Mujahedeen, against the failures of the Islamic State of Afghanistan (both its ability to establish any sense or order, the constant fighting, and the fact that, like Hekmatyar, they found it was too liberal). There isn't really a direct line between the Taliban and the leadership of the Mujahedeen, again, as the Taliban rose up against the now divided leaders of the Mujahedeen. The former leaders of the Islamic State of Afghanistan then tried to form a resistance, known in the West as the Northern Alliance, with their most prominent leader being Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud, along with Hekmatyar, was among the foremost of the original Muajhedeen.
Exaclty. They are Pashtun and many Pashtun do not care there is a border separating Afghanistan and Pakistan. They straddle the border and move pretty much freely between the two countries. The two groups are officially different groups, primarily with different missions. However, they are ethnically the same. One group runs the Afghan government now and the other is fighting against the Pakistani government.
