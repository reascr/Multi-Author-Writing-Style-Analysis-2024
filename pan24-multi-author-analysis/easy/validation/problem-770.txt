No no see there's this bank I heard of in Deutschland that will do aaaanything for money, no matter how many times they get caught or fined for money laundering.
Cultural conditioning isn't necessarily brainwashing. I wear a suit and tie when I go to a wedding or a funeral, that's just as arbitrary as wearing a hijab.
Exact same principal with money/wealth/power. And considering they've done far more than drink our collective milkshake by this point - all while condescendingly suggesting to just add another notch on the belt - how fucking gaunt must we get before we start eating the rich? Rhetorical question, but suffice to say... very. Unfortunately, just as the self-proclaimed "Christian" nationalists have proven that the depths they're still willing to dig is bottomless, I don't think there is a limit to how much we as a society will put up with; at least, not with our current rate of comfort consumption (everything, not just food) & willful distractedness. Who knows, maybe Elon's revealing public tantrum on his new toy can ultimately have a positive impact on humanity, if it manages to be the straw that turned Twitter into Parler. Dude's already fucking sprinting towards this outcome, and it can't come soon enough.
-The definition of theocracy is literally a government ran by religious leaders/on religious principles.
Can anyone from Deutschland help me remember what this bank is called? It's right on the tip of my fingers...
The problem is that even when no one is being explicitly “forced” via actual physical force or laws more often than not women face extreme social and family pressure and become essentially persona non grata in most Islamic countries personally and professionally for taking off the Hijab.
