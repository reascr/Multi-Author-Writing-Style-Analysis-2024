Our advantage is our judiciary absolutely loathing far-right-wing vandalism. Hell, Alexandre de Moraes was the one who ejected the Governor, Lula had just suspended his authority over the state policy until day 31 and transfered it to himself, and wanted explanations. 2 soft 4 me.
The business plot was a relatively well organized top down conspiracy with real money and leadership behind it which failed because the plotters didn't realize that Smedley Butler, the renowned General they picked to lead the charge had recently been radicalized in the opposite direction after several meetings with homeless WWI veterans and ratted them out. This siege in Brazil is just a repeat of an attempt that already failed in the US. They even had their own version of the Q shaman. What's the Marx quote, 'history repeats, first as tragedy, then as farce.'.
After the governor sabotaged his own Police, president Lula declared a federal intervention on the Federal District's security force, which makes them answer directly to the Federal Government until the end of the month. After that, reinforcements were called and the terrorists were boxed in, both in Congress grounds and in their camp near the Army headquarter where they were begging for a military coup. Under the command of Lula, the police and military started dismantling the camps and detaining the rioters.
