The people are broken into submission and resigned to their fate. Many know they won't live long enough to collect their pension so they drink their lives away. Yet there are some who gladly want Putin to restore the Soviet Union as they desire a return to when their lives were a little better. There are also people who believe all the propaganda from the Kremlin.
There are people who have taken the pro-Putin propaganda to heart and really ran with it. They may be members of nationalistic groups online.
Getting back to those ultra nationalistic groups online. They are kind of like American QAnon believers in the sense that they've swallowed the Kremlin propaganda whole and are really nationalistic. Some of them will settle for nothing less than the total conquest and destruction of Ukraine and the Ukrainians. Some actually are baying for their blood.
Exactly. Navalny was poisoned, recovered, decided to return to Russia and now is suffering daily inhumane treatment in prison. What for? Wouldn't he be able to do much more good if he stayed free and abroad?
