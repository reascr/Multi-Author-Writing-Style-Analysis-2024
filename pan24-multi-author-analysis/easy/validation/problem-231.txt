The seven main sources of energy that are found in India. The sources are: 1. Coal 2. Mineral Oil 3. Natural Gas 4. Thermal Power 5. Firewood 6. Hydro Power 7. Nuclear Power.
7. Obviously developed countries would help by the way of financial assistance to poor and developing countries in their journey to renewables not just for the historical emissions but also beacause it goes a long way to help prevent a global catastrophe.
So, if developed countries are really serious about phasing out fossil fuels, why not all fossil fuels, why should developing countries be forced to spend money right now while developed countries can sit around using their gas powered plants for longer period of time.
If only coal is phased out, developing countries would need to construct gas/ petroleum based power plants till they have sufficient renewable infra to substitute, or go on massive infra spending on renewables right now.
In short, India wants phasing out of all kinds of fossil fuels simultaneously from both developing and developed countries.
