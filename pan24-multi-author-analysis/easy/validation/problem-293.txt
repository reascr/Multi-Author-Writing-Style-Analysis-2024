You mean cripple further. That economy has been ruined for the coming decades. But change has to come from within. There is only so much the west can do to get the people to actually take action against their billionaire oppressers. The amount of destruction Putin and his cronies have caused in the past years cannot be ignored any further. Syria, Chenchnya and now Ukraine. It has to stop.
Furthermore this whole "forcing the whole world to play along" can have terrible consequences since not only are other nations forced to cut economic ties with Russia thus loosing valuable money but it would also cause them to feel resentful against The West, seeing their actions as forcing and strong-arming them into doing what they say or lose economic goods from The West which on top of making their sovereignty feeling violated along with how hypocritical it is for NATO to call Russia a terrorist state of the invasion of Ukraine while refusing to do the same thing for US due to Iraq results in these countries feeling alienated by Western powers and making them see The West as no different from Russia which is NOT what Western leaders want.
