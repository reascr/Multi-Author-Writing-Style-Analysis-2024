That’s… not how this works? Until a new law specifically says that SCOTUS has a different number of seats, SCOTUS has 9 seats because this is the most recent law addressing it. Congress sets the size of every federal court through law, and it only changes if Congress passes a new law specifically changing the size of that court. Laws don’t lapse just because.
The bonus is, it's super easy to implement as all it requires is a simple majority to establish a new Apportionment Act and then our representative democracy might actually start representing the people again instead of primarily serving large corporate interest.
? House has no say. President appoints and Senate confirms. There's no law that the House would have to help overturn.

Hmmmmmmmmmm. Yeah you may be right. I can see the argument that the law has been repealed by the introduction of later acts which did not contain the hard limit on seats, but there's also a strong argument that this law continues to control.
