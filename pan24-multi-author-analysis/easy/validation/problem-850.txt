1200 random people, most with zero experience in climatology. My favorites are the IT consultant, the radiologist MD (I'm an ophthalmologist and it would be fucking hilarious if I ever ended up on a publication like this even though I majored in physical sciences), a lawyer with no science background, the microwave \[oven\] specialist, the professor of hematology who couldn't quite tough it out to become an actual hematologist, the software specialist, the former CFO of a bank (they don't sound financially driven at all...except that is what the F stands for), the CEO of Dutch supermarkets, and the multiple people (such as Dick Leppky, Retired businessman and Independent Truth Seeker) who didn't put their actual title because they are at least smart enough to know it would degrade and embarrass their pathetic efforts further.
This sounds stupid. I get that CO2 has natural benefits but if these scientists want to provide the greatest benefit to life itself then surely they should appreciate that 1) not putting excess CO2 into a system that has worked well without it would be ideal and 2) not every species survives every climate cycle, and the point of our intervention now is for us to be one of those that survive.
