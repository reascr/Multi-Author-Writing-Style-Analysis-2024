No need to include "for money" - "People that do this should be considered as traitors" is fine by me. Not only do these pilots get money, but they are likely provided lots of other comforts in order to get more info out of them. Honey traps are common tools.
There are cases where Australian-born citizens joined paramilitary units and other groups (ISIS, etc) that were considered hostile/engaged in hostile actions with Australia or their allies who ended up being tried for treason and/or other crimes; so best for any Aussie to be very picky about who they join, unless they want to risk being flagged as a traitor or member of a terrorist organisation.
Thank you for actually searching it up for me. Was discussing it with a workmate. And we both agree it's disgusting that the CCP is doing this. Answered my question perfectly.
We're seeing a (very, veeeeeery slow) cooling change in stance to China recently, after the impact from the wine export fiasco, attitudes towards treatment of minorities and other items; so... dunno - I hope that's showing the shape of things to come, as I'm not liking the lease agreements - not to mention all the farms being sold directly to them and now considered territory of China, apparently.
