For one thing, much of his base isn't going to think too hard about it, and will accept that he's trying to maintain their values, albeit in an extreme way. Most people aren't going to see the forest instead of the trees, because that requires critical thought, and if there's one party that actively fights against critical thinking, it's the republicans. They don't want us intelligent. They want us stupid and easy to lead. It's why they keep attacking education time after time.

They are the conservative party - the party in all governments that wants to maintain power among the elites and deny it to the common people. Democracy is literally anathema to a conservative ideology.
