The appropriate reply from Biden should be that "I went to where I was wanted and needed. When Democrats proposed regulations they were always turned down by the GOP. And in fact it was Trump who eliminated the regulations that would have prevented this disaster. The person you and your neighbors voted for. So I am doing what you have asked and not involving myself in the mess that you helped create for yourself. When you wish to discuss proper safety regulations and pressure your leaders to talk to us about reasonable measures we will be happy to sit down and talk. But I am just following your wishes right now in that it was your decision to support politicans like Trump and the Republican party who didn't think these type of regulations were appropriate.".
We’re debating people who still want to think pilgrims/settlers and indigenous Americans (Indians, for the culturally challenged) actually started the thanksgiving holiday. The capitalist propaganda is deeply rooted in the minds of Americans. I don’t know how to counteract that but it’s the clearest challenge to American exceptionalism I can think of.
