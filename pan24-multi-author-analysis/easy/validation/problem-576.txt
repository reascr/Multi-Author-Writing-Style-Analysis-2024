It’s more complicated than that, in my opinion anyway. Productivity has been mainly driven by capital investment in technology, so should the returns of that investment accrue to the employee or the person who invested in the capital? Technology also creates new type of jobs, typically higher skilled, which do pay much better. For example, before the steam shovel was invented you might have needed 100 laborers to do the work of one steam shovel operator. The laborers might have earned, for example $5/hr. But if you add up their total wages it’s $500/hr. So you invest in a steam shovel at $100,000 and now you pay one person $50/hr. Total pay went down, but that one high-skilled operator is earning 10x what the low skilled laborers earned. There are also now people employed in the production of steam shovels. It’s hard to quantify all this, but the point stands that the value of increased productivity should not all accrue to labor - some of it should, but how much? There is also value being provided to the employee that is not paid. Jobs become easier, safer, more interesting. Digging with a shovel all day is back-breaking work whether you are paid $5 or $50. So the benefits of capital investment to the employee can’t be fully captured with pay. There is no incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies if the benefits just end up getting paid out in wages.
