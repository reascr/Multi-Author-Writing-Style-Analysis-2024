We've literally had them for well over a decade now. Do you not understand this, it was such a success they've been able to run it for hours at a time as well even on the first test and was a potential choice of the ABL system(which went with a much more powerful chemical laser setup). The JHPSSL system was a wild success, feel free to look up all the wonderful papers that were birthed out of it. Obviously you'll find quite a few redactions and the actual.. applications of the tech in the actual devices fielded aren't available to the public. But anyone with any passing interest knows about it rofl.
It's basically already fully developed. They made sure to show it off to Biden when he visited. They want the Americans to be involved inorder to get business from them, and better their chances of selling it to European country's. It also means that American dollars goes to further r@d for the tech wich Israel is involved in. It's kind of like almost all American fighter jet pilot helmets are made by an Israeli company.
