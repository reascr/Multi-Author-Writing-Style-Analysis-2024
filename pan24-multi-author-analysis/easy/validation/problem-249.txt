8870 / 2700 = 3.285 seconds. This doesn’t account for the bullet losing velocity over time, wind or anything else that could change the velocity of the bullet. Kinda weird to think about.
I ordered a rifle at a hunting show in Reno in the mid 90s after watching the manufacturer's video of a shot taken at an Iraqi tank commander from a long distance, crumpling him, then several seconds later his crew throwing their mess kits in the air as they dove to the ground when the sound wave arrived.
Fair enough. Also, US was in Iraq illegally, but not Vietnam. Vietnam was technically still under French rule, and the French invited them. That said, I prefer it your way. Law is a silly thing, and the US had no business in Vietnam.
Semantics. “American” is a colloquial shorthand for a citizen of the USA, used worldwide. Therefore a distinction is made and I am North American, but not American.
I'm Canadian and live in North America, but I do not live in the United States of America and so am not American in the traditional sense.
