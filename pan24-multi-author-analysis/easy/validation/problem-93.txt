>Employees in sectors including transport, education and energy across France will take part in Thursday's strike, with major protest marches expected in Paris and other cities.
I don't think you get it man. They'll just get five. Or ten. They do not give a fuck. All that matters is they have power and they have the means to secure it, strike or not, if they so desire.
Edit: disregard! NPR has wildly mislead me. But, happy that at least this has been corrected by real Frenchman.
If they weren't to extend the retirement age, an elderly person will find themselves in one of two scenarios imo : 1) SS payments are too small to live off of, so the person rejoins the rat race at 77 2) the SS payment run out at a certain age like say 85 and then you're fucked becuase you're too old to get back in the workplace and now you're just a burden on your younger family members.
A utopia by my standards. Meanwhile, in the good ole USA, I'm chastised for not picking up the phone or answering emails over the weekend in a timely manner (not just answer, but answer them now), that I'm just not "putting in my all" or "caring about the company" or some baloney. It is so dumb.
The high income/corporate/other taxes is actually a major issue in france imo because companies looking to expand into europe simply don't consider France (generally speaking) due to the myriad of taxes that they would have to pay to for example hire an employee.
I've heard that line for decades. Literal decades. SS is fine and very much solvent if Congress stopped treating it like a slush fund they dip in to whenever they need some cash.
