Thereafter, the Russian "peace keeping" mission will have no peace to keep since the Armenians they were sent to protect will no longer exist. With no Armenians left in Nagorno-Karabakh they will merely be seen by the Azeri public as an occupying force. Then Aliyev will cry to the West that the Russians are occupying its internationally recognized territory. Russia might eventually leave with some sort of an economic/financial deal with Azerbaijan and just like that, the dictator in Azerbaijan will have what he always wanted. All of Karabakh.
Little to nothing about this is fearmongering, Azerbaijan has repeatedly, loudly, and clearly stated and acted with force on all of these aims recently, and the commenter is correct in assessing that the geopolitical landscape has shifted such that almost nothing seems to seriously stand in Azerbaijan's way short of the US. Armenians, all Armenians, are in very serious danger now and in the coming months to years.
Exactly. This entire issue/war is a direct result of Joseph Stalin. He's the person solely responsible for placing Nagorno-Karabakh into Soviet Azerbaijan despite the overwhelming majority of it being Armenian (not to mention the historical ties).
