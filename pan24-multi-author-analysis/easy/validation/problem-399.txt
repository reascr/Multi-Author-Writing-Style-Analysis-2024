Maybe if we can't bring a good administration to Haiti, then we should lead Haitians towards good administration. 11 MM inhabitants are nothing when compared to the total population of Western countries, it would only be necessary to distribute them in proportional amounts in different countries of the west and disband that country, I believe that this would be the most pragmatic and beneficial solution for the Haitian people.
You hit the nail right on the head. Once a country reaches a tipping point of perpetual corruption and lawlessness it's almost impossible to recover from it. You see this in Haiti, Somalia and Mexico.
Only historically. From around 1825-1950, Haiti was forced to make substantial debt repayments to France. Since then, most of Haiti's debt has been cancelled, and the rest refinanced, so that their total annual debt service payments are actually under $10m per year, while France alone sends Haiti $25m a year in aid, on top of exceptional aid for events like the earthquake.
