In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Not quite. The ones who don't listen to the base enough get primaried out by even more radical ones. It's not a one way street, it's like a positive feedback loop or something.

Ahh, interesting. And I assume that's why the universal healthcare crowd is always pushing to eliminate private healthcare completely? The system only works if everyone is in the same pot?
If voters kept the house for the Dems and elected a few more democratic senators in places like Ohio, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, we'd probably get not just permanent ACA subsidy expansions (which among other things cover the middle/upper class folks who have sudden very costly emergencies) but also a pseudo Medicaid expansion nationally via ACA subsidies (thus covering the poor in states that refused to expand Medicaid). As well as potentially a public option (lowering costs somewhat), more drug reforms (lowering costs somewhat), and increasing government medical residencies (lowering doctor pay somewhat via supply and demand but also increasing supply of doctors and helping various areas that have doctor shortages).
Yes I totally agree. There's more we can do to improve the ACA to make private insurance better and easier to afford, as well as qualifications for government programs.
