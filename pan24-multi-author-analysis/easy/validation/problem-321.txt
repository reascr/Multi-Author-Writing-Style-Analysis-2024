EU should change it laws widening it's sanctions on Russia since they have been already declared a terrorist state, there are not laws to deal with this problem but somebody should change the law and made some new laws to apply to a terrorist state. Like how it is possible a terrorist state as Russia can have its propagandist flying freely? I still don't understand it.
Romania has a deep hatred for anything russian, my grandmother told me that under russian occupation in the moldavian area they starved while the soldiers stole their food and my grandfather's sister was executed by a russian soldier by a nearby river where they washed the clothes cause she resisted the rape.
How? Take a look at the map. The Russians were trying to get to Odessa and then to Moldova from Kherson for months. Do you think they're going to retake Kherson and steamroll to Moldova?
So...modernized, western military. Access to NATO intelligence. Political will to push for EU and NATO membership. Work to restore borders after kicking out Russian bootlickers.
