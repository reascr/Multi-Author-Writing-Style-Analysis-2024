My name is Gilles Paris, and I'm a journalist who spent seven years in Washinon D.C. reporting on American politics as the White House correspondent for France's leading newspaper Le Monde. I had the task of explaining to French readers, who still consider themselves very rational, how the United States could have elected Donald Trump as president after Barack Obama. This was no mean feat, even with a White House accreditation, especially during the pandemic. I also took advantage of my seven years to travel to 47 states (still missing: Hawaii, Alaska, and Maine) and fall in love with the R.V. way of life!
Her years as a senator and her status as a former Secretary of State in addition she was highly educated as a lawyer and former partner in a firm even having made her start as an aide kn the Watergate investigation. She also was well familiar with Washinon political machine so she had congressional and cabinet level experience, I donâ€™t think anyone else running at the time could claim this.
