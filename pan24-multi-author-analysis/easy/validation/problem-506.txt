Are you an "ethnic Ukrainian" or an "ethnic Russian" if you come from both sides of the border - which is the case for many, many people in Russia and Ukraine?
We largely define ourselves by our nationality (with the exclusion of ethnic minorities like Crimean Tatars, Cossacks of Don or of Zaporozhye etc) and not our ethnicity. Given the shared history of our two countries, it's nearly impossible to even determine it. The poster above was most likely referring to the Russian-speaking people from the eastern parts of Ukraine (they were evacuated the most) who nevertheless define themselves as Ukrainians, so calling them "ethnically Russian" would be incorrect and even kinda crass tbh. It is also the basis of Putin's propaganda and the backlash of a Ukrainian one: Russian-speaking Ukrainians from the East (especially Donbass territory) are often marginalised and called "rusnya" (racist slur for Russians) by their Ukrainian-speaking compatriots, so it's just hurtful all around.
Probably a bit of both. I know I've read of many folks finding that the safest way to escape or avoid conflict have fled to Russia and many of them are then fleeing Russia to other countries. I think travel in and out and through Ukraine is a challenge due to obvious risks, but also restricted travel options (flying, trains, busses, etc).
Relatives. A lot of Ukrainians have relatives in Russia, seeing that we used to be one country at some point, and after the division the border control and immigration policy were very lax until about 2012-14. Think like Canada-US interconnectedness, it's about the same - used to be.
