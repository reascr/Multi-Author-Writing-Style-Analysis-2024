I volunteer for the rainbow railroad and have helped Qatari queers to get asylum here. There's a reason queer folk are desperate to get the hell out of that country. And most of the middle east, African (including christian Africa), Asia, eastern Europe and parts of South America for that matter. It's lethal to exist as a queer person in a lot of the world.
