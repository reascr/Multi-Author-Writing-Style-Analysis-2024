In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I agree. Distinguishing between ideology and application muddies the waters a little, as with any other political philosophy. But yeah, right wing anarchists and right wing libertarians should, at their logical conclusion allow for anyone to marry, and you could argue abolish the institution as a whole. I imagine a pure anarcho capitalist would probably support the dissolution of the state, and therefore marriage, but idk if any of them have genuinely thought that far ahead.
Anarcho capitalists are nut jobs but their philosophy would probably support same sex marriage. They’re essentially libertarians that are even more anarchist in nature, because as noted libertarians don’t actually believe in libertarianism, they are just disgraced tea partiers.
LG: Gay? I wish! If I were gay, there'd be no problem. No, what I have is a romantic abnormality, one so unbelievable that it must be hidden from the public at all costs.
