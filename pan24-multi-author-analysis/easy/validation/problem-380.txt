Sorry I thought is was pretty clear I was making a joke. I know some other Christian beliefs have saints. But it doesn't change that Jesus doesn't have time for your lost keys!
Other Christians don't even have saints, you think Jesus has time to help you find your keys? No their is a Saint for that!
"208 Human Sexuality: We affirm Godâ€™s biblical design for marriage and sexual behavior between one biological man and one biological woman, which has proven to be the foundation for all great nations in Western civilization. We oppose homosexual marriage, regardless of state of origin. We urge the Texas Legislature to pass religious liberty protections for individuals, businesses, and government officials who believe marriage is between one man and one woman. We oppose the granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for sexual behavior or identity, regardless of state of origin. We oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose nontraditional sexual behavior out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values.".
