One of the highlights of my senior year in high school (2000-2001) was reading Newsweek every week in my social studies class. 20+ years later I still remember their quality reporting on the 2000 presidential election. A damn shame what's happened to it.
The long and short of it is that Japan knew the war was lost but wanted better terms of surrender (they didnt like unconditional surrender at all), and were hoping to either get Russia as a neutral party to negotiate a deal between Japan and the US, or simply to stay out of the fight because they figured the brutal fight for the main islands would make the US rethink their goals and be willing to negotiate something less than unconditional surrender.
Yup. The only thing to take away here is that there are leaders on the ground that don't see a conventional way to defeat Ukraine. This man has zero say in what Russia will do.
Honestly... I'm not so sure it is at this point. I mean, I guess there's biological and chemical, but Russia has launched kinetic missiles with no warheads for lack of conventional missiles. They're in dire straits if they want to win the war.
