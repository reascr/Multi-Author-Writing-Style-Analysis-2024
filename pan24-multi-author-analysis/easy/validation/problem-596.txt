It's not even just practically unreliable. The chain of custody on that was corrupted so badly that it and everything to do with it is completely inadmissible for any court anywhere in the United States.
You'd have to appeal a ruling on that evidence all the way up there, somehow, and if they did rule this admissible it would destroy criminal prosecution rules in the US overnight. There would be no restrictions on valid and invalid evidence. Abolishing the idea of chain of custody is beyond insane.

The mainstream media articles that GQP-types claim "verified everything" (based on a post-Giuliani copy of the drive) actually point out that very little was verified, and many things were modified (and folders of photos added) after the date the laptop was allegedly dropped off, apparently by someone who didn't understand that computers record creation and modification times. IIRC the modification date was coincidentally a few days after Giuliani claimed to have gotten hold of the copy of the drive.
As I understand it, the FBI got the laptop fairly early on, but the shop owner saved a copy of the drive and passed it along to Giuliani.
