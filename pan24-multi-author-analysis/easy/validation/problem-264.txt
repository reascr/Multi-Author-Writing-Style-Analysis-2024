It won't open a Pandora's box because they can simply rule that the Republican uses of the precedent are constitutional and the democrat uses of the precedent are unconstitutional. You have way too much faith in the conservatives on the supreme court.
It's all connected as well, there's no denying it, culture, local and state laws, political ideology, socioeconomic status, upbringing, environmental influence, what type of information and media is being consumed, these things don't exist entirely independent of one another, and together they influence gun violence. Laws often change to reflect one of these variables, or are influenced by one of these variables and vice versa, it's all connected, the implication that the nature of gun laws have nothing to do with rates of gun violence ignores this very fundamental idea. Its not gun laws alone, but that also doesn't mean gun laws bear no impact on these things.
