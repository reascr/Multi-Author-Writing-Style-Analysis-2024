I honestly think they need Nato in this war at this point so they can lose AND save face - pretend that they denazified Ukraine, fought all of Nato to a stalemate, and were the bigger country in de-escalating from a nuclear war against the aggressive russophobic west. It will be a glorious victory.
If Russia used nuclear weapons in Ukraine (they won't, because it doesn't fit their strategic goals, but just to satisfy a 'what if'), there would be a large conventional response by a US led coalition (not NATO itself, but of 'willing partners') against all Russian assets not inside the borders of Russia and Russia would be sanctioned to the point that their only trade partners would be, maybe, China.
No matter what their called. I can't imagine how large of a brick the pilots shit when the F-35's rolled up. I doubt they knew they were there until they announced.
The F35 is the most technologically advanced jet ever made, a little bit more advanced in terms of electronics than the currently updated f22, much more advanced than the SU57 (the best Russian stealth plane, of which only 21 were ever built) and astronomically ahead of basically every other plane on earth.
