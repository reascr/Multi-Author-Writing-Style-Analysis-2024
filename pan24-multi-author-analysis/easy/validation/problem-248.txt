Russia's blustering has reached the point of absurdity. If I were advising strategy for the U.S. & Europe, I would contend that they are indeed a paper tiger, and to call their bluff. For every announcement that Russia makes threatening vague, but grave consequences for the support of a NATO country, (like releasing video of an icbm missle with multiple warheads being loaded into a silo), I would counter with a brief and consistment statement which states NATO will continue to provide any support they deem fit to assist Ukraine to regain their illegally annexed land. Period.
They won't even need the US. Greece has enough Exocet missiles to make every russian vessel, boat, canoo and jetski into a fish hotel. For the shit Greece gets its anti air umbrella is probably the most capable in Europe, and have a reserve system capable of amassing an army large enough to make everyone sweat within days. Russia scares no one militarily. Unless they want to rule of a world of rubble by nuking everyone they can't expedition into Europe any more than Tuvalu can into Australia.
