The Chinese might very well saber rattle and make a fair bit of noise if the US ever came to blows with North Korea. But I see no reason whatsoever why the Chinese would stick their neck out far enough to put it in striking distance of an American axe. North Korea isn’t nearly valuable enough to them for them to consider it worthwhile to piss off the world’s preeminent military superpower.
The U.S doesn’t want a war with North Korea because after its finished crushing their military like the insignificant relic it is. They would have a country sized mess they would be obliged to clean up.
Honestly... I don't understand why NK is allowed to "bully" those around them. If it comes down to "it", realistically NK would get mopped. Just saying.
Authoritarian governments MUST have enemies. This is just the most extreme example. They know they cannot win a land war with anyone, they would be starving a month in.
I love international politics. North Korea rattles the sabre and launches rocket after rocket Japan's way. Japan decides they need more security against their neighbor who keeps lobbing rockets their way, "How dare you be so aggressive!".
