Ultimately, America functions as a "Representative Democracy." We vote in officials who represent our ideas, concerns, and desires within the government. Even in the US, voters sometimes directly vote for laws in referendums. The representatives that the citizens elect make most choices for us because it is simply impractical to expect millions of people to meet at the local town square to discuss budgets, taxes, and construction. We elect the representative whose ideas match closest to our own to deal with these.
