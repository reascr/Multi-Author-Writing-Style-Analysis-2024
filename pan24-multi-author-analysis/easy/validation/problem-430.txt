But through a combination of luck, Russian miscalculations, Russian corruption, the sheer force of will of the Ukrainian people, and the massive balls hanging between Zelensky's legs, they were thwarted in the first first few days and the West had time to organise and more importantly, Ukraine still had a functioning government to which we could send supplies.
That sounds low to me. Everything you hear from the ones who survived and got captured is like, "There were 10 of us and I was the only survivor," or "There were 10 of us and only 2 of us survived." (They send them out in groups of 10 to be gunned down so they can figure out where the Ukrainians are. Must be fun being a Russian convict in Wagner.).
Participants in a war have zero credibility for accurate reporting. It's like listening to sports players as to the outcome of a play. They're going to say they scored and the other team was only playing dirty.
Wounded probably meant casualties. But yeah, Russia ain't doing so hot. Hopefully Ukrainians keep the resolve.
