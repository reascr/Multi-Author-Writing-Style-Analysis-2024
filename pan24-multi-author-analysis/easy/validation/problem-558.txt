For better or for worse I always admired that people from places like Texas, Georgia, and Utah always gloated about how awesome their states were and how much better they were than everywhere else (especially policy wise / people wise). Liberals would talk about how Salt Lake City and Austin and Atlanta are just as liberal as anywhere else and "you'd be surprised" and not talk about the negative affects of conservative policy at the state level while conservatives always gloated about how successful and great the states were because they weren't "ruined by democrats". Like Sandy from SpongeBob was the least proud Texan I've ever encountered and had the calmest reaction of anyone (liberal or conservative) from Texas to any outsider criticizing Texas.
Theoretically both are possible. You can get a lot done in two years when you have a majority in the entire state legislature.
