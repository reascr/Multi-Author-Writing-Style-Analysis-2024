Well, I think at the outset of the conflict there was a general perception that the US tends to sideline Europe in many situations. Instead of going in and the US doing whatever it wanted, disregarding European repercussions, Biden told Europe, effectively, that "this war is on your continent, we'll support you in whatever it is that you want to do though here's what we think should be done.".
Ofc I think Germany could have prepared more before the war and taken more action faster since in a more unified way, but 1) have to recognize the massive steps taken that would be unthinkable a year ago, 2) it does genuinely seem like the PiS party in Poland has a secondary goal, after supporting Ukraine, of making Germany look bad and specifically conducts diplomacy (from open statements to press to formal requests (or lack thereof)) in this manner.
Everyone was laughing. Because nobody thought that decades and decades of economic ties would be thrown into the dumpster by Putin. Ties that were designed to stop aggression. The same ties that made the EU work.
