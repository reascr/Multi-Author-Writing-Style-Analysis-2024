I don't really think the ballot drop off watchers are relevant to this particular batch of votes. For one, the ballots in question are all election day drop offs where people walk into an active polling station to drop their votes in a box. The "poll watchers" were monitoring drop boxes that were out in the community pre-election day. The votes being counted are also from red areas and any drop box monitoring I heard about was in blue parts of town. Most of the state votes by mail and has done for years, so any reported drop box watching activity was really only going to deter a small portion of the votes cast in the state. That's not to say that it's not problematic behavior, just that it's a vanishingly small amount of votes that would potentially be impacted based on how the state normally votes and the fact that they were only watching traditionally blue areas. In order to have a large effect on the outcome, the drop box watchers would essentially need to be scoping out every mailbox in Maricopa County which is just not practical.
