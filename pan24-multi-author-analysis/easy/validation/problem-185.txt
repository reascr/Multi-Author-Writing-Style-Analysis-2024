Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, shakes hands with commander of Russiaâ€™s military operation in Ukraine General Sergei Surovikin, awarded with order of Saint George of the Third Class, during visit to the headquarters of the Southern Military District, at an unknown location, Russia.
The issue with WMDs is MAD. Most people do not want to die. Most Russian politicians (including Putin) know that the moment they fire off a WMD the Kremlin will get levelled. We'll all get levelled. They want that just as little as you or I do.
Equally intolerable is Ukraine retaining control over the newly discovered oil and gas fields that can easily catapult them to the 2nd largest producer of either on the European continent right behind Russia, which means they could seriously undercut Russia's (and by extension Putin's) petrodollar profits, a fire threat given that Russian GDP is over 50% dependent on pil and especially gas exports.
