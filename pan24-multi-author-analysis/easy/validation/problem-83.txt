It was actually a strategy by the Russians in WWII. They had not sufficiently ramped up their military industrial complex prior to Hitler invading - so many "soldiers" in second waves of attacks were not sufficiently armed and were instructed to pick up the weapons of their fallen comrades.
Makes me wonder. I make beats and was in contact with a Russian guy almost daily about making music. We weren’t super close or anything but about two weeks before the war he stopped texting and just stopped posting music altogether. Thought he might have been taking a break, tried to contact him about the war and his thoughts (he seemed very liberal and against Putin). I just hope home boi ain’t in a ditch somewhere, he had some good tunes too…….
At the outbreak of the war jt was reported that Russia had told the majority of the troops they were only going to be participating in training exercises at the border, it wasn't until they were actually crossing into Ukraine that they were told they were actually going to war.
That easy, huh? For a conscripted teenager in a foreign land forced into a war to just call, trust both their home country and the country they are invading, to safely leave their old life and family behind.
