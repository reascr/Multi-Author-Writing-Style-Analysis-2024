No car crash deaths! Lots of deaths caused by blood loss and cranial trauma, however. Completely unrelated, I assure you. Safest roads in the world. Everyone says so.
For 3 years China was controlling covid to such an extreme that if one person tested positive, everyone they interacted with AND everyone the interacted people interacted with were unwilling forced into quarantines for 2 weeks where they were constantly tested. Some things got ridiculous, like Ikeas shutting down with everyone inside and Disneyland Shanghai being shut down with everyone inside. Entire hospitals got shut down for days just because of 1 case. It kept covid from hitting the general population, but also merely delayed the inevitable with no end goal. For a long time no one dared protest because it meant prison time in China, but after 3 years people got pissed and started protesting in multiple cities and finally the government backtracked. But they went from extreme dystopian measures to suddenly none at all with no middle ground, so covid hit a vulnerable population all at once and no one had the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines because the Chinese government forbade it out of arrogance that their own COVID vaccine, Sinovac, is better (it isn't) so China is being hit with the first wave right now, all at once with no restrictions. At least it's omicron and not the earlier variants.
