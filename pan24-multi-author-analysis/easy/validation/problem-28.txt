Their condemnation of Trump sitting down with infamous dinner guests is testing the waters. They are looking for real life indications that their party’s midterm election losses really do signal Trump fatigue. So far so good.
> The Justice Department’s success in removing Trump’s legal obstacles to its investigations may also be moving the country toward the resolution of one of the most fateful questions haunting any modern political campaign: Will an ex-president who is running for the White House again, and has a history of inciting violence to further his anti-democratic ends, face criminal charges?
Yes, I am aware of those. I don’t think state level cases especially the NY case have the potential to turn loyalties away from Trump and towards DeSantis. I think the NY case worst case scenario for him is its potential to negatively impact Trump’s businesses. I think criminal charges and a trial will result from the Georgia investigation but trumpanistas have already effectively cast that as an individual’s vendetta against Trump and his loyalists, just as they did with the members of the Jan 6 committee.
