Even some of the moderate Rs that I talk to justify the gerrymander. They're like "Well, Dems collapsed in the rural areas and stopped competing there, so it's kind of their fault too." And the worst part is -- there's some truth to it. We won like 60 of 72 counties in Wisconsin in the 2008 election (obviously a high water mark) but Democrats regularly used to win most of the counties in the western half of the state up until 2010, and we had strong rural grassroots operations led by congressmen like Dave Obey and Ron Kind.
