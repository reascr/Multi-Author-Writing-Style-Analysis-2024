They are, but the good news is that each day more and more of the old, uber-conservative Arizonans continue dying, and more and more of the younger, less conservative Arizonans reach voting age. I haven't seen figures, but anecdotally I've heard a lot of conservative Californians have been moving to Arizona, Nevada, Texas and Utah, and while not "progressive" by any means, "California Conservatives" tend to be a lot more moderate than conservatives elsewhere.
132 is bullshit. No Ballot measures with a tax increase to pay thing like schools, fire departments, libraries and police to name a few will ever get passed again. While single issue sounds nice it’s going to complicate things more than fix them. The writers of the bills got what they wanted. Minority rule.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
That’s California. Here in Arizona a ballot measure to increase taxes by .1% to fund rural fire districts failed to pass. If rural fire districts can’t get help no one stands a chance.
