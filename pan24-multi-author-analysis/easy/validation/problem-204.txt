Ukraine has reason to let it live for now. Let it live until they push into Crimea so the Russians have a way out. Sure it means the troops can be used to re-enforce Russian lines elsewhere but you generally dont want to leave an enemy no escape route unless your plan is to literally eliminate them.
Huh! That’s interesting. I’ll keep that in mind. I live in Alaska so we don’t have fleas but I’m finishing a project in Idaho and they are down here. I’m not wanting to import any back home. I’ve heard if you get them into your house they can take up residence. That’d be such a bummer. Ditto with picking up bed bugs while traveling. Thanks for the tip.
By not hitting Russia proper, Ukraine proves to the Russian population that they aren’t as barbaric as the Russian government makes them out to be, completely invalidating the majority of Russian propaganda. Making Russians doubt their government and their actions. They can keep Russian war support low, making the Russian people unwilling to cooperate with their government when it comes to the war and makes soldiers more unwilling to fight, meaning they’ll surrender to Ukrainian forces with less of a fight.
How? Ukraine lacks a navy and has very little air power. Russians have dug in deep in Crimea since 2014 and can be resupplied by rail, sea and air. I cannot imagine Ukraine taking back Crimea by military force, it simply lacks the capacity to do so. Ukraine may be able to take back all the rest of the Russian occupied areas, but Crimea would be a meat grinder for them and Russia will not give it up and will just commit it's entire military to keeping it if it has to. It will only be handed back to Ukraine under diplomatic means IMO.
