In France it was a different story, a massive number of reactors were built giving an efficiency of production, leading France to have some of the cheapest electricity in the world, and certainly in Europe. The cost per kWh of electricity in the UK is around $0.41 USD, and in Germany it's $0.53 USD. Compare this to France which is $0.21 USD - nearly half the cost of UK, and 2.5 times lower than Germany, thanks to Nuclear! Some "failure".
I agree with you that the Greens are currently the only party that behave properly in the Ukraine war, and that especially the SPD is a major disgrace in this conflict, but this does not negate that the Green use the anti-nuclear position as their foundation myth and because of that, are vehemtly against any new evidence that Nuclear might have become safer and more sustainable since the 1970s.
Thank you! Glad to see someone gets it. Germany decided to be so unfathomably stupid and there's usually a price to pay for stupidity. They're part of an alliance that aims to check Russia's aggression and yet they were paying billions every year to the country and the dictator they wanted protection against.
