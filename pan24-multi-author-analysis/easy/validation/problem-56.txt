Interesting. So I've heard from a lot of Redditors about why my approach can't work. What do yoy think will work? The internet has voted on outcomes before and given a face to those who would rather stay hidden.
hahahaha .. I can't help but chuckle because I literally used to work for the guy. He was a floor above the engineering department in South Bend. I can't grasp how he got to where he is today. It's mind boggling.
We Need accountability from the administration first before holding individual airlines accountable. This is mostly their fault for shitty airline labor negotiations in 2021 followed up by prolonged travel restrictions that were only recently lifted back in august resulted in a labor shortage. And with transportation industry Covid mandates and policies new pilots can’t get their required flight hours creating an even larger labor shortage. It’s not just southwest doing this to passengers spirit airlines and frontier airlines have been doing this shit since September 2021 and the Biden administration has done nothing with those airlines except let them go bankrupt. None of these passengers will get refunds or new flights unless they have travel insurance. Everyone is just shit out of luck. Fortunately I am able to have my credit card company do charge backs every time the airlines do this shit to me. so far ive been lucky and couple thousand dollars have been charged back for the airlines shitty service across the board. TLDR: I’m blaming the government for this. Fly American or delta if you don’t want this shit to happen to you.
