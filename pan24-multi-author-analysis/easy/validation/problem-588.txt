I simply think anyone who truly believes this world came out of randomness knowing how complex everything is deep down does not believe this but they don't want to be constricted/tied down and they love this world and their desires so much they willing to take science as their religion.
Islam has no issues with science, it doesn't disapprove evolution (aside from the whole species evolving into a different species aka apes into humans which still has not been proven and is a theory) or big bang it just says their is a creator behind those things not randomness.
Deeply sad. In the article it says one of the players got beaten by her mother many times for wanting to participate in athletics. Notably, her mother also tried to stop her from fleeing the country, and the player attempted to commit suicide. I hope one day the player will be able to play soccer again.
Of course the alternative to any religion is to believe the super complex universe, including the mountains, oceans, trees, sun and moon down to living things and the complex biological systems inside each human and animal is all random and came out of no where simply due to evolution.
