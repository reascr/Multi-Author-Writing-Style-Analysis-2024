So my understanding of it from what I can remember is that either house (House of Representatives or Senate) can propose bills, if it passes one, it goes to the other. It has to pass both, then it can go on to be either signed into law by the President, essentially a promise to execute/enforce the now law, or vetoed. If the President signs it then it goes on to the Supreme Court who in theory checks the law for Constitutionality. If they find that there’s something in there that goes outside the roles of the federal government then they send it back to the people who drafted the bill to be modified. If the President vetos something similar happens unless you can get a supermajority (iirc 67% or 2/3) in the Senate. Someone who’s had to examine the structure more recently than 5 years ago should fact check me on this but that’s how I remember it working. If I’m right this means the Senate is the house with the right to overrule a presidential veto. I don’t remember if the Senate can overrule a SC veto but I think not.
Riiiiiiight. The timing has nothing to do with the midterms shifting more blue than expected. It's not like they were hoping for their Red friends across the pond to win some elections and leave Ukraine to die right?
