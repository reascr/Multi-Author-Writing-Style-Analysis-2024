wait a minute, don't forget I was already President, the Greatest President We've Ever Had, and I know nothing about Anti Semites, I know nothing about Fuentes, Nick Fuentes, and they were brought by Ye, Kanye West, who I do know very well, and I have to say they did have Total Respect for me so why would I say anything bad, all I'm saying is I knew nothing about it, it had nothing to do with me, but you would never know that with how the Fake News is acting.
I've done more for Semites, more for our Country than anybody, but they don't wanna talk about that, and I've done probably more in terms of Administration and Being President that people can't even believe it, even the King Of The Fake News CNN had to say, "Trump is so Presidential," and I knew for a long long time that I could either be Movie Star or President, maybe both who knows, and we'll see what happens. I have The Look, I have the Star Power, and I'm also Incredibly Rich, and they wanted me to give it up, don't forget the Democrats said I couldn't be President and do Business at the same time, but I did both way way better than Obama ever could, even better than Reagan. Ronald Reagan, he used to be a Governor before he was President, not a lot of people know that.
