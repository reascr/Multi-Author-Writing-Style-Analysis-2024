In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Itâ€™s fine. Just go ahead and believe whatever propaganda the oligarchs shovel at you about this race.

And like a child who indiscriminately rejects anything that might challenge what they believe in or what argument they're trying to make, these conservatives blindly disregard and dismiss all information that threatens their worldview, their argument or narrative, while on the other hand, they gravitate towards and mindlessly embrace whatever information confirms their biases, their pre-conceived views and their prejudices.
RIP USA. There are no more elections in the US. The political machine now has direct control over the population. This is precedent that we be followed in other states. Mail in votes will never be removed (even though it was unconstitutional in PA). And elections will never be secured. We cannot even secure voter id laws. Don't get me wrong, I will be voting Trump, but watch the enormous fraud take place and everybody says, "this is fine."".
Every time, every god damn time we see right wing violence, it's turned into a conspiracy of some sort, or it's downplayed, whitewashed, like these people are fucking blameless, perfect, incapable of wrongdoing, which is an egregiously absurd notion, it also helps them lay the blame on others, and again, this is exactly how a child behaves/thinks.
What's more, whenever an act of political violence occurs, and it's some right wing nutjob behind it, or some mentally unstable person who has been radicalized by far right ideals, conspiracies and propaganda, it's almost always either a false flag, a cover up, or some deeper conspiracy. How convenient right? The party of personal responsibility can't seem to... Take responsibility.
