Oh the young! You have the numbers with millenials and Gen Z please use your numbers to take control from the failed boomers. I am a boomer hoping you flex your muscle and make your future into something better than my generation managed. The damage we are doing as we die off is just terrible.
As commented here by others, young voters largely support legislation including pro-choice and green/environmental issues, which essentially eliminates the Republican party from the discussion. Boomer and Gen X Republicans still clinging to the old ways don’t have the numbers or a even a viable agenda to carry them into the future. Flailing incompetents like Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan and batshit crazy MTG and Bohbert will finish off what’s left of the GOP.
