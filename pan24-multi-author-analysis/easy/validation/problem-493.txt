Makes sense. We are really good for exporting our armoured vehicles. Unfortunately, we have this terrible habit of selling them to the Saudi regime to be used to kill Yemeni.
2) defensible posistions. They have had 8 years of building up heavy fortifications in the strategically important Donbas. If you ever watch Russian footage of captured posistions every tree line is filled with trenches.
Exactly. Probably Romania, Poland, Baltics. It would make sense to build there and just ship them over the border. Russia cannot attack the factories as they are on NATO soil. Not sure about the Baltics, but Poland and Romania have large military factories from the Cold War. They could be upgraded and start producing equipment with a very short turnaround time.
Without oversimplifying things. Recycling is just reheating it back up to make the atoms movable again and removing the parts that you don't want.
metals can't be "polluted" Once you throw all of that scrap into a furnace, there are processes to separate/remove the undesirable parts out. There are no exceptions when it comes to metals. Plastics are a different story.
Your analysis of Russian equipment goes against western analysis which has Russia with a 6 to 1 artillery advantage Ukraine claimed to need 5x what it has received in order to gain artillery superiority over Russia and including all donations Ukraine has only a few hundred active tanks maybe 1500 tops counting captures and donations and not counting losses there has been at least 200 losses that have been recorded.
This is never a true. It is always cheaper to recycle metal vs getting it from the earth. Raw earth is a mix of all elements, not just iron. You have to mine it, transport it, separate it, and process it. Scrap metal has already gone through all of that. Melting it down will always be less resource and energy intensive.
