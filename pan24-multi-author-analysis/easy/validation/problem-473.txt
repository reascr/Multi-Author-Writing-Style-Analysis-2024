IT's like the people still defending Alex Jones. The man even said he now "believes" Sandyhook was not faked. Yet, screams: "Please give me money they are going to make me live on the streets because I loved to take other people's money and enjoy their misery." Those people just can't get the point that a crazy person killed children. Because you know, it hasn't happened before or the fact that you know, people are killed for the most petty things imaginable. So, they believe in a con man when they have NO connection with the shooting or family members there. Hell, Andrew Pollack who wrote "Why Meadow Died" which is actually a pretty good book. Still blames Obama and democrats for his daughter's death. Yet goes on Fox and other TV saying how the GOP is useless and Trump lied to him and so did Betty DeVos about fixing the system. Especially after Uvalade. But in his mind: "If they would have just stopped that program my daughter still be alive." Yet, he told Jones that he was "full of shit". Did he go after him or strike up to counter speech him? Nah, he ended up supporting the same GOP that believed in Jone's lies and watched as other people were harrassed and even mentally beaten into submission that the shooting never happened, even if they were related to the children being killed.

Nobody is disbanding political parties. Just the Peopleâ€™s Party is temporarily taking control of the government and making them work for the People for a change. Purging the criminals.
