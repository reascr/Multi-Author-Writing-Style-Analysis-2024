Weed saved my life. I think a lot of people fuck about with it, but it isn’t like that hurts anyone. Make it illegal to drive high. Fire my ass if I’m at work high. But for Christ’s sake (who made weed for us if you’re Christian and believe God mad everything) let me smoke my goddamn weed on my own time. Mary’s cbd:thc patches are easily the best non-opioid pain relief I’ve had the pleasure of trying. Smoking before bed is one of the few ways, absent sleeping pills that make me walk, that let me have a solid quiet night of sleep without crazy dreams and sleep paralysis. Weed and therapy has saved me physically and mentally. Fuck D.A.R.E for trying to tell me this was an evil drug. Fuck anybody for trying to tell me this shit was immoral or unchristian or irresponsible. I’ve watched people fuck their lives up because of prescriptions. Weed has plenty of shit to educate people about, but it’s a far cry from dangerous.
