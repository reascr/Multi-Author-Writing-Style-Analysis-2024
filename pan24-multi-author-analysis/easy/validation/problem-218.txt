"You would think that working in human services, social services, that the first person you think about is the recipient but that was not the case throughout the Coalition government.".
To finish, it seems appropriate to reflect on the topic of this particular article; despite knowing that there were credible reports stating that issuing these bullshit notices to vulnerable people was harming them, not to mention illegal, she herself formulated the media crisis strategy, which involved publishing broadly the names and details of people who disputed the notices in the media to deter anyone else from coming forward.
Thanks. It still just blows my mind that even governmental records weren't considered good enough in terms of proof. I realise it was a federal policy and I worked for the state government, but if even governmental records weren't considered good enough what chance did most people have of being able to gather sufficient proof. I realise it's just more bad faith on top of bad faith, but it was absolutely set up so that people had no chance.
