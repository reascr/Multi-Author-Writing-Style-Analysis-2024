First - both the EU and NATO immediately became the targets to reach for us. We started working on those goals as soon as we got the politics, money, etc somewhat sorted out.
Furthermore. In hindsight a lot of things we were taught in Swedish schools during the 70's and 80'd seems so wrong. And all the spies and informers, mostly with contacts in GDR, that were present everywhere in Sweden, sometimes in high places, is really scary to think about. All info about them have been made top secret in Sweden for many, many years to come. They are old now, but still walk free among us.
Finnish politics towards Estonia has sometimes been so-so in the past (unfortunately, our diverging histories and different experience with USSR has coloured our views differently until recently - IMHO Finns were too naive towards Russia, even though outside of Eastern European countries that suffered under soviet influence and occupation, Finland is probably one country that mostly had little to no dreams about Russia) and that has caused issues between the two countries, but it cannot be denied that Finnish civil society and Finnish estophiles were of a huge help during occupation period and later in the 90s. Finnish cultural society organisations were used to help Estonia pre-restoration of independence, for example (Tuglas-seura is what comes to my mind).
He he yah! Was more thinking about the political manipulation and such than invasion. Finland has proven it self one of absolute hardest people to invade per citizens (some 7mil tops) for sure.
Four - Russia was in shambles; politically, economically, societally. It didn’t have the power to influence our countries AS much as it wanted, it was busy combusting internally. As Russia was undergoing alllll kinds of issues, we worked on getting our diplomatic ties back up and running, our economy routed towards Europe, our tourism open and welcoming etc. The Baltics worked their asses off to get into the association agreement phase of joining the EU and we tried to open and close the chapters ASAP. Same with NATO. We didn’t have any internal wars like in the caucasus, we fought with corruption, but it was never as bad as in places like Ukraine. The Baltics had always been the “west of the east” in USSR, so we were already better off in many ways when USSR broke up.
D) Ukrainian society was not that anti-USSR than the society in the Baltics were. Yes, they didn’t want the USSR when it ended, but I don’t think there existed the type of hatred towards USSR that existed here. That strong dislike fueled the Baltic states to do very painful things in order to cut the connections to Russia at a faster and a steeper rate;.
