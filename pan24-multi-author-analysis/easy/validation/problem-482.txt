My work(manufacturing) stopped testing for thc at pre employment and when out sick for more than a week but will if you cause someone to get hurt. Not sure if they test for thc via blood or urine now though since they have adopted a more lenient policy on thc since they allow people to have their medical card and use cannabis just not at or before work and do random blood draws and test for thc.
same! i work in a high-hazard industry and we’ve had a handful of openings for over a year. no one can manage to not smoke long enough to pass a urine test, despite the good wages and job stability. i’m pro not taking drugs before being in a highly dangerous environment so response times are great, but i’m also pro not drinking before being in a highly dangerous environment for the same reason. and apparently that’s not as big of a deal to many employers. instead, we’ll just be short-staffed, which isn’t safe either.
