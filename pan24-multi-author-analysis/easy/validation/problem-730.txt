So unless you're strapping up your boots rn and are ready to march over there this second with a rifle in hand; don't be bitching 'the US isn't doing enough'. I don't know what possibly more people (more specifically their citizens) could want at the moment unless they're suggesting outright WW3 which we should all be trying to avoid.
Exactly. It's the long game that matters. Putin signed legislation to protect ex-presidents from prosecution in Russia, but post-Putin Russian leadership can still send him and other war criminals to the Hague if that gets some sanctions lifted.
No. No one wants that. This is like the worst IRL Trolley Problem, but 100k+ people have already died. Putin is unpredictable though. No one knows what to do.
Isolate him politically and impoverish his main supporters. Bankrupt his country. Fund dissenters and revolutionaries in his regime. Fund and arm Russia's enemies. Cut Russia off from major world institutions. Help other countries to stop relying on Russian fossil fuels.
