Iâ€™m American-Turkish. You are exactly right. Religiousness in America and Turkey have similar spectrums. There are people who are largely secular. There are this who identify with a religion but follow the rules loosely or as they suit them. Then there are degrees of more extremism. The less educated and more rural parts of both countries tend to have more hardcore believers who also happen to be the most intolerant of others. In Turkey and in the US, religion has been used by politicians to strenhen their tribal support and political power. AK party in Turkey and Christian Evangelical Conservatives in US are absolutely cut from the same cloth. They both have very authoritarian and illiberal sensibilities.
