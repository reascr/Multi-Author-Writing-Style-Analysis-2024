It’s really textbook post-WWII armored doctrine, even Guderian and Rommel knew this stuff in France and North Africa. The armored unit is only the head of the snake but you need 360 degree protection including mechanized infantry and at least marginal air superiority, something considerably harder to do when your enemy has operational fighter wings, SAM defense systems and shiny new anti-armor/infantry drones that aren’t the size of a school bus.
Also the German demand was not honest. I am pretty sure that Scholz is primarily concerned that the US 2024 election will be won by Trump/Republicans. In his last term Trump openly discussed to Blackmail NATO Countries for the US Security commitment. With a possible returning of Trump it doesn’t make sense to send the best German Tanks to Ukraine, without the same baking by the US, because the republicans could easily blackmail Germany, when Germany send most of there tanks to Ukraine and following that is highly dependent on US security guarantees.
How is the reason bs. There are no logistics in place right now in Europe to service the abrams. The leopard is the most widely used tank in Europe right now. Also Germany didn’t do anything but show that the alliance members all have very different goals.
