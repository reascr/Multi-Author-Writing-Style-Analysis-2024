Remember the main thing about modern propaganda isn't patriotic songs or posters or nationalistic sentiments, it's not about convince you to change your mind directly. It's poisoning the well everywhere else and making you distrust your peers, government, and neighbors. Once the tipping point is reached and the natural problems of a country are amplified, it takes very little poking to keep it going. The vast majority of the trolling and propaganda is automated, and there's plenty of human supervised efforts as well. A dirt poor Russian country kid with a computer can bring his family out of poverty doing this shady business online. All Putin or any dictator needs is to be able to point at America and say "See, it's not so bad here, look at them." You don't free a country with landmines. You don't invade a country to liberate them. It really is that simple and blatant.
Interesting video. I had not heard Tom Snyder speak before. And thanks for your thoughts on r/conservative. There is only so many times you can try to fight the good fight until you realize it is pointless. Take care.
