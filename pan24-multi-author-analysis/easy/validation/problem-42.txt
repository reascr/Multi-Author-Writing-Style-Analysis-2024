In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. Black people and Hispanics tend to be incredibly conservative in their views of LGBT, and Republicans definitely have been successful with their messaging that “the left” is trying to groom their children with sexually explicit and pro-LGBT propaganda. Black and Hispanic voters are also more likely to face substantial difficulties due to inflation wiping out their already low-on-average buying power while the Democrats keep telling everyone that things are going swell/okay (the economy is doing fine, for those of us who are upper middle class or higher).
I hate The NY Times. They had an oil shill “test” a Tesla and of course he completely lied about his drive. Then they bought 538 and scolded Nate Silver for daring to defend his modeling…which turned out to be dead on in 2012.
