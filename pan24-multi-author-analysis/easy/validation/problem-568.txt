This sentiment seems to be shared a lot, this is just kinda simple minded though. Humans weren't meant to kill other humans like that. One of the things the nazis learned in the genocide department when it comes to the humans dishing it out, and why it's much more effective to use chemicals to execute mass amounts of people: killing someone takes a toll on anyone, it's easy to do when you think you could die, but when you have plenty of time to sit there and contemplate your options, and also the person you're killing, it's horribly detrimental to your mental state which you probably want to protect given they are your soldiers and heavily armed.
True. The only way seems to be the Iranians, seeing the only way out is to take down the evil regime, since they were gonna die anyway, takes up arms. The US would have interest in the rebellion weakening Iran, so maybe they'll sell the rebels weapons, but that's about it. The West simply will sleep like they always do when brown people get slaughtered.
