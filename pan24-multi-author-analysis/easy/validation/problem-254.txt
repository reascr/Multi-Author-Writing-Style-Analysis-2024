If Ashli's mom is angry, she should be directing that anger at the 2 male insurrectionist who broke the window of that door while screaming, threatening, and physically intimidating the police officers who were trying to guard it. Then, once the window was broken, instead of either of the 2 men who broke it trying to climb through it, they get nervous because they can see the secret service agents holding guns and yelling for them to stop--so they turn around and BOOST Ashli up and through the window. When she gets shot, they panic and run away. Funny how those men were so brave until it came to actually climb through the window that Secret Service guns were trained on while they yelled at the terrorist to stop or be shot.

Exactly. I'm not saying they deserve leniency or that, frankly, Ashli didn't get what she deserved. Just saying it's sad their reality is so far gone and that demagogue, fascist, wannabe strong men are willing to use them that way.
