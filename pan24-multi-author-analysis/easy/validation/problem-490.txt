I’ve worked in fast food and if you can’t add up the change (you’d be surprised how many teenagers can’t) you won’t get the job. It sucks that so many people are uneducated in this country but you don’t have to let them run a country just to avoid discrimination based on intelligence. Intelligence isn’t a protected class.
Do I know? Did you know that Trump had nuclear codes in his classified documents, ready to hold the world hostage? lmao.
