According to the latest market reports coatings make up 7.6% of the PFC market, of that 7.6% non-stick coatings (frying pans) represent 1.5% (source BCC Research).

I would introduce you to the countless other applications of PFCs and why PFCs are so hard to replace in those applications, but I think that would just waste both of our time.
