Russia will not likely have sane leadership until sanity is restored to Russian culture, and even if the years of reality-distorting propaganda was to stop immediately, it will take many years for society, and government, to be deprogrammed. Just look at Putin - the most powerful man in Russia, with access to the world's information via the internet - a resource, like many aging Russians, he does not use, and was therefore entirely oblivious to the reality of conditions in Ukraine, and genuinely believed they were waiting for Russia with open arms. He's now faced with reality, and like many Russians, has just doubled down. And still, he browses the web through little binders of printed off info his advisors give him.
So there was like 7 min video of incident in vk (russian social network), where soldier argue with officer and telling him people don’t want to die without neither proper equipment nor any proper training, closer to ending of video officer tries to physically escalate either by unexpectedly closing by or throwing a slap (don’t remember exactly) for what soldier just push him away, after this physical interactions stopped — so soldier was literally sentenced for “beating” which is just one push which did zero harm to officer (except his ego).
