IF china created a land mass and actually had a steady population on that landmass, it very much would in very real legal terms extedn their teritorial waters. there are also habited islands they claim ownership of that the philinines and other nations ALSO claim ownership of. IF no one else contested those claims.. be it through use of force, or trade/negotiation with the other countrys that claim ownership. then again there would be a very real argument for extending their teritorial waters.
Cultural similarity doesn't solely define historic friendships. Just ask Eastern Europe right now, or the Balkans. Americans finding it hard to order a pint or w/e doesn't change a lot.
literally. the farthest point in north west china from the south china sea. like literally the whole ass other side of the country is just as close to the china sea as guam is. saying guam has rihs tot he south china sea is liek saying florida has rights to the great lakes. cause florida is only 700 miles away fromt eh great lakes...
