He wanted to gut INE, the independent body that organizes elections and functions as the electoral tribunal and give those powers to his minister of the interior, basically making all elections government elections, not be carried out by an independent entity the majority of Mexicans trust. He lost this battle in Congress, but it was also his first major reversal in public as it united a huge segment of society and for the first time one of his big projects received almost universal rejection, that one really pissed him off. He just passed a bunch of secondary laws to try to limit the funding of INE that are basically going to be annulled, which is why he wanted Yasmín Esquivel as president of the Supreme Court as she’s his only real ally there, the other justices he’s appointed have all proven to be level headed and even handed. He hoped Esquivel would delay and influence others as president of the court, but that crapped out for him.
