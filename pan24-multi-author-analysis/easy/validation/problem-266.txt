In a lot of ways, he's pretty fucked. If he backs out of the war, he's as good as dead, if he escalates to nuclear weapons, he loses China and India and probably sees NATO intervene. And his forces seem to be losing or holding in conventional conflicts, but he has an extreme faction at home that won't tolerate that and wants escalation or someone who will escalate. He's basically spinning a bunch of plates and hoping nothing goes wrong.
KYIV, Ukraine — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hailed the annexation of Ukrainian territories as a major achievement and said his country’s nuclear weapons serve as a deterrent in the war the Kremlin calls a “special military operation.”.
Putin, who has repeatedly said that Russia was ready to use “all available means” to protect its territory, including the annexed areas of Ukraine, rejected Western criticism that those statements amounted to nuclear saber-rattling.
Asked by a member of the Human Rights Council to pledge that Russia would not be the first to use nuclear weapons, Putin demurred, saying Russia would not be able to use nuclear weapons at all if it agreed not to use them first and then came under a nuclear strike.
The Russian leader said reminders of his country’s nuclear arsenal were “not a factor provoking an escalation of conflicts, but a factor of deterrence.”.
“If it doesn’t use it first under any circumstances, it means that it won’t be the second to use it either, because the possibility of using it in case of a nuclear strike on our territory will be sharply limited,” Putin said.
