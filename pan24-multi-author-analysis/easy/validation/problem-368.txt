Israel and the US actually get a lot from each other. Israel is incredibly technologically advanced and has many startups that are commonly bought by large chip makers/tech companies. Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, Amazon, have all done that, among many more. Israel is a world leader in chip development, the current ARM revolution is really happening, because of Israeli companies. Same with computer security/chip level defenses, which Israel is ahead of most of the world. US buys exploits from them as well as they have strong computer security capabilities. US is better at making bombs then chips, so Israel gets that in return, which when they get US aid is spent into US companies, helping America. They trade a lot of intelligence and is a safe place for the American military to operate from when needed. Israel does not want anything to do with Palestine as much as Palestine launches rockets at them. Currently the status quo works better for them, which is unfortunate. Israel is not perfect, but is a relatively stable country in a hostile area.
