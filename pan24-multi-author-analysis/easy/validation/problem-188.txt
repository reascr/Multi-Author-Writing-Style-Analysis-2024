Two fucking years before tRumps defeat a Wapo columnist foresaw everything; tRump sewing doubt, pressure on states not to confirm, the declarations that the election was rigged, then constitutional shenanigans to keep Trump in power until everything was resolved, which by that time he would be firmly ensconced as a fascist. Luckily, Mike Pence for once, as well as a couple of Republican secretaries of State,ii had some balls, but it was close, very close. And all these new laws as well as the gerrymandering will keep a white (soon to be) minority in power much longer than they should be. The poor and lower middle classes unfortunately take the economic beatdown via reduced safety nets and rigged tax rates, and that won't change until you marry that to those same people effectively losing any voice they thought they had in elections. It is a recipe for a revolt.
