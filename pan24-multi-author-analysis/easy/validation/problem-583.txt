There's actually many different ways a tank can be better than another. Higher resistance to explosions, better armor, ability to intercept missiles, ability to fire faster (or with smaller missiles so you can get more inside), bigger space inside (so the people inside are more comfortable or you can put more people if needed), night vision and other gadgets, using fuel efficiently, etc.
Yeah, most likely. I'd say almost every party would be in favor of this except for UP and VOX and a few minor parties like Bildu and CUP. Although I'm not entirely sure about VOX's stance on Ukraine and in UP I feel like the Izquierda Unida/PCE side of it might be more open to sending the tanks. At least the people that are closest to Yolanda DÃ­az. But who knows.
Mind you, the other political "party" in the coalition is also a coalition itself, with one-half of the "party" (Izquierda Unida) supporting it (or at least keeping it quiet, mainly abstaining but with their leaders supporting it), while the other half (Podemos) openly opposing it.
And it's been like that for decades. They only throw shit at each other expecting people go with their side out of spite for the other.
