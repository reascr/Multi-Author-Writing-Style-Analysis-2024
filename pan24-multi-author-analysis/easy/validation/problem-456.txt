It’s all part of the same transit system including the subway, and people jump the fare gates and sneak onto the buses already. The transit police don’t enforce the fares.
Nope, they hurt consumers massively, raising prices at the end user point, particularly on any food that isnt specifically subsidized, by raising the opportunity cost of growing anything other than corn, wheat, soya, rice, cotton, sugar, or molasses. Not to mention agricultural tariffs. If we removed all agricultiral subsidies and tariffs, rhe average comsuler would see their grocery bill drop by about 7%. Plus, all these welfare sucking incompetant farmers who cant manage to actually competenin the free market would have to get real jons instead of sucking at the taxpayer teat.
Exactly. Everyone benefits from roads even if they don't travel on them, like trucks that deliver all the goods that people in urban centers consume. But public transit is very limited to benefiting just those in the city. So if they want to make it free then by all means create a city tax to pay for it. But don't put that on everyone else who will never see a benefit from it.
