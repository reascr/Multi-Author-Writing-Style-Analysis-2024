In the N. Carolina crash both bombs were found partially armed. In Spain two of the bombs detonated (conventional explosives) and spread plutonium around the area, basically a dirty bomb. Scary stuff.
When this popped up on BBC, in the context of Rishi Sunaks government getting a hammering I couldn't help but think if this is A) him trying to garner favour by taking headlines off Zahawi or B) if this is him trying to stay relevant for a leadership bid, same as his recent trip to Ukraine to beg Zelensky to endorse him, it's the only part of his PM legacy that positive and he's hammering it.
I doubt that would have happened. Soviet Russia lost wars against small and middle sized countries like Finland and Poland. And Russia really suffered from the German invasion. Without Lend and Lease and American resources, it would have been even worse for them. Russia has infinite Ressourcen, but its state is too corrupt to sustain long wars outside their territory. They can bully small bordering states, but that is all.
