I mean, they do upload their general plans for the years 2025, 2030 & 2050 on a regular basis & then have their associated groups act in a like fashion. For example, the Climate plan that SCOTUS nuked a few months ago is a direct copy of a plan created by the UNFCCC & CBD (a subset of the UNFCCC) - even though SCOTUS made a decision on the Obama introduced legislation, multiple state governments have implemented their own cookie-cutter versions like San Diego’s “Riding to 2050” plan & illinois’ ICAP program. None of these plans are original ideas created by American business or politicians but by an international organization that seeks to make gradual changes across the globe on the sub-national & national levels. All starts with ICLEI buying out local board members & there’s plenty of videos you can watch of citizens at city council meetings expressing discontent with proposed climate programs that generally lead to unwarranted taxation & hardly any true mitigation of climate disasters but the board members who’ve been bought inevitably pass the programs administered to them from outside the country.
I'm not sure about that. I remember when the debt hit 1 trillion around 1990 and there were predictions that Social Security and medicare would be backrupt by 2000 and the US in general would be bankrupt by that point. It never happened. I'm not saying our debt is irrelevant, but it is not a priority to eliminate it. It is impirtant to keep an adequate debt to gdp ratio though.
