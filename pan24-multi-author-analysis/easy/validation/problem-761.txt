The original goal of the event, which they still will try to achieve, is to attract Western tourists to their country en masse. They already have the Middle Eastern market. They have seemingly started to realize that the level of change needed to become an attractive tourist spot for Westerners will take decades. So now, they have pivoted to playing the upholders of Islamic values for brownie points. It takes being backed into a corner for a foreign minister to bring up the fact that Western nations buy oil and gas from them despite their human rights violations. Doesn't bode well for the big picture tourist attraction plan.
Fuuuuuuuuuck that. Where is Australia in all of this? They just let a foreign government sexually assault their citizens? And their only response is a lawsuit?
Really? You’ve never seen a Jesus obsessed instamom crying about how unfair it is rainbows don’t mean what God intended them to be? That heathens have ruined one of gods greatest gifts?
Exactly. All these people telling athletes and others to take a stand are sitting in the comfort of their presumably western homes and don't have to worry about disappearing in a Qatar prison.
