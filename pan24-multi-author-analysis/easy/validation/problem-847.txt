Meat for the grinder. Their current strategy seems to be simply to wear down Ukraine's will to fight. So they'll throw however many bodies they need at Ukraine to make advancing hard. No matter how poorly equipped, it's still not easy to just beat thousands of soldiers.
I see this as originally being Russia creating a frozen conflict zone to ensure Ukraine can not join NATO and is limited in its abilities to gain investment/resources while Russia tries to create the political conditions for another pro-Russian candidate to take power (historically in Ukraine candidates would alternate between pro-EU and pro-Russian). However, it became pretty apparent that Ukraine would no longer alternate like that and firmly had aims of joining the EU and aligning itself away from Russia.
There is of course strategic utility in capturing Ukraine, but I would caution against assuming that there is a fully rational explanation for Putin's actions. It would be absurd for any average, well-adjusted person to launch a massive invasion that has truly hurt their nation because of ideological beliefs, but Putin is not rational and his age/COVID have not helped. He is a former KGB agent, it is well known that these people are very conspiratorial and paranoid.
Industry? Try and get what you can as the whole region gets pummelled by Ukrainian artillery and you send all the workers in the region to die.
