Became friends with Kim Kardashian after her and Kanye went after her, quoted Katy Perry’s song that’s a diss track aimed at Taylor, married a Kushner after Taylor publicly came out about her political leanings, and most importantly, signed with Scooter Braun, who famously and completely fucked Taylor over.
Why would that matter? All that would change would be the name of the tyrant they try to prop up. The support so many of them showed for Trump even after he tried to send a bloodthirsty mob into Congress shows how utterly broken and despicable the Republican Party has become, and their longstanding habit of enacting anti-democratic voting policies wherever they get control shows that this isn't some isolated incident, it's the end goal.
That’s a great point. All these years standing there with my palms facing upwards saying, “this is crazy, right?” And then to see tens of millions cheering this madness on it’s all too easy to begin questioning reality. But yes, just total shitheads; exactly as it seemed.
