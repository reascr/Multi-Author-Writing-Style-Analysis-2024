He completely failed in my eyes as a UK citizen. I'm so pleased he helped you guys in Ukraine but here in the UK he was nothing but a lying cheat. I won't give him the time of day to be honest. He's an absolute conman.
To be fair many European nations danced a knifes edge with supporting Russia and hoping it would "come around", and I imagine it was in no small part due to the possibility of shifting energy dependence closer to home(without the ugliness of producing it actually at home).
Who even are you? Have you lived under a fuking rock for the past year or something? Boris is a criminal. No, get your head out your arse, he doesnâ€™t care for Ukraine but instead used it as a means to try to improve his PR amid a slurry of scandals that around over the course of over year.
Exactly. It is also worth pointing out that the British military have been helping to train the Ukrainian army way before Johnson was PM. British military trainers have been in Ukraine since 2014 I think, helping to build up the skills and weapon knowledge.
