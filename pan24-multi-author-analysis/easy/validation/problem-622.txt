No it wasn't, the Republicans could dump him today just like they could have then, but once they really do dump him (if they ever do) then the same price will have to be paid: they will have Trump and his base turn against them. You say that if they'd dumped Trump at his second impeachment hearing then they'd have won these midterms, but that discounts how bad the GOP messaging would have been these last two years with Trump raging and campaigning against them as opposed to campaigning for them. Imagine what the focus would have been without the GOP running interference on all the investigations into Trump these last two years (mainly because of how complicit so much of the GOP is for Trump's attempted coup).
Yes. I would actually really love to deal with them directly if they want to go there. I will stand with Dems and sane conservatives that I dont agree with like Liz Cheney to deal with them.
