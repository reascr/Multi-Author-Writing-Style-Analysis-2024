The Department of Human Services would administer the People’s Housing Assistance Fund Demonstration Program, which would provide 12 monthly $1,000 payments to individuals who met the following criteria: experiencing homelessness, at risk of homelessness, severely rent burdened, or earning at or below 60% of area median income.
Have you ever dealt with someone who’s addicted? I’d argue a very large majority of these folks will absolutely spend the $ on drugs or alcohol. What these people need is detox, treatment, rehab, and counseling. If they can prove they are clean then I’m all for helping them get back on their feet. But as soon as they start using again, yank the $. I bet 10% at best will use this money to actually try and improve their lives. Addiction is hell, I’d know because that was me. Cheers.
