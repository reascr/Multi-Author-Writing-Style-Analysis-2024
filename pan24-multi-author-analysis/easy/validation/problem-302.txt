Yeah Israel can continue destroying gravesites of Palestinians and taking their homes Expand the settlements, who knew that things could be so great if we just surrender and accept whatever my neighbor determines is peace. What a wonderful world!
Palestine started the hostilities. Israel was willing to reach an agreement at the camp David negotiations in the 90s, but gasser Arafat tanked the talks over a refusal from the Israeli side to grant the Armenian quarter of Jerusalem to the Palestinians despite the fact that the Armenians in said quarter have been clear that they wish to remain with Israel and not go to Palestine. Quite hypocritical for a movement supposedly all about self determination and such…but really, the main reason he tanked the talks is because he was too scared of the violent zealots in his own ranks who would have defamed him for caching to the Israelis for any agreement short of Israeli handing over ALL of Jerusalem (an impossibility), labeled him a traitor and apostate for making peace with Israel and advocated for him to be killed. The Palestinians have started over a half dozen wars with Israel and lost each one, but refuse to introspect as a society (as the Germans and Japanese did after ww2) and reflect on how their hateful, warmongering ways have brought them to ruin. They are the agents of their own misery; the cause of their own ruin. As such, they do not deserve sympathy. If they’d have accepted the offer of the initial Jewish immigrants (who came legally and peacefully) to live in harmony and work together to build a better future, they could have benefitted from the modern education and European legal institutions and educational institutions those immigrants brought with them. Instead, they looked down on their superiors as “dhimmi” and “kafir,” and preached jihad against people they viewed as religiously inferior. This hatred and prejudice, as well as misplaced belief in their own inherent superiority, has been the bane of their existence ever since. The Israelis have advanced exponentially, while the Palestinians have stagnated and even descended further into the depths of poverty and misery because of their hate and rage filled identity.
