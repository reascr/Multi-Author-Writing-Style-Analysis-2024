It really is crazy though to see how much warning Stalin received from his intelligence network, and others, though. .
soviet union did not have the money, public support or export capacity to sustain a prolonged conflict, so they resorted to a military doctrine of nukes first on all scenarios, which led to a US policy of total retaliation, which kept both countries relatively at bay.
Look. Fuck Stalin. He was a horrible leader and person. He genocided both the Ukrainians and Kazakhs and ethnically cleansed many more ethnic groups (plus purging every leftist group that didn't support him, the Bolchevicks included).
This. According to Kotkinâ€™s second volume on Stalin, Stalin tried very hard to make pacts with the Britain but Churchill was vehemently anti-communist. Fearing Japanese expansion in the East, Stalin felt it best to sign a non-aggression pact with Germany so that he could focus on the East (we now know the Japanese at the time did not have intentions of invading the USSR). It seems he knew a war would breakout in mainland Europe and the hope was that Germany, Britain, and France would destroy themselves in the conflict; which, would enable to socialist uprising in these countries.
Tl/Dr. The west by inaction proves itself so weak, that Russia lost the belief that the west has the balls for MAD.
