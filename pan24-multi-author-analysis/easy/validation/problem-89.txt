Per usual, deflecting from the statement. So easily predictable. And, darlin’, I could give a big pile of bull butter whether you take me seriously or not. I am assuming you are unable to embrace diversity or thoughts that deviate from your own. Expected. Rather, what matters is that we as a nation begin to call a spade, a spade and investigate across the board, across the aisle, and in our own aisle if necessary. And, I might add, when investigations are complete, let’s go back and review them rather than shoving them down the news cycle. Let’s bring back to media circus table the once big voices who were shown to be right and wrong. Nah boo, you don’t have to take me seriously because as a southern woman of color you feel my use of the word “darlin” doesn’t jive with your “fancy”vocabulary. But you will take me seriously as educated, politically aware researcher who just dropped the mic…youmadohyoubigmad.
Congratulations! You now can tell the difference between hideous weasels and good looking but not traditionally manly men.
