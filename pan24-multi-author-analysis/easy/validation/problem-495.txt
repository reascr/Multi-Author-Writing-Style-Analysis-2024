In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
2. Peace negotiations are an obvious ploy and it's weird that you can't at least acknowledge that perspective. Negotiations mean compromise, and compromise means giving something to Russia that they don't deserve because wars of aggression should never be rewarded, ever. This is very fundamental to my view of international relations. And I would argue that being rewarded for aggression is specifically what Putin wants out of this whole affair. Furthermore, the idea of "peace talks" suggests, falsely, that both parties have some level of fault in the cause of the conflict. They do not. This was a war of choice on Russia's part and Ukraine did nothing at all which would justify their complete invasion and destruction. Ukraine does not want to attack Russia, therefore any "peace talk" is a sham - end of story. This is 100% on Russia, and the only acceptable peace is that they accept to retreat from the war that they alone started unjustly.
