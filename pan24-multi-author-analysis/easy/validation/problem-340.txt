Swiss banks profited from the Jews gold, Switzerland made some hard decision, you can say even some wrong one (keep in mind that it's easy to judge after the facts, much harder when you must take those decisions with a war at your doors), but using cherry picked events and facts decontestualized to spread hate is really wrong, even more if done without actually knowing what you are talking about.
Just say anything. Nothing you just said was relevant to anything I said. You just threw a complete straw man to avoid admitting that if you want to deny humanitarian products you are a POS. Did you think attempting to marginalize me by being snarky and throwing out ridiculous sarcastic things like Illuminati was brilliant on your part? Weak, bro.
Like bringing up the holocaust in a post about drugs sales, while I brough up the US, and everyone else because, guess what, they sells drugs to Russians too (Switzerland follow exactly the same EU sanctions) and is hypocritical to decontestualize an article just to spread hate on one nation while closing the eyes to the others... You understand?
