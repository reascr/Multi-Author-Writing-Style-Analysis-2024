So you're saying that Russia is doing the very thing they've accused Ukraine of? I'm shocked. They've never done that before. (\Said in the most monotone, un-shocked voice possible.).
Ukraine was also accused of hiding american biolabs that created viruses, owning infected pigeons and mosquitos that were trained to infect specifically russians, using small nuclear arms, satanism, terrorism attempts (that one time when russian police arrested "terrorists" who were carrying such dangerous stuff as ukrainian flags and Sims 2 disc) and etc.
Agreed. My point has never been about whether it's good or bad to use them though, more that I don't find Russia's word reliable enough to believe it was Ukraine using them. That's not to say Ukraine didn't, just that when Russia claims something it is often the case that Russia is trying to blame someone else for their own actions.
Hahaha. I smell manure. Ukraine destroyed their butterfly mines. Russia refused to sign the agreement to dispose of them and kept them, while Ukraine disposed more than 500k. No doubt Russia is using them in this instance, as earlier in the war. Russians are so full of bs these days that no one will trust a thing these granny raping poops say for the next 20 years. In the meantime, I will be looking for Poutinâ€™s death notice on the front of the newspapers.
