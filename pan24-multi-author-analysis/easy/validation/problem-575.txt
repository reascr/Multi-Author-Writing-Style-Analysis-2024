I've gone through a similar thought process. Was on the highway behind a van I couldn't see past when its brake lights turned on. I thought he was just slowing down a bit so I braked a little bit, turned out there was a car completely stopped in front of him so he was braking HARD. As I was braking I realized "shit, I'm still approaching way too fast" and hit the brakes hard, ABS engaged but I was still going to hit the van. I remember weighing my option, "do I swerve left? No, not enough room. Can I swerve right?", checked the rearview mirror to see a car coming, but asessed he was going slow enough for me to make it without him hitting me (hopefully). Managed to dodge the van with mere centimeters to spare.
That's really interesting. I'm Australian, and we did Hitler, Nazism and the Holocaust throughout the entire year of Year 9 Social Studies class. We spent a really long time on exactly how Hitler came to power, a shorter time on what he did in the lead up to WWII and the failings of international diplomacy that enabled him, and then a long time on the Holocaust (which I knew nothing about beforehand and am still traumatised from that class).
