They'd all sell their tacky MAGA shit to start trapping and making beats to get rich like their new god hero merely because a top 10 Q-Anon influencer was having a slow week and falling behind on rent, so she made a suggestive video wildly misinterpreting a Dre lyric about getting his dick sucked "liberally" or something, then highlighting his conservative bonafides like being a CEO of a huge company he created, a legacy of homophobic lyrics, and credible accusations of violence against women in public. There would be so many bad Republican thug life videos and memes for a while, many of which would inexplicably and mistakenly use pics of Ice Cube. Conspiracies would abound that Snoop was Q, Death Row was a front for white hat conservative lunatics, and that Eazy-E was going to be reincarnated as JFK Junior.
