The tradeoffs just aren't worth it, especially now that missile and radar technology (and the ability to share that data) has come so far where modern jets have no problem engaging outside of visual range, making dogfights essentially obsolete.
They could and they did. Don't forget about the ballistic missile attack early in the war on the Ukrainian barracks. Russian ballistic missiles have good accuracy, they are just limited in the numbers. If they had the Intel on a AFU barracks, they'd hit it. Thankfully, they don't.
it is why the US invested millions in programs like the dragon lady or blackbird, and billions upon billions with spy sat + ground stations + an ASSLOAD of trained analytics that understands what the picture returned means (IE is it a command center with HVTs or troop sleeping quarters or just civs) for this capability.
Whoops, my bad. I was thinking about the Russian populaceâ€™s general view of Putin, so no /s needed. But yeah, for B_O_S up there, he needs it for himself.
