You do realize that there are legitimate arguments we are not practicing any kind of proper democracy in this state? Our representative democracy is not necessarily the same as a pure democracy and because of widespread gerrymandering and over/under representation across the country it’s arguable if we even have an accurate representative democracy. If it was all determined by popular vote, there’s proof things would be radically different. Then we have to address the insane money that influences campaigning and legislation as well as the literal corporate takeover of mainstream news that resembles blatant propaganda to influence the masses. Looking at the current state of affairs and arguing it shows democracy doesn’t work isn’t a fair analysis because this is arguably not a working democracy. I haven’t even addressed the extreme politicization of the Supreme Court. Voting matters but it’s not a simple system and there are different kinds of structures for democratic government. I agree the current state of affairs is untenable.
