We are the only country in the world that has the gun suicide rate as high as we do. We are the only country in the world that has the murder rate from guns as high as we do. We’re the only country in the world that has as many mass shootings as we do. We’re also the only country in the world that has as many guns with a lack of training and respect for those guns as we do. I say that to assuage the “well akshually the Israelis and Swiss..” comments because their populations have forced service in their militaries where the US has a voluntary military service. The problem here is both the easy access to guns as well as the lackadaisical approach to gun ownership we have. It’s a right granted to us but we don’t honor that right by treating it with respect.
Absolutely shameful pandering. We can do better things with our resources like try to get basic government functions such as healthcare, passport offices, and immigration to work. My country is falling apart at the seams and they are dickin’ around trying to take hunting equipment.
