This is correct. The government is the issuer of currency. They can create as much as they want to fund fiscal spending. The only limiting factor is that creating money causes dilution of value of the currency, leading to inflation. Therefore when the government creates money for fiscal spending, it must also destroy money by taxation. The refusal to tax the wealthy sufficiently to allow necessary fiscal spending without causing inflation is absolutely a decision made by the government, and not caused by any external factor as they would like you to believe. The cause of the crisis in the NHS is the simply the refusal to tax the rich adequately. Furthermore, the rich are able to escape tax entirely by using offshore tax havens, as Sunak does himself. The reluctance to tax the rich is hardly surprising when the Prime Minister is one of the richest people in the country, benefitting personally from loopholes in the system over which he presides. The conflict of interest is clear. He must be removed.
You could argue it the other way; if you transferred all their wealth to the wider population, there would be a huge spike in inflation as everyone is awash with cash and wants to buy lots regardless of the price, so prices go up and very soon everyone feels poor again as a new baseline has been established. This is why the government wants to avoid everyone getting a payrise now. It will simply mean a new normal and more inflation.
