Sure, but only from my own frustration as a voter and tax payer. There has been a lot of discretionary spending in this year alone that have real world price tags attached to them that the “just raise the debt ceiling” crowd seems to fail to account for. Forgive college loans you say then call everyone that asked how it gets paid for assholes for asking how it gets paid for. Blanket donate hundreds of billions of dollars to the military industrial complex so as to equip Ukraine. Again the mere suggestion that it’s not our war and we’re labeled as Nazi sympathizers. Then there is the 7000 page omnibus bill to the tune of trillions rammed through congress in 48 hours notably without republican input. Who here can read 7000 pages of legal documents in less than 48 hours? By all means don’t acknowledge any of that and just say “just raise the debt ceiling or you’re a piece of shit that wants to burn the whole country down”. All it’s doing is mortgaging our great great great great grandchildren’s futures. The money doesn’t just go nowhere. You don’t want the republicans to cut Medicaid and social security then stop making them have to consider it just so you can get your college paid for when you agreed to the financing. These are only three examples of course there are more than I can ever point out.
