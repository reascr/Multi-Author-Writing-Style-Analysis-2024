This is the single reason neither Lukashenko or Putin have pushed the button on a second front opened by Belarus yet, because they'd have to divert a ton of Russian forces to enforce Belarus' military participation and fight partisans behind the lines.
Southam leaves 5.6 million. 2.75 are women. Sooo, is he going to take 60% of the male population between 15 and 65 into the military?
His military force is only about 50,00, with some weird paramilitary of about 150,00. Scary, depending on their mood, no?.
So here's a thing, neither Russia nor Belarus nor Ukraine have entered full mobilization yet, but if Belarus and Russia do enter full mobilization, if they do mobilize millions of soldiers, we could potentially be looking at 10 to 1 or larger numerical advantage for Russia. I know that some EU countries (mine included) are making list of all Ukrainian men and boys who escaped Ukraine, in case of full mobilization. They are literally making list of boys age 16 and up for potential conscription.
Not necessarily. The Russian (and by extension, Belarusian) way of war has a different set of rules. They only have to give guns to the blocking troops. Prisoners are useful as meat shields and bio-mine detectors.
