Why wouldn't it be systemic? There's a culture put into system that breeds the kind of criminals Russia takes for soldiers. Ever seen hidden camera videos of Russian barracks? The dysfunction of Russian military (and most other state institutions) is endemic at this point. They beat, rape, loot and pillage because that's pretty much what they were allowed to do at home, under superficially more rules and an umbrella of legitimacy from higher ups (who trade in contraband and goods they can write off as part of corruption). There's also a reason not an insignificant percentage of Russian conscripts don't object prison sentences all that much when tried for desertion, for example -- prison and military "carreer" in Russia are a bit like choosing between sleeping in shit or vomit.

And we think Morgan Freeman is bad.
