In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Huh? Several federal departments are already located outside DC. Are you saying Virginia has direct control of the US military because they have the Pentagon, or Maryland controls the NIH because they have Bethesda?

Digitize everything. People should be able to pull up records without going through ridiculous forms and filings only to be rejected for no good reason. Every vote by a politician, every line of every draft of a bill, every word uttered on the debate floor, every outcome of a committee discussion, all of it there for anyone who would have it. (except in cases of national security and even then there's a timeframe for release). There should never be any voice vote or raising of hands where you can't tell exactly what your elected officials voted for. Total transparency in that regard.
