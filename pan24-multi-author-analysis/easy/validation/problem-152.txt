There are some votes the founders worried about would just become mob rule, not of the educated and civilized, but the misled, furious, and fooled. America was always meant to work together, the schisms of the two party system falls apart when one side is honestly imo just trying to do harm or being willingly undermined or compromised for other nation's gains. My two cents at least.
The US has spent last 80 years or so in mostly unjustified wars, and as soon as there is a "good" war where the lines between good and evil in a conflict is so clearly defined, where one party is the clear aggressor, bombs hospitals, civilians and infrastructure, rapes , pillages and tortures, commits forceful relocation (aka kidnapping) of entire populations and tries to erase an entire culture. These are warcrimes, and probably crimes against humanity as well, which should honestly disgust most people in the west. Especially the party that supposedly has 'good christian values', but instead they potentially want to abandon almost a century old doctrine of defending democracies and western values.
