>Russia said on Monday it was downgrading diplomatic relations with NATO member Estonia, accusing it of "total Russophobia," and Tallinn responded by telling Moscow's envoy to the Baltic nation to leave.
Oh boy. I'd like to say my country not forget the past and support Ukraine too. However I'm from Hungary and our bastard, liar and corrupt government help to the Russians and licks Putin's \ss and veto everything that aims to help Ukraine. The Russians killed thousands of Hungarian people and terrorized the country through the history and our officials seems to forgot that... I'm ashamed for this.. But you guys are awesome!
"Russophobia". Russia is an insane country. They lie, cheat, kill, steal, spy, manipulate and sow discord - yet others are just supposed to accept it and go on with their lives? Fuck that mafia state.
Large Russian speaking population yes, however most consider themselves Estonian with Russian cultural heritage, which is vastly different than considering themselves ex-patriated Russians.
It is also worth considering that a sizeable chunk of Russian speakers did not voluntarily immigrate during soviet occupation, but were voluntold or shipped here in an effort by the regime to saturate and phase out local culture and language.
