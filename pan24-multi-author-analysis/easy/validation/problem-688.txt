It’s too late now to undo Brexit unfortunately so a second vote wouldn’t matter, and applying for re-entry into the EU would mean unacceptable terms for the UK, so realistically it’s not going to happen. The UK has tariff free trade with the EU, which is better than almost any other country, and closer relationships are being formed as part of a trans Atlantic and pacific agreement with Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It will never come close to making up for the trade lost, but unfortunately when a country effectively votes to sanction itself, there’s not much you can do.
Precisely. The masses were manipulated into voting for a mystery box under the guise of sovereignty (and a touch of xenophobia) only for the manipulators to make a fortune and disappear into the obscurity whence they came.
Yes that was true. But your economy needs to produce that money somehow to be able to give to the farmers. Within the eu UK economy could do that. I am not so sure if that possible now.
They aren't clowns they are citizens who were subjected to sophisticated psychological manipulation.
