This is ridiculous. One of the main uses of civilian satellites is military applications. The DoD is the biggest customer of civilian satellite capacity in the world.
Exactly. Canâ€™t trust SpaceX to deliver a payload or retrieve a crew from the ISS without creating a hostage situation. Cut them off cold while Musk is in charge.
That is a scary possibility and a can of worms Starlink absolutely does not want to open, which is why they repeatedly emphasize that it is a civilian and humanitarian communications network. Nevermind the legal snafu weaponizing Starlink would cause in terms of export control, there is an escalatory issue here as a piece of technology that can be extremely dangerous if misused by bad actors.
The point is that Starlink doesn't want to be subject to that level of restriction to begin with; if the US government gets involved, it's already over, and suddenly Starlink is subject to regulatory review and sanctioning by every country in the world on the grounds that it's a dual purpose weapons platform. That's why it's against their TOS.
He has shown a single talent: knowing how to ensnare talented and competent engineers so that they can build wonderful things despite his constant and counterproductive interference and megalomania. I'm in IT. I saw his many comments on Twitter - he is an absolute fraud. It was never clearer than when I saw him speak his mind on my own field of expertise for a change. What an insufferable, incomprehensibly stupid, pretentious ass-clown. My God.
American companies can not export military use or dual use technologies without extensive regulation, ITAR being the most prominent. Phased array radars used to be common restricted on this basis, but things like rocket engines, GPS, inertial guidance packages, etc are all obviously things that can be used for military purposes. Stepping back this is seemingly obvious, the US doesn't want random companies exporting the technology to easily make strategic weapons without oversight. Boeing and Raytheon aren't just donating or selling arms to the UA, it is channeled through the government. Absent a contract, SpaceX and Starlink are not in a comparable position.
