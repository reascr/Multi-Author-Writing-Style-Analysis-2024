So yes they're not natives Close to 2000 years have past they have no claims, unless believe the people of Turkey should give all their land to the Greeks, in fact so should Ukraine Since parts of Ukraine were controlled by Greeks, so what are you going to say Ukraine so give their territory to Greece?
This is an insane take. Like claiming that Native Americans are not native to America anymore because they are outnumbered by European colonizers.
"Native Americans are not native to America anymore because they are outnumbered by European colonizers!".
Yes the Jewish diasporas never happened, and despite somehow being controlled by Christian Romans which heavily forced Christianity onto its people, it somehow had a majority Jewish population...
Yeah, except I’m not wrong. Maybe take a few minutes to learn the first thing about the history of antisemitism in Europe, and why the Holocaust was the straw that broke the camel’s back and made all the Jews realise that they’re not safe there, so they left.
I’ve seen this “stolen land” argument so many times and I ask the same thing every time; where do you think the Jews fleeing Europe because of the Holocaust should have gone?
