Weapons and supplies. It wouldn't make sense to send cash and have Ukraine buy weapons and supplies from other countries. We gotta keep the U.S. military industrial complex fat and happy.
Exactly. Unfortunately, greed makes a human blind to future consequences. Honestly, for Putin, this is just fun for him before he kicks the bucket soon. He already knows he's going be significant in history books whether good or bad.
Exactly. I read the other day that we are giving basically 2.5% of our budget to more or less break down one our biggest adversaries by means of another country. Sadly it came to this but we might as well help them in doing so since they are a peaceful nation and going to war would be catastrophic for the US.
Absolutely. I agree. All I'm saying, we need more balanced spending budgets. Military needs war to profit. I don't think it's all for good reasons most of the time.
Not for the right reasons though. We need to lower costs for healthcare by giving people easier access on checkups and preventative care. However, the cost of healthcare premiums are barely manageable to middle class earner and do not provide much coverage. Most of that money is to pharmaceutical drugs and overpriced hospitals, not actually caring for the patient...
There is more incentive for doctors and pharmaceutical companies to keep Americans sick. Just like military benefits off of fuck-up conflicts. Afghanistan is a perfect example. Just because we spend money trillions of dollars doesn't mean it gives better results. It's how we use it. We just have a corrupt government that exploits vulnerable humans.
