I don’t see how they get to 60 votes to pull that off in the Senate. Though it’s not outside the realm of possibility that they blow up the filibuster if they get a simple majority and try to push through but they’d have to get both houses of Congress and the Presidency because they definitely won’t get a veto proof majority. We’re more likely looking at government spinning its wheels as one chamber or another or the Presidency saves us. Unless they fully take over the federal government in which case we are fucked in so many ways if they remove the filibuster and we can add the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to the mountain of legislation they will pass to take us back to the 19th century.
Yep. It's why they're fighting so hard to rollback state's voting rights. And then when people/organizations sue, what's this? It's all the conservative, shill judges they've installed in federal courts and on SCOTUS. They're only going to bend and break the rules more and more as time goes on in order to try to remain relevant and in power.
