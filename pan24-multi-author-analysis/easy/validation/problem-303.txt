Honestly I don't even think it requires being socially conservative. Having lived here all my life I think most Kansans, even the ultra conservative ones, really just want to be left the hell alone to live their lives. Sure they may not like "the gays", but even a good chunk of my religious conservative friends and family wouldn't support going back to gay marriage being banned again. They just don't want to be forced to be put in a situation where they're personally expected to act as if they condone it or support it (because while they morally object, they also believe it's not their business). It's a fine line, but I think it's walkable. State Dems here already focus more on individual liberty rather than specific social issues. The abortion vote is a great indicator for how Kansans feel generally - my decisions are mine and the government needs to stay out of it. And for the love of all that is holy the KS dems have to just leave the gun issue alone. Any politician even hinting that they support any kind of gun regulation in the state or nationally is dead in the water. (TX has the same issue and Beto sunk his own campaign.).
