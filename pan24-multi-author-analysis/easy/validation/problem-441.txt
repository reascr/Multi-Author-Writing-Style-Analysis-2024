You are correct. I confused this for the concept of "settler colonial studies" which I looked up between our exchanges. I made a mistake.
So did the Mongols, Celts, Alemanni, Suebi, Slavs, Assyrians, Medians, Turks, Arabs, Magyars and countless other Eurasian peoples that never operated in a feudal system until they adopted it from the realms of the former Roman Empire.
What do you base this of? In Australia (where I live) I mainly see more indigenous people using that term, so I'd assume something similar in Canada.
As far as I know, settler colonialism is a perfectly valid term to describe a country like Canada but also the USA and Australia. The country was colonised and flooded with immigrants who now make up the majority population and control most institutions, with those institutions being modeled on European thinking and not indigenous thinking.
What does that mean? What is an “indigenous” thought? Canadians born in Canada today are now native Canadians. Which specific institutions are “European” thought?
I don't agree with this. For one thing, I don't think indigenous people are uniquely perfect. But indigenous people in the Americas built cities and towns and had agriculture. Although I was incorrect to paint a broad brush that all of them followed socialism when I was mainly thinking of the Haudenosaunee.
