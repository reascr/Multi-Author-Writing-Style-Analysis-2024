Big time. Two of our largest industries are Defense and Energy. All of Europe is now buying American gas instead of Russian, and we are selling weapons like hot cakes, not just to Ukraine, but to many panicked nations in neighboring regions. And that’s just the financial side. Our sphere of influence, our soft power, and our ability to project it has grow exponentially in the region as well. Not to mention Ukraine is slowly whittling away at one of our primary adversaries for pennies on the dollar compared to a direct American involvement in the war. This has been a great win after 4 years of Trump ruining relationships with our allies. A great win for democracy. A great win for NATO as a collective. I’d like to believe that by setting this interventionist precedent, we have also deterred other rivals from their nefarious pursuits cough China and Taiwan cough. With luck, Putin dies, we see pro Western regime change, and can begin discussing on the nuclear disarmament of Russia as a condition to be reintegrated into the global economy. Hats off to the Biden Administration on this one for a job well done.
Really? Russia has been in Ukraine almost a year, and victory is still uncertain. Throw 15-20 more countries at them and I don’t see Russia having a chance.(assuming they don’t go nuclear).
