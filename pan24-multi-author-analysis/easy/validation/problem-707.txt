I find it impressive that someone could score that high. I recently went through the WAIS-IV. It really puts your mind through the gauntlet. I think they measure cognitive intelligence pretty well. Obviously, there's social intelligence and other types of intelligence that are just as important. Idk though. When people think of smart people they're usually not paying attention to how that person would react with another. There's really only one section of the test that I feel could be influenced by outside factors like education, etc.
Exactly. I know an absolute idiot that is the best fps gamer I have ever met in person. I mean he is incredibly stupid and can't remember basic things he reads. I would say he has a 8th grade reading level in college. His aim wasn't godlike or anything. He outsmarted me every play. It was wild watching him think ahead, and he had a feel for all of the spawn times and locations. It was crazy. He'd let you kill him just to respawn closer to a better weapon that was about to spawn and then roll you 3 or 4 times.
