There is some truth to this for anyone reading. Banks ignored small accounts due to the influx of people applying for PPP (both rounds, but specifically the first). You had to manipulate the system to get in the first round of PPP, so the loans (can we stop calling them that? I'm calling them free money from now on) were overwhelmingly given to those with better connections, higher status at the bank, and overall larger accounts. Some of them were even refusing to process applications for accounts already at their bank (except the largest) and were using the ability to get processed as an incentive to go after new customers. So, they were treating it like cell phone carriers - you switch to our bank, you get processed (if your account was large enough), but if you already were at our bank, you get nothing - unless you have a very, very large account and can actually get someone important enough on the phone.
Everything reopens. You were thinking of focusing on your family more anyway, and your business name and space still has a saleable value...
