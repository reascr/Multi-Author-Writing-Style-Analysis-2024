In Biden's case (from the reports that we currently have), they found the documents, notified the proper agencies, and transferred them ASAP. In Trump's case, he lied about having them, refused to turn them over, and has repeatedly fought to have the government turn the classified documents back over to him calling them his property. That shows much more intent than "someone made a mistake, here are these documents back.".
325 Documents were recovered from Mar-a-logo after repeated requests for return from the National Archive. Trump's lawyers even signed official statements claiming Trump didn't have the documents.
Having documents isn't the crime Trump is accused of. Refusing to return documents and obstructing efforts to retrieve documents is the crime Trump is accused of.
Correct, it is the willful retention of the documents that makes Trump's actions criminal. The National Archive formally requested the documents back and Trump refused.
