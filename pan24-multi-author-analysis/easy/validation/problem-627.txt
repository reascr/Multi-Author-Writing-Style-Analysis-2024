What does that have to do with the claim that a change will allow "100 percent' of the talent to be utilized?... I'm not commenting on the factual points of his statement, I just can't get behind politicians padding their opinions with PR bullshit. If he uses it for such an unnecessary point what else is he spinning? This isn't just a 'him' problem, it's a problem across the political spectrum of the planet and some individuals abuse it more than others but it's always there because there are people who will defend it out of political tribal instinct. If people stopped accepting it we might get a better class of politicians and policies overall. Good luck with that though. People are suckers for flimflam promises across the board.
Technically he isn't wrong most of the jobs require mandatory English,india is the second largest speaking country currently behind US but only about 10 percent of Indians speak English maybe it may have gone up.my point is india really isn't able to utilise it's talent pool.nobody can utilise 100 percent of course but imagine not being ableto get job even with all the knowledge simply because of language moreover the notion that he mentioned hindi and Other regional language is the key here it means Tamil Telugu can get there jobs by learning in there own language.
