I guess? Except that the majority of biomass is plants, so it doesn’t seem so odd to separate out some things just to get a sense of scale. I mean, all statistics are really useless unless you’re trying to make some point about something. If you don’t care how much of x and y there is, a statistic is pointless. It’s really just sort of an eye opener - 96% of all mammalian “things” (by weight) on our planet are people and our food. It’s like saying 25% of all animal species on earth are types of beetles. Kind of cool but if you don’t care, then it’s a useless stat. I personally think it’s kinda crazy how successful beetles are but you might not.
