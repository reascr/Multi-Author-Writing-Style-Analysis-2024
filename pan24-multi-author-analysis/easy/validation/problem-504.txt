Exactly. China gains nothing from Russia gaining land in the West. They will 'help' Russia after they lose by buying mineral extraction rights in Siberia and the Far East (at a discount price, of course). China will set up company towns which they will have significant control over.
Interesting article. The elephant in the room though is whether Russia is willing to stop short of taking all the oblasts it has annexed.
Different government. The Chinese government that was around when the Japanese took over Manchuria is now the government based on Taiwan. The current government based in the mainland China owes it survival to Japan invading when it did and being able to largely do the bare minimum, while the government in charge took heavy casualties doing the majority of the fighting. After the war, the truce between the CCP, and the KMT that governed China at time ended, with the CCP driving the weakened KMT troops to Taiwan with the help of Soviet aid and weapons it took from Japanese stocks in Northeastern China. The CCP formed the current Chinese government telling Ukraine that it should give up land for peace. But you wouldn't know it from the World War 2 films produced in China. It would make you think it did the lion's share of the fighting with the Japanese.
