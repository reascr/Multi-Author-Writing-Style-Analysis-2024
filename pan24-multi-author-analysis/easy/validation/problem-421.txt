No, he didn’t. As a guy who despises Trump, I’ve been coming across articles for years about him “having a bad day” for various legal setbacks and none of it ever leads to prosecution. He’s been spamming the courts with noise for decades. He’s still the GOP’s front runner for 2024. He’s committed enough crimes out in the open for any other citizen to end up getting waterboarded in a CIA black site, including smuggling nuclear secrets and instigating an armed attempt to storm congress and overthrow the fucking government. He’s fairly obviously a Russian intelligence asset. His tax fraud is an open secret. Tons of his former associates have been convicted of crimes to which he was a party. And he hasn’t had a truly “bad day” yet through all of it, he’s holding rallies and playing golf.
