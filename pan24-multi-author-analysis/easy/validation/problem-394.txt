Some pledged to “decertify” the 2020 results, although election law experts said that is not possible. Others promised to decommission electronic voting machines, require hand-counting of ballots or block all mail voting. Their platforms were rooted in Trump’s disproven claims that the 2020 race was rigged, and their bids for public office raised grave concerns about whether the popular will could be subverted, and free and fair elections undermined, in 2024 and beyond.
Voters in the six major battlegrounds where Donald Trump tried to reverse his defeat in 2020 rejected election-denying candidates seeking to control their states’ election systems this year, a resounding signal that Americans have grown weary of the former president’s unfounded claims of widespread fraud.
Thank fricken gods! Election deniers are such a small minority of the people in our great country. Why are the rest of us being held hostage by the crazies. Time to get back to a more normal period in life. Dang, for the past 6 years, it felt like you couldn’t turn away or else the country would crumble. But it didn’t. Aren’t y’all happy to get back to some level of normalcy?
