> According to Daily Star, Maslov was criticized by both Putin and the Kremlin before his death for failing to produce enough tanks for Russian troops to use in Ukraine.
Absolutely. The only way I can make any sense of the Russian government and its actions is when I think of it as a criminal organisation of some sort. Its only goal is to enrich itself and expand its influence. And putin is the main [Thief in Law] (.
I still think the commanders themselves are competent (not genius by any means but competent) but years of Zerg rush working and fighting vastly less well armed opponents has given them false confidence about their abilities and putin taking personal command of strategy (pretty sure I read that earlier in the year) and ordering non-strategic or heavily armed cities to be taken along with the well known vast corruption in the logistics and procurement departments along with laughable supply lines has hampered any hope they did have for a victory.
