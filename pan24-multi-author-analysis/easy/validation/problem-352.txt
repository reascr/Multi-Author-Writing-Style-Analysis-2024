Edit: I used blanket because it matched up with "interwoven" and in my head I pictured a shit stained ball of yarn. I suppose you could use mittens or booties instead.
In 1542, the establishment of the Roman Catholic Inquisition effectively restrained secular courts under its influence from liberal application of torture and execution. The methodological Instructio, which served as an "appropriate" manual for witch hunting, cautioned against hasty convictions and careless executions of the accused. In contrast with other parts of Europe, trials by the Venetian Holy Office never saw conviction for the crime of malevolent witchcraft, or "maleficio". Because the notion of diabolical cults was not credible to either popular culture or Catholic inquisitorial theology, mass accusations and belief in Witches' Sabbath never took root in areas under such inquisitorial influence.
2. Western govt making statements only help the mullah regime's narrative that protests are a foreign conspiracy. If Iranians want to overthrow the mullahs, they'll have to do it on their own, like successful revolutions in other parts of the world. Foreign assisted revolutions lack legitimacy.
I like. The expression ”shit blanket”, I mean, not anything else you described. I’m using this from now on, along with ”shit mittens”. You have done the English language a service, my friend.
