True, it's officially peace time. But only for as long as Russia or China still see America as strong enough to deter them. Western Europe has been too complacent and Russia doesn't see Western European powers as more than a speed bump in terms of protecting NATO's eastern flank. If America were to take the same approach in failing to modernize and increase its military capability there would be both an invasion of Taiwan and an invasion of the Baltics in the next few years with more invasions to follow after that.
Bruh indeed. Nobody could come close to what the US had in the 80s-90s. Nowadays, China's tech (stolen, whatever, point is they have it) and production level is much closer than Russia, or any other adversary had back then. That's what it's about.
Is it really "peace time" when Russia has declared a holy war against the West threatening to attack Nato countries, China is building up to invade Taiwan and threatening the US with war in case US were to interfere, North Korea is doing missile tests it claims are simulations attacks against the US and Iranian regime is acquiring nuclear weapons while its leader is promising death to America?
With who? It's for sure not going to be Russia now. And China would HAVE to take over Taiwan before it could expand anywhere...and like good luck with that. That operation would make Russia losses in Ukraine look small.
