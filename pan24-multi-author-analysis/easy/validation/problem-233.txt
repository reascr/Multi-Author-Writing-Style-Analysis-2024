Just think about how Donald Trump won the presidency by just thousands of votes across multiple key states. Think about how huge a difference such a small margin made. There is no such thing as a disposable margin for Republicans if they want to remain relevant on the national scale going forward. Unity must be total. Donald Trump can make that impossible. There can be no unified social media message if anyone opposed to Trump controls any amount of the messaging. The GOP can't survive Donald Trump going rogue. It especially limits this brand new House majority's life expectancy. And if the Trump wing is small and unable to dominate, they will still set fires that will hurt other Republicans.
Exactly. Any democratic win is now fraud. Apparently, dems always cheat but theyâ€™re really bad at it. They cheated enough not to lose as badly as expected but not enough to maintain power in congress.
