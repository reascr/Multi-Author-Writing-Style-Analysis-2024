It's ok. There will just be yet another instance of cops beating a black man to death, or holding a back man in a choke lock until he suffocates, or shooting a black man for seemingly no reason. Maybe some cop will really go out on a limb and shoot a black woman instead. And everyone will spout more platitudes about how awful it is, and how it can't be a allowed to happen again. And then it'll fade from the news a few weeks later, without any real policy change in the police department in question (let alone any legislation). The cops involved might be prosecuted, but maybe not, but they'll be out free for months or years before the trail concludes. And short of the most egregious activity possible being caught from a clear camera angle, they'll probably get off scot free.
