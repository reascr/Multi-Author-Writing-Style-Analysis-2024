A much, much better use of her would be as the new Chair of the DCCC. She’s the most successful fundraiser in the Dem caucus outside of Pelosi, she knows how to run a successful campaign without the benefit of a big war chest, she’s arguably the best the Dems have at using social media to communicate messaging nationally and engage with constituents, and there’s a still simmering split within the party over centrists fighting the left harder than they fight the right that can her appointment could be an excellent olive branch to smooth things over. Plus you want Leadership to be in safe districts whenever possible. Also there’s some serious discontent about how the previous DCCC Chair adopted a strategy of amplifying extremist Republicans in primaries because he thought they’d be easier to beat. It’s fucking reckless and a lot of them won the general. Expect some more noise to be made over that. With now 3 (possibly 4 of Clyburn follows Pelosi and Hoyer) leadership positions open I expect the Congressional Progressive Caucus to bargain for a few of their own to take up one or two spots down the line in order to not fuck too much with Jeffries running. Then again, they might have the votes to stop him all together, but I doubt it.
