We are at the beginning of finding out just how much long-term damage Trumpism is going to do to this country. Trump was successful in a couple of things. He was successful in exposing the fact that there are a lot more racists and bigots in this country than anybody was comfortable admitting to, even if they knew it privately. He was successful in coralling them into a voting bloc that reshaped the GOP and in many cases can no longer be ignored due to its sheer size. He was successful in showing us that continuing to push the envelope as far to the right as possible, then pushing it further, is a viable pathway to victory in some areas. And he was successful in showing us that our government really doesn't have an answer when someone like Trump comes along and says "So What? What are you going to do about it?".
Trump also tried to dismantle the Federal executive, installed his family and friends at the highest levels of government, appointed extremist judges and justices, colluded against our Allie's with Russia, took money from foreign governments, raided the coffers for his family and cronies, etc. You don't think DeSantis can do more damage than that?
