I agree. I was pointing out the part with all unions where they protect union members that are grossly bad employees. Every union you mentioned have examples of members that are still employed after overwhelming evidence shows fire-able offenses while the case goes through the system for months or sometimes years all while still getting paid even though they're no longer performing their duties.
Well said. There's an active push for a new Constitutional Convention. Philosophically, I agree with Jefferson in that it should be rewritten at regular intervals to keep up with the times. And it's long overdue. But do I want that to happen in a corporate-driven, dark-money superPAC, Citizen's United environment? Do I want MTG or Rick Scott or the Koch organization involved in the process?
