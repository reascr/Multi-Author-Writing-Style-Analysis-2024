Yes anything can happen in a war I’m not of the belief that the frontline will stay static and where it is now. I think Ukraine liberates more land back over time. I personally have a hard time seeing them getting anywhere near Crimea though. Like I said, time will tell.
Just like everyone knew it wouldn’t happen, and then how the Russians would crush the Ukrainians, then how it was only a matter of time before the Russians won, and then how the Ukrainians could never regain their territory, and how the Russian massive offensive of hundreds of thousands of men and thousands of pieces of armor were going to make major advances…and now how the war is far from over and how impossible it will be for Ukrainian to regain Crimea.
Is this a sportsball metaphor? Who are the Lakers and who are the away team supposed to be? Is Kobe supposed to be representing Ukrainian tanks? Russian (conscripted and don't want to be there) reinforcements? So many questions.
who can forget those glorious russian moments, like when they didn't capture bakhmut, or that other time they didn't capture bahkmut, or when then threw literally thousands of unarmed prisoners into the meat grinder in a failed attempt to capture bakhmut, or when they took a picture of the sign outside of bakhmut and claimed they captured it but then it turned out they didnt. what a country.
