What the fuck...I served for 5 years. It makes feel physically ill that this guy is in Congress. Is it all a huge Psy op to make us lose faith in the system? Campaign finance ties to Russian oligarchy money. How is there no safe guard against this kind of thing? Isn't this defrauding the United States of America? How is this not a felony? I just want to be in a room with this guy. I'm not trying to vent some rage fantasy but this guy makes me angry in a way I'm not okay with. I want him gone.
Everyone here kids, but the fact the the GOP (perhaps the majority of Congress) considers The Small Business and the Space and Science Committees to be the least prestigious committees worthy of enough for a sociopathic and pathogically lying high school drop out to sit on as some sort of busy work, is pretty much a damning indictment of Congress and the GOP.
Makes sense. His PhD defense in small businessology was so compelling it won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. It also won four categories of Nobel Prize.
