The Sanskrit grammatical problem, also known as the Pāṇinian paradox, is a challenge posed by the ancient Indian grammarian Pāṇini in his Aṣṭādhyāyī, a highly technical treatise on Sanskrit grammar. The problem arises from the fact that Pāṇini's grammar is self-referential and recursive, meaning that it refers to itself and can be applied repeatedly. This leads to the question of how the grammar can be complete and consistent, given that it is defined using itself.
Absolutely. When I asked if it was OK to take a summer holiday, my advisor responded by saying that then I could gather less data, assuming my singular goal was to gather more data. She was quite unable to see the human for the human, instead of for a more simple machine.
Sanskrit is perfectly understandable and translateable. It wasn't that Panini wrote cryptically; he'd written what was essentially a linguistics textbook, but included a rule that was incompatible with all of the other rules of Sanskrit grammar. The student's work seems to have just shown that the rule isn't wrong, but rather that it had been misinterpreted, and that the proper interpretation makes it consistent, and thus usable as a shorthand.
