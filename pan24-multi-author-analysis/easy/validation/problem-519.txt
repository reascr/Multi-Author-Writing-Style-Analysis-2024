The most prominent one would be Bernie Sanders Medicare for All Bill. There are roughly 2 million regular middle class Americans working for the insurance companies that would be shuttered by Sanders bill and those workers are spread across all 50 states. On top of that, the annual cost of the program is roughly twice the total tax revenue that the government currently takes in. You don't make up that money by solely taxing the rich. Sanders entire list of suggestions for raising that additional revenue only added up to about half the total cost of the program and included a 5% income tax increase for all households. Vermont actually tried to implement a single payer system that was much less generous than Sanders plan and had to scrap it because they calculated that it would require an 11% increase for all households, which would strain the budgets pretty much any family with a mortgage. It was an idea to address a real problem, but designed in a way that would cause a lot of harm to a lot of people. But there are still plenty of people on the left who demand that specific solution to the very real problem of providing people with affordable healthcare.
