Why are you confident Trump would lose in the general election? He garnered the second most votes in history last time. With the Supreme Court's dismantling of the voting rights act, states like Georgia, that Biden won, could very easily wind up going for the Republican nominee just because of how many black would-be voters are unable to cast their ballots. And historically, the Presidential election has usually been a referendum on the state of the economy, if the economy is doing much below average or much above average; I certainly don't feel confident that the average American is going to think the economy is doing well in 21 months (heck, I'm not even sure if it's going to be debatable-- there is a non-trivial chance that the economy will be in a dark place by then).
Then get punched in the fucking face. There's no way around it if a bully's threatening to punch you unless he can corrupt your crew into doing his (and that's being used loosely here) bidding. You either punch the bully or say no, let the bully punch you and let the aftermath play out.
