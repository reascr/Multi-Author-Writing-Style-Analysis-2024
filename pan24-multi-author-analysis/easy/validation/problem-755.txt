I am really curious to know why he was arrested by Russian border police after just going from Poland to Kaliningrad on a vacation and then held for the majority of a year there. What was his crime?
The whole region was depopulated of native Germans at the end of WW2, and only somewhat replaced with Russians (and other soviet nationalities) during the following decades. Itâ€™s still largely empty.
So the article that has business in getting clicks and manipulating the data to create more clicks is telling you one side of the story without telling you information about something critical to the article itself ? all most like its shifting the narrative to for some weird reason ?
The non-profit foundations (Richardson, Menzies, James Foley Foundation) simply took up the legal negotiations with the Russian judiciary/government on behalf of the family. They didn't "negotiate" his release like some are implying but rather just did the legal requires to get him released when Russia said his time was up. He committed a crime, did time, and was released after 9 months.
