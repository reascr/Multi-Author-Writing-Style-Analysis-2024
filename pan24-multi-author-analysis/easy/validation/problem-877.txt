Sorry. Fifty years of voting has brought nothing to people like me. Oh, I’m still gonna vote D — and that makes me even more furious. I saw Dick Nixon resign August 1974 In the 50 intervening years, the Democrats have fumbled every play. WE DO NOT HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE Billionaires do not pay their fair share of taxes The War on Drugs The constant wars of imperialism all over the globe AT THE EXPENSE OF THE HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE of every American The Supreme Court! It’s difficult for me to breathe sometimes when I think about how weak and defenseless the Democrats are, how feckless they have always been, and how they do nothing for people who work for a living. Save your innocuous platitudes for someone with hope. I ain’t got none. Democrats suck and Republicans are theocratic fascists. Goody.
Oh. Republicans are totally coherent to themselves — you don’t resonate with what they want, and you’re hoping Republicans don’t matter, but they do. Republicans have gotten everything: the Supreme Court is now a religious body; we are failing to confront Russia because the Rs want us to BECOME Russia; our global climate is destroyed. You may think it’s not too late, but it is. The Rs have totally destroyed the wall between church and state. It’s just worse and worse after this. Sorry! I have voted against them since 1972, but they have won.
