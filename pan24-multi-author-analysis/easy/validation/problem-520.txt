Ok fine here’s a better analogy for the idiots. I start a physical fight with someone, they throw a rock back at me. I duck, they hit someone else in the face breaking their nose/eye socket. Guess what? I’m not liable for their medical bills because I didn’t throw the fucking thing. Ukraine is liable for this, not Russia. It came from their air defense force. Whether it was an accident or not, doesn’t matter.
It means NATO actively destroying not just every missile and plane over Ukraine, but also every air defense system Russia has not just in Ukraine, but anywhere that can fire into Ukraine, or anywhere that might threaten your assets, meaning several hundred kilometers deep into Russian territory, along with the radar installations that send them data, the power substations that feed them, the airfields that host the fighters that are going to scramble in response to your attacks, and more.
Who tf said it was okay? I’m only saying that NATO doesn’t want to escalate to a nuclear war with Russia. If anything having NATO being aggressive is what the Russians want, the alliance has to be level headed.
