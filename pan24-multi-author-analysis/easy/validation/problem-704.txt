Whoa my guy. You’ve got a lot of feelings about this. Kinda my point is, you’re pretty fixed in your way and maybe you don’t call it shame but suicidality is an illness. It’s not going to help you or anyone else calling it self centered. It’s a mistake, sure. But you’re really clinging to moralizing it. Suicidal people are sick and need help. They don’t need to be scared straight, they’re past the point of thinking people care anything about them. I have nothing but empathy and understanding for all the emotions that go into those affected by suicide. Maybe I was a little abrasive, but seriously. This is research based and evidenced based shit we’re talking about here - compassion, openness to the conversation and issues around suicide is not condoning it. Neither is saying “died by suicide” - it’s descriptive.
