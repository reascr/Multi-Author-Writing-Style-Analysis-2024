As a Christian myself… I don’t agree with the idea that Christians should be controlling anybody through the laws or positions of power… I am human, and I wish everyone could agree with me, but I know that can never happen, nor would it be a good thing… These “Christians“ Who want Christians to have all of the power in the world to make laws against those who don’t agree with them missed the point that Jesus made that our kingdom is not meant to be here on earth… Our job is to get you into the new kingdom, not one that we create physically on earth.
