This makes my blood boils I don’t care that he makes jobs or whatever, he probably has private jets and so many mansion Yet when I was making 40K I ended up with less than 30K that I could see. How come someone can pay $750 on taxes?? What’s wrong with this “democracy .” I feel like instead of going forward, we are going back to pre French Revolution times So mad.. so many big corporations doing whatever the heck they want, killing us with toxic food, stealing from us, paying us crap even though the price of living has increased an outrageous amount in less than 100 years, YET people still care about which pronoun other call them!?
Hey may have donated his salary in previous years (and allegedly plus a little extra to account for taxes taken), but he only did that for the first 2 quarters of 2020, there's no report that I can find that he donated the second half of that salary. So by my count there should be at least $200k taxable income for that year. He straight up lied to the IRS about this.
