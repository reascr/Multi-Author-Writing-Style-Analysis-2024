These border guards have to realize that they are no longer border guards which would be deployed to defend the border from outside aggression. These guys are now prison guards.
Haha another commenter just notified me of that function Wasn't aware, but that's a super rad aspect I'll certainly make use of I'm a little handy in Spanish, and Italian seemed to be a bit easier to learn bc of it's similarity, but I peered into some starting Germanic and BaltoSlavic languages and noped right the fuck out until I can dedicate some more time and attention. I have a better learning base for Romantic languages currently. Lots of opportunity to learn more moving forward, ik just a young US guy, and play with the idea of moving out of the US, but working as a nurse in hospitals, I would need to be quite capable if I wanted to be an proficient nurse. Hard to comfort people when you can't communicate well on a day to day basis.
Every country has an internal security apparatus. The US has the FBI, the UK has MI-5, France has the DGSI, etc. The fact that the KGB has a successor isn't the problem.
Exactly. From everything I've seen, Russians that move to other countries do so only so they can live there as Russians in another country. Still waving the flag, still getting defensive over all the horrible things Russia is doing.
