So I made a slightly longer version that is a similar of this argument though I will more I am much more skeptical and critical Then I think many people, especially people who are non-native (which does include myself) would be. I know that this is a sensitive issue and I certainly don’t want to come across as having all the answers, but I do think for all of the people that go “well how can we object to this?” I think the problem is that there’s a lot that we still need to figure out. Also, as I mentioned in the comment, The thing that high, as a non-native person, looking and feel like is the elephant in the room with regard to native and indigenous politics in the US is that much of the way that tribes determine who can be a member really bothers me and seems pretty fundamentally opposed to much of the way that we think about race and nationality today. I’m certainly willing to give some leeway, But I do think it’s a problem when you can culturally raise your children as one thing and then suddenly they’re no longer eligible for membership in your tribe and the benefits that may come with that if you, say, marry someone outside of the tribe, or tribal membership requirements change as what happened with the disenrollment issues a while back. And I really think that compounds a lot of these issues around who gets to vote, whether it’s going to be based on region or if there’s some kind of special ballot or what not. I’m not gonna go completely into issues, but I guess if you’re curious, feel free to look through my other comment that I linked and bring up any objections or criticism any of y’all might have.
