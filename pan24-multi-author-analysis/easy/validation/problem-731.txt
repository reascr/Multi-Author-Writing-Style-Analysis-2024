They began getting them at the end of October, but I agree, they're not really comparable. The 600 (+/- $10k; hard to find) is cheaper than a Shahed 136 ($20k; accounts differ and range up to 53000€), but meant more as an Anti-tank/-armor weapon à la javelin ($78k). The 300 is anti-personnel mostly and cost $6k. Yet the Shahed outperforms in range (est 1800-2500km) hands down, which is clearly a problem. The 300 is 10km, and the 600 is 40km with 50km of loitering time.
The only western tanks which have a realistic chance to actually make an impact and have proper logistics are the Leopard and the Abrams but even the Leopard is going to be a challenge considering the number of variants and while there are a big number overall available, they are spread throughout many countries and thus limiting the amount that can be given away, not to mention that while many countries use the Leopard, it's not like these countries can actually produce them or provide more parts.
There are to an extent. The US gave UA some switchblade drones. There are two variants, the switchblade 300 and 600. They are not nearly as long range as the iranian shaheds, but they are smaller and more portable and thus more tactical.
