This is a direct result of the tea party "scandal" during the Obama years. The IRS received a massive amount of claims to be tax-exempt from tea party groups then when they had to devote people and resources to these claims and start denying them republicans screamed they were being unfairly targeted. This resulted in a huge pain in the ass for the IRS, few friends work for them they talk about people going through all their work trying to find stuff. One friend specifically got pulled into a meeting over the abbreviation TP which obviously was for Tea Party and not Tax Payer. She knows someone who actually required surgies from joint injuries when the investigators demanded he had to look through hardcopies of files for literal months to try and find bias. They denied multiple request to use digitized files and in all those weeks/months of work he turned over nothing substantive.
Classic “conservative” economic theory. Any time the annual budget deficit gets under control pass massive tax cuts. Blame resulting deficit increase on democrats. Rinse and repeat. Our taxes are the lowest they have been in 100 years. Deficit is the highest. Hmm.
