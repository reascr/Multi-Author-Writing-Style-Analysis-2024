Yup. And ever since he got his God Complex (a loooong time ago), he is using his brain for nefarious and selfish acts.
Seriously. I have been particularly well informed on the issue since just before they started Cast Lead. NYT coverage is actually particularly bias in favor of Israel - not quite as ignant as Bill Mahr (gd, that dude doesn't even realize how racist he is) when it comes to issues involving Palestinians, but hey, who is?
2. The law your talking about only sais Israel is culturaly Jewish, infact 25 precent of israelis are not jews.
How's Israel an ethnostate? 25 precent of israelis are Arabs with full rights the same Rights Jews get , the law says that Israel is culturally Jewish but not just Jewish . Also seems your problem is with the only Jewish state and not with the 22+ Arab ethnostates or European ethnostates, heck Japan is also an ethnostate but your problem is with a country that is isn't a ethnostate , your just a hypocrite.
Seem your problem is not with the ethnostate part but with the Jewish part , I don't see you condem the actual ethnostates in the middle east just the Jewish country.
