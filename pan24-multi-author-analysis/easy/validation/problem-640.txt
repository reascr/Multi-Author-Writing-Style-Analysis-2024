In any case, there's a middle ground here. Cut through the noise of the comments and just read the news as the story develops. The Capitol mob and the sentencing happening now is important and getting a lot of coverage, but I'm much more concerned about the congressmen involved in the false elector plan. Both are dominoes in the bigger picture of American democracy. So when you say "when it starts actually happening" for many, those two dominoes toppling, those two lines being crossed, means it is actually happening. Barbara Walter, who's been studying, teaching, and writing about US democracy and civil war for decades, mentioned in an interview that the Capitol mob (I'm paraphrasing here) got people to start seeing the bigger picture and looking at how we got here. For her, it started happening a long time ago. For others, it won't be happening until there's a gun in their face.
