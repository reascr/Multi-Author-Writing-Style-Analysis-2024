First, define the fascism. It isn’t an act or method of ignoring or breaking the rules. It’s a tribe, it’s a group, and they’re unifying beliefs that lie underneath what they actually say, because fascists never ever say or debate what they truly believe in good faith. You failed to define this so you’ve decided that the way they break the rules is “fascism.” You have just played directly into their hands. What is it really then? Republican extremism. Christian fascism. Since the rest of the Republican Party always rallies behind the angriest, loudest voice, it effectively IS the entire Republican Party, from top to bottom. Including people who engage in political action, down to electoral volunteers. That’s right, if they’re Republican, they can’t be trusted.
Exactly. It would just be tons of lying bs thrown at Biden and complete disrespect. He has to just tell them to f off. Maybe let a few folks who punch back from his admin testify but mostly executive privilege and ignore the ferals in House GOP.
