>Former president Trumpâ€™s 2020 campaign commissioned an outside research firm in a bid to prove electoral fraud claims but never released the findings because the firm disputed many of his theories and could not offer any proof that he was the rightful winner of the election, according to four people familiar with the matter.
Imagine that. They knew they hadn't won but continued to lie to the MAGADittoheads in the Republican Party and got their useful idiot True Believers arrested for trying to foment a violent coup, but they still cling to their abusers and try to argue that they are not just a bunch of fucking fascists.
By not releasing the study? probably none. It could be used as evidence that collecting donations to help find proof of the supposed election fraud after this study was done was fraudulent.
