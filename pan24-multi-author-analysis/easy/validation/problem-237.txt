If you're worried about a pandemic. Now would be the time to begin prepping like any disaster. At least a couple days of non perishable food and water, crank radio, flashlights, batteries, blankets, first aid, etc. If you arent willing to prep then you arent that worried.
If you dont think a couple days is enough, prep for however long you think you need to. 72 hours is the rule of thumb for general disaster preparation. You could prep for 3 months +.

60% mortality. And it is extremely lethal among sea lions in nature and minks in captivity. The mortality rate among chickens is north of 90% in 48 hours. But regular influenza is pretty moderately contagious , about half as contagious as the original covid. Current variants of covid are much more contagious and less deadly. Covid revealed much stupidity , but most people (more than half) wore masks and got vaccinated. That level of compliance would kick influenzas ass. Or maybe pandemic influenza is more contagious, but we have little direct evidence of that. The space of possible plague is large, and covid ain’t shit compared to what is possible… even inevitable over long time scales. But H5N1 is probably manageable, with reasonable precautions .
