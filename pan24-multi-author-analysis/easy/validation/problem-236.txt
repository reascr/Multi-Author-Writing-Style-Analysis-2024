I also have to say that I've seen a lot of well-meaning people mistake the arbitrary nature of gender for sex. Gender is arbitrary and biological sex, for the vast majority of human beings, is not. Intersex traits that would result in meaningful sexual ambiguity are (not, as some have said, as high as 1.7%). That doesn't mean it doesn't happen, but it's not the case that human sex is as fluid as gender, or that we shouldn't still think of biological sex as dichotomous in the general sense.
Exactly. These people cannot out reason their opponents, so they prefer to yell over them repeating the same points. Other person gives up, and they think they won.
I do have to say though, that I can completely support transgender people ascribing to whatever gender they want (including no gender), using whatever bathroom they want, and getting gender-affirming surgeries (after all, what are breast implants and hair plugs but affirmations of one's gender identity), while thinking that women should decide for themselves whether their athletic organizations will allow trans women.
