Here's a very simplified example. A household earning $500k in a year is considered to be a 1% earner. They would currently pay about $150k or so in federal taxes. That's approximately the same amount they'd pay under this proposed tax plan if they spent 100% of what they earned in the year. Realistically, earners at that level could spend 20% or less of their income under this proposal and still live very comfortably. That amounts to an effective tax rate of 6% ($500k x 20% x 30% / $500k). Any money not spent increases their wealth directly at the expense of middle class taxpayers, since the middle class will spend a larger proportion of their total income to survive. For example, a middle class household earning $100k would either have to spend 100% of their income to match the 1% example at 20%, for an effective tax rate of 30%, or to match the same effective tax rate of 6%, they could only spend $20k in the year.
No, no. The last two decades was let the rich pay less so you could earn more via trickle down (even though salary is a business expense). Now its just let the rich pay less.
