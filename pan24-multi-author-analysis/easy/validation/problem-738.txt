This whole war, Russia has consistently failed at reacting tactically to intelligence... or even to manifest reality. "This changes nothing" is the Russian motto.
Exactly. During the Great Wrath (1713-1721) Russia killed, tortured and took as slaves a significant portion of the Finnish population. Talking about tens of thousands of victims in a population of 300 000 - 400 000 people. Can't choose your neighbours I guess. Russia has always been a cunt.
EDIT: I forgot to mention a critical aspect of this that is forgotten but important about an authoritarian state: everything is centrally managed, from the top-down, everybody is to follow orders strictly and completely, nobody who is not trusted by the dictator's chain of command is to have any independent authority or autonomy, everything must depend on the system, everyone with any authority must be part of the dictator-approved hierarchy to prevent rebellion.
Yes, thank you! I was trying to remember where I saw this. Such an excellent video. It's an hour long so cozy up with a coffee or hot cocoa but it's worth it.
Throughout December, NATO & Ukraine have been unofficially negotiating with Russia. I think the US, even the French, were shocked at how that went. There is a lot more consensus now about this war ending in a forced retreat. As soon as certain things were said by Mr. Peskov, Brads & (probably) Leopard 2s got green lights.
