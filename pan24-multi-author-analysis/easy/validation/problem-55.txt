He might be the part of indian right. And you think right is all about slaughtering Muslims, right??
Russia is a terrorist and fascist country and should be treated as such (the government mostly) and though ussr helped India it hurt and infringed autonomous countries that bordered it, did similar things that nazis did. And now these days they’re trying to do the same, to bring back the ussr and cause terror to other countries. Ukraine was and is an autonomous country and doesn’t belong to Russia and the countries that join NATO joins it out of their own free will. But whatever believe the brainwashing instead I don’t care, truth is truth so no matter how many times you’ll spew lies a lie won’t become the truth.
Also people have been brainwashed to believe everything the government tells them even when it’s not true. There are some cultural racism there too, the whitewashing and no need to lie and pretend that that doesn’t exist, when there is plenty of data about it. And so is the red light district also a thing. Rape culture although masked still exits there. Am I trying to say that India is a bad place and that they’re bad people? No, that would be the same black and white thinking just like about Muslims.
