Simple. USM Athletics Foundation are top donors to Phil Bryant and later Tate Reeve's campaign. Follow the money. Favre says build me a new stadium. USM says how are we gonna pay for it. Favre calls in some favors from his buddy Phil, Phil contacts Nancy New and said redirect me some TANF funds and she does it. And now that both Phil and Brett are taking heat they asked their friend Tate to kill the investigation. Tate fires the attorney who sent subpoenas to the USM Athletic Foundation. I bet if you could read Tate's text messages there'd be all the proof you need that he was asked to run interference for the investigation by both Brett and Phil.
