Sorry but Mueller did not do his job. If anything all he did was reinforce the ridiculousness of the Republican Party. Given that the justice department operates independent of influence of the president, it also shouldn’t have mattered who was president. He uncovered a crime and chose to uphold a crooked justice department standard of not charging a sitting president while ignoring all the other justice department standards that hurt trump. If we knew what mueller knew I have a feeling some of us might be obligated out of sense of duty to mankind to tell the world just how bad things were to prevent more chaos. He didn’t. Trump went on to stay in power and lead the initial reponse to Covid-19. Hundreds of thousands of people died because of his incompetence and evil and in my opinion that blood is on the hands of all trumps enablers and those who were too much of a coward to stop it.

... factual foundation? Trump sent a mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol on live TV The factual foundation of a need for a serious investigation by a non political entity isn't in question.
Thank you. I'm so tired of reading about how smart and meticulous these people are when all they've really done is pass around the responsibility of holding Trump accountable.
