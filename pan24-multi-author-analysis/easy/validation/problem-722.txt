A little tangent, but it's ridiculous how people don't understand why Trump supporters went for him to this day. Pollsters were always confused because the reasons for supporting Trump changed constantly depending on whatever Trump ranted about recently. It was never about any specific policy goals, it was purely authoritarianism and them wanting to alleviate their overwhelming anxiety because they never developed healthy coping strategies growing up. Democrats could take advantage of this and use more populist rhetoric and it would actually be true unlike Republican's who lie about making things better for the average American. It's why Bernie Sanders was liked by many Trump supporters, he filled the same role but with actual beneficial policy positions.
Unpossible. McConnell is like a shark in the ocean. I have a healthy respect for a strong murderer when itâ€™s in its environment.
