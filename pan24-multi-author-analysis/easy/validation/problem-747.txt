There’s a pretty good argument to be made that it’s already covered by laws against religious discrimination, since the caste system itself is tied to religion; you can’t discriminate against someone based on caste without their religion (or perceived religion) being a factor in the discrimination.
What should I do, exactly? Should I have to bring it up every time I speak? what do you want exactly? There is always the possibility that some other communities will have greater privileges than yours, and you may have to deal with prejudice there, which is something that happens more frequently. Where will this downward spiral eventually lead? Because there are more hierarchical structures than humans could possibly enumerate, discrimination between humans does not always result from community status, despite the fact that it is frequently the main factor. And based on the way you are speaking, I don't believe you want to stop this obscene tradition. You want other people to express regret for crimes they didn't even commit. You are getting a subconscious pleasure that somehow you are fighting for the casteism atrocities but in the mean while I think you are damaging more than anyone else you are more casteist than an average Brahmin.
