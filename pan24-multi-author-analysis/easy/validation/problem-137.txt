If they're putting other prisoners to work in tank factories, I'm sure they could use them for logistics as well. I mean take this guy: doesn't really matter if it's true that he was in prison for illegal logging, but there are probably plenty of people from poor, rural areas that end up in prison for petty crimes like that. I know in Belarus you can go to prison just for being unemployed. And Russia has a 99% conviction rate. Russia is a HUGE country tens of thousands of square kilometers of woodlands that are barely inhabited. I don't think people there who are trying to make a living as loggers are necessarily hardened criminals that will steal everything they can get their hands on the minute you turn your back on them. Especially after having endured prison and being given the chance of earning a pardon.
Yes actually. Keep throwing Russians at Ukraine until they push through, and take land. Theyâ€™ll just keep throwing soldiers until the they win or run out of soldiers. Or until someone makes a leadership change.
