In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Because really? We’re seriously at the point where someone can just blatantly lie about their entire life, hide their criminal history from another country (where the case is still open), get elected to Congress, and still be allowed to take the seat, and there’s no recourse other than hoping and praying that the people who live in that seat see anything wrong with it? When this guy likely committed several crimes in the process (lying on campaign disclosure forms, for starters). What kind of country are we running here?
