It's basically a highly toxic site for years to come (thousands million+ of pounds of Vinyl Choroid, along with other chemicals is not just going to go away, that easy, imo). So I am surprised that Trump is even showing up at that place. But it's also a conservative area that consumes FOX New, Zero Hedge, Alex Jones, etc... So in their mind no one is talking about it and they are being screwed over by Biden/Mayor Pete and not DeWine (who was the one who ordered the tankers to be controlled burned, but I would like to point out that if they didn't do that then it probably would've exploded an caused a much larger environmental/health issues) , DeWine didn't declare a state of emergency when the derailment happened and now he can't access FEMA because of it. But I doubt that anyone told the folks in East Palestine about that. I understand that they are mad but they are mad at the wrong people. Trump has a habit of saying things people want to hear. So I don't doubt he will say Biden is "too afraid" to go to East Palestine and that he won't help them. And oh, Mayor Pete bad. That along with with him claiming the 2020 election was stolen and that if he was in charge he would've done something else (in actuality he would've made it much worse, IMO).
