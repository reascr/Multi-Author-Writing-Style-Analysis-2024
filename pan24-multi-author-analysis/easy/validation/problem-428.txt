I'm not suggesting ideas, but how does the Russian military not have some nuclear engineers that could do this? I'm not saying they are huge supply in any military, but it seems like after a year there's bound to be some that could have been reassign. I understand not all tasks are the same but even so.
We weren't far from this incident growing to a scale when not 50000 people were evacuated but millions would be at risk of having to relocate (Chernobyl was worst case scenario for the reactor but the way it was handled was surprisingly competent for Russians, they accidentally sent one man who could actually see through bullshit and cared, I doubt they have many like that left by now).
Why? Whatâ€™s the worst that can happen? A rogue engineer builds a structural design flaw into one of the plants, causing the entire thing to blow up if an enemy happens to shoot some torpedoes down the long ventilation shaft leading to the reactor core? Not likely as the target area would only be about two meters.
