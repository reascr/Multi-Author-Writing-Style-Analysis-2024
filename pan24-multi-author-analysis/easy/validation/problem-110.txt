In the ER you are entitled only to a medical screening exam. This can be from anyone licensed to do one. Iâ€™m an ER doc and Private equity backed contract management groups swept in and forced out every democratic physician owned group in our city in a 2 yr period. All started cutting physician hours and stretching their responsibilities. Queue the influx of PAs and largely under qualified/educated (fault of the system, not them before they jump on me) NPs. If you demand to see a MD/DO they may oblige but by no means have to and speaking from experience, any demands made to be seen by a certain person will start off the encounter on the wrong foot. That being said, if my loved one came to the ED for something serious or rare, I would insist they be seen by a docðŸ˜…. I would probably be better at knowing whether they were appropriately triaged though. I and for some things, say laceration repair, Iâ€™d actually prefer the NP to one of my Physician colleagues based on who has more recent reps.
