It absolutely isn’t. In general, it is much harder to get CPS into a home and talking to kids and parents than this article makes it seem. I don’t think that the article is incorrect, I absolutely believe that families face these things, but it takes a lot to get CPS to actually do anything. I adopted my son from foster care I’m VT, and before he was taken from his home, 35 reports were made to DCF during kindergarten and 1st grade. Reports were made by school officials and his pediatrician. Once police found him, at age 5, walking a mile away from his house down a state highway because his parents were fighting and he was scared and left. He was gone for hours and no one noticed. His parents got in a fight and were throwing things at each other; a mug hit him in the face and cut him under the eye. It was at least a year after these events that CPS was able to remove him. Now I am a teacher in WA state, and have had to make several calls to CPS about things students disclose to me. Most of the time, the families refuse to be interviewed and so that’s it until another report is made, though probably the outcome will be the same. I made a report about safety concerns of a student this year because the student and a friend were talking about how the student’s dad was an alcoholic and an abuser. CPS went out but dad refused to talk. Later in the year they removed her from the home because he got drunk and punched her in the head so hard she got a concussion, and she was only removed from the home because he was in jail.
