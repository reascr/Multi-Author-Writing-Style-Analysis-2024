Eastern Europeans figured out centuries ago how to get through long winters on stored food. Grain keeps naturally as long as rodents are kept out. They also rely heavily on root vegetables like beets and turnips, which keep naturally in a root cellar. Ukraine's national dish is borsch- beet soup. They have a great enthusiasm for foraged mushrooms in fall, which are a source of vitamin D, at a time of year when the sun's UV light is too weak to provide much to the skin. Pickled and lacto- fermented foods like sauerkraut are sources of nutrients that don't endure cooking well, like vitamin C. They even turn dried tea and white sugar into kombucha, which is rich in B vitamins.
