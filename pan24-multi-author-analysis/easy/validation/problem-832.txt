Absolutely. I don't think its programming decisions are directly about money, but you can still destroy it financially. At some point, the costs outweigh the benefits. Massive judgments tip the scales heavily in the cost direction.
Exactly. FCC and even the AG need to get involved. It’s not like these were harmless lies. They fueled an insurrection to overthrow a free and fair election. It’s insane they’re still allowed to operate as if nothing happened.

Rupert Murdoch has deliberately destabilized GLOBAL DEMOCRACY. Not just in the US, but in Australia as well. Destabilizing global democracy deserves being prosecuted thru ICC-which is why, I suspect, ALL of the Murdochs live inThe US. If they lived in Australia and were indicted, Australia would hand them over to the ICC. The US won’t. They’d have to travel outside the US and enter a country where Interpol could arrest them. With the GOP corruption tied w/ the Murdochs criminality….global democracy hangs in the balance.
