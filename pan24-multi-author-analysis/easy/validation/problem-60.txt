In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
That’s great. We still have elected leaders in office who stand with fascism. And that is because of the other ones that refuse to root them out. They will always keep coming back if they aren’t dealt with. Next time will be more than just a few cops who didn’t get the memo.

Sociopathy + privilege. Most learn to mimic empathy as a defense mechanism but a special class of them, like Trump, never did, because he never had anything to defend against. No matter what he did, his money and prestige afforded him sycophants and hangers-on who could feed his Narcissistic Supply in return for a chance for some of the crumbs at his table. It would never occur to him to learn something like faking empathy because there was never incentive.
