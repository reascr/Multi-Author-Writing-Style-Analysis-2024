The law says that the required Saturday voting should float a week earlier if blocked by a holiday, but there is almost zero chance that any county would be ready at the end of this week since they have to close out the current election (including the audit), advertise the early voting dates and locations (at least 7 days in advance), and complete logic and accuracy testing of the equipment with the runoff ballot package (which also has to be advertised and public).
This isn't that uncommon. States can float holidays to celebrate at different times of the year to extend a break. You see it at universities also esp for the day after Thanksgiving and the week around Xmas or New Years. Should they be celebrating that particular holiday at all is questionable. But that's why they move holidays.
