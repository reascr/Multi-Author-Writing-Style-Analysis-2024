In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
So yes, it is? That's what it sounds like. It's kind of ridiculous to me how we have special grand juries, special counsels, etc., all which are these elaborate processes that take forever and require insane amounts of resources and time... all for basically a report with which one person or some other tiny group of people use to make a final decision - which they can opt out of, anyway. It's all so redundant and promotes the idea that delayed justice is no justice. We seriously need to streamline our justice system. It's incredibly bloated. And I definitely appreciate that "the wheels of justice turn slow" and that it's intentional, and one of the better facets of this country... but it's almost as detrimental, IMHO, and the highest and most egregious criminals know it and abuse it. /rant.
