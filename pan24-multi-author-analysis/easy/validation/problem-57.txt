I mean I'm pretty sure I have a wider field of view looking out through the windshield and windows than looking through a backup camera or using the mirrors as well as having less blind spots. Like if someone was walking along the cars in the spaces next to mine I feel like I'd definitely see them earlier as I'm pulling out if I had previously backed in because I would be able to lean forwards and peak around the cars to my left and right. However, there are cases where it makes more sense to pull in such as if a parking lot has angled parking spots or if theres an open spot behind the one you're pulling into so that you can just pull into that other spot and be setup to just pull out later.
Happy cake day. In some states without front plates, it’s a no no because it’s harder for law enforcement and parking folks to keep tabs on ya. That said, backing into a spot reduces your odds of a parking lot collision substantially cause so many people get hit back out.
It's literally easier. The turning wheels are at the front of the car, so reversing into the space gives you the ability to get a much tighter angle, and get into the space.
