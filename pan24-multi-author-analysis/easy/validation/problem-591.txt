Agreed they need better monitoring and more frequent shutoff/diversion control along lines. I live near an ocean transfer point and shore tanks sit behind tertiary coffer dams and secondary containment pools. The same pipeline that feeds these tanks sits at the bottom of a small mountain. A few years ago, a city engineer flagged a run of this pipe for a sub working on a city highway project, the as-built drawings were incorrect and a neighbourhood was showered with Bunker C until the excavator operator got his bucket uncurled to direct the flow downward‚Ä¶. Into yards, a couple of streams- it was a mess. Two houses were destroyed due to basements full of oil. They could not stop the gravity-driven flow because it wasn‚Äôt driven by a pump or gas pressure that could be shut down and trying to stop a mass of crude flowing downhill by ‚Äúputting your finger on top of the straw‚Äù would have risked causing vacuum-induced pipeline collapse miles uphill and more leaks in worse locations. We need triple layer, human-proof safeguards, company-posted cash bonds and company-funded response teams.
No clue just yet. I want to go see the impact but I haven't had to time since I work all the time and to my knowledge it's blocked off üòï I'll ask around and keep an update. Huge clean up effort though , that they are trying to keep under wraps. Farmland, underground water reservoirs are being affected though also the water. They just won't come out and say anything.
