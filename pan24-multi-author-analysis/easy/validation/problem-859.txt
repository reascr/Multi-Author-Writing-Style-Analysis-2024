Sorry but that's too easy an explanation. A better explanation is too many Republicans sat on their ass and allow The Crazies to take over the party. It's that old adage of first they came for X then they came for Y and then when they came for me there was nobody left to speak out. The Republicans allowed Donald Trump The Big Lie, election deniers, Lauren Boebert, MarjorieTaylor Greene and the other nut jobs to be their voices. They allowed Donald Trump to hand pick the nut jobs and now they're trying to say it's because the Democrats supported those people they made them easier to beat. I think even if the Democrats hadn't supported those crazies a lot of them would have won because that's who the Republicans choose in their primaries not thinking about who is more centrist and can build a bridge. Republicans build walls and then wonder why they lose. They need to look in the mirror we need to go back to the winning party gets 60% and the loser gets 40%. Not as Newt Gingrich instituted 100% to 0 and if you don't like it that's too bad.
