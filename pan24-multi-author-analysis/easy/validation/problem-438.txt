The Columbia accident report determined that a rescue mission was likely improbable. But, had the damage been known to the astronauts, they could have possibly packed the hole with tools and ice and whatever they could find. There was a spacesuit onboard and a EVA was possible, although it would be unteathered. The “ice team” which predicted impact damage from ice knew that the size and velocity of the detached ice was way outside of their models. They tried to get this across to management with a single, total shit, PowerPoint slide. Don’t use PowerPoint kids.
Feynman actually found out (and mentioned in the Rogers Commission Report) that management assigned a probability of failure to everything, down to the individual bolt, sometimes claiming a probability of failure of 1 in 100 000 000.
I was in 2nd grade. Can only speak for those in my class, but we didn’t completely ‘get’ the seriousness of it all when it happened. One of my classmate’s mom worked at the facility where they built the fuel tanks. She asked someone from NASA to come talk to us about it. It sank in after that.
