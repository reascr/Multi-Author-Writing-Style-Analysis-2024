Good. I for one am tired of people using their color crayons on the flag. It doesn't need it. The colors it has are fine. The design is fine. We don't need people's faces on it. We don't need coloring on the lines. It's just not necessary. It's a good design just like it is. So leave it the fuck alone because it's a good looking flag and doesn't need any help.
Exactly. And most of them work closely with the Vietnamese government, which is the only sensible way to do it if you're interested in closure for the families vs. conspiracy theories.
wow. grew up seeing that flag, that bumper sticker, that sign, everywhere. all the movies and media on it. my dads vet friends all telling me their support groups were sounding more and more like new episodes of tour of duty and china beach every week. my dad was a 2 tour marine there. in the early war he never watched any of those shows.
