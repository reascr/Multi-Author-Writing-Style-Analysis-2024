Not that I’m saying that we shouldn’t tax the rich more but everyone that thinks the gov should be doing more is already calling for taxing the rich. Sooner or later you can’t just tax the rich to pay for stuff. Then what?
How do you tax wealth unless it's realised for example Jeff Bezos does not have such high wealth because he has billions in cash he has such high wealth because he owns 10% of Amazon and as the valuation of Amazon (the amount of money people are willing to pay to own Amazon) increases his wealth increases but unless that wealth is converted to income there is nothing to tax. What you are proposing works, i am not saying that having high marginal tax rates do not work (Netherlands is an example) but it would not solve wealth inequality, what it would do is it can increase the quality of life of the poorest which is extremely important for us to do. On a side not I don't understand why these are even talking points in the United States because for the past 60-70 years US economists have been recommending everyone else to implement universal healthcare, get rid of useless spending on subsidies, build infrastructure, give affordable connectivity (public transport), give access to affordable education, and have a deciplined fiscal policy because it works in increasing the productivity of an economy and test these are talking points with polarization in the US.
There has always be two view on this. The liberal view want all people to finance his own retirement and if possible by private fund and the “social” one (the one that is originaly up in france) that mean all current workers contributions pay the cureent retired persons. In this all pay by their possibility and all receive by their need. And normaly in this view retirement pension are more like a continuation of salary and not a down payment of their cotisations.
