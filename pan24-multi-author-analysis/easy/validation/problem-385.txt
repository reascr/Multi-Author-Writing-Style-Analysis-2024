Basically Kremlin is made of 70 year old fossils that don't understand tech at all. They would probably have banned or taken CCP-style total control Telegram if they had a clue, but they were just too illiterate to prevent sabotage and easily persuaded by the tech industry leaders; now it's too late, Telegram's current form is as irreplaceable as the Bolshoi ballet. Then the younger generation of elites that is trying to compete for the power that frees up whenever Putin's circle dies out (Medvedev, Prigozhin, etc) has figured out how to use Telegram for its own purposes. Unllike China, they are missing the middle ground of technically proficient pro-censorship officials that could actually take full control the platform.
They spooked him. Probably received veiled threats of a polonium milkshake from his poutine one on one phone call. Or they'll target his starlink satellites.
And even in Russia Telegram actually somehow manages to exist as a reasonably secure app because 1) it's so big that it's culturally irreplaceable by now, 2) because of this even some government officials use this to communicate with their fans, and 3) the government actually tried to ban it, but they fucked up the technical implementation which made the ban impossible to implement, it was really unpopular, and then during the time when the regulators were trying to unfuck this all, some tech oligarchs managed to lobby the regulators to drop the issue.
