One big thing I really feel is missing on the conversation is, ironically, the historical context as to how the statues got there. One has to realize that humanity didn't really care for historical artifacts that weren't of that persons religion until English and French nobles in the 1700-1800 began popularizing archeology and anthropology of other cultures or ancient civilizations with different religons, and these statues (or the Rosetta Stone) are a perfect example of that.
Maybe they saw the last week tonight piece. It was amazing being in Greece and actually seeing how many pieces were missing and st the British museums. Pretty fucked up.
Personally, I would argue that the best compromise would but let the British Museum keep some of the marbles as a monument to appreciate how humanity came to appreciate ancient civilizations and other cultures and how it (even if unintentionally) ended up saving the Parthenon and countless other ancient Greek sites and artifacts. The other statues would be returned, but the remaining missing niches in Greece would in turn be a reminder of how important valuing and preserving history or risk loosing everything.
Likewise for this example, although many modern Greeks understandably are angry that the statues are not in in Greece, they should also consider how close they came to having lost so many more of them - including the ones still in Greece today. Without British intervention it would not have been surprising if the Ottomans at the time would have fully stripped the Parthenon of marble while the local Greeks would have not interfered as it wasn't as much of a priority of things to fight back on the Ottoman subjugation (as it was a pagan monument and not an Orthodox Christian site).
I highly recommend the last week tonight piece on this. There's literal pictures of British stealing shit labeled loot written by the people themselves. Hopefully something can be worked out.
Basically, it would be like if someone (the Ottomans) was about to use a bunch of paintings as kindling that they had stolen from a down on their luck artist (the Greeks), but a rich guy (Thomas Bruce) ran up them, bought a handful for millions of dollars, which then effectively meant that the rest of the collection became priceless overnight and too expensive to destroy.
As the other guy said. The Ottomans did, and they wanted to scrap this and use it as raw material. It would have been destroyed. Because somebody in Britain PAID for it (not stolen), it has been preserved...
