One of the far right parties already talking about canceling trans healthcare (in Israel it is known as "The Committee") which is in charge of surgeries, hrt, and the change of the gender mark in trans folks ID. If they get their way and the committee gets out of the general universal healthcare or even demonized it can lead to a lot of problems for trans folks mostly because the general public just don't care enough about trans people here, they just think of them as part of the lgbt community and that's it.
Thank you. And no, I wouldn't get directly mad at my friend but I would carefully try to explain why a behaviour is leading to him getting bullied and therefore affecting me as well. I wouldn't stop being their friend but I would say stuff like, "girls really don't like it when you info dump about Pokemon on them. Let's go find Pokemon fans we can talk to instead.".
I also want to say that as a Jew it's important to remember that if you feel it's hard to be Jewish in America as a direct result of Israel's actions, then you blame should not be directed at Israel, but rather anti-semites who don't understand this dynamic and use "Anti-Zionism" as a flimsy cover to assert their antisemetic double standards on you and make you feel bad for being Jewish. Why should you be made to feel guilty about being a Jew? You didn't vote in the Israeli election. And also take a moment to understand that if you think everyone hates you because you're Jewish and American, try to imagine what it would be like as an Israeli and have countries much more powerful and populated than yours as your neighbours who would like to see you wiped off the map (I'm mainly referring to Iran). Now is the time to be proud to be Jewish. Not embarrassed or guilt-ridden.
