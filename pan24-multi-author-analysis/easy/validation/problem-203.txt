Larkin called a private emergency executive meeting to discuss “unelected personnel”. The city council then voted out Zimmerman (the sitting mayor), which moved Sarah Leland, the vice-mayor, up to the mayor position… which she immediately relinquished and nominated Larkin to be mayor since she had no vice-mayor to take her role… which the council then approved… effectively ousting Zimmerman and replacing him with Larkin through a series of council votes.
Yup! Every family of mine who claimed to be a libertarian was just a Republican who thought the Iraq war was a bad idea (in hindsight of course - they gleefully supported it for all of Bush’s term) but still voted straight ticket Republican in every election.
Wow. All the while claiming the other side is doing it while actively doing it. I might have to hit my head a few dozen more times to face the world if this is the reality.
