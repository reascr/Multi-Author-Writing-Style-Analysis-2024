More fundementally, Ukraine is a nation-state with soliders, the Iranian protesters aren't even a solid group or organization but rather large unorganized public reactions to police burtality and sexism from the Islamic Regime.
That's your solution? that is not going after the root of the issue. That is not a solution. maybe stop trying to make deals and negotiating? maybe stop your citizens from going to Iran so they can't be used as prisoner swaps and bargaining tools? maybe declare the IRGC as a terrorist organization? how did you take down apartheid south Africa?
Maybe a better option would be to use western intelligence capabilities to sneak a few thousand automatic rifles through the border into Iran so that protesters would have something to push back government forces, instead of stating the obvious by lighting up a useless tower on another continent?
Maybe even shoot a long range missile into Ayotallah's mansion while that shithead is snoring, because they don’t have a nuclear weapon to retaliate, for now, and do the same with other high profile figures of the regime, it’s not like the most of their civilians aren’t supporting a regime change.
