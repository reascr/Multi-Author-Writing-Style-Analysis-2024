It's never occurred to me to enslave a political leader I don't like. Murder? Has crossed my mind. Kidnapping, I could see. Imprisonment, power to you. Enslavement? Odd choice.
Persian is an ethnicity, Iranian is a nationality. A lot of people in the western diaspora identify as Persian over Iranian because they have a national identity like American or Canadian as well as wanting to avoid being associated with the Islamic Republic government after the revolution.
um. thats what you chose to comment in this thread about an insane threat from iran? geeee. do you have a biased take on the conflict in israel maybe?
you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims. the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa. the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%). it IS mostly anti semitism. to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above. furthermore. it is an offensive. stupid. strawman. trope. that i cant tell the difference. as a jew. when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.
The problem is manipulators, and the easily manipulated. World leaders gathering under the big-tent of fascistic and nationalist ideologies.
