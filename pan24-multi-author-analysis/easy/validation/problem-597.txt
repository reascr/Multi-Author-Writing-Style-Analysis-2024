Actually that's not the whole story. Haaretz reported yesterday. Netanyahu wanted Ukraine to vote against the motion. Zelensky told him that in exchange for a vote in his favor or official abstention, he needed military support for the war. Netanyahu declined to commit military help but told him they could speak about it at a later point and Zelensky gave the order for the UA representative not to show up so that UA keeps the door open if Netanyahu chooses to help in exchange for a favorable vote. In this case Ukraine did not officially abstain either, they did not vote and abstention requires a vote.

Jews moved back to Israel over the course of many decades. This started in the late 1800s and didn't involve violence or theft. It was just immigration. Of course there was also a population of Jews that had never left in the first place.
Difficult? He doesn't give a shit about what Israel does to Palestinians. He actively supports Azerbaijan's ethnic cleansing campaigns and ongoing invasion while he is being invaded lol. The Ukrainian people absolutely need help but people need to quit acting like the politicians are beacons of democracy. They are remnants of corruption that are simply not Russian. That doesn't mean cut funding, it does mean he's not the second coming of Jesus and these types of decisions absolutely should be paid attention to, noted and acted on when the pattern becomes clear.
