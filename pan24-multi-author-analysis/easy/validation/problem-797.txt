Too many corporate housing investors, too many AirB&Bs, too many books and podcasts telling investors how to get rich in real estate, too many real estate investors over-leveraged or outright greedy, too many wealthy people owning several personal homes, too many houses allowed to rot into uselessness for the depreciation tax break. Fight these causes before building more housing.
