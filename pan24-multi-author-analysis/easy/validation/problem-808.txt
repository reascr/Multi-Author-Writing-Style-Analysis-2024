I pray that he really takes stock, puts his recovery first now, but he doesn’t have a good track record: ignored doctors advice, stopped taking meds after first diagnosed with HBP/heart failure in 2017; insisted on resuming grueling campaign for senate after near fatal, incapacitating heart attack/stroke in 2022; hospitalized twice in one month in 2023, then staff issues statement vowing his return to senate duties “ in a few weeks”. 🙄.
No, random voters in PA are definitely NOT part of any medical evaluations and associated decisions for elected officials. And again, PA voters were not deterred by Mr. Fetterman's slight speech deficits during the debates, and still felt he outperformed creepy Dr. Oz, and they voted him into office. Unless there is a recall (and afaik there isn't such a thing for senators in PA) voters do NOT have any say in whether or not Mr. Fetterman continues his term after his current treatment.
Ramifications? Not much, for brief absence. With him in office, the Senate is 49-51; without him, 50-50 but Harris always breaks ties, so he’s not really needed to pass bills—assuming manchin & sinema vote D.
