I'm guessing Nevada and Arizona have relatively lax gun laws (at least compared to California, but maybe not as lax as Texas), whereas Oregon has stricter gun laws (again, maybe not as strict as California). Further proof that at least part of California's "gun problem" is that guns are being purchased legally in other states and then brought into California.
Considering how large California is, the fact that only 60% of its known guns are coming from in-state purchases I think does somewhat lend to the fact that the gun problem can't be solved completely within California, because a large number of guns are still coming in from out of state. And when you compare it to Texas, where 85% of its known guns are purchased in state, I think it proves that guns are being bought elsewhere and then brought into California.
I may be reading it wrong, but I think we'd have to say that 58% of the guns with known sources are from California. Because 83,781 of the traced guns are from California, and 143,466 of the guns have known purchasers. The other 88,318 guns don't have a known purchaser, so I assume they don't know where they came from (so they could come from California or from another state).
