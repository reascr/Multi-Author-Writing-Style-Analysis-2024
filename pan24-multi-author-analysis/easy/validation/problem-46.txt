The anti-LGBT rhetoric works for them because LGBT people aren’t born into LGBT families. They don’t necessarily look a certain way that they could be identified as LGBT. This isolates the community to an extent, discrimination against races is easier but also they can’t go too far with it because of changing demographics and attitudes/willingness to tolerate overt racism. LGBT people face bigotry within all races and religions. Because of the coming out process and issues specific to LGBT people we’re sadly in a unique place where bigotry is just tolerated because we as a community are fewer in numbers and spread much more thinly. Also, now that they got what they want from Roe. Their next issue is to “protect” children from gays and trans people. They hide behind this to spread their hate. I see the anti-LGBT rhetoric only getting worse before it gets better.
