I grabbed some extra foil for this one - but I was thinking Reddit is restarting its planned IPO because of chatGPT. The botageddon is coming. Botpocalypse?
The other head of state is Macron. Andorra is fairly interesting from a sovereignty standpoint. And theirs a lot of weird religious shit that's survived into the modern day. One of the modern incarnations of the knights hospitaller has its own diplomacy corps and official observer status at the UN. Despite the fact that it hasn't been a sovereign nation since 1815. I've got no idea how they pulled that one off.
i checked out andorra years ago to compare fiscal benefits with luxembourg, austria, germany, monaco, isle of jersey, gibraltar, canary islands, cayman islands, bahamas island, portugal, croatia, switzerland, vanuatu islands.
It’s just bots. There’s a lot of progressive activists who are tech literate and can get on github and download Reddit bot scripts and deploy them. Do many people really care about what Andorra does about anything? Not really, so the message needs amplification.
