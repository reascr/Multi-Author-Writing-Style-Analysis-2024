Judging by the emails I get, you send the suckers your supporters messages like "You have 30 MINUTES to donate to our Official Trump 2024 Victory Fund to receive a 1300%-IMPACT. Don’t wait another minute, Friend. We are counting on you." or "This period of time will go down in HISTORY, Friend, and you will FOREVER be remembered as a LOYAL Patriot that helped your FAVORITE PRESIDENT SAVE AMERICA. Don’t wait a moment longer. Contribute at least $100 IMMEDIATELY to claim your very own copy of OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER before my VERY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT. " Or flatter them with "Friend, according to my Official Patriot Records, you are one of our movement’s TOP PATRIOTS. When it comes to DEFENDING America from the Left, YOU never waver." The last one is particularly amusing, since I have never voted for or contributed a dime to any GOPer, and especially not Trump. Don't know how I wound up on his mailing list, but it amuses me to no end.
