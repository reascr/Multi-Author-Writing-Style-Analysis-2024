The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009 Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$15.5 million to victims' families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process.\[63\] In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.\[64\] Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the Ogoni people, who inhabit the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.\[65\] The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Saro-Wiwa's son, was due to begin in New York.\[64\].
Good. Documentaries have many times displayed the kind of destruction the oil folks have caused in areas of Nigeria - seemingly ignored by corrupt officials etc.
