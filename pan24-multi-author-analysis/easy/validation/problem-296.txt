Not to split hairs - I agree with your broader point - but there's a reason they didn't listen to Barry's warnings in 1981: they were still following Barry's lead from 1964. It was his campaign that birthed the Phyllis Schlaflys of the world who helped form the very same "Moral Majority" he rightfully railed against in his later years. , but it does a decent job of drawing connections between Reagan's rhetoric in 1980 and Barry's rhetoric 4 presidential cycles previously. His famous quote about how every good Christian needed to kick Jerry Falwell right in the ass was spurred first and foremost by Falwell's opposition to fellow Arizonan Sandra Day O'Connor's nomination to SCOTUS - something far more personal to Goldwater as a sitting US Senator from that state than broader disagreements on political views.
If and when the FBI (hah?) comes out and clearly identifies domestic terror threats, and they are unilateral, then the conservatives can just point back and say "see? they are coming for us, we told you this would happen, we are all going to be called domestic terrorists and they are coming for you now.".
