In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup! I remember being very ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ about them because of videos of the screens not being properly calibrated and the selection you would make would jump to something else lol. I don't know if it was necessarily nefarious but paper ballots scanned in are just so much more verifiably accurate to me.
Exactly. Figuratively speaking, fuck republicans, but no one should ever literally fuck republicans. It doesn't get any more unfuckable than treasonous fascist trash.

These subpoenas are asking who's paying for legal representation, "all documents and communications" about Trump's election PACs (including formation, contracts, funding/use of money), everything related to a nonexistent "Election Defense Fund" (potential money laundering front), and info about Dominion and Smartmatic (potential fraud). Add this into the existing investigations about January 6 itself, fake electors scheme, and the election fraud and it suggests that the DOJ could be looking at whether the Trump campaign itself could be an organized criminal organization.
