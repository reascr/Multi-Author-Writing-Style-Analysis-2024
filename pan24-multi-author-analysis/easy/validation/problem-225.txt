Oh I'm not saying marijuana doesn't have a place in medical treatment of numerous different conditions. I cannot think of any legitimate medical reason you would light it on fire and smoke it, and therefore, it's silly for people to pretend the zip they picked up to spin into a backwood is part of a legitimate medical treatment plan...
I firmly believe that in the not so distant future there's going to be evidence that comes out, unshocking to anybody who's not a moron, that lighting marijuana on fire causes sickness like lung cancer... Because lighting anything on fire and breathing the smoke does.
Seriously. I’ve often considered the types of selfish justifications politicians could make for legalization, beyond anything monetary, and one of the most obvious to me is pacification of an increasingly disgruntled populace. A closely associated line of reasoning, what you describe, would be legalization to offer a more comfortable condition of experience while we’re subjected to the impacts of their perpetual corruption. Put another way, if you’re going to f us, at least use lube.
