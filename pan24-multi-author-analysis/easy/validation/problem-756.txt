Why would India deliver weapons to Russia? India was never going to go against Russia since 70% of our army is dependant on them and we have 2 neighbours with whom we don't have the best of relations, add the fact that it has been Russia who has helped with their veto on many matters. If you think this is something new, it has always been our position aka let's try and accommodate them, you are talking about Ukraine war indian trade with Pakistan only stopped when Pakistan stopped it (post removal of 370) and this is a country which had killed many of our citizens and despite what many fans of our current government might think even after pathankot we were trading.
