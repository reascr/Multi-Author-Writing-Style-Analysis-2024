The issue with those books is they arbitrarily assume that we either improve not a single step beyond where we currently are, or that we regress as a fear response to the unknown. More than that, they outright state that everyone else in existence is just as bad, or worse, than us. To the point that humanity briefly working alongside and in peace with the aliens, even though we could only do so by putting the metaphorical gun to their head, was so bizarre and unusual that higher tech species were watching us as side entertainment from their own infinite wars, waiting (correctly) for it all to fall apart once again and justify their own genocidal actions.
Have you read the bible? The bible very proudly emphasizes that they killed every man, woman, and child of a particular tribe, and praised God for it. Then another tribe. Then another tribe. The list is quite long. They are proud of it and praise God!
Another more recent example was the extensive reporting by every major network about young people “not wanting to work” in which they never ever challenged the claims of the business owners they interviewed, nor did they put in the 20 minutes of work needed to compare what these entities were actually paying people to either local cost of living or working conditions.
