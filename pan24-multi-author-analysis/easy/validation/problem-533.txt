Pretty much. Everyone wants to blame corporations and expects them to fix everything but nobody seems to acknowledge that corporations make things because people want the things they make . If we stopped buying their stuff they wouldn't make it, nobody is going to invest time and resources into something nobody wants. Why would Nike, for example, stop using slave labor and voluntarily increase their prices allowing someone else to swoop in and use slave labor because Americans have proven they will buy those products. So yeah in this example Nike would have a better public image but the new company would just take it's place and the problem continues, the only thing this would accomplish is lowering Nikes profits and transferring them to someone else who's willing to be unethical. As long as society accepts unethical behavior why would a company put itself at a disadvantage in the marketplace and suddenly adopt ethics?
Exactly. Every normal person could go completely off-grid with solar panels and windmills and electric vehicles, and oil and gas companies would still run a profit selling to other industries. Only way to avoid it is to never use any manufactured goods and live like a caveman.
