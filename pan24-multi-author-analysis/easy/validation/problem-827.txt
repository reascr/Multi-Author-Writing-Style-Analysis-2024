Ukraine did recently have their highly successful Thunder Runs where they quickly gained a lot of their lost ground back. But those soon stopped and they were primarily successful because of some clever trickery that Russia isn't as likely to fall for a second time. Not to mention they used a lot of the weapons and vehicles they had been given from NATO nations and need replacements for what was used up. Those things just don't appear overnight. It takes months. Plus the time it takes to be trained on new equipment before you can use it properly. I think Ukraine is probably back on the defensive for a while now.
I believe that Russia (at this time) doesn't want to conquer all of Ukraine. They just want to fully capture and keep the areas that they illegally annexed. And Putin is content with losing a lot of men to accomplish this. If they can do that, Putin will call it a complete success. ( Of course he would probably come for the rest in a few more years) If Russia can simply hold out and make modest gains like they seem to be doing right now, then eventually Ukraine may be forced to surrender those areas just to stop the loss of life, both civilian and military that they are suffering right now.
Oh, I agree with you 100%. I meant only that I think theyâ€™re trying at least to play a long game and hope political support from abroad dries up sooner or later.
