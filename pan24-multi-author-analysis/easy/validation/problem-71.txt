In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
And? Donating money to politicians doesn't mean they bought em. And this dude singled dems out and ignored gop when that organization donates to both.
Exactly. Those are lobbying groups famously started and run by American Jews. To say that famously Jewish groups “control” a politician, as was said here, sounds a helluva lot like the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews control the government. That conspiracy theory is old and has led to violent persecution of Jews around the world. Hence why it was called out.

>The crime of apartheid was further defined in 2002 by Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court as encompassing inhumane acts such as torture, murder, forcible transfer, imprisonment, or persecution of an identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, or other grounds, "committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime".
Did you read the article? He referred to AIPAC and Pro-Israel America, not some Israeli lobbying group. AIPAC is an American lobbying group famously started and run by American Jews. It’s not an Israeli group unless you think Jews aren’t really American? (That would put you in the Christian nationalist camp with Marjorie Taylor Greene.) Pro-Israel America is a recent spin off of AIPAC started by people (Jewish Americans) who were previously in AIPAC leadership positions.
I’m not a fan of AIPAC (the progressive group J Street much better represents mine and other liberal Jewish American viewpoints) but the canard that Jews control the government is an old and vile one that has led to persecution of Jews. And it shouldn’t be invoked by anyone.
