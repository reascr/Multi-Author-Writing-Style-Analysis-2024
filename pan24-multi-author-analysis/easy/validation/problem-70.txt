There's actually 5 sides in this conflict, not all of them are obvious yet: the 2%, the polity, the GOP, the DNC, and the historical national narrative and identity. This country runs on precedent and history, and the blueprint already established for this type of conflict is states rights vs the federal govt. The GOP has their base of power in state government. The 2% (who have _way_ more influence cause capitalism), has too much to lose if the country devolves into war, but a relatively peaceful seccession by 20-30 red states doesn't interrupt the economic engine too badly. So the DNC winds up with control of the federal system cause it's the conservatives who are bucking the federal tiger, not the Dems. And the Dems are historically and ideologically a pro peace party. The national narrative, (we've been through this before), _requires_ that we get this resolved in a manner consistent with the highest of our national character/identity traits, because the indoctrination of American exceptionalism we've been fomenting since Washinon chopped down a cherry tree, {yes I know, that was the point}, won't settle for anything less. If we're going to tear it down to the point of secession, (and I don't think anything less will be sufficient to overcome the big lie), we're going to be damn sure to replace it with something much better, or at least negates what brought us here.
