The Charisma thing is a problem, but he also just doesn't seem to do well pushing back against other politicians criticizing him. He's a master at attacking easy targets like public education, public servants, public health officials, and Disney World, but I'm not sure he's going to be able to stand up to the social media pummeling that Trump will give him.
Why? Why on earth would he have a chance to “destroy” Biden? He celebrates literal every policy that fucked the GOP over in the last two elections. No one is going to buy that he’ll suddenly morph into a moderate if he’s put in the White House. Once the Election Machine really gets going, his every shit bag policy will be spread to every corner of the internet. He’s too Trumpish to appeal to Independents, but has none of Trumps showmanship!or charisma. Biden actually DOES have a lot of really good policies to hold up and have celebrated,’in addition to the incumbent’s advantage.
