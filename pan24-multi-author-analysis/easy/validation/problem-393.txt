In a world where renewables are the near future dominant power generator, fossil fuel funding anti-nuclear campaigns is like abacus companies funding anti-calculator campaigns.
5. Bioaccumulation, many fish giving off radiation inside another fish will cause a higher concentration of radioactive materials than the surrounding water.
Two. Your supposed understanding of environmental sciences shows that when it comes to radiation exposure and toxicity levels for tritium, you don't know shit.
For any marine organism to ingest enough tritium from the waste water, that they then contain harmful levels of radiation, would require ingesting more tritium than what they'll be exposed to from the waste water. And it does not matter if the waste water isn't evenly distributed. Due to the size of the Pacific, in particular the area where the waste water will be distributed by ocean currents once released, the tritium will be diluted enough that no marine organism will ever ingest or be exposed to enough of the isotope in order to contain harmful levels of radiation.
4. Marine ecosystems depend on microorganisms who thrive in the surface of the ocean (where dumping happens) and are more sensitive to radiation than humans (except the dinoflaggelates I suppose) and local extripation will occur.
One. I didn't say tritium cannot bioaccumulate. So accusing me of saying that, is a strawman fallacy.
