The US has been increasing munitions production again and again and trying to exhort western allies to increase production as well. The past year has definitely caused the DOD to reassess munitions stockpile levels. The fact of the matter is, Ukraine is in a fight where they are greatly outnumbered and there isn't a realistic amount that will be enough, nevertheless, collectively, we need to give Ukraine what they need to win.
I agree with your sentiments and knowing (and following) everything (public) the West has provided, I still have a sense more can and should be done to make Ukraine's fight quite a bit less unfair.
Not really applicable. Artillery shells would be relatively useless in a war with China. That would be fought with long range missiles and air superiority. NATO has plenty of that as we aren't supplying much of it to Ukraine and the planes and tanks we are supplying are older tech and will just be replaced with the latest and greatest. If anything, this will strenhen the Western Militaries for a modern war against China. Ukraine and Russia are using metaphorical sticks and stones compared to the stuff NATO is prepared to fight with.
