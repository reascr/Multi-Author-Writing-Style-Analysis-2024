What's funny is I hit on the strategy by accident. I'm in sales and work in a very purple state. Basically, it started as a way to make regressives not think I was a communist groomer in drag so they'd still give me money. As time went on, I started leaning into it and now it's a whole conversation about how terrible all of the old guard politicians are regardless of party. How they're all scumbags. If they ask me about trump, I tell them I think he's a piece of shit "but what politicians aren't?" I don't particularly like biden anyway so it's not even like I have to lie to them when I badmouth him. It all culminates in them thinking I'm one of them and they wind up trusting me. I'll take a superficial regressive over a well educated progressive all day when it comes to doing business. They're just so easy to manipulate. They're just lucky that even if they don't take their best interests to heart, I still do but I could totally exploit these people.
