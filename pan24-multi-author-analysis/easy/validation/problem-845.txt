The stupidest part of this all is we're just going to repeat the clown show again when they vote on the rules. Even if we ignore that having any single member be able to move to recall the speaker is a very dumb idea that nobody wants, they appare tly negotiated that a bunch of the crazies get committee chairs outright? Why would the person who was going to get that committee chair vote for those rules?
