Do you remember polonium poisoning? Polonium is a terrible poison which is very likely to kill the poisoner while simultaneously having uncertain effect on the victim depending on how well it's applied. It's crazy expensive because the only way to get it is if you have access to a nuclear weapons program with very particular refinement capabilities. It's much easier to use a bullet or a knife or a club to kill someone. The only reason to use polonium is if you want everybody to be absolutely sure who called for the murder. Putin may grin and claim he's never heard of polonium, but that's just diplomacy, unimportant in his worldview\; Telling his dissidents they're going to die screaming of radiation poisoning if they become intolerable, even if they escape to a NATO safe harbor, is politics.
I.e. there's a lot of deaths from heart attacks and drug induced heart attacks, and falling off and out of things.
Dude seriously? That's seven hours I'm going to have to mod that game just to reinstall it, play it for 2 hours, and then forget about it for a year or so.
