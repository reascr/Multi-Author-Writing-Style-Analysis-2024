The issue with that line of thinking is that in both Afghanistan situations, the conquering power had their own government installed and that government was in various ways in power in a lot of the country. Here, they're struggling to hold the outlying areas closest to the Russian border. If the Russians managed to take Kyiv or kill Zelenskyy, then the comparison would be correct. That's why people think this won't last that long. They've lost >100,000 troops and don't even have control of Ukraine.
