why not both? Shitty gov't is usually a product of apathetic or moronic voters. A symptom and not a root cause. Better-educated populace (basic education) would lead to better candidates to vote for.
Lol what it’s true. I’m liberal as fuck myself, but this is absolutely what Apple look for when employing staff because they know that’s how us young people relate. Apple ain’t trying to Apple to fucking old farts.
We'll see how it plays out, my understanding was that with the adjusted way bargaining works, 'minor' players like RAFFWU or other grass-root organised groups have less of a say in the bargaining table / consideration given to their claims than the larger, more recognised shoppers (who can eat a dick as far as I'm concerned).
Well done. I don't care who you vote for, but we desperately need more voters like you. You don't have to vote for a major party because you think you're vote will be wasted. Think of it as building the seats up of your chosen minor for the future. It may not happen now, but if enough people desert the majors, things will change, major parties can become minor ones.
