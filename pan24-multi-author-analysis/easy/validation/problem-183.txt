People have made a point to drop their membership (which was automatic at birth, prior) but I personally feel it has merit to, at the very least, retain my right to vote for church council - which isn't immune to political extremism. But that's an aside!
Just saying, although I can appreciate that asking a religious man to invoke religious words towards something that is against his religion is a somewhat more sensitive situation, the idea of "its his belief" is a dangerous path towards outright discrimination.
But this shit? I totally don't get it. This is the equivalent of black folk demanding the KKK give them membership. It makes no sense.
There are practical matters, such as keeping and caring for property and facilitating burial grounds, which still ties the church to law more so than other membership organisations (its purpose and form of organisation, for instance, are still regulated by law).
Lmao no. That's not what happened, at all. Business has a right to refuse service, but there's always an . The baker wasn't comf baking a cake for LGBT couple, it'd be like me not baking a cake for a black wedding because they're black. That actually illegal business discrimination.
They, or the church as a whole, simply are not under strict obligation to host wedding ceremonie for anyone, really. It's been a while since the church held dominion over the legal act of marriage and with separation between state and church largely complete, this is kind of a non-issue that primarily concerns members of the church.
