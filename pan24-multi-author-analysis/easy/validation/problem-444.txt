I get that but that still doesn’t address my point. They authorize a bunch of junk, doesn’t mean it does anything productive. Anything that we don’t have money coming in from tax receipts needs to be borrowed. My point is the fiscal mismanagement of our government. I tossed out one example that will clearly get to $100 billion. How many other examples are there like this? What percentage of a dollar spent by the federal government actually does something productive for the citizens and what percentage is pure waste. There seems no accountability for where the money is allocated to and the utility of it. I’m curious how much waste there is. The military industrial complex is clearly a money generating machine for so many but that’s just one component, but a big one. Medicare, while very important isn’t financially well run and we certainly can’t have Medicare for all under our current broken healthcare system. That would only exacerbate a problem. The underlying healthcare system need to be fixed, screw the insurance companies, get the prices to something fair then work on a healthcare fix. I guess my pint is that I think the entire thing is broken. The politicians are all in on the joke, they don’t work together, they don’t do anything productive. They waste money and time bickering and keeping score of gotcha’s with each other. I think the only chance we have is get money out of politics, term limits (money and power corrupt and it’s clear self governance isn’t feasible for these folks) and have systems in place to fire them immediately for corruption, fraud, lying and misleading, like any other job in the US. The Rest of the World wonders how the US has suddenly become a corruption-raddled third world kleptocracy. While there has always been corruption it’s out of hand and not even remotely being disguised anymore.
