The next step is Moore vs Harper. If this goes the way conservatives want, then state legislatures will be able to make up any rules they want concerning elections and the courts won't be able to challenge them.
Suppose a Republican controlled state legislature decides that only Republicans can run in state level races. Right now, this would make for an easy court case and this rule would be struck down. What if courts weren't allowed to intervene, though? The only way to change this law would be to elect state legislators to change it, but the only ones allowed to run would be Republicans.
Alternatively, a state legislature could pass a law saying that they get final say on any election results and can overturn them for any reason. With no way to challenge this in court, Republicans wouldn't need to worry about "stop the steal." If they lost, they'd simply overturn the results and there would be no mechanism to challenge them. (Again, you could elect someone else, but then the state legislature would just overturn that and install their preferred candidate.).
