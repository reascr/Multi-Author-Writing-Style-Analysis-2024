Civilian aircraft information is public for obvious safety reasons. Elon's jets are Registration: N628TS, N272BG, N502SX.
Elon's FAA jet single-source information is not doxing. Per your own post: aggregation is (hunting down a person's different profiles and personas and putting them together as one). Yes... But not simply Elon's jet business submitting flight paths. Just FWIW.
In normal countries making drugs an illegal substance could probably work very well , just like in normal countries making guns illegal would work however with America seems like legalizing it would actually be the lesser of two evils with all the demand that's created for the cartels in south America.
No. That’s not how it works. Do you know what happened to alcohol consumption and overdoses in states that legalized weed? They went down, dramatically. If people have access to clean drugs, the money that was spent on prohibition is repurposed to rehabilitation, and aren’t ostracized from society for using, it’s a dramatic reduction in harm. I encourage you to educate yourself on legalization.
