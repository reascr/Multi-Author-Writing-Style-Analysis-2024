Most developed nations are grappling with how to pay for the baby boom generation's need for geriatric care with populations that are plateauing. This is a big problem for Germany and Japan, and China is facing a huge crisis caused by the One Child policy. But those are populous countries constrained by natural resources. China instituted the One Child policy out of fear of Malthusian overpopulation. The one country in the world with plenty of space and natural resources for an expanding population is Russia, and they're throwing a generation of young men into the meat grinder. For every man killed or crippled, around ten emigrate. The conscripts come mostly from the poor, the talented and educated were the first to flee.
Exactly. This is also the reason why this genocide was rushed by all accounts. Not so long before war Ukraine signed deals with few companies that would help them gather those resources, since they themselves couldn't. Now that they could, putin suddenly became worried.
