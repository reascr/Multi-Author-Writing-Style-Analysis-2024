Do liberals suddenly not shop at Walmart anymore? Drive gas-powered automobiles or fly in airplanes? Use cellphones with rare metals in them? Eat foods harvested and ranched on lands laid waste for the sake of agriculture? Heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summers? Use electricity?
Now the mines are closed. Many hold resentment against those who support climate change because its the people pushing climate changes fault the coal mines closed. Yet when job retraining programs are offered the scoff at it because it's "not what our family does". They made a industry an identity and are now trapped by pride and "tradition". I have wasted so much breath trying to bring reasoning and factual conversation with people in this position but they won't have it. Most haven't even seen 50 miles from their home town. The kicker is you will hear things like "this has been happening for thousands of year, just let it happen".
