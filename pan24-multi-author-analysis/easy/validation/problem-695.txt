Famously? It's ridiculous that would be famous considering it was an off-the-cuff comment in the middle of a long interview about a subject that doesn't matter anyway. To my knowledge he didn't embellish his record in any other way - he just remembered his marathon time from 20 years ago. Who cares?

Daily reminder of why so-called independents are generally just embarrassed conservatives. During the Bush years Paul Ryan was considered a bullshitting kook by Republicans but I guess nowadays bullshitting about cruel policies without the overt mean streak is enough to look presidential to a majority of Americans.
5.	Stephanie Kemplin - Accused Franken of groping her breast while doing a photo op during a USO tour. “When he put his arm around me, he groped my right breast. He kept his hand all the way over on my breast. I remember thinking, ‘Is he going to move his hand? Was it an accident? Was he going to move his hand?’ He never moved his hand.”.
As a thinker, he's extremely unknowledgeable and uninterested in actual policy. As a politician he's got some good senses. He knew that the people somehow further to right of himself were gaining power and using it to reduce his own, so even though his policy positions almost entirely overlap with Trump's, it made good political sense to try to reduce Trump's power so he could claw some back. He's a young guy, he's got decades of time left to get shit done.
