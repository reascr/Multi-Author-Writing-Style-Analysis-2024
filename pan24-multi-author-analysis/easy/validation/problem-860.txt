Seriously, I smoked for years and I detested people who threw them on the ground outside my job. If someone was smoking with me and they threw theirs I would check them.
Why privacy considerations? Your numberplate is your fucking car. The camera will read your number plate (like they already do) and they will just print the number on the bag.
All they are doing is printing your number plate on the bag that is it. The big big letters and number are already visible on your car. they arnt putting your name an address on any information you couldn't get by looking at your car.and seeing as they already write your number plate on the recipt how is it any different? apart from now you have to clean up after yourself.
Exactly, and imagine actually holding the companies that produce the environmentally toxic chemicals accountable and not the average person.. crazy right.
Very cool. An apple is highly biodegrabable. Something that takes 15 years isn't. 10 000 years is nothing in the grand scheme of things either and we wouldn't refer to something that takes 10 000 to be highly-biodegradable.
