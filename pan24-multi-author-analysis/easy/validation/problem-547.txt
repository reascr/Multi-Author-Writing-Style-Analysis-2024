I read an article several years ago about this. At first, the article read as if the downward slide of the public school system was caused by forced integration. Allowing minorities into white only schools was the problem. I was obviously thinking WTF am I even reading. But then the writer got to the meat of the issue, and explained that the real reason was because conservatives decided to punish the public school system relentlessly over decades, for forcing them to allow integration. It was a very intelligently written piece, and I wish I could find it and link it, but unfortunately Google isnâ€™t helping me.
