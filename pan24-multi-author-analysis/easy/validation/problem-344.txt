Once Trump saw in 2020 that he was tanking in the polls he had to invent his visibly false attack on our working election system. There was little extra risk in exposing himself to criminal liability in pursuing a coup. This is because once he was no longer president all of his stunning levels of fraud became more actionable and he knew he would go down anyway. He is losing enough of what support he still had that he stands almost no chance of winning even the nomination. Even a few hardcore Trump nuts balk at supporting a guy once it is no longer remotely deniable that he is a massive crook. Who knew? Oh yeah. Everybody with decent decision-making who ever looked at his career.
"Superbowl? We can't write about the Superbowl, we already wrote about it last year. Superbowls happen, everybody knows that by now.".
Unfortunately, he isn’t treated like other American citizens are. Will be interesting to see if he gets charged….
