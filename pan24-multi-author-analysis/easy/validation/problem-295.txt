MTG has been a fundraising machine. The more extreme and obnoxious she is, the more money she gets. She supported legislation that would ban the display of Pride flags and what she called “hate America flags” at U.S. embassies. That got her a lot of donations. She also said the Black Lives Matter flag represents “a group who wants to erase our history and bring mass destruction to our country through Communism.” That brought in donations. She said, "The Equality Act that we are to vote on this week destroys God’s creation. It also completely annihilates women’s rights and religious freedoms. It can be handled completely different to stop discrimination without destroying women’s rights, little girls’ rights in sports, and religious freedom, violating everything we hold dear in God’s creation.” She got a lot of donations after that. She said, “Teaching racism and promoting sex, homosexuality, & normalizing transgender to children is mental/emotional child abuse.” More donations.
Not everybody is running and gunning from MTG's ultra safe seat. She'll do decades of damage in two years to the GOP if they let her do this.
