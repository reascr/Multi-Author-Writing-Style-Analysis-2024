It's odd to say it... but in a very abstract sense they kind of have. Between Russia's overall performance against Ukraine, their disastrous failure at airbourne attack of Hostomel, and the air defense situation.... Russia can't really do anything to Moldova. Not using conventional military.
Pawn, not knight? Pawns can’t jump squares, but knights can. That doesn’t mean they can survive behind enemy lines without backup, which is what these idiots were planning.
Exactly. I don't understand how people don't get this. Russia can't get to Moldova. They can't send supplies. I mean, at least the 7000 Moldovan troops can be resupplied with ammo. Russian forces there are effectively already encircled. Russia can't even fly fighter jets over Ukraine, let alone cargo planes.
Moldova is weak, militarily, economically, politically. Infiltrated by Russia for decades. BUT it's moving in the right direction and strategically speaking except NATO members the most stupid place for Russia to make threats against since it has no direct way of attacking in any conventional attack (Transnistria has a force of obsolete, unsupported and impossible to supply light russian troops that would be a walk in the park for Ukraine to mop up since they announced they will help Moldova if it comes to that).
Eh, that's too far fetched. Be more like Russia launched missile strikes AR Moldovan government but several missiles were intercepted over Ukraine and of the ones that made it, two hit residential neighborhoods, and one hit in a field. Russia deployed airborne forces to attempt to seize power but forces were shot down over Ukraine resulting in the death of many troops and several commanding officers. Russian forces in Transnistria briefly tried to fight their way into Moldova, but were harassed by Ukrainian HIMARS attacks. After several days of combat, the Transnistrian forces surrendered due to lack of ammo and supplies from Russia's inability to deliver supplies through Ukrainian defenses. Following the surrender, Moldovan forces were able to move and reclaim Transnistria. Russian president Vladimir Putin made several statements that red lines were crossed, and threatened nuclear attack, but took no action. Following the incident, the Moldovan government applied for membership into NATO and after much deliberation and hesitation from Turkey, Moldova was inducted into NATO on June 27th, 2024.
I'm not sure they wouldn't try. Russia takes big risks, and soldiers lives are cheap right now. They might rely on Romanian/Moldovan doubt and reluctance to shoot down a troop carrier... especially if it's disguised... however badly. A major with his finger on the trigger might be reluctant to perhaps start WWIII... for the few minutes it would take.
