Of course I did dumb shit when I was 14 and yes, sometimes I also suffered the consequences. Life doesn't discriminate between smart or dumb, being dumb is also no excuse in committing a crime and he absolutely was out there to commit a crime. You're just writing a scenario in your head that would make it more acceptable, that would trigger tolerance for his actions, but you don't know why he was there or what he was planning to do. Nor does it matter really. I feel bad for his mother, I don't feel pity or empathy for him.
The lenhs some of these people take it to us downright embarrassing and somehow they don’t see it They will literally go to war and fight each other over a name and a number on a jersey AND if that player announces they want a trade or go elsewhere THEN all of a sudden that “Fan” is sending death threats, Racist remarks, to that player WHILE WEARING THEIR NUMBER AND JERSEY (Looking at YOU 49er fans in particular) y’all sent death threats and racist Bs to Your own QB & WR1 in the off-season and now here you are praising them ALL WITHIN THE SAME YEAR! How is that NOT Mentally Unstable? Y’all bipolar & dumb AF.
