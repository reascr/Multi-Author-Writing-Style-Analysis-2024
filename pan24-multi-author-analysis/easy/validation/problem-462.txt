Nah, that's mostly historical revisionism. Yes, the US historically overstated our overall contribution to WWII (primarily in the European theater though), but this narrative is an overcorrection in the other direction. It's unlikely that the Soviets could've made a meaningful difference that far from their primary front and concentration of logistics and forces and looking at actual Japanese records, the bombs were the largest factor. Specifically, they believed after the first bomb that they could keep fighting, but that was based on the mistaken belief that the US would only be able to make one every several months or longer, and they determined that was an "acceptable" loss rate for the time being (and frankly wasn't that much worse than the firebombing anyways). When we were able to deliver a second one within days rather than months, that changed the understanding.
The Japanese had already humiliated the Soviets/Russians. They had next to no experience or capability to participate in amphibious landings. The US was already at their doorstep, burning down their cities, strangling their supply routes, invading outlying islands. They had the Worlds largest Navy and an enormous and experienced amphibious force. The notion that the Japanese were somehow uniquely motivated by Soviet action is Soviet propaganda.
