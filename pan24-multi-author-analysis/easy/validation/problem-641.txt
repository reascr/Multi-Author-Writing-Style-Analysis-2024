I'm glad the number is rising, but it's too little, too late. I really feel like people defending, and celebrating the lack of action...less than a third showing up, and that's just registered voters, the population is much higher, don't understand how horrible those numbers are.
Younger voters complain...constantly about the older crowd being in politics....but the old people vote.
Also, remember the majority of younger voters refuse to vote. They understand politics like the boomers understand tech...but the boomers at least get something for their ignorance....re-elected.
Boomers show up, and vote for their ideologies, and people their age. Change needs to come from the younger generation. it doesn't happen magically. Only 27% of voters 18-29 showed up. That's 73% that didn't. If you want to point fingers, start with the 18-29 year olds that refuse to vote. The younger voters could push these dinosaurs out of office. They don't. twitter burns, and complaining aren't action.
