Let's run through a not uncommon route. A GPS module is produced by a company, let's call it Spiteful Industry Inc. SII sells those GPS modules to drone repair shops across the country. Eventually newer better models from SII come out, so the drone repair shops wind up overstocking and auctioning off the old GPS modules since they are no longer a market standard. They auction them off to Sock Auction House. SAH holds sales of several large collections, including SII GPS modules. A company called Prison RR Inc purchases one of those collections for pennies on the dollar, and sells them off to Issued DM, a Nigerian company that resells American components across the African continent. IDM sells some of the components to TA Inc, a Dubai based company with branches in Egypt. TA Inc then resells the SII GPS units to Iran at a huge markup.
"Security" has outweighed "cohesion" and "stability". We have our evolved system of economics to thank; rampant without proper legislation or intelligible care. I think this is true for so many of our societies' ills.
