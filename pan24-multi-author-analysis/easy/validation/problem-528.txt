Holocaust denial is a central element in many of the more aggressive antisemitic conspiracy groups. They say its existence is proof of their globalist agenda.
Creativity and imagination not required. What you lack is hatred. These people don’t believe any of the shit they’re saying. They just want Nazism destigmatized.
Not sure if this is what you’re referring to but General Eisenhower was quoted as saying: “The things I saw beggar description…The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty, and bestiality were so overpowering…I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations to propaganda.”.
Thanks. I don’t recall the names of all the experts. I know architectural issues were important. The deniers would/will grab hold of some minor detail and try and blow it up into a major issue. E.g., one was whether the stacks the gas was dropped down were staggered or in a row. Another issue was about whether poison was detected in the material. (One study said no, but it was shown they tested an outer wall and poorly. Better studies found it as expected.).
