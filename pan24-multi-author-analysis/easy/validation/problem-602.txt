Honestly that’s the best I would hope for. Torture and mistreatment of POWs is never justifiable and should be investigated seriously and punished severely. Without excusing it, even the most experienced and disciplined armies can’t completely eradicate this problem because it’s one of the darker sides of human nature. What’s important is that these incidents aren’t systematic and that the perpetrators are made examples of. If Ukraine does the latter, perhaps it will embarrass the US and other paragons of humanitarianism into following suit.
No justification. Hold them responsible for what they do. But let's be very clear - it's hard to trust the Russians in any way because they have proven to applaud torture against Ukrainians. Russians at home loved that video, by all accounts. Russians here cheered.
This, unfortunately. War makes monsters of us all. Terror bombing Ukrainian cities doesn't help. I can't imagine what I'd do if I'd lost friends and loved ones to the cogs of Putin's neo-fascist regime.
Superiority is not perfection. While it’s good to aim for perfection, it’s important to value things that are imperfectly better than the alternatives.
