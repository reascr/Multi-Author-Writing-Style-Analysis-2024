ugh, I know we're joking but this is all based on real shit. Like "America's Mayor" from 9/11 really stood out there and ranted about election fraud without evidence but with spray-on hair color dripping down his head. And it's very likely he rented a space at a 4 Seasons feed and seed when he meant to do it at a 4 Seasons hotel. And people REALLY trust that guy when he says "Hunter Biden's laptop has all this crazy stuff on it but you can't see it and even though the FBI looked at it and said it wasn't there, it really is, just trust me.".
Understandable, but disappointing because no one is better equipped to exploit the tiny, chaotic Republican majority and, after all, Pelosi's first legislative accomplishment as Leader was sinking Bush's Social Security plan while in the minority in the House, where a simple majority rules.
Hold the fuck up! You mean to tell me that people prior to WWII did not get to enjoy the delicious delicacy of Chocolate Chip Cookies? No wonder we ended up this way.
