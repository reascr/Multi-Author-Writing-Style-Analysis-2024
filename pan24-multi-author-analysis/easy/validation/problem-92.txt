Ukrainians are in absolute apperication of what America has given Ukraine. My cousin fought in Ukraine and on his last evening in Ukraine he had a meal with his commander and a few fellow soldiers and he was told he was now American/Ukrainian and he countered "but I don't even speak Ukrainian" and they laughed and said "most Ukrainians don't speak Ukrainian when they become Ukrainian" he looked confused and said "Babies, babies don't speak when they are born, but they learn".
100%! I travelled there in 2018 with a bunch of Kiwi guys from London and for the most part they were just stand up people. I've also been to Russia around the same time, and not so much for then.
Yeah, modern warfare is mostly optics/curated information. It's nothing new, just amplified these days. Fascinating to see in real time, but I'd rather not. Fuck Putin, lol.
The American public in general will likely see a net positive effect, since ramping up production of military equipment means more jobs, and most defense companies pay well and are rated as some of the best places to work, and many are unionized.
