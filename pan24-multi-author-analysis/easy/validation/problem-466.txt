Yeah. When I worked in Holland for a while, I was floored with how much EU residents get. Even the lowly service and retail workers. I sent some guy home one day because he was being an ass, and my boss asked why. I told him, and he said, "No, don't do that, he still gets paid, even if he's not here." Top that with sick pay and vacation pay, and somehow, things still run fine and I guess it's profitable since companies stay in business.

Then over the next 15 minutes you need to reprogram your fancy bus' computer to tell it where we're now going because the place you wanted to land at is a no go, calculate how much gas your gonna burn to get there, look at aeronautical charts about the new place, communicate with company to tell them youre going somewhere else, communicate with flight attendant to tell them the people riding the bus are gonna be upset, break your passenger's hearts, use your bus' fancy computer to get the speeds you need to fly your next approach and landing, brief the next arrival and landing, reconfigure the fancy bus' wheels and wings for landing, then land.
I had to go through WC and it absolutely destroyed my career at the company. I was black listed and treated completely differently afterwards. They thought I did it just for the time off. 0/10 workplace environment.
