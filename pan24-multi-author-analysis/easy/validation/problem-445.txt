In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Eeeeehhhh??,,, any press is good press! Maybe they’ll bring some uppers to stay awake during the meeting, and some flow max to keep the old farts pissing regular, and some benzos to keep everybody, calm, and a little pseudo ephedrine to keep the sinuses dry, and everybody just alert enough to not have to blow their nose,… And may be a little Xanax for the agitated ones.
I strongly agree with those moves. The note you made about barring them from any industry they had purview over is for an even longer period than I've ever heard but I like it. I'd honestly just like to see them barred from the private sector in any capacity for an extended period of at least 7 years. Give them good pay and a good pension after at least 2 terms so they have no reason to go off doing things they shouldn't.

Fiscal conservative ideology/politics, big business interests and most of the corporate mainstream news-media resist sufficiently progressive ideas from actually being implemented.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please if you have any questions or concerns.
Also, Republican representatives are likely manipulating the Democratic Party hierarchy into making the latter's fiscal politics/policies even more conservative. They all seem to favor big money interests over people.
Absolutely does. However, I imagine we're unlikely to get politicians Nascar-style wearing their owners. By the time we could I'm sure we'd get the much more logical legislation to cut the corruption out.
