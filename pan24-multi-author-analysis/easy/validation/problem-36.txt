Well I can't dipsute a negative. Until you provide a distinction about what is virtuous about witholding democracy or what is virtuous about not letting yourself change your mind. Then there isn't really much to discuss. Though were you to come up with a reason as to why I have a feeling it would just be for the sake of the counterfactual. Some need to defend stubborness rather than accept it's a good thing to allow Scotland a democratic vote.
So the alternative for the North - and Scotland until the SNP - was to vote Labour. But the problem is. How do you convince the South East to vote for a Labour party when their public spending is already pretty good? Labour needs to run on a manifesto in the North/Scotland of improving our neglected public services. But they already get that in the South East. So they want lower taxes or even public spending cuts. They've got theirs screw paying for improving the rest of the country. So Labour is in a position where they can at best offer liberal or even slightly conservative manifestos to win an election. If they get to progressive then the Conservatives/right-wing and Liberal Democrats/Centre-right sweep up those South Eastern seats that they need to form a majority. And we end up with a decade of austerity and shite growth.
But yeah, surprisingly, actual countries, with their own foreign policy, own militaries, and own heads of state, and their own currencies, have a greater ability to make unilateral decisions than semi autonomous regions of said countries, which have no foreign policy, no foreign relations, no independent currency, no military, and not even entirely independent elections.
Lmao. That's adorable. Pulling out the facts and logic rhetoric after getting wrecked by several layers of reasoning in my first post. Careful you don't fall in the toilet ya tiny assed Shapiro wannabe.
Generally speaking, states arenâ€™t allowed to unilaterally seceded. The Americans famously had a bit of a war about it.
