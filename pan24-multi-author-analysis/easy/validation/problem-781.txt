If you were the leader of a country and losing a war mean your country would collapse. What line wouldn’t you cross? What button wouldn’t you push? I don’t think Ukraine can military beat Russia but if they can they won’t live to see the results of their sacrifices. That seems to be pretty obvious for anyone with a brain. Russia will nuke that place if they lose.
Comparing Napoleon to Putin is also a huge disservice to Napoleon because Napoleon was an intellectual man who was genuinely interested in knowledge for its own sake (even before becoming First Consul of France he was admitted as a member of the French Academy of Sciences; he also considered it important to bring teams of scholars with him on his Egyptian expedition - they ended up discovering the Rosetta Stone), a reform minded man who emancipated the Jews, abolished surfdom in the areas he conquered and oversaw the creation of the Napoleonic Law Code (which survives in many countries to this day - in fact Napoleon once expressed the wish that he be remembered for the creation of his Code rather than his military victories), and a much more rational and personable man who could actually take criticism from friends and listened to others' advice even if he didn't always follow it (Putin meanwhile surrounds himself with only yes man and no one dares oppose him).
