Now, this may be just where we live (Queensland), so grain of salt and all that, but the culture here goes to bed earlier. Like restaurants are open 'late' means 9pm. Translation: they're pushing u out the door and locking up at 8.30pm. But...most blue collar jobs here start around 5-6am, and are done by 2pm, but they're also in bed by 8pm. Because of Queensland's proximity to the equator, sun can be up at 4.30am in the summer. We bought black-out curtains almost immediately.
Do you blame them? I don't. America as a country is getting terrible every year, fueled by extreme polarization and division. I'm Malaysian and I feel very apathetic towards my own government. Because why should I care? What difference does it make when our lives (us Malaysians) are still going to be divided and unequal anyway. I vote for the first time this year (again, in Malaysia) and I honestly don't care who won. Us Muslims get shit either way.
