The PiS just tries to distract from their own problems and their issues with tje EU (especially since Germany criticized their law-reforms).
Generally yes, but in case of Poland it has nothing to do with geo-politics - the PiS just tries to distract from domestic problems, even though they get a shitload of Money from Germany through the EU already. Their nationalistic voters love when they use Germany as a punching bag. But there is no substance to it and no one in Germany takes it seriously.
Net contributions don't really matter, %GDP contributions matter. Do you have those numbers, just curious. It'd be like arguing that the USA is putting its fair share into NATO if it cut its contributions by 1000%. It'd still be putting in more than poorer nations. But the actual amount isn't what matters... it's the amount vs gdp. Obviously Iceland isn't going to put in as much as Germany, but by only looking at total amounts, you are overlooking that vital part of it.
Polish victim and inferiority complex. Someone wronged them 80 years ago and ever since, Nationalists are milking that for votes.
