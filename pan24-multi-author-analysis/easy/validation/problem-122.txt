And here the answer is no - not as a nation. It is said there were no official Polish institutions (like governmental bodies), which supported Germans (in particular in antisemitic activities), that Polish (underground) institutions persecuted a collaboration with Germans in that regard (known as szmalcownicy), and while some Poles were responsible for such crimes- still they were crimes, and there are also numerous examples of completely different approach (like e.g. Irena Sendler).
Imperial Japan should repesent a very different warning; the horror of unaccountability, a refusal to take responsibility at any point, and how it just ends you up in the exact same horror show except no one wants to admit they got there because everyone who could have done something about it shirked the responsibility until it was too late.
You are right. In Poland we often remember the good, tolerant parts of our history, but we get very defensive when antisemitism, pogroms are mentioned.
I do agree that pre-war Poland could have done more to combat antisemitism, to foster integration. But I also don''t believe that any kind of policy would stop the industrial genocide brought by Germans.
