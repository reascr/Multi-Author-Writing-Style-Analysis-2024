Might not be worth it to replace your hot plate mid-remodel, but when it comes to single-burner 120v portables, the NuWave units which let you specify the temperature make dealing with oil a lot easier. Results in fantastically consistent frying.
And you can't light them in the event of an outage. I live in Texas. I insisted on a gas stove instead of electric because we get hurricanes- and no, the pressure in the pipes doesn't last forever when there's no electricitt to run the pumps to keep it up, but it's better than an electric stove that is functionally kaput as soon as you lose power.
Yes. You get pretty much instant heat from the induction stoves too, and temperature control is reproducible across different pots and pans in a way that's a lot tougher with gas stoves.
I prefer the experience on the newer induction stoves to gas. You get really good temperature control for frying, rapid heat adjustments, and the ability to get your pot up to temperature incredibly quickly. It's just a better experience, even when you don't include not having to breathe the fumes.
