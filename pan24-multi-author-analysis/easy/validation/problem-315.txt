DeSantis? He held a special session to deal with the insurance crisis and instead of dealing with that issue, he turned on Disney and stripped them of self governance and their special tax status. This immediately put a huge debt on the back of local municipalities and will degrade public services in areas where Disney operates and used to provide said services. And he did it because he disagreed with their stated support of LGBTQ people, which just so happens to be a flagrant violation of the first amendment-- using government power to punish someone for their political speech.
