It might just be his undoing. Not popular means he is of no value to the Republicans and might even spur them to (privately) see indictment as a way to get rid of him. Not popular means he may not find running as an independent feasible (outside of his maga morons, who is going to fund his run? Put gas in his private jet?) eliminating the risk to the GOP. Not popular means the DOJ can take off the kid gloves w/o the fear of mass rioting and unrest. Heâ€™s one bread breaking moment with degenerates and Nazis away from being irrelevant. Please make it so ðŸ™Œ.

Terrible headline. Of course the party is done with the useful idiot. They got their Supreme Court and totally unnecessary tax scam while he occupied the White House. Heâ€™s an inept politician. Everything he touches dies. His base will vote for him and anyone like him who isnâ€™t as ignorant, like DeSantis, Cotton, Hawley, etc., they love the bigotry and intolerance he legitimized.
