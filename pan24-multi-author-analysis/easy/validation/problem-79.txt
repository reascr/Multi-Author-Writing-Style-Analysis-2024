Citation needed. While I'd read a lot of "doctors _could_ refuse you as a patient" in the context of non-emergency care, I never saw any examples of doctors actually doing that. I've really only seen that documented in practice for transplant recipients. Because there's lots of people who need transplants and if you aren't willing to do what all current medical science supports as decreasing your risk of infection/increasing your chance of survival, they'll pass that organ on to someone who is willing to take care of it. And that seems entirely fair.
This process could definitely use some reform, but then again, I'd rather see a French style, national healthcare system in the US, where the government provides the financial backing for healthcare and insurance companies transition into regional points of adjudication and contact, working according to unified, government guidelines, where profit isn't the motivation for healthcare.
. High level takewaway: "Government-sponsored plans, like Canada’s, are frequently publicly-portrayed as limiting choice. However, there is clear evidence that for Canada’s health care system, less choice in insurance coverage (although guaranteed), has not resulted in less choice of hospitals, physicians, and diagnostic testing and treatments compared to the U.S. In fact, there is arguably more.".
Ok, so I work for a nonprofit company, so there maybe bias there, but the concerns with fraud are often due to statistical observations that can come about from either a specific treatment being historically abused or from a provider tripping a few triggers where it seems like they're constantly prescribing/pushing for something that may not be statistically common, for the overall population.
Jesus Christ dude. You think obesity in the US is why single payer wouldn’t work? Really grasping at straws here.
