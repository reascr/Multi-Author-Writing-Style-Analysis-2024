In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
So did I. You see, there was very little actual violence given the extremely large scope of the protests. And BLM protesters were deliberately being provoked by "law enforcement" and beaten and gassed and detained en masse and kidnapped off the street. And it is all on video.
It's definitely proof, though, that we need updated standards of communication regulations and laws regarding data harvesting. And perhaps tempering everyone's expectation they must respond immediately every time.
I spent 3 hours at work "researching" those lies. If you don't spend as much time or more on your response, (and it had better be 6 inches!) it proves you're wrong.
