fellow restaurant-worker-turned-IT here. On top of everything you've mentioned, I was a tipped employee so I don't even know how paid sick leave would have worked. Would they just pay me the average for that day? There's no way any restaurant would want to pay someone who stayed home from their own coffers, if you call out then they just call someone else in and the tips go to them.
Exactly! I was a food prep worker at a fast food restaurant, so I was one of the first to show up. I tried calling in sick, was told it was "unacceptable" and that I had to come in anyway. I later got fired for working too slowly, because I was sick. That same place made me push the issue when I noticed the 'fresh' chicken had a smell and had a weird, blue color. They didn't accept that it was bad until I told them a third time and refused to prep with it anymore. They still cooked and sold the stuff I'd prepped before that. (I'm not saying which company it was, because every store has different management some try to do better for their staff/customers.).
