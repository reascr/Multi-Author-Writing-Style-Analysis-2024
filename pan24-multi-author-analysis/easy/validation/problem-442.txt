No. Just ban hurricanes. Take the liberal NOAA's maps with hurricane arrows pointing at Florida and use a sharpie to draw then going back to sea. Or Cuba or Mexico. Then drop a Nuke on them. Easy.

Honestly it's hilarious. He's legit massively ruined his states economy and they're fudging numbers. The entire event industry has basically pulled out of Florida and Disney's threats to leave are actually becoming real instead of bluster. They've lost hundreds of conferences, events, conventions, etc and more are pulling out every day. I'm two years the state will have basically no event economy at all which the state massively relies on for funding.
