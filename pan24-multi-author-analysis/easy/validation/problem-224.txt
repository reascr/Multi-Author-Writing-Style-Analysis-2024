If only people voting for the GOP actually saw how these priorities actually help them, it would be amazing. (Mainly because I want the Overton window to shift so we are more on par with other first world countries.).
A few years ago (2013-2014 I believe) a real life socio-political experiment began when Wisconsin went decidedly GOP under Scott Walker and his gerrymandered kabal in the legislature the same year Minnesota went decidedly Democratic with Dayton and bicameral Dem legislatures. Similar sizes, similar economic engines, similar climate -- side by side.

Edit: gerrymandering is legal under the constitution. Just canâ€™t do it based on race etc. if the GOP gerrymanders, the Democrats must also do it, or they will be unable to represent their constituents in an effective manner. This is how you end up with a democratic governor who is essentially worthless when a GOP veto proof legislative body controls a state. Reference NC as an example.
