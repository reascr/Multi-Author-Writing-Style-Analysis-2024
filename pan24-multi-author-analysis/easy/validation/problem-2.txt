The folks who don’t work in service need to understand how this would actually play out in practice. I work in a tasting room with about the same seating capacity as this restaurant. We have the option to collect payment info when we take reservations, and thus the option to charge no-shows, but it happens at our discretion. Slow Wednesday and a party of two doesn’t show up? Fine, Godspeed, you haven’t actually inconvenienced us. But a group of 8 no-shows on a Saturday? You bet your ass I’m charging you; I’ve had to turn away walk-ins because you agreed to show up at a time and now you’ve cost me that business. It can be a very case-by-case decision, and nobody should be condemning this restaurant for putting a system in place that allows them to recoup some losses.
Exactly. Scarcity isn’t conducive to calm. A restaurant controls the atmosphere just like they do the menu. It’s a huge part of the overall experience.
Once the chargeback is filed the merchant has a chance to respond and then the cardholder/issuer can respond back if the merchant did not accept it at which point the merchant has one last chance to accept it before it is sent to the credit card network for a final binding arbitration(the number of steps can vary by network but that's the general gist). There are significant fees incurred on both sides to end up doing this so the overwhelming majority of disputes are resolved before this.
