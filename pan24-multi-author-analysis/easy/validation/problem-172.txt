Looks like The Book Of Revelation to me. Everything from the mark of the beast to a new Jerusalem. The falling towers of Babylon and the 7 years of tribulation which we are currently in. 2020 to 2027. The Covid Years. The rising Dragon and Angels Trumpets.

I lost a home to a hurricane when I was a child. I was raised by just my mom. My lungs were shredded by black mold and didn't recover for years. We were donated a small camper while our new home was built. We relied on community and government, though more so on community, we only got $500 for immediate needs from the government. We had about a years supply of food stored up. We had a new home four months later. That's how my family rebuilt.
