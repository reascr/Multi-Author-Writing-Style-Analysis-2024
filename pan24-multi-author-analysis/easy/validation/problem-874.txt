Where was this when he said White Supremacists were very fine people? Where was this when he said Mexicans were rapists and murderers? Where was this when he tried to ban Muslims from entering the country? Shithole countries? Every single time Trump showed us his true colors Republicans circled the wagons around him and protected and defended and excused him. They should ALL go down when he flames out. Any one of them who voted not to impeach a cheater, liar and traitor. Any one of them who voted not to certify the election. Any one of them who couldn't stand up to joke of a "president" because they were afraid. Every. single. one.
