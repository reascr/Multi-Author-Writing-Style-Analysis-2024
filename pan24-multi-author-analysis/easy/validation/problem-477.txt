Russia did, and has made wiping out the Ukrainian people and their national identity a major cornerstone of their war.
You've already acted as an apologist for Russia and it's attempts to eradicate the Ukrainian nation. Don't pretend you care.
I never mentioned Afghanistan and you can try to convince yourself as much as you want that Iraq 2003 and Ukraine 2022 are not the same but at the end of the day, they were both illegal acts of aggression by a large country, against a smaller sovereign nation without international approval, against international law and the UN charter.
It's not quite that cut and dry. Trademarks don't automatically enter or remain in the public domain the way patents and copyrights do. In 1950, anyone could have used the ancient Greek term/persona "Nike" to advertise anything. Once the actual corporation Nike was formed and filed for the trademark for clothing, no one else could. Trademark law differs from country to country, but generally, the IOC would likely have a legal right to stop others from calling their events "The Olympic Games" without any kind of clarification.
