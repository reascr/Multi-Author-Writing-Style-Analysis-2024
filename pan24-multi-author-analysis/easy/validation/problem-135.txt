contentious confirmation process that included allegations of sexual assault. In 2019, it was reported that by order of the White House and Senate Republicans, the FBI limited its investigation into the accusations of Kavanaugh’s past sexual misconduct.
Not so. Every day Americans hear about and/or are affected by decisions of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, we now have a constant drip drip drip of reports about the current bench: Kavanaugh’s history of sexual abuse and rich white frat boy bullshit. Alito leaking decisions to supporters. Thomas’s wife fostering an insurrection but yet Thomas sitting on cases involving the same election. Barrett the inexperienced religious nut. Somehow the Chief Justice can’t figure who leaked the Dobbs decision. (I call BS.). Ergo, Americans no longer trust the Court. This already is not sustainable and the new documentary will likely push this court deeper into mud.
