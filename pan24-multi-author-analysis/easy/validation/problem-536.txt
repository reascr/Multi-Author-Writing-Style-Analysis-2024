Ha, you know the amount of times indian establishment regardless of their political ideology have been betrayed by Pakistan is astounding. First in 1999, the hindu nationalist BJP led NDA government started peace negotiations as lahore declaration, they started a bus route from India to Pakistan and PM vihari was among the first passenger and they signed the lahore declaration at the same time thousands of Pakistani troops were crossing over the border into india in himlayan mountains resulting in kargil war.
I am really an outsider so don't get mad. I think it is an empty statement because Pakistan is so fragmented and even under Taliban attack in some places. However,It is a remarkable statement but too late to prevent China from further fragmenting it and getting whatever raw mineral wealth it may have. If I were in India I might worry about having to negotiate with Mr. Xi Jinping about all things Pakistan. Khan will be the PM.
Kashmir's geopolitical position is invaluable. Pakistan Occupied Kashmir is what connects them to China, and the route China wants to use in the long term to circumvent the Indian Ocean and South China Sea choke points. If by same miracle India gains back those territories, it will connect them to Central Asia and open up all the historical land based trade routes to the Stans.
