Neural networks are created through evolution. To create a neural network you first design a tester basicly to see how good your algorithm is. Than you go on and randomly create 100s if not thousends of programs with the hardware available those are tested. let's say the best 5 than go on and are replicated again a fe thousend copy all with very slight adjustments all made randomly ofc. This goes on and on and on till the best version solves the test program to an adequate lvl. We now know the alogrythm works but since in the creation of said algorithm no human actully designed anything besides the test nobody know how the neural network solves the problems only that it does. This is why you can find that some AI is "racist" not because the creator was racist but because for randmess to solve the test the easiest way was to be "racist" the creator just didn't design the test well enouth.
