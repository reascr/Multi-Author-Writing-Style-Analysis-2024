From 2002 to 2003, the NYTimes, MSNBC, Faux, CNN, etc operated as stenographers for the Bush admin, bullhorning any propaganda that co-presidents Cheney-Bush wished. But there were many journalist who wouldn't compromise and got it right. Landay and Strobel from Knight Ridder reported actual facts about Iraq before George the stupid invaded. Giving the entire US a heads up to Cheney's ginned up intel & propaganda. The below article was written well before the invasion and is part of a series of about 25 articles that Landay and Strobel had written before the invasion.
To add veracity to the Downing Street Memo, the below article was written well before the invasion and is part of a series of about 25 articles that Landay and Strobel had written before the invasion. Bush/Cheney were ginning up the false intel to support a decision to invade. You might not have followed this back then, but I did closely. We all knew it was a complete bullshit invasion. The Brits did a post mortem (Iraq Inquiry aka the Chilcot Inquiry), check into that. The Chilcot Inquiry was scathing indictment of all involved and Blair did all but shite himself begging not to be prosecuted for war crimes.
