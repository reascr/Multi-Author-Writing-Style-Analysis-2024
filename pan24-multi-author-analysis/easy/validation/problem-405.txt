Sigh. Costs didn't go up by 10%. Supply went down. Prices go up by however big the demand for eggs vs the new supply is.
Interesting. I know Avian Flu can be devastating for supply as you basically have to kill all birds on the property if the virus is found, but according to this article no virus was found at producers in the US. There is no law against lying to the public to justify higher prices, but if you have multiple suppliers using the same lie then it seems like price fixing. Definitely, deserves investigation, and a severe crackdown.
So dumb. It's embarrassing really. This won't go anywhere. The price of eggs is up because of a flu, and if the price was artificially low (which is what these dolts want) you would not be able to find any eggs anywhere.
Eggs are expensive because of a flu, which reduced supply and because the price goes up as supply goes down so as to keep demand at a point where you can still buy any fucking eggs.
