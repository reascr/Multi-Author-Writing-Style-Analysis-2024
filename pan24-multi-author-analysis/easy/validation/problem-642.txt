Yeah who needs democracy or adherence to law or institutions. Certainly all of those highly funded and logistically difficult social programs and public works projects that Reddit expects from their governments will still be possible in a violent society where politics are dealt at the barrel of a gun. Itâ€™s not like humans have had thousands of years of civilization to develop the current systems as a correction of past mistakes. What could go wrong? Thanks Reddit!
Japanese people are known around the world to be hospitable to foreigners, they might hate us (its a known fact some Japaneses cant stand foreigners) but most of the time they will treat you ok, so, imagine this old lady, she seems harmless, she leads you, she makes you feel home, all you can think of is "Damn, this old lady is wasting her time helping my sorry ass", shes telling you how to properly cook your Yakiniku (Japanese BBQ), all of the sudden she asks the questions, what you do for living, are you X or Y faith oriented.
