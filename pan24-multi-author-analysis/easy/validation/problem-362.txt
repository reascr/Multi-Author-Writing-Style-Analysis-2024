extremely na√Øve of you to think that a common "distaste for US global dominance" is a trivial unifying factor amongst the BRICS nations. perhaps you didn't even read the article i linked above, nor the quote i pulled from that article that says "If accepted, the new proposed BRICS members would create an entity with a GDP 30% larger than the United States, over 50% of the global population and in control of 60% of global gas reserves." that is far from trivial and I hardly believe these nations would announce their application into BRICS publicly if they thought it was doomed to fail.
Certainly. Now, I wasn't born nor am I currently wealthy so I've already got a snowballs chance in hell. Next, I'd be fighting for consumer rights which means zero corporate support so I'm DOA. Would just be another random no name who submitted paperwork to run for President. The problem is those who want the power of the Presidency don't deserve it and those who could wield it responsibly don't want it. You need a Cincinnatus or equal statesman who would wield the executive branch for the true good of the people, country and mankind.
