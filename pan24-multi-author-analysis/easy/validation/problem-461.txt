That's completely incorrect and I work in this field. Denmark as a party to the Refugee Convention uses the five protected characteristics of refugees in its status determination, one of which is membership of a social group. In many refugee receiving countries, gender (like sexuality) has been considered a social group. This decision just allows gender to formally be used in the Danish determination. It's perfectly legal and not a human rights violation of Afghan men or of any other asylum seekers.
Sadly, sensationalism works. The 17k people who upvoted this probably believe the headline, and many will never learn it's wrong.
Borderline misinformation. Yes, all the girls and women who are already there. What of the men in their lives already there with them? Goodbye and good luck, please die fighting the Taliban or whatever. I guess if your country's birth rate is already significantly below 2, you'll take all the women you can get.
Reasonable headline? Top comments will be someone misunderstanding the study and attacking the methodology.
