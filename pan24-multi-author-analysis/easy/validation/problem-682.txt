Had Dems lost hard this cycle, it would show that the public wasn't in favor of them at all, which would mean an uphill battle to keep the White House even as the incumbent, and a very high chance of Republicans still maintaining the House and Senate (doesn't happen often, but not outside the realms of possibility).
The reason why it isn't just 'treading water' as you put it is because the next election cycle, assuming trends continue and there's no super unexpected shakeup and neither party entirely shoots it's own foot off doing something ridiculously stupid (and it's Democrats, there's always a chance of that happening any day of the week), Dems will be projected keep the Presidency as the incumbent, to retake the House by a decent margin and gain more seats in the Senate. Then in the follow up midterm they'll have seats to lose while still having an above average possibly of holding the trifecta.
