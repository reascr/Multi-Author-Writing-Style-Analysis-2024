I lived there (Parika) for a year in 2020 when Covid hit and just went down this summer. They are definitely more chill and not outright murderous concerning lgbt. Ofc a lot of people have aversions to it and I got told expressively I'm not supposed to walk around in a skirt (I'm a tall straight dude). But even so this summer I went to the creek and even saw an "auntyman" (derogatory Carribbean slang for trans people, sometimes gay people and drag queens) live there and allthough they got a lot of stares, nobody hassled them, nobody shouted at them and I didn't see any other aggression towards them. The country still has a lot of development to do but I figure unless you're in a religious cult (there are many of them). You're more or less ok as long as you don't draw too much attention. The laws just kinda make it a "don't ask don't tell" type of deal. But as always Guyana is just about the slowest out of all the Carribbean countries to change.
Different laws affect different people differently. Depending on how you define sex, gay sex is outlawed by making anal sex illegal.
