and you have Kevin McCarthy, my Kevin, and he's maybe doing an ok job. he's Speaker now, not a lot of people know that but it's true, and I came in, we're talking after Obama so you know it was bad, we had a Total and Complete Failure of the Democrats as usual because they can't Govern, they can't be Presidential, they said I'm the Most Amazing President probably that we've ever had. you look at Washinon, you look at Lincoln, I mean we're talking Andrew Jackson even has a run for his money ok, you could put them all together, add them all up, and they couldn't even come close to President Trump. I did more in 4 years than any Administration in History. don't forget, Day One, I was set up by Obama, he was Pretend Nice, you know what I'm talking about, and there were no more problems until Sleepy Joe decided to work with Obama and Crooked Hillary to steal the Election yet again. they Rigged it, we have it all on Tape, and we're gonna be going probably to the Highest Court In The Land, and we'll maybe get a Fair Shake, we'll see what happens.
