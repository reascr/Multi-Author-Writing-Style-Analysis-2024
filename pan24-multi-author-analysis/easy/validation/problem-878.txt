I was briefly coworkers with someone who had served as a mayor in a small town. He told me that winning elections was easy. You just find a problem, and hang it on the incumbent. He found a playground that was a little rundown and portrayed it as a dangerous deathtrap. Incumbent accuses him of exaggerating (which he was) then "You don't care about the safety of our kids!" Local news eats it up because they are desperate for a scandal. When the mayor decides to get the park fixed, coworker balked at the cost, and claimed it was graft. Another candidate proposed something cheaper, and was "cheaping out on our kids." He claims no one really pushed him on the inconsistency because he would just ignore questions and pivot to accusations, and hey, content is content to mediocre journalists. I asked him for his policy on theplayground and his actual words were "I didn't have one. Policy proposals are for suckers. They make you vulnerable. People will always find problems with them.".
