Something about the way Germany behaves now makes me upset. It's cowardly that modern Germans are so against supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons. The biggest bully of the 20th century now suddenly is ardently against weaponizing a nation that is struggling to survive. They act like they have a reason to be so against war. For once, Germany can thrive and be on the good side of history, but they seem so afraid. Like they're morality-bound to never be involved in war again. It's fine to be involved with war. Just don't fucking do what you all did throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Shit gets to me.
Meloni has been very open and vocal about providing weapons and support for Ukraine - despite her other politics, on Ukraine she’s been consistently solid since taking office and has pretty much locked step with the rest of NATO.
Sorry. Haven’t had any coffee yet this morning. Memories of German dithering and Macron spending all that time trying to get the diplomatic limelight got me a little salty.
