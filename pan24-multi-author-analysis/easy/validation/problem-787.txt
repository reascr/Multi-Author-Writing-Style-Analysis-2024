One of the most recent is a bill proposed in the Indiana legislature which would force teachers or administrators to notify parents if the student wants to change their “name, attire, pronoun, title, or word to identify the student in a manner that is inconsistent with the student’s biological sex at birth.” Similar bills have been pushed in other states like Arizona and New Hampshire.".
Chester Middlebrook-Pierce, a researcher who most famously helped create the foundations of Sesame Street, believed in a form of discrimination called childism, and believed that not including children as peers in discussions directly concerning them was one of the most prevalent and unaddressed forms of discrimination. So firstly, I'd say so much of the answer comes down to, 'who does the child feel safe telling this information to?' and sometimes, they're going to feel safe telling a teacher and not a parent, and if a teacher feels like a parent should know, they should make sure the child is aware because if they're being harmed at home, they may not speak up but they'll be the only ones that even have a chance of speaking up about it.
