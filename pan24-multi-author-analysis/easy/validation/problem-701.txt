You ignored the GSM part of my comment. You have alarm systems. They are hooked up to either phone or internet to maintain contact with the station, and to send alerts if an alarm gets triggered. Someone comes along with a chainsaw, and cuts the entire group of lines connecting your building to power, phone, and internet. Now they break in to each unit in the building. The alarms will sound but not be sent anywhere, except that one unit. They have a GSM backup connected to their alarm system. It sends an alarm alert via the cellular network. The base station works for many hours on battery, and you typically can't get to the GSM module without triggering a motion or contact. Thieves are arrested, caught in the act.
Global System for Mobile Communications AKA the 2G networks of your phone, that many countries use as the "backplane" of their mobile infra, its mature and reliable tech with widest availability so its kept up for phone calls and SMS as a last resort network.
Oh, I agree. But I would also expect that most museums would go on lock-down once alarms are triggered, with barriers, bars and such. We don't know enough details about this one yet.
