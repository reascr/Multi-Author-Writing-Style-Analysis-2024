In other circumstances, people like to talk about donor countries. This difference to the receiving countries leads to a break. This is happening now.
This includes associating Soviets with modern Russia, UN votes, vetos and speeches, arms sales, seeing Russia as a successful and honest country, and being completely forgiving of all and any Russian steps against Indian interests (big one is their massive relationship with China, but also them restricting foreign investment from India and others and cancelling arms sales).
They do not. There's respect for the fact that Russia has been more reliable over the decades, but no one is in love with the country. People do not go about discussing Russia, what a great country they are, consuming their media etc. Heck, no one ever even thinks about them and their cultural exports to India are basically nonexistent. I'm from India, so I think I have a pretty good idea of how people feel about this. Again, it's not about the love for Russia, it's more about skepticism of the west due to past actions and what is seen as condescending attitudes of the west.
