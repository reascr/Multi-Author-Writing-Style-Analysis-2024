Yeah remember that one young athlete which was under sweedish or finland flag and after he won medal he presented Z symbol and praised the war or shit like that? Fuck'em.
I think, if we let North Korea compete, which is basically a pseudo less developped 1984 state, China who is actively conducting a genocide, Russia was fine after invading Georgia and bombing Kurds and other innocent civilians in Syria, the US didn't get any reprimand from the IOC after invading Iraq and Afghanistan, then holy shit let's not make the russian people unable to participate in international events, how can that do anything but spark a renaissance of soviet era hatred towards the west and even more far right movements to take off?
Meh, I don't know what to make of this. You would hope that the state sponsored drug cheating and match fixing would have gotten them banned (stuff that directly impacts the competition). But no, now there's a war that has the eyes of all the first world countries on it and they're probably going to get banned. I'm not saying they shouldn't be banned but the hypocrisy of the IOC is too much to take anymore. Maybe it's time to just drop the olympics entirely and people can watch what they want to watch.
