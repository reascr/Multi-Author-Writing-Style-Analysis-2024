Obama here is just a commonly known example of Western (very loose definition here, i know) politician, nothing to do with Obama himself. An external scapegoat, basically.
They still do. It is a shadow of former self, but Russia still hosts talented people I admire. I stopped reading anything Russian because I don’t want to give money to this regime, used to buy tons of ebooks from their online stores. This war sucks on so many levels.
Before they invaded Ukraine they were spreading the propaganda that Nazi Ukraine was killing Russians and Russian culture (true, there are extremism and corruption in Ukraine - but if this could be considered a valid excuse to attack a country, Russia would have been eliminated a long time ago), Ukraine is an artificial state etc.
I agree. I spent my college years studying Russian language, history and literature. And as a listener of classical music, am enamored with some if it’s composers. And I believe that iconography is a beautiful sacred art form. Even some of its architecture is a fascinating study.
