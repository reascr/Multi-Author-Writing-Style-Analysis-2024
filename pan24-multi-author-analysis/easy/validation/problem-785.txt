Not the same commenter, but I'd explain it as; hypocrisy isn't illegal, so getting Democrats upset when they don't have the power to stop it, makes them seem weak. (In authoritarian minds).
In fact, most airlines not named Southwest performed pretty well over Christmas. As I mentioned previously in this thread on the day Southwest had 70% cancellations, American Airlines was at 0% and United was at 1%.
On a day when Southwest had 70% cancellations, American Airlines was at 0% and United was at 1%. So most of the industry handled the disruption well with minimal unnecessary delays or cancellations. Southwest was the one exception. I doubt very much a fine imposed even his first day on the job would have prevented the SWA management meltdown this Christmas. But if they don't issue refunds and/or pay for meals, hotels for this meltdown he will then be able to fine them for that.
