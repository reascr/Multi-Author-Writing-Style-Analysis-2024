Great! If USA wants to sit down with China and make up new rules for the rest of the world I think China would have preferred that.
The only acceptable option is smaller, and exclusively meteorological. They're trying to claim they fit into an exception that doesn't apply to them.

The international agreement is that small (I believe <5lb) exclusively meteorological (China said this was 'primarily' meteorological) balloons don't violate sovereignty. But countries are still supposed to inform countries their balloons will fly over (China didn't).
It's worth pointing out China is upset about American surveillance balloons they've alleged (without evidence) are over their sovereign airspace. They're simultaneously trying to claim their surveillance balloon is acceptable, but nobody else's is.
