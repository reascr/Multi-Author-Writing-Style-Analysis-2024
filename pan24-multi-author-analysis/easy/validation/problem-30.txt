After the Roe leak, they told everyone to calm down, this is a states rights issue, nobody was going to try to ban abortion nationality.
It's complicated. I don't know his dad, but I do know people that I consider to be intelligent that got sucked into the propaganda machine. The "news" organizations that purport to inform them actually just lie to them and tell them scary stories about "the others" (basically anybody that's not a straight, white, conservative, natural-born citizen). After listening to nothing but lies and fear-mongering for years, these people have no real data left to make intelligent decisions. It's all bullshit that was specifically manufactured to control them. As long as they choose to stay in the right-wing propaganda bubble, they will stay this way. This is why the right-wing propaganda machine has demonized every other source of information. You can't listen to CNN, MSNBC, or NPR because they're the "mainstream liberal media" and they lie to you. You have to stay here and listen to Tucker because he tells it like it is. So, they're trapped by the fear and ignorance that was planted in them by the people they trusted to inform them. This isn't even touching on things like their social media presence or how they've taken over churches.
