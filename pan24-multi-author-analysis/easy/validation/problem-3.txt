This is all theater for Russian watchers. Doesn't matter how subhuman the speaker is, doesn't matter how improbable the outcome. The worst thing you can be in a Stalinist Dictatorship is weak, the second thing is disloyal. Its the same in the ccp too.
Also, if the Russian army is fully crippled in Ukraine by the West, then they would be open to retaliation from eastern european countries that would want revenge for the Soviet times, and put Russia through a century of humiliation. Russia should remember how Europeans are like when dealing with a weakened nation, since they did it to China last time.
Also, this is shaping up to be Russia's century of humiliation. I think the PRC remembers what happened in their history, and is taking pity on Russians right now. And besides, the last time Russia was getting their asses kicked in a war in Europe, with their economy destroyed, they turned to communism, so why would the CPC want to stop that?
so.. Russia right now is threatening UK, France, US, other NATO nations with nuclear destruction.. I'm fairly certain there are large groups of Chinese nationalists that would celebrate those countries suffering.
