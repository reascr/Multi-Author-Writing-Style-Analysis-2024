In the US, the Proud Boys would be way more terrifying if they all lived within a 5 hour drive from another, rather than nearly 50. And also pointing out that If the Germany had same proportion of fascists as the US does it would be a very scary situation due to vicinity.
I was mostly trying to convey that most would think Germany would be one of the last places for far right ideologies to begin to thrive again during this fascist wave. I never said The US didn’t have fascists, we’ve arguably got more than any other country proportionally - i was simply stating the fact that physically smaller, mostly landlocked countries are easier for extremist groups to organize quickly, which makes them scarier.

Actually the perfect comparison. The US have a death sentence for murder yet müder rates are extremely high. It simply doesn’t work this way. If someone wants to kill someone he’ll do it either way and if someone wants to get a gun he’ll try to get it either way too.
