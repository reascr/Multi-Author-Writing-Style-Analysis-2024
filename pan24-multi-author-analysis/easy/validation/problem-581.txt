As an “exchange”, FTX is allowed to offer relatively risky instruments to investors vs. what a bank could offer, but unlike a bank, is not allowed to then leverage investor funds to make loans, etc, and generate income. So unlike a bank, they’re SUPPOSED to maintain a 1:1 ratio of assets on hand to assets invested, to prevent exactly this sort of “run” from occurring. Whereas Wells Fargo for example can loan out people’s money and therefore have less than 100% of the value of assets invested actually on hand at any given time - this is because the FDIC insures those assets to reduce the impact on individual investors if there is a run on the bank.
Bull runs always have crazy shenanigans. There’s always too much money going around, and any lack of spending for advertising causes you to make less. The issue is people never know when the bull run is going to end but, it’s usually always around the time everyone knows it’s happening which means the general population always sees financial stuff as “a waste of money” because by the time they’ve seen it… it is just a waste of money. It’s ironic.
Ultimately, this means that 1) the crypto hedge fund likely does not actually have the necessary assets to act as collateral on their loans, and 2) the exchange doesn’t have enough funds on hand to make investors whole in the event of a run - which was what happened when the news leaked, and people have now just lost most of whatever they had in FTX.
