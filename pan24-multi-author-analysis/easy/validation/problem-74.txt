So you’re in favor of companies going beyond overboard with censorship? Because there only two possible outcomes with section 230 being removed: either absolutely no censorship, since section 230 stipulates companies must attempt in good faith to remove unfavorable let alone all unlawful content, and the consequences of such an approach to the internet, or the worst of the outcomes, which is censorship many times worse than what people complain about now in an attempt to stifle any possible legal complaints against companies. And yes companies who only care about their bottom line will go to places we cannot imagine to protect their bottom line. Everyone will be affected negatively from the demise of section 230: from liberals to conservatives, from pro worker to pro corporations, from minority advocates to traditionalists, to anyone who even posts one thing that can be taken as “controversial” by the person receiving such content regardless of the intent behind a post. Frivolous lawsuits will rise with the ruling against section 230, since America is the land where theoretically anyone can sue for pretty much anything. The internet as we know and love may likely die if section 230 goes away.
