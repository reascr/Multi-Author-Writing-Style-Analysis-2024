What does the EU benefit from sanctioning China over Xinjiang though? Europe isn’t Turkic so its not ethnic kinship, and the Uyghurs don’t really have anything to give Europe that China can’t already give. Sure antagonism can benefit American hegemony but thats not exactly European hegemony. Honestly this whole thing feels like a moralism.
Discussion on the deal was halted by the European Parliament in May 2021 after Beijing imposed sanctions on European individuals and entities in retaliation for similar EU action over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, accusations that Beijing denies.
