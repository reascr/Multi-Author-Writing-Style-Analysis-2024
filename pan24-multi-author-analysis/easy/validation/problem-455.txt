They're obviously great vehicles and will be put to good use but calling a Bradley a tank killer is laughable. If it's such a tank killer then why do we even have abrams (actual tanks)? they have an auto cannon which will do great work vs the older tank variants the Russians are using but won't do much against modern armor without a bit of luck. They do have missiles but they aren't much more of a tank killer than an nlaw or javeline so it's funny to single the bradley out. I get it's optics though so whatever.
It was mostly about how projects just kept rolling along over budget, the people in charge of them said everything was hunky dory, there were no real consequences for people who were in charge of these floundering projects as long as they stayed in the good old boys club, and there was a revolving door post career between the people in the Pentagon and companies negotiating for contracts.
