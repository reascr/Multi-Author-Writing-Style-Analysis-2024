Also fair: I just learned that while they were affiliated, the Fenian Brotherhood that operated in Canada was actually founded in North America. So maybe the ones in Ireland weren't that bad. But the ones that were here? Fuck 'em.
Now I haven't heard that story, but I assume becasue of my passing familiarity with how they message that kind of stuff that it's probably one that seemingly came out of nowhere, and then they run a segment on it in each of the talking head primetime shows in order with each host giving their own unique take on it. Maybe it's like "woke-ism destroying America" or that kind of a spin on it. So in one night, if you watch straight through you get to hear from three separate people three times in a sarcastic, know-it-all tone how its so terrible and awful, and scary. Oh yeah, BE SCARED. Becasue this meaningless thing that happened is evidence that BIG SCARY THING is also happening, and it's probably those Libruls who are doing it. Then if you watch over the next week or even two weeks they may do recurring follow segments like this, following up on the "situation." The repetition is the key here as part of a strategy designed to make viewers outraged about it over time.
