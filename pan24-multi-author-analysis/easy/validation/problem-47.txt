Regarding intervention: in a globalized world there's not a single dictatorship that can be toppled without the tacit agreement and support of other countries. That was true for the apartheid regime as it is true now. This is because power is not a national phenomenon anymore: every country participates in granting or denying another power and legitimacy. What the opposition council advocates for is not direct military intervention, but assistance in denying IR this legitimacy on the world stage. Things like: 1) better enforcement of sanctions and punishing people who help IR circumvent them, 2) blacklisting the IRGC, 3) expelling diplomats and walking out of the room when their officials get to speak on the world stage such as the upcoming UNHRC meeting. This must be joined by support such as 1) finding ways to grant internet access (without it the revolution is doomed to fail), 2) use frozen assets of the regime to finance strikes (they cannot strike without money). These are just a few actions and there is no neutral stance in this. A neutral stance in the war in Ukraine in practice would imply a tacit support of Russia. When it comes to toppling IR it's the same.
The only way I could see it working was if the Shah was completely separated from the mechanisms of power, akin to the King of Great Britain (god, it's still weird to type out King as opposed to Queen), where power is more of a formality than function and it resides exclusively with Parliament and the Prime Minister's Office.
Sorry, but they just don't need to. He brings too much luggage that Iran can't afford to deal with. As much as they hate the current system they won't tolerate royalty either.
