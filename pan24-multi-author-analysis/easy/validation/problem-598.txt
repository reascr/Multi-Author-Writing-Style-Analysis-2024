In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. Hilarious. These midwesterners living around me love Desantis and can’t stop talking about voting for him. I ask them if they follow Florida politics and they don’t. I ask if he has actually said he is running and they don’t know. They are all in on Desantis because Fox News has told them to be. They can’t tell you one thing about him. He won’t need charisma or policy or anything to win over the Trump crowd. They will March right in line.

Exactly. This act is a bridge too far ..... unless Trump is the nominee. Well then they'll ruthlessly support him. There's no moral stand these people will take when power is at stake.
Secular Jews are overwhelmingly Democrat and/or progressive, but there are striations in every surface; Republican non-religious Jews definitely exist, including Trump supporters. Many secular Jews are supporters of Israel, but that support has different expressions for different people; there's J Street and there's AIPAC. Big ticket two-party politics tends to murder nuance, but plenty of Jews (religious and secular) support Israel and Palestine and just want to create a peaceful solution.
