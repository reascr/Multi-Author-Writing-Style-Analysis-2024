In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I don't know if I buy that. Desantis is less caustic, but also less charismatic. I don't see him being able to generate the same energy.

Trump never had the authority to declassify documents related to nuclear secrets, definitely doesn't have any authority to declassify anything since Biden was sworn in, and it is beyond question that the documents are classified, because neither Trump nor anyone else declassified them. Whether any document is classified is cut and dry, and only idiots and liars believe Trump could have secretly "declassified them by thinking about it". Trump also doesn't have to share the documents with anyone for it to be a crime, as multiple experts have attested.
