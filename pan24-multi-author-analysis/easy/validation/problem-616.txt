Except Fettermen has been up front about going to therapy to correct it, and it has not impaired his thinking. Have you known anyone who has had a stroke, especially a non elderly person? Speech impediments are normal and generally fixable. It is something Ive seen and dealt with in my own family, including one sister that had her first stroke at the age of 28 (currently shows no signs of a previous stroke, despite having at least 5 known large events. Only remaining physical symptoms is she apparently has a black dot in her vision of her left eye. Speech and vision previously severely affected). That people justify Hershel and demonize Fettermen for a physical, explained, treated issue that does not impair his thinking skill is exactly the lack of critical thinking and comprehension I am talking about.
Trump got the EC in 2016, he won. I'm not denying that. Hillary won the popular vote... that is also undeniable.
