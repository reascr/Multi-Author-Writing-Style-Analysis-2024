Also if the west was afraid of a conflict with russia why the fuck joining the conflict in all but declaration of war in the First Place? Theres many ways they could punish russia without causing nuclear war, in all likehood a few dead farmers Is not enough reason to declare war anyway or consider It an open Attack, its very obviously a mistake whoever committed It, nato would not have invoke article 5 even if It was actually a Russian missile and Who thinks otherwise Is a Little bit out of their minds.
Yes dude, they did. They immediately claimed it was a Russian attack and it took less then several hours for the west to conclude that it wasn't because they literally have all the military and spy tech in Europe and from satellites watching this war 24/7.
1 - I'm not a bot. Just a person that use their own head. 2 - I agree in your point of the shopkeeper, but I don't see what is the connection with this incident. 3 - We had a missile strike in Poland that isn't in war. Two people died, and the final statement is "bad luck". 4 - And from my understanding of the final conclusion is that is all ok and the polands need to take it and comprehend that "bad things happen".
The "good" thing is that the people of Poland have nothing to worry about from now on. If they have another hit by a rogue missile is just bad luck and bad aiming from the Ukrainians.
