Honestly, it's probably a little from column A, a little from column B. Most diplomacy is, doubly so when there's a war involved. That's the nature of understanding time, and the fact that you not only want to stop this current threat, but do your best to minimize all future threats. The jury is out on what will bring Russia into normalized relations with the West, if anything, and how long it'll take, but that's the ultimate goal.
Obviously. Anyone who has even the slightest idea of how the polish government operates knows this. The only people who are ignorant are either Americans or Russian shills.
Really. There were some voices that NATO has to do such things unanimously, apparently it wasn't US opinion. Also US is a natural leader of NATO and country geographically far from this conflict. For US to do something like that would be a much easier thing than for Poland, considering both NATO (for example countries like Germany or France would have harder time to protest against that. Remember it was weeks after start of war, some coutries were only sending protective equipment or defensive weapons) and Russia.
