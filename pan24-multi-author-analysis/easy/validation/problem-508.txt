Incorrect. While I agree with you that shutting down that strike was wrong, this incident wouldn’t have been prevented with increased sick leave. It happened because the rail companies are using fewer workers and longer, less adequately manned trains. The strike didn’t address that issue, it addressed a symptom of it. It wouldn’t have stopped rail companies from running the trains the way they do.

For Republicans the derailment was ideologically incorrect. Private business is good, regulation is bad. Events which expose their ideology as false or grossly incomplete are intolerable, they have to be eliminated. Hence the conversion story.
