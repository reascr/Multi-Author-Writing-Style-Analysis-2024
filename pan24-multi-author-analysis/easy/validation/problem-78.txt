And thanks to this extensive field testing, we now know that our weapons can easily kick the shit out of Russian forces. Thank you for your contribution, comrade Putin.
Absolutely not. Trump would have totally distanced the US as far away from it as possible while threating to pull out of NATO if they assisted (which he did already talked about prior...) and thus allowing Russia to walk in as planned.
Exactly. For context we did the same for Iraq post-invasion and Syrian rebels.. and they squandered it for years. Granted, it’s a completely different type of war.. but the methods of assistance are pretty similar.
A given not necessarily, a possibility absolutely. That’s why NATO needs to be very clear to Russia on what their response to a nuclear attack would be and that it would not be tolerated.
If Russia uses nuclear weapons that’s it. One nuke launches and there will be a dozen in response. Of course Russia wouldn’t take that lying down either and regardless of the incompetence of their military I refuse to be liege we know every launch site they have and even if we did I refuse to believe we have the capability to hit them all before launches occur. Even if we did the nuclear response from NATO would likely cause enough damage and fallout to push us into a miniature nuclear winter and then we’ve got a lot more problems than we did before.
The problem is the fallout from even a small nuclear detonation in Ukraine could very easily hit NATO country’s and at that point Russia has used a Nuke against NATO even if indirectly. People don’t realize how tightly packed many of the country’s in Europe are. Ukraine is not a particularly large country, and because of its shape there aren’t many areas in Ukraine that are terribly far from a NATO border. Even less points within Ukraine that aren’t close to a NATO border would be worth hitting with a nuclear strike. The most likely use of nuclear weapons from Russia would be a small tactical nuke. But tactical nukes can be as large as 100 kilotons. For context the Chernobyl event was equivalent to 0.3 kilotons and the exclusion zone for that covers 2,600 km^2 ……..
