It's kinda sad how this turned from our last ray of hope to get Maduro out to... well, nothing at all.
"foreign sanctions 'constitute violations of international law' and have exacerbated Venezuela’s economic crisis with 'ineffective and insufficient' carve-outs for humanitarian issues.".
Chavez’s management of the Venezuelan economy led to an over dependence on oil exports, which was fine while the value of oil remained high; but in the 2008 recession, demand for Venezuelan oil from China fell by a lot, meaning the value fell too, sending the economy into a slowdown. The long term impact of this was that the Venezuelan economy was already slowing down before the US embargo even happened.
For me I think the cause of the economic crisis is a mix between the long term effects of Chavez’s economic policies, but also because of the short term effects of the US embargo.
One could say that Chavez’s policies had already weakened the Venezuelan economy a lot, but the US embargo was the event that was the trigger for the current catastrophe. After the embargo the Venezuelan economy nearly tanked, and its GDP fell by around a third in only a year. Lifting the US embargo would lead to the best outcome for not only Venezuela, as it would allow oil exports to resume and drive economic growth, but also it would be preferable to the US, since the US needs to replace their Russian oil and gas with something else.
