Has the US ever exerted its authority over the Prime Minister or similar of a ruling authoritarian regime for a lawsuit, civil or criminal, for a crime that happened in their own jurisdiction?
You've lost me. I gave you a solid example in the last comment. If you're still not convinced the president has the power to not enforce a US law, then that's on you. Doesn't make it any less of a fact.
Can you show me any example where the President unilaterally decided to extend such a non-presidential power into not just another country, but into the consulate of another country within yet another country?
Examples of a US President picking and choosing which federal laws to enforce within the US, where there's some actual notion of federal or executive jurisdiction, don't really apply well to an entirely different country.
Missing the point here guy. Used to be legal to beat your wife in the US, but didn't make it right. The fact that they are hiding behind legalese without making a stand against this extreme barbarism is why this feels icky.
