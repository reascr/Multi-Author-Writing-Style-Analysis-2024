The story is kinda murky. Some rumors claiming his family was threatened in Russia. Others claiming it's because he was sent to infiltrate the Freedom for Russia Legion. Others claiming it's simply that Ukraine couldn't trust someone who was sentenced for murder for so long a sentence. Others saying that it's because the number of PoWs Wagner was willing to trade for him was too enticing. Etc.
Is the blademissile similarly physically gruesome? Sure, but "killing your own troops to terrorize any others that don't want to fight" is horrific and "assassinating an enemy leader, and going out of your way to use a blade missile that presumably has lower odds of success than a bomb but will minimize civilian casualties" is relatively humane as far as war things go.
So what? The Ukrainian ends up getting mistreated and possibly tortured as a POW while a person, who may or may not be totally honest, and who is a convicted criminal for serious crimes is relatively free.
QUICK! How much would the range of himars rockets increase if the warhead was replaced with bottles of vodka with parachutes?
