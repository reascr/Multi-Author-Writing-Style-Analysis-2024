I know you mean well, but the whole "Apartheid state" thing is part of the problem. It erases the actual problem (policies of the Israeli government that harm Palestinians) and replaces it with a national identity. Criticizing Israel's policies acknowledges that they can and should be changed. But if Israel is an Apartheid state, it cannot change while remaining Israeli; that's simply what it is. In other words, you have no recourse but to destroy the state. Which, oddly, also mirrors what the Israeli far-right claims (that they can't make the reforms necessary to ensure the Palestinians' peace and security because it would constitute national suicide) AND what Hamas claims (that they will not accept any outcome other than Israel's total destruction). It also erases the possibility of a two-state solution, wherein Palestinians have a state that is uniquely theirs, because in the Apartheid analogy, Apartheid was dismantled by creating a unitary south African state. But the historical context there was completely different (I could list the reasons but this is getting long-winded already); suffice it to say that it's a very round peg in a very square hole.
