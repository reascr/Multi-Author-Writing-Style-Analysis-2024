Belarus and many nearby countries are giving troops and loyalty to putin in exchange for heat (gas/oil). They need heat. If Hungary signs a gas deal with Russia (high likelihood?), Ukraine will be surrounded. The troops from the other gas signee countries will be in the hundreds of thousands.This means Ukraine has to defend all other border areas in addition to their current goals. Russia and those troops can overrun Ukraine by February. China is providing tons (in 50 ton loads) of winter gear to Russia. N. Korea is sending arms and troops. So, Ukraine will immediately need more guns, ammo, tanks, winter gear, and troops than expected. Don't forget to protect the waterfront and Moldova from Black Sea subs and ship attacks. putin won't squander this unique opportunity. Kick putin.
Edit: if by not integrated you mean that the US has not officially recognized them as part of their military then yes you're right, but they regularly take military contracts from the United States so it's more semantics than anything. The first sentence on their Wikipedia page about Iraq is "blackwater played a substantial role in the Iraq war as a contractor for the United States military".
