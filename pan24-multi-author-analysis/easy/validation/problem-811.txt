We may never know. Russian state media has publicly called for genocide in Ukraine and the elimination of their countries existence. In actions, beyond their illegal invasion and the death and destruction that has incurred, they have forcibly relocated over a million Ukrainians to Russia, including some 250,000 children and have started removing any books referencing Ukraine in Russian occupied territory, all of which is clearly genocide. Who knows how far he would have gone or what other atrocities he would have visited upon the people of Ukraine had they not stood up and decimated his invasion force making the world take note. It's not like Russia hasn't been responsible for the deaths of millions of Ukrainians in the past... Putin could very well have become the latest Russian tyrant to rival Hitler or Stalin even. Remember the Holodomor genocide!
