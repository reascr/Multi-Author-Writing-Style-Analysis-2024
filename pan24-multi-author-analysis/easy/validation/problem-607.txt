Kroger employs 465,000 people. If they do this to everyone of them every year they can save about $70million a year which they then can use for executive bonuses, stock buybacks, political contributions, and to pay their legal team so they never get in trouble and can keep doing it.
worked for kroger for around 6 months. probably the worst job I ever had. not bc the job itself was terrible but bc management insisted on making things terrible. also, they promised special sick-pay for anyone who got covid but didn't actually give it to myself and others. but really the worst part was management being complete dickbags.
