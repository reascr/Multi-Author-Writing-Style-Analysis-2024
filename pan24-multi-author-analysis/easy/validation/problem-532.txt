If people had any idea how much money, time, and effort was spent to win that margin it would blow their minds. It took a 24/7 anti-Democrat propaganda network to pull it off, there are whole books written about the people Hillary Clinton has personally killed, the Russians had to hack her emails and Wikileaks had to misrepresent them to the public, if Donald Trump hadn't been a (shamefully popular) reality TV show start it might have made all the difference, like, it took a fuck ton of work to bring Clinton down, and even then they were 0.057% away from it all falling apart.
Fair enough. Dems did lose support overall though with women compared to last election. I misread the graph. But yes, you did point out the weakness of my argument.
Yeah, neither did anybody else for that matter, the mainstream media dedicated more air time to negative stories about Clinton than any other candidate, they dedicated less air time to covering her policy than any other candidate, she had to carry around all the nonsense baggage from the primary about her nomination being "rigged" and how "as a neoliberal capitalist" she was as much "a part of the problem" as the Republicans, and then the cherry on top was James Comey making the historically unprecedented choice to hold a public press conference to discuss an on going FBI investigation about Clinton the week before the election.
