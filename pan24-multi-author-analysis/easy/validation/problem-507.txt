In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
No, it isn't. This clearly T-bones both _Heller_ and _Bruen_ and there is no way it will make it past the federal courts. All Senators who are lawyers already know this.This bill is pure theater and it is intended to distract the Dem base (I are one) from noticing that since the _Dobbs_ decision, Democrats have now failed at every major policy initiative they have had for the past 50 years. So let's waste time on a futile performative gesture which is certain to fail, and alienate over a hundred million peaceful, responsible gun owners in the process. Great.

Exactly. Majority of gun deaths are suicides. Fix the economic issues you fix the resentment that leads to depression and suicide and mental illness that leads someone to shoot up a school.
