Korea is also the most likely to actually deliver the goods, plus they're one of the few nations allowing the tanks to be manufactured entirely in Poland, so if they fail to make delivery deadlines it's on them. The western suppliers Poland have been going through are a little preoccupied right now trying to supply Ukraine or beef up their own militaries. I really don't blame Poland one bit, Korea is probably the best bang for your buck if you don't have an arms industry of your own. It wouldn't surprise me if Poland switches to almost entirely Korean weapons. Before the Ukraine war started it made sense to look towards NATO for equipment... but now unless they're at war, the western powers just aren't going to prioritize fulfilling Poland's contracts.
Generally true. In addition it was official policy for decades to not send weapons into active conflict zones.
Inferiority complex. There’s a meme that pops up now and then where it’s EU saying they hate the US and the U.S. saying I don’t even think about you and it’s quite accurate.
