From the article it seems that the family was shot at, starved, lost everything and almost died as the Russians sieged and took the city. But they survived. Now the mother works in the occupant "administration" of the territory and this gives the family an income and some security for now. A chance to live.
Whether you are a Catholic priest in the US who thinks you are saving the souls of the kidnapped native children, or you are an instructor of Hitler Youth and you think you are protecting these children against perceived enemies, or a guy taking hundreds of children from a warzone and depositing them to the people bombing them you are still committing genocide.
That is fair. There’s probably a lot of people who believe the propaganda and that they are really “helping” these Ukrainian kids, who wouldn’t have needed the help to begin with if Russia hadn’t bombed their towns and families.
This will be an unpopular opinion, but I’m sure that there are Russians who don’t approve of the war, so they spend their time helping as much as they can. Maybe this yuri guy is one of those people.
