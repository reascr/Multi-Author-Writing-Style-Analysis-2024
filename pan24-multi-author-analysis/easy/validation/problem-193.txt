The bill was incredibly unpopular in Scotland and considering devolution never gave the Scottish Government the power to to so this in the first place it's obvious to a blind man that Sturgeon wanted this to happen so she could have her little showdown with Westminster.
Aside from the fact that the bill is extremely unpopular with the electorate which was shown by repeated polls and section 35 being written into the Scotland Act meaning it is part of devolution there is nothing in the bill that safeguards the people most affected by it, Women.
Incorrect. The reforms pertain to healthcare and state record-keeping, which are entirely devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The reforms passed by 2/3 of Members of the Scottish Parliament, voted in by members from all political parties in the Parliament, including Conservatives.
Im not lying at all. Ofcourse it bloody passed with majority parliamentary support, that's literally how bills pass. My point was that it was incredibly unpopular with the electorate. Which every single poll conducted since shows it is.
