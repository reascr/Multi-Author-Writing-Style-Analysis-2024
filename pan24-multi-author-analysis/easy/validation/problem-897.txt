Applied Behavioral Analysis/Therapy is torture. Really, at the hart of any behavioral psychology is a philosophy of deprivation, negative reinforcement and the least effective positive reinforcement. Deprivation and negative reinforcement seem like the partners here, and they are at first, the real shit begins when you start rewarding your subject/patient. There in lies the rub. An ethical behavioral approach begins with earning trust and unconditional positive reinforcement. Deprivation is always a natural consequence: you throw your plate on the floor, your dinner is ruined. Negative reinforcement always takes the path of "Your threw the plate of dinner on the floor and now you have to eat a sandwich instead.".
But what I have observed repeatedly is conservative people fucking up their own lives and ruining family relationships due to failing to accept another's sexuality. I've seen that plenty of times. I've heard about this from just about every LGTBQ+ person I've known.
What is with their unhealthy fascination with LGTBQ people? Never once as a straight person has someone else being gay had a negative impact on my life.
