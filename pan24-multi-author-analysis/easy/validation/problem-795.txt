Internally, Poland's government is pretty shitty, and the Polish and Hungarians backed each other because they're both right wing leaning, ultra-conservative.
as shitty as it is, it might be a good thing if another eastern european country votes a government in that is like polands, because the millisecond that there is another country that will play the game with poland, they'll throw Orban under the bus and Hungary will be absolutely fucked.
Its a shitty situation all around because Hungary is full of decent people but their elections are basically ruined, Orban has taken control and fucked the system so badly , that legally its almost impossible to vote him out now.
My mom was in Canada. She just volunteered to translate for the refugees who were arriving. My reference to the heroes was for those who resisted the invasion and was not meant to include my mom. Her life was not easy, but it was a dream compared to what those people courageously suffered, and to what Ukrainians are bravely suffering right now.
