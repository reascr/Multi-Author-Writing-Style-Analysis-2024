Trains make plenty of sense, the infrastructure is cheaper to maintain, there's effectively no chance of traffic jams, the drivers are professionals rather than some jackass with a license, and the electric power has multiple benefits like not carrying its own fuel ( for why that's dumb), lower pollution, less noise, better acceleration, regenerative braking, and the ability to do stuff like put a stationary battery system at the bottom of a hill to even out system load at high-power inclines, all at a fraction of the cost of the auto industry, a fraction of the physical size of the interstate system, a fraction of the fuel costs to do all this transportation, and a fraction of the cost to maintain.
I must have rotten luck then. Because I've only been to an apple store three times in my life, and all three of them were at different locations. And in every case I was left dissatisfied.
Exactly. And even Waymo is restricted to some suburbs in the southwest where it hardly ever snows and rains. They also are geofenced to areas where they Waymo crews manually heavily scan everything so there's a pre-existing high-quality map of the environment. There's also a team of people who can remotely step in at a moment's notice to take control over the vehicle, and rescue teams that travel out to pick any one up from a malfunctioning vehicle.
