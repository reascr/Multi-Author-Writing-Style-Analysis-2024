Didn't Ukraine want that for themselves after previous Russian aggression, including annexing Crimea several years earlier? Russia has been a threat to Ukraine for some time, especially after moving to a democracy very recently, with Russia having a fear it would be successful and hurt the influence Russia has on the region, and especially what Russians would think about a successful democracy in their neighbor. The US may have supported their joining the UN, and ultimately NATO, but the reasons for Ukraine to do so are entirely based upon Russian aggression. Even the primary reason for the US to really get involved, beyond the humanitarian reasons, is because Russian has actively been working on undermining democracies in the western world.
Yes. There has been historic US involvement in Ukraine, but, by and large, Ukrainians have chosen that between two giants, they prefer the one that hasnâ€™t committed genocide against their population and promises an improved economy. Small states affirmatively choose between great powers and pretending that those choices are simply a foregone conclusion robs those small states of their agency. Ukraine has the right to choose the US as its protector; Russia has the right to be fearful of the West. Russia does not have a right to compel obedience through invasion.
