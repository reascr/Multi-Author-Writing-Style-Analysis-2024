...And the National Archives asking another former President to return documents they know he still has not returned, told he doesn't have them, then told he has them but they are not securely stored, told he has now locked them in a room that is supposedly controlled access, has his property raided to recover them where documents are also recovered located elsewhere, is told the documents aren't classified because he declassified them without telling anyone else who is part of the declassification process and supposedly did this back when he was still President, told them a special counsel is needed to review all documents recovered before any of them can be reviewed by the investigators since they may have non-classified materials, and may still have more unrecovered documents stashed away in a location that is extremely difficult to get a proper warrant to check since it requires exhuming a grave located on private property.
