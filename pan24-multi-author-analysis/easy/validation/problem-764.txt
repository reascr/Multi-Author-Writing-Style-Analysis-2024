__Under current climate targets, there will be virtually no glaciers left in Central Europe by the end of the century, according to an international study with Swiss participation.__.
With a rise of 3°C by 2100, the glaciers of Central Europe will have disappeared completely, they found, while a rise of 1.5°C – which would involve setting stricter climate targets – the melting would be in the order of 60%.
Worldwide, the most optimistic scenario in the study would see glaciers lose 26% of their mass compared to 2015; ice-sheets would only survive in the high mountains of Asia, Alaska, Russia, and the Arctic and Antarctic. At the same time, sea levels would rise by 115 millimetres.
Of course, the anti-humanity group already thought of that and have spent billions on convincing the world that everything should be done about climate change except the shit that actually works, by pushing scams like carbon capture, personal responsibility, and electric vehicles as all that can be done about it, whilst also buying out political parties to let them hoard the incomprehensible amount of wealth their companies have accumulated, and do absolutely nothing worthwhile to society using that money. Personal profit is the only thing that matters for them, and greed is the whole of their character.
