Covid, cholera, presidential assassination, soil erosion, food and energy shortages, drinkable water shortages, gang violence, corruption, crumbling infrastructure and healthcare systems, police brutality, earthquakes, tropical storms, illiteracy, brain drain, abductions, complete inability to hold elections or form a government, LGBT discrimination, investment collapse and currency depreciation, uncontrolled inflation, and the list goes on and on and on.
We just want peace and a stable country to share the border with. Haitians would hate it if Dominican troops were sent to their territory.
