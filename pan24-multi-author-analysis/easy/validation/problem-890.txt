Given they cannot directly translate money into war material they rely on internal production. Production can be influenced by converted industry, extra work hours, more efficient methods. Currently I would imagine there is alot of pressure on people to work those extra hours with out compensation in money. This will work for a while due to the terror and propaganda control the government has over the population. Its a open question if this will ever fail though.
Just go look at a Ural vs Brent price differential chart and tell me that oil is fungible in this environment, it's obviously not, years and year of near parity and instantly it drops to -$35, stabilizing at around -$23 - this is because demand for Ural crude within the global oil market has dropped, it will start coming back as new supply chains open up new markets for the Russians.
Demand for oil in general has stayed the same, but demand for Ural crude has dropped and demand for non-Ural crude has increased, there's like 1 billion people now that are looking to stop using Russian O&G and those people will be looking elsewhere, whereas the countries turning to Russian O&G never had an issue with using it, the price just became more attractive. The only reason we can separate them into groups like this, with different impacts on their demand is because the supply chains are fucked up. If there were no supply chain issues and price differentials returned to normal, then I'd say it is fungible, but not right now.
