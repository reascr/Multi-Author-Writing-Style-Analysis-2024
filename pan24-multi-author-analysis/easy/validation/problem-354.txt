A bit like the 2004 American presidential election when it was felt that staying the course with an unqualified leader (and particularly military leader) was a better option for Iraq and Afghanistan than a decorated war hero who was not a miserable failure (though I'm sure we now all long for the benevolent idiocy of the bush years).
13 out of 60.... So I guess I was wrong, it's closer to 80% that dislike Hezbollah.... They are not one of the most popular party. Lebanon has an antiquated sectarian voting system, where different religions are represented "proportionally" and most parties are sectarian. Hezbollah is one of 2 Shiite Muslim parties, so they get a high proportion of the Shiite vote. Sunni Muslim, Druze, Maronites, Orthodox, etc. each have their own political parties. The high fragmentation of the government effectively gives almost any party with more than 5 seats the ability to veto legislation (similar to the hyper representation in Israeli politics allowing fringe parties with few seats to dictate legislation for the governing party). Again, complicated. Lebanon is not equal to Hezbollah, despite what the media want to push.
