Sorry for the seemingly nitpick but western people have a tendency for bothsidesism and false equivalency when it comes to the conflict. Thereâ€™s a big difference between Artsakh being a a landlocked enclave completely within Azerbaijan fighting for their existence and Nakhichevan being a exclave separated from the mainland but still having a border with Turkey and land connection through Iran and not having to deal with any threats from Armenia whatsoever.
The CSTO is such a useless alliance. Even Kazakhstan gave up on it when it started sharing CSTO intelligence with turkey and turkey planning to establish drone manufacturing facilities in Kazakhstan. It even supported Azerbaijan in its war with Armenia and is looking to escape Russias influence over its energy sector by talking with Azerbaijan over building a pipeline.
Not quite. It was done to give Russia geopolitical allies on its borders and maintain existing trade relationships. But the relationship has always been Russia sending in troops to help its allies, and never its allies sending in troops to help them. If there was no war in Ukraine there would also be no conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Russia would have sent troops to Armenia to push the Azerbaijanis back.
