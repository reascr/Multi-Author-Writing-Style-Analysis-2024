Just to add onto this fact: most Israelis and Palestinians know this is the IDF's official rules of engagement, first you yell stop or ill shoot in Hebrew and Arabic "atzor or Ani ereh, wakef wakef wala Ana batuchak" then of they don't stop you shoot in the air twice, then if they don't stop you shoot their legs. The goal is to stop them from continuing to approach, so they'll fall to the ground, but sometimes they bleed out of you hit their arteries. But at that point, they were given all the chances and warnings. But if the soldiers followed these orders, which it sounds like they did, the IDF won't even bat an eyelash as all orders were followed and they gave it their best try not to resort to violence.
Criticize? No, I made the valid point that it's entirely possible that the story they've given out is false. If you set aside your bias towards the IDF, you'd see that. Or you can be naive enough to believe everything a military force says. I guess all the people in Gitmo are legitimate threats to the U.S.
