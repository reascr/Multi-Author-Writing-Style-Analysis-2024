Hey bud, want to come backcountry splitboarding? We will wear beacons so if one of us becomes buried the other has a 20 minute time trial to dig the other out before brain damage and/or death!
hmm... interesting. not sure if the virus would survive in a mosquito. The mosquito sucks blood only once and then generate its offspring. So the virus has to transmit to the offspring before being transmitted to a host again.... well anyways I ask chat gpt...There is some evidence that mosquitoes are not able to transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes, and the virus does not replicate in mosquitoes. While it is theoretically possible for a mosquito to pick up the virus from a person's skin or blood and then transmit it to another person, this has not been demonstrated to occur in real-world conditions. The primary mode of transmission of COVID-19 is through person-to-person contact..... ok so the answer is maybe...
