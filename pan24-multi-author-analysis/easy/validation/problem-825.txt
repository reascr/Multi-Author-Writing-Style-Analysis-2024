If there was ever a time to convince young and/or uninformed Wisconsinites to vote, NOW IS THE TIME. My family is moderately conservative (if you can fairly call it that anymore) but have slowly been becoming more progressive over the years. When the topic of abortion comes up, they always say there’s no way it’ll go away… until it did and is in many places. Now that they know what’s at stake, they are all asking questions and are starting to realizing that the people they’ve historically voted for actually don’t have their (or most anyone’s) best interest in mind. Please, please, PLEASE don’t let us go further back than we already have, Wisconsin. This may very well be our last chance to protect democracy in our state.
Neither conservative candidate will help us humanitarian-wise. The other liberal candidate is a Reverend. Personally, I don’t want someone so close to the church involved in my state’s highest ranking court. That’s my opinion only. So, Janet is the strongest bet and her policies align with mine.
