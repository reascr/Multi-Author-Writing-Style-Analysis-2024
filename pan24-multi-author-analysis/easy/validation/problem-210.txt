I remember in high school being absolutely astounded that there were beautiful old cathedrals and bell towers and Colliseum in Italy that were graffitied and carved all over with names, and that people could just climb on Roman ruins in parks - then it kinda clicked that the locals mostly viewed it as “boring old buildings or rubble” unless they could make some $ from tourists.
That’s it. It doesn’t matter how fucked up Egypt is, people want to see the pyramids. We learn about them in school, and they’re a constant source of curiosity. They’re one of those things that ends up on a lot of bucket lists. People are going to see the pyramids no matter what’s going on.
You can see pyramids, not the pyramids. Mexican pyramids are cool, but Egyptian pyramids are what’s in everyone’s mind when they think pyramid. We saw them history books, movies, video games, etc. They’re probably the most iconic historical location in the world. There will always been an attraction towards ancient Egypt and the pyramids.
