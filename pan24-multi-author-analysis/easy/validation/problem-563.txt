In the grand scheme of things, however, it could be a net positive for the world (Western, especially). A semi-demilitarised Russia can attempt another invasion again within a decade. One which has sacrificed nearly all of its arsenal and a big chunk of its young population will have a harder time ever rebounding to its prewar level of power. Thus, another two years of war might permanently remove Russia as a significant geopolitical player altogether.
Part of the problem is maintenance. The US military spends a lot on pulling stored tanks out and making sure their still in working order. Russia more than likely hasn't. Instead of spending the money someone probably stole it for themselves. Remember rubber seals dry. Parts start to rust and leak.
We (as in NATO+EU+other allies) have literally more than a order of magnitude more military equipment and industrial capability than russia. We should've been over-supplying Ukraine 10:1. It's only a question of will, which sadly seems to be lacking.
