There's also the fact that (and I don't mean to make light of this at all) some of the aging Republican base, and some of the most loyal older Republican voters, were basically told by Republican leadership that they didn't need to get the vaccine or wear masks during a deadly pandemic. So...uh...you know. Some of those most loyal Republican voters lost their lives due to bizarre and misleading health "advice" from Republican leadership.

Unfortunately Republicans hold an overwhelming majority in the wisconsin state assembly and senate because of gerrymandering. Evers is only able to veto their stuff by the thinnest of margins, they almost won a supermajority that could've overriden his veto power. So it'll be another 4 years of Evers begging them to do something good for wisconsin and the Republicans will not even do their jobs. Evers tried to get them to do something about guns by calling special sessions and the Republicans just gavel in and gavel out the session within minutes.
