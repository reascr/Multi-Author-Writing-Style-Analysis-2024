Now? We bought our first home this year in the Twin Cities and there's a good chance we never come back. We've talked about it and with how Iowa continues to devolve into a nightmare. Why would we ever want to try to raise a family where our child would go to a declining public school system, have few protections or even really be safe if they were a girl, LGBTQ, or a child with special needs? Hell if we even tried to start a family and she has an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage she could die or get in serious legal trouble because the state is trying its best to become Gilead? We used to lead the nation in education and were one of the first states to allow gay marriage. What has happened to this state is abhorrent.
