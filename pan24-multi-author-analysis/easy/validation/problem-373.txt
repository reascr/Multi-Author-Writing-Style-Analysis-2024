This reminds me of when the Taliban pick and choose things from Islam as well. Like forcing women to cover up but then not letting them run businesses/work, going to school, stoning people for adultery (except the burden of proof in Islam for such a crime is having 4 men seeing the act occur which is virtually impossible), and so on.
Why do I bring it up? As a reminder that this stuff gets the public to justify a war, which almost always ends up much worse for the people. Iran has to handle this themselves.
I mean thinking about it, there hasn’t been a single country that hasn’t gone medieval on some mfs, china still has concentration camps to this day that everyone just, stopped talking about for some reason, the US is shipping their bloodlust to other countries to fuel the warmachine and russia is being russia, not to mention slavs warcriming eachother on the regular and it wasn’t too long ago that all of europe was on fucking fire.
This is what my Muslim coworker would do. He slept in and fasted a couple of hours and then ate an enormous amount of food in the evening. I’m like isn’t that missing the whole point?
And from experience, there’s a good chance that if you’re that powerful you’ve done something terrible and benefitted from it, like african warlords drugging up children and giving them AKs to kill eachother, their short stint on this godforsaken earth tainted by substance abuse and constant death, those warlods live comfy fuckin lives, own a lot of shit, and disaster followed their every fucking move.
