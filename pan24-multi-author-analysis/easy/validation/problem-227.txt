OOO, I'm waiting to turn negative points, for a comment on the same topic in r/Europe. The issue is not only in the dumb wind turbines but in general the Sami community as a whole will be abused. I'm not Norwegian but I live in a village where there are Sami, and as far as I know in the past the Norwegians didn't treat them well. Territories have been taken away for NATO training grounds, or for industry in Sweden and Norway, I guess the argument for industry is the same as now for "eco-activities". In the 80s, the constitution of Norway was written, I think, that the state should guarantee the preservation and development of the Sami way of life, and not work more because of the money generators that interfere with the reindeer herds.
What a shameful response. This take isn't just misguided and dumb, it's straight up evil. The obvious fix is to put the wind farms somewhere else so as not to interfere with indigenous lifeways. This should have been a basic part of the due diligence done during the planning process.
