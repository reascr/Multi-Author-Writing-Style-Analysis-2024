Over 3 million voters in Florida voted for democratic candidates in 2022. We need more from the national party. I’d like to encourage the national democratic party to bring forth more goals than abortion access. It is embarrassing. Support medical procedures people decide in private and move on. Let’s finally do the right thing and expand representation in the House. Taxation without representation is what we fought for to create this nation. Let’s give the citizens of DC, USVI, PR, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana’s a full vote in the House. Let’s work with our South and Central American and Caribbean neighbors to figure out how to help them create opportunity and security to keep their residents in their nations to stave the migration patterns to the USA. Let’s end our embargo with Cuba. Marco Rubio is obviously going to be re-elected, let’s go for it. Let Florida turn red over Cuba. It is already red. There is nothing to lose and everything to gain. Let’s also talk more about the high cost of health care and how unfortunate it is for small business that they have to provide it for full time employees. Wouldn’t it be freeing for small business owners to not have to pay for it when a federal system already exists and could be expanded? These are things that make sense at a national level.
Extreme gerrymandering. They redrew my district and added a few to the state in areas they knew they could pick up easy wins. The maps were literally drawn by the governor :
