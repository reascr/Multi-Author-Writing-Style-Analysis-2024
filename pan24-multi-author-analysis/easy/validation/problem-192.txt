Do not badmouth sophisticated Chinese nanotechnology. Those ultralight supersonic self-propelled smart satellites will cost the Chinese taxpayer a billion Chinabucks.
OK? But my original reply was pointing out that there will be a much larger market in programming the communications constellations than in the cleanup satellites. Not really referencing the original article.
They plan on tweeting Musk with an offer of a million Chinabucks so he will pretend his satellites are suppressed. Much cheaper than launching satellites of a technologically sophisticated level such that theyâ€™ll need to buy them from the U.S.
