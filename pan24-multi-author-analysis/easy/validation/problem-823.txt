After the partition plan by the UN, the Jews actually accepted to share the land and approved the existence of a Palestinian Arab state alongside Israel. The Arabs refused the partition plan and the surrounding arab states initiated the 1947-48 Israeli-Arab war which goal a was to throw all the Jews out. Didn't go as planned, the Jews win the war and pushed back the Arab states. Before that, the territory was the British mandate. Also after that war in the 50s, Jordan invaded and annexed Judea & Samaria, renamed it west bank, and threw all the local Jews out. After that, there is also the 1967 war, and then the 1973 war, Israel was systematically menaced by the Arab states which had one objective: destroy Israel. A lot of territories were offered by Israel in exchange for peace, for example the Sinai. The Golan was also offered in exchange for peace (but refused).
Really? You must be on a different reddit. The word Israel gets mentioned on here and everything becomes about how evil it is and how they bomb kids. Hell Jews in America are talked about and it comes back to Israel.
