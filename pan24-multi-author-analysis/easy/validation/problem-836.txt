I don't know. A country who goes nuts for wearing a cloth over their face during a pandemic but are happy for school rooms to have litter boxes for school shooting prep isn't right in it's head.

Actually doing something is political suicide. Things only get done because there are a few politicians who in good faith try to make the country better, or, are lobbied to do something with the lobbyists taking the heat (eg picking up any lost campaign funds etc) if any.
I'm not the sort of person to put politicians in one bag (some are lazy, some aren't; some are smart, some aren't) but there has been a trend to not legislate and instead push the decision to any other institution.
