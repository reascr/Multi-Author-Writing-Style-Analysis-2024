Look up Office 39; it's a North Korean government agency that makes money for the regime through illicit activities (basically a state-run mafia) such as weapons and narcotics smuggling, selling counterfeit goods and currency, cybertheft, insurance fraud, human trafficking, etc.
Thanks; It was the goddamn USB cord that came with it. It was faulty. Not that you are still reading this but I spent 5 hours troubleshooting every Fucking thing imaginable. I gotta vent to someone! Lol.
If a peace treaty is signed with North Korea, then the core justification for the ROK-US Alliance (and the continued US troop presence) disappears soon afterward, which could lead to a formal termination of the alliance and US troop pullout.
Yeah. I understand your point, but they probably buy the radioactive material from Russia as they have huge deposits. Building the machinery may be difficult for them but let's say they have WW2 equipment. The majority of the equipment would be mechanical as back then semiconductors weren't around. So they could probably build it in north Korea. Some North Korean citizens also study abroad. Their leader Kim studied in Europe I believe. I'm sure some of their citizens probably study physics or nuclear physics at reasonable universities across the world to obtain the knowledge too.
