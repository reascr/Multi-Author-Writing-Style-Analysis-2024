But what is implied by your posts is there is something wrong for a Black woman to achieve prestigious positions like District Attorney of one of America’s great cities, or getting elected Attorney General of America’s largest state. Reading people like you, who ignore the complexities of the job and reduce it to “she sent ns to jail for weed” without giving any deets or actually providing any contextual info on it. Not even explaining if you mean her tenure as AG where she wouldn’t deal with local marijuana cases, or her tenure as a DA where she ran the office that would be was in a city where the population wasn’t all that black (it’s not like she was DA in Oakland).
How do you know? This is just more bullshitting from you. Do you ever state anything factual or do you lie about everything?
Stop lying about verifiable facts. Plenty of black people act like republicans, claiming kamala can't be bad for black rights is an obvious lie. She can and is. No one is going to claim clarence thomas is a supporter of black rights just because he is black. He happily threw out major voting regulations that preserved the rights of minorities.
