”I hear the critics and the phony fake news media that I have a TRANSACTUAL relational with my daughter Ivanka. But you didn’t hear it from me. I don’t want TRANS anything. Okay? Very simple. I’m not into the trans. I don’t believe in it. And how could I? To my own daughter? The gorgeous light of her mothers full bodied figure? No I don’t Transact with anyone and especially not my own family. But I hear a lot about someone who very much does and is into TRANSacting and they want to do it to you and your kids and your lifestyle. We all know the big bad trifecta of TRANS this and that. Don’t we folks? Richard Gere, The Pope— and folks let’s be honest okay? The pope we see the pope they show you? That isn’t the pope. I’m talking about the REAL pope locked in a chamber one thousand and fifty seven feet below the Vatican. I read about all of it in this documentary I watched on a flight from Mar A Lago to West Mar a Lago. But anyways folks, the REAL POPE, and Flea from the Red Hot Chilis. There okay? You have it. That’s who’s in charge folks and don’t ever forget it.”.
Presidential material. Wasn't the other one about how she has a nice ass or something? It's a presidential quote I'm not saying it myself just to be clear.
Seriously. I feel like if I went back and took any random day from the Trump administration it'd have the kind of wacky thing any other president would have brought up all the time. For Trump, it was just Tuesday.
Absolutely. He looked down on Charles Kushner for getting caught and doing time. Trump walks this line between being a buffoon and a savant so well it's not a mistake.
