I suffer from a mental illness, and not one of the more 'media friendly' mental health diagnoses such as depression or anxiety. I'm well treated for it (schizoaffective disorder), as you can hopefully tell from my relative coherence. I'm posting this article partially because of an interaction I had the other day in this subreddit, wherein a commenter joked that C-SPAN callers were undiagnosed schizophrenics, and I was downvoted for asking them not to make a punchline out of the illness. I'm sharing this article and this story to hopefully help humanize those with even the less savory mental health issues, and maybe give someone pause before the next time they joke about "schizos", call Fetterman a 'vegetable', rush to attribute violence to mental health issues, or in some other way do their part to ensure that those with serious mental health issues and/or disabilities do not take part in public life.

Interesting perspectives. Without being too insensitive to the challenge Fetterman is facing, one wonders whether there are some national security considerations worth examining as it pertains to politicians suffering mental illness. I think weâ€™ve got enough issues with how our leaders perceive reality even without taking mental illness into consideration.
