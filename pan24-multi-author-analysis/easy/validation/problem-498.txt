I think it means we need to look past headlines and scrutinize what's actually being done, because as I read this article it's just two random house Republicans saying some platitudes about "orderly legal immigration" being a good thing occasionally. Talk is cheap and Republicans lie like breathing.
The Democratic party is the party of humane, reasonable, and economically literate immigration policy. But sometimes Democrats say "Latinx" so these folks will complain a little about Republican immigration policy but will keep voting for the GOP anyway, because god forbid people have any sense of reasonable priorities in politics.
Oh, I totally agree. I used it in quotes because we are obviously discussing words in speech and text. Latine obviously makes more spoken sense. I was just noting I’m not sure “Latinx” was ever intended to be a spoken word by those who first used it; more like internet slang. I have no stake in the debate, but I think its an interesting nuance to consider as an example of the flexibility of language in different contexts and mediums.
