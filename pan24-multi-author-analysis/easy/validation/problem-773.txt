Yeah I've read... On reddit, that this is part of how they fight war first they send in the unwanted poorly armed as cannon fodder basically to waste ammo and reveal the positions of the enemy, then they send in another wave, then finally their is the wave that is best equipped, but who knows how much of those last 2 part's are horse shit... That's why they are threatening nukes. I prey they do not resort to using nukes on their neighbor. Vladimir certainly is bringing back the soviet union in the worst way possible for Russian citizens (I presume only men are conscripted so Vlad can take advantage of the ladies).
Oh absolutely. As someone who's worked in freezers even with only -15 f, the cold penetrates even thermal gear. Cover your mouth and nose because it will run and freeze on your face and make it worse.
Absolutely. I grew up in a prairie city that got pretty damn cold in the winter - the worst it got was about -40 but regularly in winter it would go to -30.
Exactly. People seem to forget that 70% of Russians live in urban areas, these people have coats to get them from the parking lot to their door or wait for the bus for 20 minutes. Most of them live in cities, they're not off stalking through the countryside in -20 all night.
