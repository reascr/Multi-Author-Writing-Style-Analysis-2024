Manufacture consent. If you watched the AMA awards or the Grammy's you will notice it is all the same. The artists are the same and interchangeable. The auto tune is everywhere and most of them can't play an instrument. Its all about influencers created and destroyed by the companies. Ticketmaster and live nation control the stages, the artists and the sales.

Current inflation? No competition with Always Late(tm) inventory. What are you gonna do when I increase my price? Switch? Competitors can't take the business because they have the same upstream monopoly supplier who can't increase their production.
