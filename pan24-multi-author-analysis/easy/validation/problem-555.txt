If someone they consider a "man in a dress" is legally classified as an "adult performer" when all they're doing is reading Mary Poppins to kids in a library while dressed as the titular character, what exactly does that mean for the person whom they consider a "man in a dress" who is just trying to go to her job as a 5th grade Music teacher? Or hell, just trying to go to the grocery store?

This guy is making Trump look good. I said I would never vote for Trump, but if I only had 2 choices, sadly I think I'd vote Trump. Desantis is literally following the Fascist playbook. To me, Trump does just to get votes but is not as dangerous as Desantis, (he's more intelligent than Trump, hence capable of more devious acts) if you can believe that. A man who tried to overthrow the government in my mind is less dangerous than Florida's Mussolini.
