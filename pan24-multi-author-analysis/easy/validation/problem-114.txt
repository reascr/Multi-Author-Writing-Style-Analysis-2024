These types of generalizations are completely unhelpful and only serve to drive Serbs away from the EU and towards Russia. Obviously the government of Serbia would not be involved in this type of plot, the risks would be far too great even if they felt inclined to do so. However, it's no secret that a substantial of the Serbian population has a pro-Russian sentiment and thereby serves as a potential recruiment pool for Russia.
Secondly, by saying things like "Ofcourse Serbia will help Russia", one is artificially pushing them towards Russia by creating sentiment among the pro-EU people that Serbia is "bad".
That does not mean "Serbia" is helping Russia, it means some Serbs may have been recruited by Russia. Big difference.
Crazy how back then us and the American used to be allies and now American kids are trying to justify hatred for Serbs because an Austohungarian national killed the Austrohungarian heir to the throne in a forcefully annexed region, which Austohungary used as an excuse to murder 3/4 Million Serbs in an attempt to expand their empire.
By voting against it in the UN? By not recognizing the breakaway regions of Crimea and Donbas? By Selling weapons to Ukraine? How exactly is it helping Russia?
