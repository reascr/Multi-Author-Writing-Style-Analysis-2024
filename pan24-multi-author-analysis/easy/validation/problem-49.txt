I’m excited to see our Gov spending their time banning videos of people’s cats & dogs doing funny things. Maybe they could pay attention to the 10M registered voters that are waving their arms asking someone, anyone to investigate stock market manipulation. Hedge Funds/Market makers control the market like a god damn video game, stealing millions of dollars from retail investors daily. Maybe they could have some serious conversations about our energy policy. All these fuckers do is bicker and then spend time banning an App that is utilized by unproductive people. What secrets is China gonna steal? The perfect ratio if Mentos to CokaCola? WTF is wrong with our elected officials???
Solution to daylight savings: keep time the same year-round, let companies/small businesses/farmers/whatever change their individual business hours seasonally if they want to/think they would benefit from extra sunlight during working hours.
Ah, okay. That makes more sense. I originally thought random gov employees were just downloading TikTok on their GFE to scroll through in their free time.
