In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Dark Money must end. Every cent donated should be identified by individual and/or corporate entity, whether to a candidate or a Political Action Committee.

Every last Penney must be publicly printed/posted & totally accountable at least 8 weeks BEFORE any election whether City, County, State or Federal office. No further donations can be sought or accepted.
