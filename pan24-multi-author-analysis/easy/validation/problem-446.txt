The military kicks out the miners/woodcutters/landgrabbers (Don't know how to say grilheiro in English =p), the government distributes some food boxes and medical assistance. Politicians take pictures with sick and starving people, the media publishes everything... And a couple months back the miners will be back because the military can't stay there for long without constructing some form of base (Which is illegal in natives lands), the natives are sick and starving because they are locked centuries behind the modern world with primitive agriculture and physics. And the whole circus starts again.
The difference is some politicians use their power to reduce deforestation rates by 80%, protect Indigenous populations, and give food to poor kids, while others use it to line their own pockets, build cults of personality, and irreversibly harm the global climate. And while I can't say I support people doing illegal/unethical things to put themselves back into power, I also think the Lula case highlights why any legal system that puts down a man who uses his power to help others deserves as much skepticism as the man himself.
No. Just let them be be free and they will naturally integrate the society. That happened with basically every single tribe from south Brazil.
