As to your second question - I have seen human beings care for one another so intensely, even risk their lives for one another. That has been a beautiful thing. KV.
Often times in Israel, I see Reuters report in an heavily biased manner, where for example, if a Palestinian 13 year old pulls out a knife and starts stabbing random Israel, and promptly gets shot for it, the title would usually be "IDF has killed a Palestinian kid"?
Edit: I tried to search up the incident 3 days ago where a 14 year old Palestinians stabbed someone to death, but despite having 5 different articles about Israel that day, it somehow didn't make the news.
Ha! Honestly this one is easy. This was new to me as a New Zealander, but in Ukraine, the gas stations often had hot dog stands. Which was revelatory. So I would say the best sandwich is on the road in Eastern Ukraine, from any open gas station, with an American hot dog in fresh bread. But if we’re going homestyle, I’m a huge roast beef, mustard and pickle fan. KV.
