Pitkin county is at 9300 votes counted and CBS estimates that there are 2300 votes. Last election the D candidate got 74% of that counties vote and this year Frisch is outperforming that candidate in ever single county so far so let's say he holds at 80% of the vote there, then that's another 1840 votes for him and 460 for Boebert and that's around 1380 net. Garfield county is at 90% votes counted 23500, so 2600 votes remain and if he remains at the same percentage, then he will get a net of 350 votes there. Then Pueblo county has about 3100 votes left and if he's at the same percentage there, then he nets 275 votes. There aren't enough votes left in red counties to to get her there. Even if he got 74% of the remaining vote (1100 net) like the 2020 Democrat in Pitkin and then you switch the numbers in Garfield and Pueblo county to give Boebert the votes I'm thinking Frisch will get, then she still loses.
There are rumors more votes are left in Garfield County, which has favored Frisch and more votes in Mesa County, which has favored Boebert. Those rumors haven't been verified or denied by either county.
Republicans expectations dropped. It's not about having the "best" candidate for the job get the job.
American voters have horrifically short memories. Trumps tax cuts for the wealthy were permanent, the tax cuts for the poor and middle class meanwhile were set to expire this year.
