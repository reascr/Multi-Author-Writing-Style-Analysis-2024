What they actually sell is a lot of partial systems (like the above mentioned barrels) that are then used by other countries' domestic industry. And then there's the other side of complete systems going to a completely different set of countries (like RM selling their Skynex/Skyshield stuff to Qatar, Indonesia or South Africa while nobody in Europe gave a shit about it and if they did they would rather buy the gun and build their own system with it; or like Diehl selling IRIS-T SLS/-M to Egypt for years while European countries were never interested in the whole system, Norway instead added the missile to NASAMS and is now building another system based on the missile with the same producer, and Sweden is cooperating with Diehl, also to produce their own system with mostly domestic industry based on just the missile).
You made that part up too. It handed over two other types of vehicles. It said it has approved the sale of the howitzers. So maybe nobody really knows? Expect you of course.
