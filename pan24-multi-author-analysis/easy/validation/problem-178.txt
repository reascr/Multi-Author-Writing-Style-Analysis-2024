Carrier Strike Groups are already extremely vulnerable to subalmarines both nuclear and conventional. Virtually every naval war game that has Subs versus Carriers. Ends up with the subs getting a kill. After the end of the Second World War. The allies had various captured German ships that had to be destroued afterna few years by treaty. As well as loads of surplus ships that could be destroyed. So the Americans started dropping nukes on them. The ships turned out to be far more resiliant than anybody expected. The problem was largely that the ships became radioactive. But if you expect to be attacked radiologically than you can "pre-wet" the ship. Essentially before, during and after the attack you have a load of high power sprinklers covering the entire outside of the ship. So the radiation doesn't stick to it.
From the article: "The Poseidon torpedo is a nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle" capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions. Its nuclear propulsion system gives the Poseidon virtually limitless range.".
