(Wow, not remotely close. Well, I didn't actually take any culinary classes, just spent time around them.).
It simply doesn't appreciate being excluded by these meetings (And if there is a country with no leg to stand on lecturing us on pan-European initiatives its France which spent a decade siding with Russia over us in Libya while we were trying to fix the mess France made).
Been awhile. Bechamel (butter?), white (flour), Spanish (tomato) Hollandaise (egg?) and I think the onion one?
We The Italians don't give a fuck about this , We are SUPERPROUKRAINE , our army did not release ANY note about "what weapons" we gave to ukraine and i think that's a reason , we are providing good shit but can't talk about coz russia still hold one of our two big balls , our home gas and oil prices are still high for people and industry(where people work and risk to lose job) , so "we the people " live on our skin everyday this damn dance on the edge of the cliff. but anyway we are glad to do this. Becouse We are European with the same Ideal of freedom and justice, even if you can't find it everyday, everywhere around you ; "We Are This Ideal".
