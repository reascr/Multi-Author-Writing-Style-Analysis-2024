I really have no idea why there are women in this country who are working to ensure their daughters have less freedom and options and opportunities than they did. It’s next level fucked. Boomers think they are the greatest generation when they’re just the most entitled. Entitlements galore. They can’t imagine another world in which they don’t use their entitlement to tell people what they should do with their lives and how to live. Literally every boomer will say that they are practically the hardest working American ever, when in actuality they just have jobs and work like everyone else. It’s constant self aggrandizement. It’s a whole generation that was given so much that they just can’t imagine other people actually work harder than them and have far less than them. It doesn’t compute in their brains. The abortion issue is just like a relic and vestige of the past that they must wield power over even though they’re too old to fuck their wives and too self centered to empathize for women, who made the grave mistake of being human with another human and having an unintended pregnancy.
Geez. South Carolina's my home state but I have lived abroad for many years now. What's the scoop? Anything on the local news or is it all anecdotal?
The anti-choice movement is perverted, misguided, misogynistic, irrational, morally and ethically inconsistent, bigoted, and unsound.
