Yah. A buddy has a sister with a gay best friend. A few times they dragged us to a gay club. I'm a very go with the flow people watching person, so figured the first time it'd at least be interesting. It was indeed. He was into some dude there so I being a few drinks in told that guy to talk to him. Won his respect and everytime I bumped into him after he'd go out of his way to try to find someone to introduce me to. One I actually really talked to and dated for a while. Good times.

Garbage performative politics. It didn't work out for them in the midterms so by all means keep doubling down on this crap that doesn't help your constituents.
Exactly. Distract, deny and deflect while they fumble through your pockets, on the way to looting the Treasury.
