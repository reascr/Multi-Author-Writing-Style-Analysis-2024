So... The act of giving money or other assets with the purpose of influencing someone's opinion or decision in your favor is called a "donation" nowadays. Not bribing.... Right....
It is money he mostly controlled, but it’s not 💯 fungible money - he can’t just spend it on hookers, it has to be laundered via some process (paying for hotel rooms at one of his shitty hotels, used as a hush payment etc) so there’s a significant discount on its value to him. It is interesting that he’d use that much, say, 20%-cash on something so dumb, but I think it’s explainable via 1) it’s a ballache to steal from his PAC 2) it was probably “spent” by one of his minions helping to enable what they imagine his idiotic fantasies are.
Up front? I’m surprised it wasn’t “do this audit for free, and ‘if’ you ‘find’ that I actually won, there’s a million (in donor money) for each of you in it.” (Followed by him not paying anyone.).
