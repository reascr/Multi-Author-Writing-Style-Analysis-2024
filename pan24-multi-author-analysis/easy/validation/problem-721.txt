I am sure said review will be done in an impartial way and absolutely not used for partisan purposes. /s.
House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says Congress will need to investigate the president following the discovery of classified documents at his former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washinon and a second batch at his home in Delaware. He also criticizes the Justice Department over how it handled the matter compared with the the FBI's search of former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and he criticizes the failure to disclose the discovery to the public before the election.
Ya know what? We should probably search the homes/offices of every former President and Vice President. Cause who knows how many classified documents have been taken out and "forgotten" about by other previous holders of the offices. Though I get the feeling a certain VP who served from 2001 to 2009 is going to have the most stashed away somewhere.
