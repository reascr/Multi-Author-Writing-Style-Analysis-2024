and I got there first, way ahead of Sleepy Joe, he didn't even want to go to East Palestine, my favorite Palestine, the others have a lot of problems, but they love Trump there so you know it's a great place, and I gave them Lifesaving Supplies, Biden has given them nothing, here I am, right after it happened, being Presidential when Sleepy Joe is on an Overseas Luxury Vacation, can you believe it, he must be tired from all the Golf he's been playing, remember I never had time for Golf, but I love it and it loves me, but I never had time as President, I was too busy doing deals, I did Veterans, I did Tax Cuts, the largest we've ever seen by the way, even better than Reagan.
