Good starting position. You demand a ridiculously high raise with the offer of letting him fly it. Work your way down to the raise you actually want with the offer of letting him sit in the pilot’s seat for five minutes. Ten if he gives you a extra heart bonus.
Oh I know, World War One is brutal, Im from Canada (which had a huge historic implication for the country) so in high school we spend a good portion learning about World War One and they don’t hold back the turn horrors of that war (and even then I don’t think we went nearly as deep into detail) i can only imagine what the late 30’s to early 40’s would’ve been like for people who had to experience the darkest war of all time, being told and hell maybe even having to be involved with a second one after they ended what they thought would be the War to end all wars.
Also, good luck with the COVID. First time you’ve had it? Just curious because my wife has had it 3 times (nurse), I’ve had it once, and my kids have never had it even though we quarantined in the same house each time. Blows my mind how it can be super contagious yet also I didn’t catch it 2 times when I was sleeping a foot away from someone that had it (and I’m not being sarcastic or downplaying it, it genuinely confuses me because it is contagious as fuck but we didn’t catch it from her).
the pic of the planes in the sky?? i am struggling to see how that's from Arma, it so clearly looks real to my eye, but maybe i'm just crazy and/or blind. is there a different pic on mobile or something?
