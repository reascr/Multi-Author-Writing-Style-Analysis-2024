DOJ also states in the letter that “disclosing non-public information about ongoing investigations could violate statutory requirements or court orders, reveal roadmaps for our investigations, and interfere with the Department’s ability to gather facts, interview witnesses and bring criminal prosecutions where warranted.”.
Yeah, I did a double take when I read this line. Like wait what, the DOJ is investigating, doing their job, while Gym’s time is mostly spent doing political theater. Not even playing politics or doing his job. Just political theater and sabotaging the functioning of the US government.
