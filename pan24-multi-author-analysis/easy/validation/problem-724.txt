We should probably rehabilitate the use of the word to what it means, if we want to understand anything at all. Its been thrown around like a used towel.
It's a stupid ironic Mexican joke, "Putin" is a slang way of saying "Puto" wich is derogatory term used to call friends or other people, it's original use was directed to gay people "that guy is a puto(gay)", but like I said, nowadays friends use it between themselves in a friendly manner, like: "Que onda puto" (what's up puto), it's part of our lenguage and pretty sure it's used all over Latin America as well.
No. It isn't. As much as I dislike the core recognisable tenets of ultra-traditional and reactionary movements (like fascism was), it pertains to paradoxically individualistic messianic cults, and is by definition anti-establishment. If there's any one redeeming feature from early fascism it's actually the revolutionary stance it takes against the establishment, and even the persecution it perpetuates.

Literally the only people she would ever respond to that weren't me (and occasionally her father) met one of those two descriptions (my daughter struggles with anxiety and selective mutism as well). I'm not sure what conclusion you would draw from this behaviour apart from 'Evidently, she has a type'. As I said, it was extremely weird, but it did make me understand how parents of gay children sometimes know from a very young age.
