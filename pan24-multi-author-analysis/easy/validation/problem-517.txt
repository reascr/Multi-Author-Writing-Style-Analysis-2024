Many other countries have a similar problem, albeit not at that scale or for the same reasons. Shrinking native population, most people entering retirement, etc. Productive members of society only fall into the, roughly, 20-60 year old age bracket. Younger/older ones don't produce, they consume resources. So even jump starting a major birthing initiative could push things over the edge in the short term even quicker. The other countries in this predicament will usually import a solution, by encouraging immigration to fill in the gaps. But, China being China, that isn't necessarily going to work. At least for skilled labor.
There's possibly an alternative to this deterioration, and Japan might be the best place to find out (as their population peaked a bit over a decade ago), but it would need some careful management by various levels of government and some heavy duty social security structures. I'm not sure whether China scores highly on either of those measures, probably not. It could be a long period of internal instability ahead for China once the population decline really bites. Countries have been known to deal with internal difficulties by going to war with other countries.
