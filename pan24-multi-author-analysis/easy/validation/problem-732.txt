The modern "conservatives"...aren't. They don't want to conserve anything. They want to regress to a time that never existed and remake the country into a Christian, nationalist nation.

Government telling schools what to teach? Sure, as long as you don't teach Timmy that some folks don't believe in Jesus or that some families have 2 dads or moms.
