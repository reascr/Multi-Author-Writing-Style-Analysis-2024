Also the fact that Russia has a reasonable large Jewish population and ties with Israel. I'm not saying I don't think Israel should not help more, but there are definitely well documents reasons they want to be an intermediary between both sides. I think people don't realise how complicated international politics actually is.
You do realize that they’d love that, right? Of course you don’t. Because of that aid and the treaty it came with the US exerts a control over their arms and technology exports. You don’t think the IDI can replace that three billion with unrestricted sales? They can. And beyond that we get first dibs on a lot of things they develop. Israel currently does not have enough Iron Dome batteries for themselves but the US has a few. Why did they give any to the US when they don’t have enough for themselves? That aid and the treaty it came with.
From Israel's perspective, preventing a a terrorist group that is actively attacking them from acquiring more weapons and preventing their main enemy from staging an invasion force on their border under the cover of fighting Syrian rebel groups are immediate national security concerns. Israel is worried about the development of the Iranian arms industry, especially Iran's nuclear program. However, their current strategy, is to engage in targeted bombing of infrastructure and the assassination of scientists and engineers critical to the Iranian arms industry and weapons development programs. I will grant you that this strategy is proving to be an obstacle, but not an existential threat, to the growth of Iranian arms industry.
