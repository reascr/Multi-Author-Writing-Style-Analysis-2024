What record of turning out votes? His first election he won by 34,000 votes and his second election he gerrymandered away black congressional districts and started a voter intimidation scheme which is the worst we’ve seen in a state with some of the worst voter intimidation practices in the country. Also he ran against Charlie Crist and a against a non existent Florida Democratic Party. Trust me, he’s not the political super star a lot of people think he is. He’s had his political imagine very well crafted in Florida, but that’s going to crumble after he comes under scrutiny for all the dangerous shift he’s said regarding COVID and the vaccine and all his political stunts. Trump was not only popular with the far right, he was a celebrity for forty years and had a hit show on NBC which portrayed him as a successful businessman, DeSantis has a high pitched voice and as much charisma as a tv remote.
