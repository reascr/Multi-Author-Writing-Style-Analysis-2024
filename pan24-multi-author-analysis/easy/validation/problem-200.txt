Boomers will never get it. They were gifted a country that was in the perfect state for them to excel and have the best quality of life this country has ever seen and think it was all their doing. Gen-Z is realizing they are going to be part of the modern slave generation and on top of it deal with climate disasters the boomers can't even fathom because they'll all be dead soon anyway, and as the most diverse generation the country has ever had have less freedom while under Christofascist rule. For the next 50 or 60 years of their lives. Republicans know their s\it is not popular, and while boomers are stupid enough to fall for the culture war BS, younger generations do not because they aren't all glued to the Fox News nightly grand slam of Ingraham, Hannity, Tucker, and Gutfield pumping them full of hard right propaganda as they drift off to sleep that would make Putin jealous.
But... If we lose the house, that's a huge loss. I agree dems are doing better than historically expected. But R's in control of the house turns the government into a massive clown show and absolutely nothing gets done. Even a 1 seat majority for the R's is too much.
