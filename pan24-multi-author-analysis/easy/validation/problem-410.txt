Nobody wants to make sacrifices injurious to their own lifestyle, it's true. Solutions have to take that into account. Saying things like "consumers need to give up consuming", "we need to stop all this capitalism", "that stuff you like is opulent and unnecessary and you should feel bad", and "bring on the revolution" is a load of crap because wishing achieves nothing, what you wish for won't happen, and if it ever did happen it would probably end badly. We have these conversations about climate change and it turns into a bunch of anti-capitalists talking about their own thing instead. Even supposedly communist China is massively industrial now and emitting lots of CO2, so this proposed political change where we all renounce consumerism is a big useless wobbly blancmange of fantasy. We're going to stay comfortable or die in extreme weather events (or be eaten by hordes of starving migrants or whatever the latest doomsday scenario looks like), and we're going to have to find solutions that include comfort, if any.
Really? What about the millions of animals being cut up and eaten? A very common example of trying to blame other things when people don't want to change themselves.
