he make his choice to fight for his country with his people as sacrifice so he can say "Ukraine still fighting" and also take massive debt from all the weaponry that ensure none of the future Ukrainian children have any future but work to pay that debt.
Brilliant. Okay, good, we have a goal. But before I get the public working on this, what should we be urging - Ukraine roll over and let Putin just take whatever he wants? Or Russia to stop his wars of conquest where he intentionally shells the shit out of civilian areas to try and use mass death to cow ukraine into surrender?
Translated: "Anyone ready for russia to rearm and fortify their shaky positions, while they insist the only option they'll listen to is total surrender and letting them keep southern ukraine.".
"imperialism, state policy, practice, or advocacy of extending power and dominion, especially by direct territorial acquisition or by gaining political and economic control of other areas. Because it always involves the use of power, whether military or economic or some subtler form, imperialism has often been considered morally reprehensible".
Yeah! I said the same thing back in the 40s. World War 2 dragged on way too long because Europe wasn't willing to negotiate with Hitler and find a middle ground. He wanted to conquer everyone, and all the Allies wanted to live, free, with their countries intact. But nobody was willing to find a compromise where Hitler was awarded, say, half of what he conquered, and then left alone in peace to rearm and fortify, and presumably pinkie-swear to never start trouble again.
