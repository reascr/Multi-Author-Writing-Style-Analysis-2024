In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yeah I have. I consume a variety of news sources. When’s the last time a liberal attacked a Republican Congressperson because of some thing Jim Acosta said? Never. Yet I can list three recent politically motivated attacks and attempted attacks by conservatives on democratic elected officials based on things Tucker Carlson has said. Radicalizing people to commit acts of terror. That’s the very definition of a terrorist organization.
Fox News is a terrorist organization. They use deliberately false and hateful propaganda to radicalize people into committing acts of violence and terror.
Rule changes are in order, imo. For example, you cannot call yourself news if the ratio of news to opinion is x/amount and opinion should be in big bold letters during the entirety of a segment. I know, I'm dreaming.
