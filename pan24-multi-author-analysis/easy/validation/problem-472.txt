Hi. Non american here. After the shit show has ended for now there is something I still don't understand. Is McCarthy no longer a MAGA republican? What did he do to be excomunicated from the cult? Or they just abandoned him for no reason and just Made him an undesirable?
Not necessarily. I'd bet one republican's crossover vote is worth MORE to a prospective dem speaker (Hakeem Jeffries, for example) than any 'safe' dem vote. Therefore, if you were a middling republican w/o a decent committee assignment and were willing to step over the isle because your math says you'd gain more support from your district by showing you were a candidate more willing to work with the other party, I'd bet you could negotiate for a BETTER assignment from the incoming Dems than the garbage assignment(s) you are holding today.
Pipe dream. The working class in this country has no solidarity because it's been successfully set to war against itself. We can't even get people to realize or accept how bad climate change already is. We still laugh at people trying to find ways to bring attention to it.
