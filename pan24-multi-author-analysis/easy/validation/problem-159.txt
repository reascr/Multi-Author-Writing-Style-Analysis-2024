Relevant article. Basically it sounds like GA Democrat politicians have been paying attention and are prepared to keep Democrat voters aware and motivated. Which is nice.
I paradoxally want their Republican to win so that the Democrats will get their asses together to keep Hershal Walker out, because I fear that complacency over control of the Senate will destroy voter turnout in the run off.
