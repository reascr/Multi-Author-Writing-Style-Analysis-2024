The last year also put lye a pretty massive misconception that pretty much everyone had: that people like Putin, Xi, Erdogan, Trump etc. will seek consensus or evena pragmatic, mutually beneficial outcomes when treated like rational actors. France and Germany got burned by Russia because they assumed that an engaged Russia-that is, Putin, will give some degree of a fuck about bigger issues like mutually beneficial security and economic concerns. It is unfortunately not true. Whether China can be engaged with is a conversation worth having. Unfortunately thats not the conversation at hand, its whether Xi is worth engaging.
America enjoys it's military hegemony. They don't want too much competition from the European military industry because this reduces it's influence from it's weapons sales. At the same time however, the United States and Europe are peas of the same pod. They both enjoy the notions of binding trade agreements (especially when it comes to developing countries) and this is secured by military power.
