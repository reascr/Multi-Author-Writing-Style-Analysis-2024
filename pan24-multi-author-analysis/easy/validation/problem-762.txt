They have to. Even if they gave Sinema an open field and ran no one, her numbers in Arizona are so poor she'll lose to almost any Republican. She's underwater with every age/race/education demographic, and her approval rating among Democrats is abysmal.
2. That’s not the last thing Democrats want..third party doesn’t necessarily have to be just Libertarian (not that Libertarians are bad, I much prefer them to the GOP, but their interests/Dems’ interest can differ greatly at times). Off the top of my head there’s the Green Party, a marijuana legalization party in MN, etc. Hopefully more third parties would pop up in the future with expansion of RCV. An anti-corruption/political reform party? Sign me up.
imaginable. Republicans, Democrats, Independents, whites, blacks, hispanics, college grads, non college grads, junkies, first graders, and puppies all cannot stand her.
Hypothetical question. Would you prefer a Republican over Sinema if that Republican was contractually bound to vote with the democratic party on 93% of votes?
