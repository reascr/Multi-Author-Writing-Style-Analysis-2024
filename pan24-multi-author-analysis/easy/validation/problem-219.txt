I've done disaster work and there's always uneven focus given to people and recovery of certain areas, most of the DSA (disaster survivor assistance, think door to door registration for assistance) I saw and took part in was targeted towards wealthier neighborhoods, and when we did low income neighborhoods people had less time to work on actually getting everything together, filling out the paperwork or following up and less attention over all was given to them. Although I am surprised the owners of the multi million dollar houses weren't offered SBA loans, which were low interest loans offered instead of grant money to people who made above a certain threshold. Maybe the SBA program is newer than 2012, but it's still surprising they got the grants.
