Today was a very quiet day with no missile strikes or drones. Nothing much happened in general, we didn’t even have any air raid alerts since 5am, which is pretty unusual. It’s very rare that there are so few air raid alerts in a day, but not hearing a new siren every few hours does feel good.
Absolutely. Criminals like these that engage in genocide should know no rest. They should be hunted to the ends of the earth and up to their last breath.
I'd like to believe they'll try to surround Kherson and not enter the city unless it's absolutely necessary (Russians would try to flatten it with artillery and turn it into an urban slog), also secure the dam at Nova Kakhovka before it can potentially be blown, then create a pocket to expand a bridge head on the left bank of the Dnipro crossing at the dam, then spearhead to Melitopol from that direction as I'm going to bet Russia didn't fortify that approach as much, then retake Crimea once land bridge supplies are being strangled, then finish off the Donbas fight.
Oh! That makes complete sense then. I've seen those in action, they're fucking insane. There was video footage relatively early on of them being used to level buildings the lenh of entire blocks. Fuck those things hard.
