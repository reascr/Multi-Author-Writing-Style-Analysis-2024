Yeah. Nobody said NK's weapons were good. Just that they made them (and a good number of them). Sometimes cheap and plentiful has its own level of impact.
Exactly. I was reading Oksana Zabuzjko about 6 months ago.. now I'm considering reading it again just to wrap my head around all the surprising history of Ukraine.
Seriously. If he's talking about Panthers and Tigers, then yeah in the rare situation that big cats were encountered on the western front Shermans (except for an E8 or Firefly) generally wanted no part of that.
Absolutely agree. I don't think NATO/the West would preemptively attack. So, it's a matter of counterattack after a Russian 1st strike. That 1st strike has the potential to be devastating. So, it's a classic situation of mutually assured destruction to some extent. If Russia doesn't wipe out conventional western forces, then we'd likely strike in force with conventional forces in response to a low yield nuke. If it was a widespread attack that severely limited conventional forces, then you'd likely see a direct nuclear response. Either way, it's a scary scenario for all.
