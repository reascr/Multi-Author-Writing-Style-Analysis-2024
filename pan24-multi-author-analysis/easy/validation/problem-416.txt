I'll never forget when Pompeo said "there will be a smooth transition....to the second Trump administration" long after the election had been decided. It showed how much of a pussy he is, completely unwilling to acknowledge obvious truths if he thinks it might hurt him politically. Luckily, Pompeo is never going to be president. He has the charisma of a wet mop, and, as far as I can tell, literally no one of any ideology actually likes him. I'm not sure if it's a humiliation fetish, or if he's just a moron who can't read the writing on the wall, but I really don't understand why he keeps putting himself out there.
Basically. A GOP state Rep in Iowa (Idaho?) is in prison now for raping an intern and another state rep was so mad at him being accused she revealed the name of the victim and made a "sorry not sorry" statement.

Exactly. He is one of the more terrifying Republican Presidential hopefuls. He is playing up the Christian Nationalism like Pence, the racism like Trump, but he seems much more belligerent and intentionally callous. Like, Trumps callousness is an outgrowth of his narcissism, but Pompeos is that AND borderline militant Christianity.
