HAH! I was buds with the loser, Hamadeh in college and I have no idea what happened to him. It was a pleasure to vote against him and I like to fantasize I and my family may have been the ones to tip the race.

Litigating of individual ballots. If 50,000 people voted and the election came down to just one or two votes that means there are probably about a dozen votes where it was somewhat unclear how the person who voted filled them out. After the recount the campaigns will find the ballots that could arguably count for them and litigate those ballots as well as try to sue any ballots which arguably might not count that are in support of the other candidate. If a race really does come down to one or two voted litigation of the controversial ballots is the next step after the recount.
