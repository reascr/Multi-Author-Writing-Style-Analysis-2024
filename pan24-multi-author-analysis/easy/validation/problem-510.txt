Can these ships be identified from these satellite images? Or alternatively followed to determine where they came from? Or is the traffic too dense there?
The companies apparently have all the data archived, and the satellites almost certainly cover the entire Baltic Sea as well as the world to the extent of their orbital inclination, so it should be very possible to backtrack and forward track those two ship's courses over several days, especially forward.
I do yes. Blowing up a bridge is far easier than something beneath water, especially when the target is in your backyard. You keep apparently forgetting how far out of the way the pipelines were and still are for Ukraine.
And lastly don't forget there is still flowing gas through the Ukrainian pipelines from Russia to EU. If Ukraine really wanted to hurt the Russians with the gas supply they would've blown up their own lines, easier to access and bigger result, as they're still being used to transport gas. And easy to blame on some failed Russian missile or partisan sabotage.
