They're prolonging their capabilities by buying Iranian missiles and dialing back how many they use from their own stocks. Also, they are presumably able to restock at a greatly reduced rate from their factories.
Like it or not, Orthodoxy would not have become a mainstream Christian church without the Russian empire, and the use of the Julian calendar by the Orthodox church went hand in hand with the Russian empire using Julian calendar in secular context too until 1917 - you can argue what came first, of course, but the fact remains that celebrating Christmas on Jan 6th/7th in Ukraine is associated with Russian colonial rule and (strangely) not Ethiopian orthodoxy. And there's very little appetite for that at the moment.
Apparently it can track and engage multiple targets simultaneously with precision. It will also work in conjunction with other inexpensive SAM systems used in Ukraine and will likely focus on faster, more powerful projectiles like Kalibr cruise missiles and aircraft. As a result, it will free up other systems workload so that they can mainly focus on smaller targets like drones and such.
