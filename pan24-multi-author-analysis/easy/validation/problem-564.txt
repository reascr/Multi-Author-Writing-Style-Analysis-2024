Corporations still cannot donate to political campaigns. The law SCOTUS overturned in Citizens United didn't deal with political donations, and your quotes show that. "Independent expenditures" aren't campaign contributions. By law, they can't have any connection to campaigns (whether that law is effectively enforced is another matter, but that's not the fault of CU). They are expenditures on speech made independently of a campaign. If I buy some paint and do a mural on the side of my house that reads "Mitch McConnell blows goats", that's an independent expenditure. If I give money to Mitch McConnell's opponent in a race, that's a donation.

Only corporations. Wealthy individuals were not affected by the Citizens United decision. If it's overturned, wealthy citizens will basically be the only ones allowed to say anything about a candidate.
