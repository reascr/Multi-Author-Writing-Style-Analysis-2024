By the way, in response to your bit that you don't think that Ukraine will survive the upcoming spring offensive by the Russians, rather than agreeing or disagreeing I'd like to point out that a loss in Ukraine could throw America's, and much of Europe's, political situation into chaos.
The aid provided has been predicated on helping Ukraine achieve an overall victory in the war, so if that doesn't happen, all hell might break loose politically, particularly for the Biden administration as they'd have to justify the spending on a losing proxy war, and you can bet that that'll come up in the 2024 election.
Okay let me get this straight . You are saying we are wrong to give Ukraine assistance now becasue we might not give it to them later ( and yes this happens before notably and repeatedly with the Kurds ) and you want American leaders to sit down with Russian leaders to stop. War in ukraine. But you also want us to stay out of Ukraine ?
