Setting aside the bizarre matter of why anyone would claim to have accidentally flipped a table over, there is probably a 0% chance that Santos was ever in a room with Schwarzman, who has an estimated net worth of $30.1 billion and is literally one of the most powerful people in finance. (A spokesman for Blackstone told the Post that Schwarzman “has no recollection of any such incident or meeting Mr. Santos, and we have found no record of Mr. Santos having a business relationship with Blackstone.”).
During a meeting in early 2020, Santos claimed that he once accidentally flipped over a table while in the office of Stephen A. Schwarzman, the billionaire private-equity investor and Blackstone CEO. “I actually sat on a chair inside of Blackstone’s office on the day of the signing of a deal…and I flipped backwards, flipping the table on the chief executive…I flipped the table on Schwarzman.”.
