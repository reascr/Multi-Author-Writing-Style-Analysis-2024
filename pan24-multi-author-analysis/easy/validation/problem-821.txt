2024 will be a major clusterfuck. Even if the Democrats outperform expectations and hold onto the White House it's possible that the Senate could flip to the GOP simply due to the map. The Democrats will have to defend three seats in Trump won states, those being West Virginia, Montana, and Ohio. If the Republicans flip those three seats they'll have the Senate majority back. This is especially considering the fact that across the last two presidential elections, hardly any states have split their tickets between President and Senate. No state did so in 2016 and in 2020 only Maine did, and that was only because the GOP had an incumbent there who was widely known for easily being able to get crossover support.
Disastrous federal minimum wage? It seems as if you view her actions from a far with little understanding of what she stands for. She's inherently selfish and does not care about benefiting anyone other than herself.
