The Texas and Florida democratic parties are a joke . Florida to this day I don’t believe even has a chair. In Texas the national DNC was no help while the GOP raked in millions from outside funds . Here in Texas we ran Beto knowing he wouldn’t win the swing vote due to his gun comments had a failed senate run and a worse presidential run , a AG no one knew , and a Lt gov that already lost twice before . First thing would be to run quality candidates which we haven’t had in Texas for many years. Democrats do very little state wide to get elected , poll closures in areas where democrats are more prone to vote didn’t help either as well as added voter restrictions . To this day there’s really no democrats in Texas with state name recognition. To even remotely be able to challenge the GOP. It goes a lot farther than the people of Texas want to be ruled by Republicans .

A la GOP supermajority in Missouri overruling voters approving independent redistricting for actual competitive races? Like Missouri making it now harder for voter ballot initiatives? I hate the blatant disregard for voter rights and will in Missouri. It is a sign of weakness in your own platform to limit voter’s say in the outcome of elections.
