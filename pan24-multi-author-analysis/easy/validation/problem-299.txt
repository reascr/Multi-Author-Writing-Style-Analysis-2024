I suppose, at least, it would be helpful to identify any potentially dangerous mutations as early as possible.
China isn't unvaccinated. China has a serious problem with the elderly population being under-vaccinated which is the most at-risk group, and their vaccines are less effective, but the vast majority of the entire population will have a vaccine and two boosters minimum.
2. Herd immunity would not necessarily be conferred against mutations. Mutations are different from the original strain; some are so different that they can evade our body's existing defense systems. This is why as the pandemic continues and more mutant variants arise, pharmaceutical companies are designing new vaccines, because the old vaccines are not as effective against new variants. Your body's immune system is no different. If you caught COVID near the beginning of the pandemic, your immune system would know how to identify and destroy that original strain. But it may not know how to do so against Omicron or any potential future variants, depending on how different they are. In other words, future mutations would still have just as much of a chance of infecting you and producing symptoms.
