This is why honestly to some degree, policies do not matter. You have boebert who is dumber than a sack of potatoes, utterly useless, and an utter waste of taxpayer dollars. Without passing a single legislation and doing a damn thing of relevancy, she is still in a close race. I wish i could be paid as much as her to sit around doing nothing, spending my time on Twitter.
Those remaining areas have 50% unaffiliated voters in voter registrations. That is what is what is throwing off the NY Times. The NYT isn't used to west slope voter distribution and are guessing that the remaining votes would split along the dem-rep registered voter percentages. They won't. Unaffiliated voters are the reason Boebert is behind. For instance, Mesa County has 106,000 registered voters, but only 15000 are dems. 40,000 are Republicans. 48000 are unaffiliated. But, the election is roughly 55-45.
