As for bringing those responsible to justice: Well, the National Transportation Safety Board is a very good, well oiled, if slow moving machine. They, along with the FAA for aircraft mishaps, are well aware that if they publish findings that lay fault, make recommendations etc. that legislators tend to charge and send people to jail and penalize entire industries out of existence. So there's an onus to make sure that all facts are uncovered and blame is laid on those truly responsible. That takes a bit more diligence and investigatory work. For airline accidents, its not uncommon for final reports to take _years_. If we see a final NTSB report on this within a year Ill be surprised. Because the report isn't just going to talk about what went wrong in THIS situation, it'll be diving into systemic procedural or legislative failures - historical inspection, safety and quality procedures, gaps in legislation and regulatory. That takes GOBS of time, you have to research and interview. "The law says this which allowed x to happen. Who _changed_ the law?".
Heh. I've been kicking around taking a course in disaster prep/management - local college has a full program in it.
