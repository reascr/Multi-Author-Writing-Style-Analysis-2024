You're absolutely right about his COVID response, but I still don't know about the cake-walk part. He did something despicable practically every day of his presidency, and was pretty widely despised. He even sent everyone money, and still lost.
YouTube, social media censor information. The CDC, WHO, NIH will post updates on their website that you may or may not notice. Social media will not allow discussion for at least a couple of weeks, USA MSM won’t cover it for a couple of months, if at all and only after it’s news in other countries. It’s needless censorship because it ultimately comes out. Nothing really sinister about the information reported, we are learning about it and the new variants. It just comes across weird because of the strict censorship. Viruses should be a political. It’s happened throughout the entire pandemic. Yes, there are a few side effects for a few people for every medicine. Refusing to allow discussion encourages fear mongering. For the longest time discussion on the origin was prohibited. What possible reason is there to eliminate it? People will not faint if it was a lab leak, it would just encourage stronger safety protocols and possibly call for discussion about increasing gain of function. If it was from a wet market,how did it make the leap, what safety protocols and testing should be put in place? Both of these items are above my pay grade so I don’t know the answer. Would like more open discussion because real science is always tested, discussed, peer reviewed.
