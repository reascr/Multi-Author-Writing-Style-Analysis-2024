Yep, limiting women’s rights and Fuck over the Democrats, two items on their list. They are good, no idea why anyone is complaining. /s.
Now I think the Republicans are absolute shit and I don't give a fuck about dress codes too, but this is you general clickbait outrage "news" set to divide people by pretending it has made the situation worse for women than it is for men when it has just brought their dress code closer to the restrictive level that the mens code has always been at.
Thank you. It’s pretty disappointing that I had to scroll this far past all of the rage to see a reasonable take like this. I’m a democrat and I’m used to republicans doing shitty things, so my knee jerk reaction to the headline was pretty negative, but then I actually read the article and saw that the men’s dress code was already very restrictive. It’s still a pretty stupid law but context matters.
