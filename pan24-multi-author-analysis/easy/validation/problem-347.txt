Plus the Russian tanks really stink inside from all the vodka farts and pants shitting that has occured. The Ukrainians need nice Chanel No. 5 scented interiors.
I mean, yes you are right. This is more like a RC. I was referring to the actual definition of a tank. This can be considered a light tank, due to weight class and main gun. Sweden's Stridsvagn are modern, and still considered tank destroyers despite the term not being used for a while. Anyway nice chat! i can see you know your stuff.
In addition, Soviet designs are apparently very maintenance heavy, and actual Russian produced vehicles have been revealed to have severe quality issues. The maintenance part in particular has come back to haunt Russian forces, as a lack of maintenance for decades resulted in much of their armored forces breaking down, both prior to combat and being abandoned once in or near it. NATO designs, in contrast, don't have the quality issue and have been kept maintained even if the vehicles were sitting in warehouses. And as an added bonus, having NATO hardware can help easing into NATO standardization when Ukraine begins to attempt to join NATO, thanks to the Russian invasion.
