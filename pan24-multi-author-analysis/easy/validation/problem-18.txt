They know they can't win this war in a neat and tidy way. It will either end with them losing and facing a shameful defeat with only losses to show for it, or they utterly devastate and overwhelm Ukraine and at least take the territory even if they nearly depopulate it.
/JFC yes /s lol. It never ceases to amuse/amaze me how dumb some reddit mothafukas are. Such good laughs.
There are no historical examples where the bombing of civilian targets has forced a country still capable of offering credible military resistance to surrender. None.
Anyway the point is that Russia's missile strategy is certainly a move, but for them to believe it was really the best use of their limited stockpile of missiles is to suggest that they still don't fundamentally understand the war that they are fighting or their position in that war. Taking out their electric grid is something you do against a military you are are already beating, and are just trying to expedite their surrender. Otherwise the best you can hope for is to slow the AFU down less than you could have if you targeted them directly.
