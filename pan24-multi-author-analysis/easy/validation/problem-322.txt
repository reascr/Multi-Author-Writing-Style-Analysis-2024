> That date was when airline agents in Frankfurt barred many Jewish travelers coming from New York City from boarding their connecting flight to Budapest, citing the fact that some of the passengers were not wearing masks, as was required at the time. But that rule was applied inconsistently, passengers said at the time, and a Lufthansa supervisor was caught on video speaking disparagingly about Jewish passengers as a group.
Exactly. If you have 16 black people waiting to get on a plane, and 3 of them are being assholes, you revoke the boarding privileges of the 3 assholes and allow the other 13 blacks to board. That is not racist. If three of them are being assholes, and you decide that all 16 of these black people are taking the bus now because 3 of them are being assholes, that is racist, and this particular incident was anti-semitic.
Already seeing the usual intentionally misunderstanding comments. A minority of people refused to wear masks so an entire group was kicked off including those wearing masks. Thatâ€™s a bullshit policy.
