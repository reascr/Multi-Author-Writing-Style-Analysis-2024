While I agree that we should stop the Chinese government from being able to collect all the data on tik tok users. We let every American and European company scour and scrape every action online to sell things back to us. Every single thing you've ever done online is stored on a thousand different servers globally. Google and Microsoft can recreate your entire life if they wanted to. It would probably take them 5 minutes.
Also, that doesn't take into account the possibility of the ccp being able to influence our society by means of suggestion(read: prioritizing content that furthers their agenda).
I've been using linux since the late 90s. I use it on literally everything I own except my daily driver. I run my own home's routers, switches, media and file servers, backup server, smart home server, I even have a home dns server and intranet. Using salvaged and refurbished hardware for all of it.
