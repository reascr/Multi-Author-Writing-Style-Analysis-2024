Compared to the other Cold War era reconnaissance platform, the SR-71, it’s quite simple in principle. The materials are rather exotic, and the mission package are quite in depth, but just the aircraft without everything else - it’s engine, wings that seem to go on forever, and a lot of clever solutions to problems of high altitude. Sure, it’s quirky - like, you need a spotter to help you land, and you have to wear a fucking space suit to fly it - but contrast that with the SR-71 which had special turbine + ram jets, a tendency for sonic booms to form inside the engines requiring these movable cones, and was generally always trying to kill her crew with unstarts and the like. I’d argue the U2 is a much simpler platform and that is why it outlived the SR-71. Shit, the SR-71 took special jet fuel, needed TEB to light the burners, and had a fleet of special tankers that just carried JP7 only. I’m saying all of this as the SR-71 being my favorite aircraft of all time.
Actually this happens worldwide - companies infringing my photos. Most of them will deny or lie about it if I contact them asking about my photos on their website.
