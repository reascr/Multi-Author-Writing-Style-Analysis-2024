I think he is trying to acknowledge it and show to his people that he cares. Putin's image is carefully managed in Russia, he has to be associated with everything that's good and not associated with anything bad. He will often complain about bad stuff going on in Russia as though he isn't responsible for it. It's a very successful strategy, there's a common belief that Putin is the good tzar who is being lied to by his vassals.
.... obviously. Of course it's fucking assumption, it's not like I work with the Russian military and am just sharing their secrets on reddit lol. But it's not an assumption that nuclear weapons take a lot of maintenance, and it's not an assumption that Russia has been lacking the maintenance on their military equipment. The assumption was that they are also lacking maintenance on nuclear warheads. That's why I said "IF they have also been neglecting maintenance on their nuclear weapons..." So what's your point? If you were half literate would already know which part are assumptions and which part are assertions.
