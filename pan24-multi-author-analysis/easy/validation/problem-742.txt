The defence review is currently being redrafted in the wake of the Ukraine invasion but I think it would be extremely foolish to pull back from “East of Suez” once again and have all that effort be for nothing. Either way, post-Brexit, there is a strong impetus to forge stronger alliances with nations in the region.

The UK was one of just a few European nations to actually actively train Ukrainian soldiers after the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, no other major European nation provided training, this was provided right up until the 2022 invasion where it was then scaled up further and moved to the United Kingdom, it also was one of the first countries to deploy massive amounts of defensive weaponry to Ukraine, choosing to do so before the war began so Ukraine could train and then forward deploy it.
