To those who think that they can just get a ‘win’ and drop some ‘uncomfortable truths’ on people with legitimate arguments against the Democratic Party’s messaging, here’s something ‘uncomfortable’ for you; Minority gun ownership in the US is drastically on the rise due to an increase in racial violence perpetrated by right-wing perpetrators/hate groups and by a lack of law enforcement to… you know… do their fucking jobs. Until the systemic issues are dealt with in an appropriate manner, Dems will lose on this issue forever. None of y’all have read anything about Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs or have seemed to make the connection that since the police are doing Jack-shit against literal domestic terrorists (see; nearly every major mass shooting for the last 20-25 years), minority groups are taking things into their own hands. You want to alienate a necessary part of your base? Go demonize P.O.C’s and LGBTQ rights leaders that support 2A Rights for self defense purposes. See how far that gets you.
