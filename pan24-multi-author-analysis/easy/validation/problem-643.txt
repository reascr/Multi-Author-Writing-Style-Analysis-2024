If you are talking about Romneycare, that was never a good label - the bill was passed by strong liberal supermajorities in the state legislature, and Romney (who was then genuinely acting as one of those centrist or even liberal leaning northeastern RINO governors - he moved a lot to the right in his 2012 presidential run) only reluctantly signed the bill, while vetoing various parts of it (those vetoes were overridden by the state legislature).
It was pretty naive of them. Also Trump did the exact same thing. Fuck the treasonous hypicritical republicans even harder. Lincoln is rolling in his grave.
If it weren't for the emails, she might have entered office with bigger majorities than Biden started with, and with the election serving as a bigger repudiation of Trump than 2020 was, so I wouldn't have been surprised if she not only got the SCOTUS liberal and got some decent stuff via reconciliation but also managed to succeed where Obama failed in 2013 and got a comprehensive immigration reform compromise passed. Plus maybe she'd have pivoted again and pushed for TPP, which would have been a good help in trying to contain China.
