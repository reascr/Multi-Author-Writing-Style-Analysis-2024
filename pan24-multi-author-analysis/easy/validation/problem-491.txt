Sometimes difficult decisions have to be made. Armenia keeps getting beaten up by Azerbaijan and Russia wants to stop this. If Armenia blocks access, Azerbaijan will attack Armenia, they will win and they will kill Armenians, destroy infrastructure and take the land. No one will do anything about it.
Region:Armenia, Karabakh, Azerbaijan, RussiThe Armenian authorities have announced for the first time at the highest level that their strategic ally Russia is forcing Armenia to provide a corridor—through its sovereign territory—to Azerbaijan, as well as to join the Union State of Russia and Belarus, reported the RFE/RL Armenian Service.
The law is clear. An agreement was already signed (no corridor language except for Lachin corridor) in Nov 2020 that ended the war. It was reaffirmed in jan 2021. This is simple, Russia wants a route to/from the meditarrean that has no international controls and to solidify its relationship with Azerbaijan while blackmailing Armenia into being its military outpost.
Look at a map. Azerbaijan needs access through Armenia to get to part of its country. There's a large enclave with a portion of Armenia blocking access.
