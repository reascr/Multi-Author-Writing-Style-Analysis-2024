Eisenhower prioritzed spending govt money on the freeway system instead of a publicly available rail transport, we still suffer from poor road conditions and increasing road congestion. Sure, yes Eisenhower did good things. He also got involved with Vietnam Civil War and did nothing to stop the Korean War (it's still technically ongoing due to NO peace treaty signed), then we wasted trillions of dollars on Vietnam. Another Republican admin forms, we waste more trillions on Iraq, Afghanistan on baselss WMD lies. Republicans are crying about "money going to Ukraine" while THEY are the ones who started wars overseas and spent trillions. Then they complain about the drug cartels in Mexico and open border but don't legalize drugs so the cartels don't make as much money when the substances are illegal. These are problems created by the GOP has made to stifle and blame the Democrats. The drug war, like other wars, has always been about money; nothing to do with public health or family values whatever that means to them.
