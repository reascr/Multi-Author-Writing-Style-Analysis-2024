You’re right. There’s no way for them to tell the under 21 military that they can be sent to a war by the government but they aren’t allowed to vote for who that government is. It is absolutely appalling that this used to be the case which is why the protests were so big and loud but stripping it away from the young people in this day and age would devastate their chances of stepping foot in office and they would lose the rather large young conservative voting block that makes up a large portion of our military men and women.
Yep. You can’t smoke cigs under 21 in most states now, but feel free to smoke ducks for money at 18, as long as you film it.

Yet another article claiming Republicans saying something without actually quoting any Republicans other than rando on twitter and a conservative radio personality.
Right. That’s exactly who they are and they were raised by the internet propagandists to be exactly who they are. They were recruited and radicalized from 4chan and gaming forums and targeted to make them as miserable as possible and to blame the misery on women, democrats, minorities, etc. And it works great, they are exactly that and they blame exactly the people they want them to but the issue is they also raised them to live chronically online and these young people don’t leave their houses to vote. Many of them don’t leave their rooms to pee and pee in soda bottles.
