I'm not underestimating him lol. He has the charisma of a wet fart. His culture war shit is only popular among the maga base. Millions of conservative voters have died in the pandemic and several million boomers are dying every year. Trump was the last gasp of a dying demographic. Also, yes, there are conservatives in blue states, that's not news. There are more republicans in California than any other state. It is not revelatory that you have relatives that would vote for him. So do I, it's anecdotal.
Dems realize they've screwed themselves by reducing their bench of presidential candidates and we're stuck with one guy who will be readily destroyed if Ron "Human Trafficking Torture Porn Addict" DeSantis gets enough momentum over Donald "Only Criminals Plead the 5th" Trump in the GOP primaries.
What the hell are you thinking? The incumbency advantage is huge, ditching an incumbent president is election suicide. Seriously, what on earth are you thinking?
