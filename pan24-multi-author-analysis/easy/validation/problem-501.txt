RTPCR should be taken 5 to 7 days after exposure. Surely some of them have false negative results. The positive results are probably those who already have the virus before the flight.
Which is immune system dysfunction/regulation. But you are correct, we are seeing this happen with COVID 19 patients. And we will be here for decades upon decades constantly discovering the long term effects of this (and all) viruses.
Exactly. This entire thread is just Americans who are assuming that EU/European regulations are as bad as theirs. The EU has plenty of laws on these things and the foreign workers are seasonal workers to help with farming/agriculture because the domestic population aren't willing to fill in all the gaps in those sectors.
Or you lost the battle. As a last ditch effort to rid the virus, your own body/immune system creates an environment that is so incredibly volatile that it kills itself. The virus will also die as it can not live in a dead body. But that’s not good news for you because you also can’t live with a dead body.
Yup there are even those of who are ethnic Chinese who are anti-China (well, more specifically the government, their overly sensitive nationalistic trolls, the scammer organizations, and the money-worshipping nouveau riches who are snapping up properties in other countries and pricing the locals out of their own homes).
And maybe some that will work. At the end of the battle your body has destroyed the virus and the baby viruses they “birthed”. You might have battle scars though, damaged lung tissue for the rest of your life. But your soldiers now know how to kill it and will get a nice tenure at the battle school to make sure future soldiers have this information.
