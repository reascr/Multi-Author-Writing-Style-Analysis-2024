"In September, the Khartoum Arab Summit resolved that there would be "no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel". However, as Avraham Sela notes, the Khartoum conference effectively marked a shift in the perception of the conflict by the Arab states away from one centered on the question of Israel's legitimacy, toward one focusing on territories and boundaries. This was shown on 22 November when Egypt and Jordan accepted United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.".
Palestinians are so overwhelmingly outgunned militarily. There is no chance any armed resistance will do anything but push Israelis further from the negotiating table and justify calls for greater security and control over areas of the West Bank. Palestinians should accept that they lost the war of 1967 and take whatever state that can get while it is still an option.
