they are called "Dark Ages" because there was a big gap of knoweldege in that period. There are TONS of historic documents in the Roman era which quite suddenly stopped. The decline in literacy also caused a decline in historic documentation. I.e. a lot of the time every early monestary had their own writing style, making deciphering them near impossible. Only after Charlemagne was a more standard scripture developed across Europe.
“Religiously unaffiliated subjects had significantly more lifetime suicide attempts and more first-degree relatives who committed suicide than subjects who endorsed a religious affiliation.”.
Lol ok goofy. Tell that to the women that are dying because they can’t get abortions. Men are always trying to control women’s bodies with religion. A man should have no say in what a woman does with her own body.
You are making assumptions and call me scientifically illiterate? Read the study for what it is and the RESULTS speak for themselves. You can make assumptions all day long. If suicide was government assisted and available, you’d have atheists lining up all day long sadly.
