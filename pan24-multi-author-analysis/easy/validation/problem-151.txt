lol. you can't see that the exact same demographic controls both parties? that the whole system is set up to protect that group and the duopoly is set up to continue to play people against each other without any real options to exit out of the dilemma...anyways, you keep focusing on the 'good' dems vs the 'evil' gop, that special little demographic that controls both is laughing all the way to the bank over how easy it is to keep people like you in line...again the system is broken or in reality working EXACTLY as planned for one certain group.
once again, the system is broken or should I say working exactly as planned by a tiny demographic that controls both...its a shame some folks are so polarized they cannot see that problem and instead just focus on the forced divisive nature of the system, continually buying into whatever piece of divisive nonsense that is put in front of them to intentionally keep people fighting and not paying attention to the real problem..it is what it is, huh...
