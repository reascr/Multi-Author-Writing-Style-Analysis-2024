I try to get democrats to label republicans correctly that they are a communist cult. They act like a modern communist party you would find in commie Russia or China. Not even getting into their Russia and putin love. Liberals tell me they aren’t communists! They are facists they are authoritarians they are semi fascist. These labels do not work. The republicans don’t care when you call them that. Americans don’t know what you mean when you call them that. We need to call them commies morning noon and night instead of the fucking gop. Because they will call us communists just like trump did and Desantis will. They will call us that with zero evidence while they cup putins balls. Democrats won’t call them communists because it may not be exactly historically correct and there are some on the far left of the spectrum we might offend. Fuck that call republicans what they are a communist cult of weak men with massive daddy issues.
