I lot of the time the fee is the company passing their credit card processing fees on to the customer. I ran the online store for a nightclub and the owners had me add a processing fee to all online orders because their processor charges a 3% transaction fee, and the store host also charges a 3% fee. Once they realized nobody was complaining about the online fee they started charging the same processing fee at the door. Gas stations have been doing the same thing forever.
Those 2 benefit very small segments of of the population as a whole, the student loans policy would target a subset of a minority that turns out to vote at around 48%, of that you need students who understand how much of their payments go to interest, a much smaller group, and an even smaller group who will remember in 6 months that they used to pay $60 more per month in loan payment, and yet an even smaller of that who actually bother to vote Democrat. You can probably put all that people in a gym auditorium.
