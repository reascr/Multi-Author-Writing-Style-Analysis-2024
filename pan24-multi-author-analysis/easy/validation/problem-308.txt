Legalization of nearly every "illegal abuse substances" would fix most of it, actually. A lot of reasons why certain natural drugs are banned is because of medical lobbying, in order to corner narcotics markets. Otherwise relatively safe and cheap drugs that would help to treat those with undiagnosed medical disorders, would force lower medicine costs as people avoided expensive lab drugs in favor of anything that might be able to be locally sourced. Lower costs means easier preventative care as well, and preventative care means fewer long-term mental health problems, the primary source of people suffering from addictions in the first place.
They are cool! The breeder did a wonderful interview a year or so ago. My understanding is their Thai is a more recent acquisition, and that Kagyu from coastal seeds was gifted, traded for, or bought some Thai seed from older people who have had the plants since the 70s and kept them pure. And he has 4 or 5 different ones.
