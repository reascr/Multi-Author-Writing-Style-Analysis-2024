This strikes me as a similar move to England’s 1950’s Royal World Tour that the at-the-time Princess Elizabeth was embarking on. Imperial influence waning, time to do a show and tell with the locals. Pretty tone deaf.
There is nothing out of the ordinary with printing the money of a foreign state, several other countries relinquish printing to foreign nations: The Guinean franc, Ethiopian birr, Ugandan shilling and Botswana pula are produced in the United Kingdom, The Mauritanian ouguiya, Eritrean nakfa, Tanzanian shilling and Zambian kwacha are produced in Germany, and The Liberian dollar is printed in the United States. But strangely, only France is ever brought up.
The relationships aren't mutally beneficial anymore. One of the major reasons is that the public opinion in France (and by extension the French government) has become much more sensitive to issues of corruption and sustainable development. There were many awful things that French companies and African elites did in the past that went with the blessing of the French government. Some African regimes miss that blessed period and just want a "protector" which would fund their lavish lifestyles and help them keep the power, but without imposing their ethics. That's why they don't go with Germany either, or Japan, even though Germany has no recent history with Africa and Japan never had, and both would be ideal candidates as healthier alternatives to France and the UK.
