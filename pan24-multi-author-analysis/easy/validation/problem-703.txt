"People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got.".
Like, if they want to legislate something about a class of people (eg, CEOs, or people claiming a certain deduction or credit), that might be more legitimate, but then there would also be no reason to request Hunter's returns, in particular, as opposed to however many randomly selected returns that meet those conditions. I really don't see what legitimate purpose they would have to request someone like Hunter Biden's returns, because he's just a citizen, unlike Trump, who, incidentally, also promised to release his returns anyway, so releasing his returns would just be helping him keep his own promise.
Also, what's someone (Trump, DeSantis, some other future GOP President) going to do, release Biden's tax returns that he already voluntarily released? Or Obama's, that he already voluntarily released? Or Clinton's, that he already voluntarily released? Fucking lol.
