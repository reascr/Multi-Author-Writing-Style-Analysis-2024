But, to be relevant, she must not file criminal charges against him. As soon as she formally accuses him of DV, his rights are automatically suspended, pending acquittal or dismissal of the charges. As he has been accused, he is now entitled (and obligated) to respond to those charges.
Still, the key factor here is that "due process" is necessary to suspend a right, and "due process" must include the right of the accused to meaningfully respond to the accusation. That right is present in a criminal case; it is not present in the process of acquiring a restraining order.
For that situation to be relevant to the matter at hand, she will have to file for the restraining order against him. There are no legal provisions for him to meaningfully respond to a restraining order. He is not entitled to counsel. He is not allowed to offer evidence, cross examine witnesses, or call his own. The only thing he can do during a hearing for a restraining order is stand there and wait for the judge to issue the order.
