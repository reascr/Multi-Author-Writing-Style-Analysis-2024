The modern-day Republican Party is the unholy union of a bunch of really stupid narcissists (mostly the ones at the bottom of the Republican pyramid) and a few very smart narcissists (mostly the ones at the top of the pyramid). The useful idiots don't know it, but the party's only real 'value' or interest is simply to hoard wealth and ruthlessly exploit everyone else to hoard even greater wealth. They'll play any culture war game the idiots want them to, as long as at the end of the day they can ram through midnight legislation to keep the billionaires out of the IRS office.
Beautiful. Raise the voting age, lower the working age, and have an entire class of people that pay taxes to the government but cannot vote for that government.

Remember, no taxation without representation. Technically we should let anyone 16 and up vote. If you're old enough to have a job and have the government take your money, you're old enough to tell them what you want them to do with your money.
