Her staff. This is VEEP but with a person with seemingly progressive dementia of some sort. She used to be sharp, I’m sure she’s hired very capable people and kept them around long enough that they can basically run the show in between her periods of lucidity. I’m not saying she’s not lucid 100% of the time, but even temporary lapses in memory of judgment have permanent, fatal effects for others. She claims to be very pro gun reform, wanting to make it tougher to get them, but she’s handed scotus to trigger happy republicans who will prevent any reform. She similarly claims to be pro choice, but then enabled the GOP to reverse roe by failing to be as mentally sharp as she once was and letting the gop pull the wool over her eyes - she makes it easy to do.
People take sports incredibly seriously. Coaches at a high level are also working a lot. I think if coaches can do it, Congress people can do it.
Narcissism. Politics demands an unrelenting desire for attention and to be loved. Which I suppose is better than the desire to corrupt the system for the sake of gaining personal wealth.
