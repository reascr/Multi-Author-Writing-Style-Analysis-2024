> The highlight reel: 76 veterans dead of COVID-19 in Holyoke at the Soldiers Home, run by a political hack appointed by Baker despite a lack of any credentials in health care. Tens of thousands of out-of-state violations unprocessed by the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles that kept lethal drivers on the roadways, including a West Springfield man who killed seven motorcyclists in New Hampshire. Commuters on MBTA trains left stranded during winter snowstorms or injured in derailments; pedestrians hospitalized after a malfunctioning escalator in one T station sent them plummeting to the ground or dead, in one case, at another station after a fall through a corroded staircase. An inept COVID-19 vaccine rollout led by a man who was once the CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. State police officers collecting pay for overtime shifts they did not work and destroying documents to hide the scheme.
