I want an unbiased article that actually gives me factual information. I'm not asking them to insult their views. But they should present the opposite viewpoint coming from scientific understanding of bee behaviour for example. They should provide counterpoints both ways and talk about these being traditional views that run counter to expert advise but also that these views have long standing tradition so it's understandable that they ignore advice. And they should go into more detail of how they are usually handled and why it went wrong this time (if this is unusual). It's important to highlight these details. The article is essentially a presentation of quotes and beliefs with no actual substance. It's lazy and poor writing.
But large proportions of westerners (especially in the US) will go to church on Sunday, actually believe that there is a supernatural being that is responsible for their fortune and misfortune, and that there is an actual heaven where certain people ascended and where people will go in an afterlife. And will hold the view above about other beliefs being ridiculous, with no irony whatsoever.
