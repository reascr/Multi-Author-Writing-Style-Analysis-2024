Liar. You're selling these systems to UAE and other Arab nations, none of which are under imminent threat (all of which are backed by the US.) The reason you're not selling them to Ukraine is because Russia will flex its muscle in Syria and shut your anti-Iran operations down. End of story.
They could make life more difficult for Israel in disrupting missiles and weapons being supplied to Hezbollah and militants in Gaza, and right now Russia and Israel seem content with the status quo: Israel continues to operate against Iranian targets in Syria, and only provides humanitarian and defensive alert systems, but no weapons.
Your final statement is the logical point. It’s very probable & would sense from a geopolitical perspective given Israel’s geographical location, relations with neighbours & Russia’s relations with countries in the region. Israel appears to be protecting their own interests which make sense, while still providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
Your example isn’t great….Israel technically did help (Ukraine up) with humanitarian aid. As for dirty hands, they could face annihilation from their neighbours. As for any excuses Israel have made, they’re very plausible so there’s nothing to suggest they’re lying other than raw emotions.
Not necessarily, you state that they’re lying as Israel is already supplying SA? That’s fine, they didn’t deny that. They stated that they don’t have the capacity which is very possible & there’s no reason to doubt it realistically.
