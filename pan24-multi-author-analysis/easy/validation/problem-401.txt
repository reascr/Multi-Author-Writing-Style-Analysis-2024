There are still a lot of units training in the EU, UK and US on equipment more recently signed off for donation, once those systems and people start getting offloaded into Ukrainian territory we'll see even further escalations of relative combat performance.
But they didn't do this. Giving Russia some hope by reduced support to Ukraine and watching Russians bleed dry, while Putin gets painted more and more into corner is surely a fine strategy. And you can't really judge this - it's a pretty good approach for the West and in the best interest of EU and US citizens. Maybe even for Ukrainians (in the long run), although they definitely wouldn't agree right now. If Ukraine wins tomorrow, Russia might be back in a year or two. If Ukraine wins by the summer, Russia might need two decades to rebuild their shit. So forth.
If you have an entire structure based on everyone being in position due to loyalty to the people above them, rather than merit… And if you have crap equipment poorly maintained because of a poor population and rampant corruption at all levels (meaning they want to steal and sell stuff, or just get away with not maintaining it)… And people conscripted out of desperation or force, rather than decent careers and a belief in what they are fighting for… It doesn’t lend itself to having a highly motivated and well equipped military who can be trusted to use their initiative.
Much agreed! It’s definitely worth watching (even it’s very disturbing at some parts). But the point is definitely that people (doesn’t really matter are they Russians or any other) are just numbers for them. Some semi-high officials of regions openly call them “trash” or “meat”. FSB director Patrushev (basically putin’s right hand) literally stated that FSB are “new nobles” in Russia, and no laws and rules common people have to follow aren’t applied to them.
I agree. Also it’s very hard to update that strategy much when you have so much corruption and authoritarianism.
