In very short, it's no surprise that banks flourished in Switzerland. The culture fits just right. But also, it's no surprise that the Red Cross was created in Switzerland, just like how this country is also a world champion in terms of international mediation. Swiss diplomats are literally embedded in all sorts of international conflict mediation (including between the US and Iran, as these countries have no direct relationship anymore, the middlemen are Swiss diplomats)...
Yeah, I get that. But there's a large amount of time in between when the preliminary results are done and when they get the final results after tabulating the ranks. It's not transport time that accounts for that.

Excellent. We need changes to the system. One of my favorite quotes, “I cannot say whether things will get better if we change; what I can say is that they must change if they are to get better.”.
