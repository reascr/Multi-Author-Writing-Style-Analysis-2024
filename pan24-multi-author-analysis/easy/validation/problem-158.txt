This is still concerning, because it looks like the new recombinant XBB strain evades humoral immunity from earlier Omicron strains. I got it within a month of getting over an earlier COVID infection, despite being up to date on my boosters. With vaccination rates low in China, and with the spectre of XBB rising, I'm concerned that China will experience back-to-back waves of infections, with the second wave coming as soon as the end of January, if the current wave continues to be powered by earlier-emerging Omicron variants.
