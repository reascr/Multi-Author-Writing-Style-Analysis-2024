About 10 years ago I worked at a screen printing shop in a pretty small “city” in southern Indiana. I used my personal vehicle to deliver a couple boxes of shirts to the boys and girls club a few blocks away. Had wore my seatbelt there but forgot to put it back on when I left and got pulled over by a city cop about halfway back and got a ticket. The cop was young, tall and lanky. Also, very nervous. He kept putting his hand on his gun and gripping it tight like he was about to drawl on me, so much that it was interfering with him writing the ticket. Then he says to me that I seem nervous. To which I exclaimed, “you keep putting your hand on your gun!” He said it was “just protocol” and I replied “it’s just a seatbelt ticket, I’m not looking to die today.” Small town Indiana, my story checked out and I was sort of danger to this guy but one move that he deemed was inappropriate and I’d been dead that day. For a seatbelt. Cops need to get their shit together before they’re allowed hold a person’s life in their hands.
