It's slightly more complex. Sometimes a leader can be chosen purely by MPs of their party (the people sitting in parliament) whereby they must get a certain amount of backing before they can be included on the ballot. Then this can either go through several rounds of elimination before the MPs select a candidate or it can go to the public membership.
When they put it to the party membership (the general public that pay a small fee to support the party) there will be debates and the party membership get to vote. There was an a disproportionate amount of coverage for this when Boris Johnson resigned. It was prime time TV and front page news coverage for weeks but less than 200,000 people, or 0.25% of the country, could vote.
No, it’s just idiotic economic policies combined with Xenophobia and a continuous superiority/imperialistic mindset to that’s making it collapse.
Shes right. She WASN'T given a realistic chance to enact her policies. Although that may have a little something to do with them not being realistic policies.
But Liz...seriously? You're saying that "a lack of political support and opposition from the economic establishment" isn't your fault? You're basically admitting you tried to force through unpopular policies that were contradicting established economic knowledge...and suggesting that failure to do so is a bad thing. Truss is right about one thing: if the system was functioning better, the UK would have much more effective leadership, which would have meant she never would have come to power in the first place.
I mean, yes, the UK is having some serious structural issues right now and that absolutely has affected the quality of the political leaders in the country. A lot of this comes back to Brexit creating a bit of a Gordian Knot situation which resulted in politicians being tasked with the impossible...which of course they failed to solve. Theresa May is probably the best example of this.
