I learned this about Ukraine a while back and I think it was Mila Kunis who said it and I knew about it since. It's easy for some to make the mistake as back then I had no idea either. But when ppl see others say it the respectfully correct them. It's an offensive way to refer to Ukraine and is an old soviet term and minimizes the legitimacy of them being a free independent country but rather some lesser. Similar to how ppl correct others when they use the Russian / soviet spelling of Kyiv and say Kiev. Ukraine uses neither and so when they get referred to in those ways it's derogatory and not respectful. But again, it can be made by accident by those that don't know and ppl will just point it out so they know foe future. That's one reason why fox news is so offensice is they can't even spell Kyiv right and use the spelling the own ppl use but rather chooses to dismiss them.
Absolutely. That decision is up to the Ukrainians and right now they seem rather busy defending their country from an invading genocidal army.
