If they’re cooperative, that means the organizers get whatever they want. Pesky democracy slows things down, adds checks and balances, and ensures the safety and well-being of ordinary people. Those all tend to get in the way of things like functionally-enslaved migrants workers who die regularly while building stadiums in the same heat deemed unsafe for the professional athletes who will later play there. Or having a police force willing to commit human rights violations and arrest/kill dissidents or anyone your dictatorial friends deems undesirable.

Unfortunately this likely would mean most WC would have to be hosted in countries with a significant leagues (i.e England, France, Germany) or countries were conversion to football is easier (US American football stadiums) or require significant logistic challenges to allow joint hosts for smaller nations or nations that don't have a deep football heritage.
2. There were many stipulations as to having the WC in Qatar, which as you can see, because of their “culture” those stipulations have gone out the window.
