> On 30 January 1933, Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor to head a coalition government; Hitler's far-right Nazi Party held two out of ten cabinet seats. Von Papen, as Vice-Chancellor and Hindenburg's confidant, was to serve as the éminence grise who would keep Hitler under control; these intentions badly underestimated Hitler's political abilities. By the end of March 1933, the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933 had used the perceived state of emergency to effectively grant the new Chancellor broad power to act outside parliamentary control. Hitler promptly used these powers to thwart constitutional governance and suspend civil liberties, which brought about the swift collapse of democracy at the federal and state level, and the creation of a one-party dictatorship under his leadership.
Not a single big fish was punished for 1/6. I actually don’t give a crap about the idiots who entered the Capitol. I care about who in the government planned it and was involved. They are the traitors (and I do not use that word too often).

Reality is constantly changing. The only way you arrive at the conclusion that standing still is the best solution is if your not really looking for a solution but rather conserving a bias.
