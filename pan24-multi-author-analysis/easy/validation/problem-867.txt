My friend itâ€™s happening, in fact itâ€™s happening right now... I spent half my adult life in the US Army, still have friends who are in and we talk. Lots of interesting things going on inside Poland and Romania right now! ðŸ˜Ž.
Putin is unlikely to resort to the use of a tactical nuclear weapon (or a radiological attack of some sort perhaps), but seeing missiles coming down on Moscow is one great way to make him seriously consider it.
No NATO country is likely to be willing to let Ukraine get missiles with that sort of range, for fear Russia will see this as a massive escalation and respond accordingly. Hitting targets in Crimea is one thing, but being able to hit Moscow is another thing entirely.
The comment you replied to was one where I suggested it would be nice to see Ukraine able to hit central Moscow as a response to missile attacks on their cities.
This isn't going to happen, but it would be nice to see Ukraine able to publicly tell the Russians that every missile that hits Kyiv will see a response aimed at central Moscow. Perhaps after destroying the Kerch bridge to make a point.
