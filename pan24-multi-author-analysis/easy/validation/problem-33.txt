Over 20 million Russians died in WW2 and Russia is still kicking. Even if there are hundreds of thousands dead in Ukraine Russia isnt going anywhere. If what you guys are saying is how it worked then so many countries would've just been wiped off the map. Man I wonder how civilization recovered after the black death, or the 30 years war where HALF THE POPULATION of a country(HRE) died. Or that time the Spanish flu killed 100 million people on top of WW1 killing 40 million. Hmmmm.
Ukraine exports about 17.3 million tonnes of wheat (5 in the world). For comparison, Russia is 1 with 33m and US is 2 with 27.3m. By adding Ukraine, Russia dramatically increases its wheat export by about 50% which would be the dominant exporter by far. This means they can also manipulate wheat prices considering their market share.
Exactly. Can't think of anyone even Russians^ would trust less to deliver on something like that than the Putin regime after its well-publicised screwing over of soldiers when it came to promised payments.
