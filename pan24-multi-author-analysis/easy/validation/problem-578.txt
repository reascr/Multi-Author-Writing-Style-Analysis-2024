> The bipartisan amendment unveiled Monday ensures nonprofit religious organizations will not be required to provide services, facilities or goods for the celebration of a same-sex marriage, and protects religious liberty and conscience protections available under the Constitution and federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It also makes clear the bill does not authorize the federal government to recognize polygamous marriage and safeguards any benefit or status — such as tax-exemptions, grants, contracts or educational funding — of an entity so long as it does not arise from a marriage.
I hate the Senate. Abolish it and expand the House. Give every Native American tribe that is recognized by the government a House seat, too.

Filibuster. The Senate made a rule that instead of having someone actually filibuster (which wastes everyone's time), they can just declare they will filibuster, which will then require a 60 person vote to overrule. Technically the 60 person vote is to override the filibuster, not the vote on the bill itself (which requires a simple majority). Budget bills are exempt from any filibuster iirc because otherwise nothing would ever get passed.
