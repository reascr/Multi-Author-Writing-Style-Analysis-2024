Why? The war started as a civil war when the Houthi Militia broke their agreements with the coalition government they were a part of and mobilized their soldiers. KSA only gets involved after the Houthi Militia, backed by Iran, overthrows the legitimate government and attacks KSA.
An Iranian controlled Yemeni state would present significant problems for the KSA's military as if Iran wanted to attack they could much more easily through Yemen.
The had a treaty with the legitimate government of Yemen to intervene if they were attacked. As the Houthi, who are backed by Iran, attacked the legitimate government that drew KSA into the conflict. It is fairly normal IR stuff.
Just like Russia is not responsible for current disagreement between Czechia and Poland, even though they literally conquered both countries and ruled them for entire second half of 20th century, In exactly the same way, Europe is not responsible for the current conflicts just because they interfered sometime after WW1.
Oh no. Not this shit again. The Saudis are doing the exact same thing in Yemen that the Russians are doing in Ukraine. In fact, the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen have been called a war crime by the UN and the US and allies who want the world to support Ukraine because of "morals" are also supplying weapons to the Saudis and buying oil from them.
1.	The original government is the one imposing the blockade (debatable term as food and aid does get through, but no fuel to transport over fears of the fuel being stolen by Houthis and used to fund their war). Saudi works with the OG and helps enforce the blockade, allowing certain humanitarian ships through. The Saudis, and this is not my exact perspective, can be seen simply as enforcing a legitimate countries wishes.
