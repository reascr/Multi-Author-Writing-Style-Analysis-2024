So you're saying it's cheaper/better to just let the Russian missiles just hit Ukrainian cities? Yeah, half a building plus a dozen human beings are definitely worth less than $50k.
A single Iron Dome interceptor costs $50k. A single AIM-9X costs $500k. So to intercept 20 missiles, Iron Dome would cost $1 million. The AIM-9X would cost $10 million.
Interceptors are valuable. Ukrainian lives are more valuable. And all those Russia rockets will sooner or later be fired into one or into the other.
Exactly. Any nation threatened by russia has an opportunity to severely hinder or even destroy their ability to wage war, for a fraction of what it would normally cost. This is a bargain for any country in europe and it’s foolish to think it’s not worth the cost.
Operational tests are commonplace. In fact, there's hardly any exercise that does not involve some form of operational test. Even the Patriots and THAADs are operationally tested from time to time, despite their age. That's called spiral development.
