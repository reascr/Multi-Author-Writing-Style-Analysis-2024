It's a bit of tug-of-war. You're right - information is more accessible. That seems to be the crux of the problem, because it means several things, both positive and negative, including: people thinking they know more than they do; people actually knowing a lot more than they used to (Trump's admin forced a lot of us to learn so much more about how government works and who is in each role); older or less technically savvy people can't adapt, and therefore, still think they can get away with the same things in the same ways without realizing how viral and deep that information can be; corrupt and savvy people realizing that people have more access to info, and thus, employing that idea and those platforms to distract and/or flood the airwaves with a mixture of nonsense and half truths to put space between their trail and those information consumers.
I’m 37. I have this vague memory of statesmanship, but it was also coated in way too much Christianity in government policy, blatant racism, and rampant homophobia. So I guess the answer is it’s only been getting worse for a long time. I’m just sorry you’re experiencing the worst of it so far. Let’s hope we don’t keep digging.
