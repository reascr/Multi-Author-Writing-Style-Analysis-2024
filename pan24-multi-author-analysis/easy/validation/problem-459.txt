The explosions in late September rocked a key pipeline that carried natural gas from Russia to Europe at a time when Moscow is using energy as leverage in retaliation for Western sanctions over the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.
Hmm. I guess my question would be who was operating our equipment at the time. did we train the Ukrainians? The Finn's? Germans? Or was it just all in a day's work?
European officials were quick to call the incident “sabotage,” and some have cast blame on Russia, although multiple investigations are underway, with Danish and German authorities also collecting evidence.
Yes. One of those suspects of course could have cut the gas line without the use of pyrotechnics, but there are some dedicated ideologues (or paid shills) in here that would love you to believe they decided to blow it up for dramatic effect. Not saying it wasn't Russia, just funny to see all of the people desperate to convince everyone that it was.
Russia denied responsibility. The Kremlin is “extremely concerned,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the same day.
