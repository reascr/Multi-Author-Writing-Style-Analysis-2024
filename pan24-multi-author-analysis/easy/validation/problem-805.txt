It's unfortunate that emulating their prophet and adhering to cultural norms around cousin marriage have undone common and well grounded taboos against marrying too close to the family tree.
Since Mohammed is reported to have married his first cousin, marrying one's first cousin has significantly less taboo in some Muslim communities and may be encouraged in others. While this isn't likely to cause problems when practiced as a one off thing, repetition over multiple generations can cause significant problems including significantly increased infant mortality rates and rates of genetic disorders due to detrimental recessive genes.
Nice. But you should definitely lie down and have pillow. You can pass out and hit your head. Otherwise it's relatively harmless. At least from a balloon. From the bottle you need to make sure you're getting oxygen. Some people plug in a breather and go unconscious on pure nitrous.
Yep, nudity isn't inherently immoral. Sure, I want something between your excretion holes and the fresh produce. But that's a hygiene issue, not a moral issue.
