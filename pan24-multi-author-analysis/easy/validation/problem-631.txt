Plan A it is then - its what we’re all really hoping for… voting, political activism, change to rank choice voting, raising the number of congress to represent the actual number of people, placing same ethical standards on scotus as all other justice but the 30 and under have to vote vote vote and get into politics-people that supported Bernie need to seriously fund this movement (gotta find a berniesque wealthy types to help fund this…) then healthcare, unions, stop corps from owning housing, in place programs like uk where government pays 25% of purchase price for first time home buyers - look at whose doing it best in the world and replicate. We need to put people in office that have the best goals for citizens nd can’t self profit off this service. There’s no reason why someone who made 50k a year before being elected is worth millions by the end of thier first term in office.
