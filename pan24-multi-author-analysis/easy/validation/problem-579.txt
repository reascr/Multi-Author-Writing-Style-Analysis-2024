Thank you. I like providing alt headlines sometimes. Good to see other people do it. I swear, eventually it'll work it's way back to editors.

Yes, definitely. The government can directly orginate mortgages without a central bank. The government can suck money out of circulation to reduce inflation without raising interest rates. The best way to suck money out of circulation would be a national property tax, with deductions for the replacement cost of non-vacant, non-obsolete improvements and state & local property taxes actually paid. As this would directly tax vacant land, abandoned buildings, and corporations with excessive state & local property tax abatements and not raise the cost of production.
