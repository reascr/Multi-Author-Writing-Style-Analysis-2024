I won't lose a bit of sleep over this. Its just Russia saber-rattling trying to get the US/Ukraine to the bargaining table so that they can get a temporary ceasefire so that they can reorganize their troops for a renewed offensive in the spring.
Bro. You think we’ve been buying $500 hammers by the truckload for the last 30 years just to let Russia get a nuke off the ground? Always remember that the shit you see is what you’re allowed to see. We’ve been doing mystery missions in space, and I don’t think they’re science missions. While Russia was reeling from losing the Cold War, the U.S. economy was roaring ahead full throttle and compared to Russia, has never stopped. Russia is so fucking far behind us when it comes to military weapons and technology, it’s unbelievable. If they fuck around, they’re gonna find out, and I really hope they don’t because the Russian people will ultimately be the ones to pay for Putin’s misstep. They need to surgically remove him and his gang before shit gets to that point.
