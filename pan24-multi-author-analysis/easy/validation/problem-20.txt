Wow. Did George ever live in WI? Many years ago I was in the drive thru at a McDonald's in Wisconsin and a young Hispanic worker greeted me at the window with the question, "Do you watch Nickelodeon?" and "Do your kids watch it?". I was puzzled and said yes and he proceeded to tell me he was in Hanna Montana and rambled on basically saying the same thing and telling me how to watch him. My kids and I just thought he was special needs maybe, because the staff just sort of ignored him holding up the line to discuss it. It was a really awkward encounter. How weird would it be if it was him?
