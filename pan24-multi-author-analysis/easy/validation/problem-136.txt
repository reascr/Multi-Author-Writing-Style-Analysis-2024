Go look at Trump's earliest statements. They are things like (paraphrasing from memory here) "It's not so bad, we have only a few cases and we'll get them taken care of" he cannot acknowledge how much of a threat it was, he has to say that he'll fix it because it is so minor, nothing to worry about. He staked his identity upon it. Then the Reich right wing media had to carry that perspective. Downplay how bad it is. Upshow how easy it is to cure it (just take hydroxychloroquine!).
