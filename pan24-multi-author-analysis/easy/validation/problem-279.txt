If you put this to voters in individual states its going to go in favor of abortion rights. Literally the minority controlling the majority. Even in red states there are conservative voters that are moderates and they lean left on this issue. The evangelical right has pushed the GOP so far to the right on this issue they've lost moderate Republicans. Even before Kentucky and Kansas we've seen voters undercut the GOP legislatures attempts at fckn over voters. Seen voters in states vote on something and then the GOP legislature either trying to undo the vote or just attempt to ignore it all together. Right now GOP legislatures are looking to push through legislation that strip voters of their power to vote on initiatives and referendums. GOP reaction to being a shrinking minority is to openly manipulate our democracy at every level to insure they can hold on to power just a bit longer. McConnell worked to manipulate the makeup of SCOTUS to give evangelicals what they wanted in return for voted. McConnell doesn't care about gay rights or abortion rights or gun rights because they're just red meat to keep voters in line. He needed SCOTUS to rule on cases small, big that aided in some way to helping donors maintain power, influence, and to keep stealing from voters in every way possible. Read the SCOTUS docket throughout the year and see the cases that the public fails to pay attention to. These cases do damage to all Americans. Worker's rights is one big area that is gutted by right-wing judges across the country and in SCOTUS. Every case has the potential to open doors or shut doors with different results that hurt us for years to come.
