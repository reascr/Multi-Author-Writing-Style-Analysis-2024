Who will cave in first to demands, who will completely cripple and paralyze the government to do so. I don't see the far right wing giving a shit if they grind everything to halt. In fact, I think they'd see that as a victory in itself. With that in mind, I wonder if there would be a bipartisan member elected by bringing Democrats over. It's possible they've went so far right of right, that the only way to get anything done is for the rest of the Republicans to go left. I doubt it but...who knows. It's only been one day.
They are voting for Hakeem Jeffries, they aren't going to vote for a Republican just like the Republicans won't vote for a Democrat, this is the dysfunction in the Republican party on display for everyone, he needs 218 Republicans to vote for him, he only has 222, 19 have now defected after the last vote I saw. The Democrats are just laughing.

I’m simultaneously relieved, and also morbidly curious. I know there’s zero probability of it happening, but I would love to see how this plays out over the next days, weeks, months?
