Now? Where the fuck have you been for the last three months? I'm a trans person, it's not "banning drag" it's trans genocide -- they're banning drag but specifically on a way that let's them criminalize trans people existing, if they aren't writing trans people into these laws directly. They're banning the only thing keeping our suicide attempts at "better than coin flip odds.".

Phrases like “adult cabaret” or “drag show” or “female impersonator” don’t really have set legal definitions, so yeah, they’re essentially using that ambiguity to establish legal definitions that categorize gender-nonconformity as inherently sexual and obscene. Once they do that, they can just rail about how anyone opposing them is pro-obscenity. It’s easy to just look at this as “well, kids don’t need to be at drag shows, and they say it’s only about obscene shows anyways,” but what they’re doing is really dangerous because it’s establishing that anyone Republicans consider to be male doing something that Republicans consider to be feminine is obscene and a danger to children.
So.... Guns around kids = just fine with Republicans while drag shows = danger to society... There is something very wrong with this kind of value system. The idea that it's better to endanger children of being shot than expose them to campy performances is mind blowingly absurd.
