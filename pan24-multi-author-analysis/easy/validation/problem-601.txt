But what would have been the benefit of keeping thousands and thousands of dead languages from disappearing over the course of human history? To what end?
I'm saying that speaking a different language and growing up in a different culture gives an individual a unique perspective on various aspects of life, which in turn leads to a more diverse and creative world.
Shit take. We could create a new language for that and not have to have any languages die. Espescially when killing languages is part of cultural genocide. Language can literally change the ways our brains work, so loosing languages means we can loose capacity to develop new and better ways of understanding the world around us.
Esperanto? I've read about many other such attempts. But learning a foreign language remains hard, even when it's designed to be easy. It's also much harder to get people to learn a newly-designed language that nobody speaks and is therefore useless, instead of an already-widespread language that is readily useful.
