Not gonna lie. I hope he's suffering unimaginable pain and humiliation. I hope he realizes that the world knows that he shits himself because he's rotted from the inside, and everytime we see him, we'll be wondering if he's wearing a diaper. I hope that thought burns his soul.
So I’m not saying some schools don’t have funding issues because that’d be stupid to say because a lot of them do, but I’m saying bad teachers are almost universal in the US education system, and that it’s often absolutely filled to the brim with sexual predators that we havnt properly vetted and removed. (Similar abuse rates in public schools as the Catholic Church but no one ever talks about it). It’s almost impossible to fire a government employee unless they say something racist or get caught doing something horrific. Here’s something you may agree with, it’s also way too difficult firing bad cops. Also once again if we spent money here in the US that would previously have been spent elsewhere, the schools would get more funding.
