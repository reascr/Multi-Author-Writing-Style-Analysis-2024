The Fairness Doctrine was able to exist for so long because it was very difficult to enforce, and thus it was hardly enforced, and it was an agreement to which broadcasters had to abide because the radio airwaves (and this includes tv which also used bands of the radio spectrum - I have a radio that could pick up the audio from my local tv stations) were seen a publicly-owned utility to be administered by the FCC. You want a broadcasting license? You had to abide by the FCC. That's out now. This is also why there was never a Fairness Doctrine for print.
