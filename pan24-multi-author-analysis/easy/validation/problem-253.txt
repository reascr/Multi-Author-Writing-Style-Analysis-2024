Taiwan seems to be doing exceedingly well regardless, and something tells me that the CCP doesn’t really have the balls to change that status quo. By the time they need to, they won’t be able to.
It's dangerous when so many people support a movement that has no logistical planning laid out for the public to see, people should know what they're getting themselves into, which is one of the reasons why Brexit shouldn't have happened the way it did, there should have been several years leading up to it so all of the false promises would have time to be shot down by people who do actual research, that's one of the reasons why Scotland's independence vote is so dangerous, because no one has a clue what it could actually entail yet many vehemently support it.
And let’s be honest here. Anyone who says it should be 75% wouldn’t agree to recognize the result if a referendum ended up being won by the Yes side with 75.1%. They’d say it was too close and should now be 80%. It’ll just never be enough.
I see it a bit differently, during the whole Brexit thing the conservatives were proposing all sorts of ridiculous stuff that wasn't feasible by any means (NHS reduced costs, rights to fully stop illegal migration just like that ect), but also weren't part of their campaign promises, just misinformtion that would slowly seep into people's minds and make them think it's good without actually having any solid evidence. Scottish independence is the same in that way, as there is no evidence that they can rejoin the EU, as they lack a massive amount of things needed to do so, also people never mention how big of a hit it'll have on their economy as a whole, most of what gets mentioned is things like your vote meaning more, how the UK left the EU, how Scotland should make their own rules ect, but just like UKIP it's all fanfare to make the public support the idea, without having any actual evidence that it'll play out any better than Brexit did. It's dangerous making such massive decisions, Brexit showed that, and there's no reason Scotland should make a similar mistake.
