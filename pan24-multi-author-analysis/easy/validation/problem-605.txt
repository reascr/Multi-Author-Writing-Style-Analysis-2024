Yeah, but it might actually be a blessing in disguise for them. If they get him appointed Speaker l then they can absolutely vilify him 24 hours a day and cast all the blame on their inability to get stuff done on him. Which would sure beat working for a living.
This is in contrast to typical establishment Republican politicans, who have always sought to consolidate power and fall in line because some people understand the importance of being a key to the kingdom, rather than to be the king themselves.
but on this one? this is disgraceful. these 20 are halting the business of the government so that they can try to force things to be passed that republicans were unable to pass when they had larger majorities and the senate (things like term limitations and a balanced budget act.) if they could not get them when they had large majorities, how are they supposed to get them now when they have essentially no majority in 1 part of 1 of the 3 branches?
