In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. Most House Democrats and the overwhelming majority of California House Democrats voted against the Iraq War including Pelosi, Barbara Lee, and Maxine Waters. Another reason to dislike Schiff.

Absolutely not. Some people take certain drugs for some specific side effects and not for the main purpose of the drug.
Completely disagree. Go read Schiff's book. He's one of the few truly honest dedicated public servants we have right now at senior level. Porter is great but Schiff deserves to be a Senator at this point for all he's done. Plus it's time to give them back some of their "owning the libs". Nothing would piss them off more than a Senator Schiff.
