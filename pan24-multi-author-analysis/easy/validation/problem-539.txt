The thing with the Challengers vs the T-72s is more about logistics, the reason it's taken so long to get western tanks supplied is that we have to set up a logistical train and make sure the manufacturers (who are private companies) are ready to supply parts. We don't have that problem with T-72s because a bunch of the closest NATO nations are ex Warsaw Pact and can supply and even manufacture parts for the Ukrainians and are themselves looking to modernize on US and German equipment which is more modern and integrated into NATO logistics anyway.
Lol have you? Do you? Forgive my bluntness, but you don't seem to have a fucking clue, given your claims earlier that "99% of Sahrawi consider themselves Moroccan" and that Sahrawi people in Laayoune are "under no oppression", when I just showed you video of Sahrawi in Western Sahara, including Laayoune itself, literally celebrating Morocco's defeat and getting brutalized for it.
Food. Ukrainian grain feeds around 200 million people around the world, majority in Africa, exports 10% of world's needs. 2 years ago Morocco , I don't think it changes since then. Tunisia also buys Ukrainian grain and its like 60-80% of all grain imported in Tunisia. I have friend in Tunisia and he said when Ukraine stopped export by obvious reasons, there simply was no flour in Tunisia and no bread at all.
Seriously. Our best friend hardly anyone has heard of. One of the first to recognize our indipendance in 1777 and our oldest unbroken diplomatic relationship we have.
