Donâ€™t worry, corporations have no morals, they will still invest and buy from you as long as you can give them what they want at the lowest price.
But I suppose none of that matters as corporations will just buy from the cheapest country anyway. (Edit: Or maybe not, all eggs in one basket approach has shown itself to be problematic. Guess it will depend on how much risk vs low prices corporations will accept.).
Iraq was to remove a dictator and became a development project, Saudi Arabia's leader has been strongly criticized by the US regarding human rights, and Guantanamo Bay is being shut down, although it was too long a site in legal limbo. However, the targeted murder of civilians by Russia in Ukraine, a land grab not seen since Hitler and Stalin, and removal of 13,000 infants from their families go way beyond a ything the US has done. India should condemn Putin's invasion and not purchase blood oil. India's imports of Russian oil has increased 30 fold since Putin's mass murders began.
