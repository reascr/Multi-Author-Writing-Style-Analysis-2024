People like to forget that “the West” is not a monolith. Some parts can be pulling their weight, while others (like, as you mention, Germany) can be wringing their hands. This is particularly applicable within Europe, where there is a distinct East/West divide, and I have a feeling that’s who Zelensky is referring to with this statement: Western Europe.
You mean me? Yea I’m entitled because I’d like healthcare such as most first world countries have. Yet Ukraine needs a MORBILLION dollars. How stupid are you? Tax dollars should go towards your own community. If the military wants to support other countries let’s take it out of their ridiculous budget. Hopefully you aren’t being serious.
Blocked by who? Every single NATO member by deciding not to invite Ukraine? They wouldn't have passed the membership action plan to join, which is why they weren't invited to join the membership plan. You should look into the status of Ukraines government before 2015.
What indecision? Has the west not done enough yet? Zelensky should start trying to recruit from other countries. Offer citizenship and land when the war is over.
