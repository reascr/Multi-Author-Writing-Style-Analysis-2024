He has to run again. In his mind, it's the only thing keeping him from being indicted. I honestly don't know whether he could get the nomination over DeSantis, but my dream scenario is they both run, DeSantis gets the nomination, and Trump runs as an independent, splitting the conservative vote. He's easily narcissistic enough to knowingly sink Republican's chances of retaking the white house in order to be able to proclaim his immunity from prosecution for another 2 years because he's a political candidate. It's not even like DeSantis could promise him a pardon if he drops out, because 1, there's no way Trump can let himself believe DeSantis could succeed where Trump failed, and 2, it looks like some of the charges coming are at the State level, so a presidential pardon wouldn't reach that far.
Absolutely! I'm hoping Biden is smart enough to retire with the legacy of having saved us from Trump and someone like Gavin Newsom or Gretchen Whitmer is the nominee.

Possibly. The hard core MAGAs I know we’re not passionate about politics at all and then Trump comes in and “isn’t a career politician” and now that is the entirety of their lives.
