It's depressingly common. I'm currently over a year into litigation against a school that did this in PA, CEO said similar things regularly, i'm told average is 2-3 years to reach a settlement, in the best possible scenario. In the meantime, most employers won't touch me with a 10-ft pole. Also their only legal obligation in the end is for them to pay the difference between what I would've made at their job vs what I actually made instead. Would sure be nice if Biden and congress emboldened the NLB, and/or Shapiro and the newly Democratic state house made right to work laws a priority. As long as the entire system is stacked in their favor, employers will continue to act this way.

Exactly. Universities have raised tuition far in excess of cost of living causing the youth of America to do deep into debt instead of being able to grow the country. It has become a business and the kids are just consumers with no price limits.
Universities favor... Who exactly is "universities"? These are for profit businesses run by greedy Presidents who fucked themselves out of CEO jobs and board with extreme ideologies meant to keep them in power.
