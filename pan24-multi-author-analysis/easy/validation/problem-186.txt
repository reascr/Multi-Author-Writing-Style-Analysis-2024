The current leadership of Russia, and any Russian who continues to glorify them? Absolutely. If the government is replaced, though, treating the citizens as complicit will just drive the new government to resent the rest of the world, until it repeats the atrocities of the previous one. Even if it means allowing a small percent of sleazeballs to escape consequences by switching what side they claim to support in public, it'd be worthwhile to engineer a social environment that leaves the masses content with the new status quo. So I'd say, if their government gets properly replaced rather than just turned over to a new wave loyal to the ideals of the old, that everyone continues the hatred and vitriol but directed at "Putin's Russia", giving the new country an out. Don't ever let them forget that period of their past, but much like today's Germany is politically distinct from nazi Germany, those who choose not to behave like the old regime should be rewarded for their self-improvement, at least by sparing them some of the hatred so long as they control themselves.
Japan? No, never was, and people don't fucking care because everyone (aside China, but fuck China) moves past it instead of sitting and waiting an apology.
