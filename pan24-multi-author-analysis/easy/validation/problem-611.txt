Sadly the American public as a rule takes elections as they come instead of punishing its political parties (primarily the Republicans) in multiple consecutive election cycles like they should if they want results, to the point the Republicans gerrymander themselves enough corrupt mitigation even if the public at large did go 'Maybe Republicans should be punished in 2024 for forming the Tea Party/Freedom Caucus in 2010 given it still has relevant corrupt and fraudulent impacts today...'.
Stock trades. It's totally legal and totally cool for members of Congress to use inside info to make timely investments. They can't share that info with anyone else, technically speaking, but that's where the rough $500k probably comes from. Congress only reports in ranges so it's hard to pinpoint statistics. Point is, that Redditor isn't completely pulling numbers out of thin air.
