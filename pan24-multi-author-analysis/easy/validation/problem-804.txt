Bar the immigrant, jail them, separate their family // work to improve the conditions that drove them to overstay their visa, make a path to forgiveness and get them legal.
It's the immigrant's fault for coming here // it's whatever they're fleeing from that made being a fugitive look better than staying where they are.
What is to be done about illegal immigration, and republicans will say - put them in jail, be cruel to them so others are afraid to come here, make it harder to come here legally, forced labor programs, send the military with orders to shoot on sight.
What is to be done about crime and drugs, and republicans will say - bring back the death penalty, public executions, make prisons more brutal, make sentences longer, forced labor, forced sterilization.
What is to be done about homelessness, and republicans will say - put them in jail, send them somewhere else, forced military service, be cruel to them so they leave, just kill them off.
What is to be done about protests and riots, and republicans will say - brutality so horrible that none will dare protest again (hey it worked in China), use mustard gas, send in the military to kill them all.
