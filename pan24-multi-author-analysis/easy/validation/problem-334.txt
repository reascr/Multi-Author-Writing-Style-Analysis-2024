Do you mean safety from sexual violence? \7.2% of Swedish Women reported being exposed to a sexual offense in their lifetime (self-reporting = more accurate measure of sexual violence than court convictions), while American women self-reporting as victims tops \%20.
Why? Who cares? Never in my life have I heard of a person running into any problems with this, but you can never open the newspaper without some politician or other person in power getting caught recieving money from a person who he later gave a big contract to, like the current prime minister who recieved an apartment from a corporation who he sold a bunch of socialised housing to for a cheap price. He would NEVER be caught unless someone close to him ratted him out. But even then, how would they find out? All those documents are classified.
Really? Damn, as an American, I'm pretty surprised to hear you feel that way. From my perspective, it feels like we've been the world's laughingstock since 2016.
Not necessarily. I donâ€™t know the wording of the Colombian law, but Involuntary manslaughter would classify as killing them and not be considered murder.
