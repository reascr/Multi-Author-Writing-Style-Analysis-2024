It's also unfortunately urban planning. Take a look at the ongoing drama with expanding Heathrow airport in London for a good logistics comparison. You can't just "move" people and you must move a lot of people either temporarily or permanently in order to restructure infrastructure. Watar mains, gas pipes, plumbing, roads need to be laid and houses rebuilt. All in all people as a whole hate their lifestyles being uprooted and when you have people who's families have lived in that little house and fought for keeping that house across generations due to rapidly decreasing real-estate availability and rising housing costs for a new home....good luck convincing them you'll "take care of them" if they agree to relocate for infrastructure adjustments when the country is in the state it's in (that's ignoring trust in politicians to even carry through in their promise).
I dunno. I've travel India a fair bit... Kerala up to Mumbai, and most of Rajasthan. It's an incredible place... but also an incredible amount of rubbish, everywhere I went. Probably the least was Hampi, but as soon as you got to anywhere with roads and houses around, just the same, rubbish everywhere. Not sure it's fair to say that western media makes it look bad... It's not really hard.
