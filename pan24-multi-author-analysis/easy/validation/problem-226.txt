Great. I see no problems with forcing politicians to represent their constituents if they want to keep their jobs. You know, since their jobs are supposed to be representing their constituents.
mmmmmmmmmmmmm idk. I think that was put in place to sew distrust in the election process in general. Regardless of how insane the claim is it is a conditioning tactic for his base.
