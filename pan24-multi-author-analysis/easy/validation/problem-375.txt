This is great. My dad was exposed to Agent Orange. The last decade or so of his life, it was very difficult with neuropathy & breathing issues. More should be done to be proactive to help vets.

Ehhhhhhh. Kinda. I’ve had two mental health doctors suggest it tell me it can be scheduled, then it’s not scheduled. I’ve tried to deal with it myself and did manage to get an antidepressant for my body dysmorphia a few years ago which has helped. But with the shit I went through it’s hard to admit that I’m vulnerable and need help as I’d asked my chain of command for help and they told me that they believed my ex over me, then they’d have me go to the hospital when I showed up bruised, as tho they didn’t know what had caused that. They’d also told me that I had to go to counseling with him so yeah, I’m not really mentally in a place where I feel like anyone will believe me or give a shit that I need help.
