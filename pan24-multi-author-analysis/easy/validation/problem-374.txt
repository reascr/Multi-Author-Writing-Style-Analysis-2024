And boebert is a horrible person who I despise, doesn't change the fact that several times tlaib has been antisemitic. Just because Republicans are awful doesn't mean I'll support antisemitism. That's the point of my comment, she's a hypocrite. She claims this language is bad then she uses it herself disguised as "I'm only against Israel" while calling Jews sneaky and greedy and at one time literally retweeting a poster about ethnic cleansing all Jews from Israel.
Now one time her "accidentally" using a antisemitic trope I'd forgive and be understanding, but she's done this a lot. Every time she either hides behind saying she's not antisemitic just anti-israel but the language she uses is always antisemitic tropes. That or she'll either give a half hearted apology or do nothing and hope it goes away.

Denialism? They literally bragged about it but you were probably too busy rage wanking over Tlaib to notice.
