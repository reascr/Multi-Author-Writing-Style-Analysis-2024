My 8th grade history teacher told us this when we were learning about the first ebola outbreak that happened in the 70s. Scared the shit out of me as a kid.
no it’s not, i’m from Nigeria and we’ve seen what not taking vaccines can do, vaccines are government funded and at times completely compulsory, i’ve taken close to 15 different shots since i turned 10 (i’m 19 and i can’t even count the number i took as a child, they literally come into the schools and vaccinate the kids, then register them because most diseases require more than one shot, they also go house to house and mark the houses they’ve gone to so you really have no choice) i’ve taken multiple vaccines for meningitis, yellow fever, hepatitis, covid, polio etc, i wish american vaccine deniers would just come to Africa lol, the diseases that’d kill them wouldn’t even have to work hard, 3 days max but then again they can’t even visit, our embassy won’t give a visa without proof of a yellow fever shot.
