Inflation is not the sole metric to determine whether an economy is healthy. The UK is performing solidly worse than the larger EU countries or the US. If you take a look at real GDP % change, the US economy has grown by 4,2% since Q3 2019 while Canada and the eurozone have grown 2,1% respectively. The UK on the other hand? Its GDP has shrunk by -0,4%. The UK economy is performing worse than its neighbors even if its inflation may be slightly more manageable than that of other countries. But honestly, that shit does not really matter. The rest of us Europeans are fucked as well, even if just slightly less so. The fact is that the world at large will almost certainly be in a recession sometime the next year. But because the UK has made trade that'd otherwise help enrich both itself and it's neighbors nigh impossible the way out of it will be unnecessarily long and cumbersome.
Seriously? Literally no one in the UK thinks he meant deploying the military as strike breakers. If the article was somehow unclear for you then you can google it and watch the actual BBC interview.
