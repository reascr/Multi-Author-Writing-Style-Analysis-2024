Meanwhile in Indonesia looking at the religious fundamentalists they seem to be more concerned on social conservative issues such as LGBT's, Sinfulness and other human follies such as free sex that they believe are the cause of natural disasters. Like really they don't think global warming will impact their lives at all, but if it does they're ready to blame it on the west for causing it, not because the west pollutes and litters (were at a time when both sides don't particularly respect the environment), but for not following particular instructions from a particular god, of a particular belief from the middle east. Yeah were all fucked mate.
The Chinese government is hypocritical. They expect the world to forget how they conquered and claimed their neighbors lands and continue with territorial expansion to this day. Then, in the same breath, they point at Japan's defense spending and cry fowl because the Japanese tried the same nonsense nearly a century ago.
Chinese mentality... They hate each other across Asia because everyone tried to invade everyone in a certain moment in their history, with great loss of life. China tried to invade everyone in his area several times, with more or less success, and Japan was more successful in the 20th century at the same game. Japan changed his game after WWII and they're more successful than china in soft power.
