Comparisons to Jesus, MLK, etc. are forms of delusions of grandeur. Mania can give a massively increased sense of self importance and an unfounded sense of greatness that are part of that. Right now, Kanye is literally viewing himself as being on the same level of significance as MLK. In the past, he has also compared himself to Jesus. These are typical features of a manic episode and part of the grandiosity and inflated sense of self that goes along with it. I think the important thing to realize is that Bipolar disorder isn’t an external disease like a virus, rather it’s just how his brain naturally works, so the fact that he made the mental leap to compare himself with MLK is consistent with that manic frame of mind.
Thank you. I was an LCSW, but I worked with kids so mood disorders were rare. I always wondered why the DSM has never created a diagnostic category for those who have exceptionally long manic periods. It is clear by Kanye's behavior the lenh of his manic state is markedly longer than what the manual says.

I'm unmedicated bipolar. I've been working hard at it, so stuffs not so severe now, but I could get manic for a few days to a week at time before I crash and get depressed for a month or so.
