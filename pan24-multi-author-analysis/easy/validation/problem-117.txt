In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes. There likely is at least some written communication between Gym/his lawyers and the Jan 6 committee providing his excuse for not complying with the subpoena. Throw the language back at him.

Exactly. Biden should cite the precedent they set of ignoring subpoenas and just ignore whatever else they say from there on. It’s like dealing with a toddler. Their tantrums don’t matter if you ignore them. They only become a problem if their parents cater to them whenever they throw one. The dems should let the GQP scream in a corner. Eventually they’ll tire themselves out and the American public will tune them out.
