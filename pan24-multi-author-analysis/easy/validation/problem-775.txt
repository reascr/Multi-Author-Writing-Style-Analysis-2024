Remember when R use to use the “are you better off now line of BS” they sure as hell didn’t do it during trump Re- election campaign but they did figure out how to make our lives miserable by passing laws when they had total control to screw us over today and tomorrow and if a D won - those laws will still be in place (example- let’s take out train safety regulations that Obama put in place) ALSO- why the fuck didn’t they do immigration laws when they had the majority? It was all build the wall Mexico will pay for it but NOTHING got done on immigration- they did pass…wait for it….tax cuts for the wealthy! We need our youth to vote , it’s their future and they need to get these morally bankrupt politicians out of office.
Exactly. I worked with progressive orgs in Texas for 10 years to turn Texas blue. It only got more red as the people fleeing from NY and CA aren't the liberals. Texas is going to be R for a long time, all sanity to the contrary.
