To say all news travels at exactly the same speed is not true tho. News during the election cycle is always going to be much faster than news outside the election cycle. The current situation also cannot be viewed in a vacuum. While it took a while to get the documents back from Mar-a-Lago, the use of the FBI to seize the documents painted the issue in a vary public light. This will naturally charge the next instance of unreturned classified documents. While the general public may not have been as interested in the Trump document issue until the FBI showed up, that template would not translate over to the Biden document issue because people are now alerted to the potential danger of classified documents just lying around in a former president or vice president's private areas. Also, the Trump document fiasco happened just one month before.
Hahahahahaha. How many stashes are we up to with Biden? 3 maybe 4. Scattered all over the country. Even in closets next to his corvette. Top secret Documents on Ukraine This is huge! He wasnâ€™t even president when he took them.
