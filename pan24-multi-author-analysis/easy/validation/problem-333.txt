> In this particular case, the comment "Hopefully not an [Object object]!" is a humorous way of saying that the object in question should not be mistakenly referred to as Object in this context. The follow-up comment "You need to use its toString() method, clearly they haven't thought of this" is making a joke about a common solution to this issue, which is to use the toString() method to explicitly convert the object to a string representation.
Electrical systems? That's a new one. Calling bs on that specific detail. edit: see thread below where I find I am wrong lol.
Probably. Assuming FTL isn't possible, you'd need a massive shield to prevent any tiny dust particule (or even atoms) to just shatter your ship while going at a reasonable amount of the speed of light.
And if FTL is possible, it would still probably require a shields missile proof to get in and out of it. Or not, but most likely.
Yeah, I consider multiple direct witnesses across an entire county, and multiple direct victims that consist of entire families who claimed to have both witnessed and experienced abductions, to be wide (both literally and figuratively).
Loads of sightings across an entire county, direct experiences of multiple families who experienced an abduction at the same time.
