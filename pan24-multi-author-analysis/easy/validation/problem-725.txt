I used to be a professional musician, playing drums and singing in R&B/Variety cover bands. FWIW, I was the only white guy in the band for most of that time. The first time I went to a particular friend's house during an off-day in Oregon, her four pugs ganged up on me, and just covered me in pug hair and drool. And when I got back to the bandhouse, one of the band's singers saw me walk in and said "Boy, you look like you just got freaky with a Bigfoot!".
