Honest question, do you really think a Biden presidency or a Harris Presidency would be much different? People put way too much on the actual person when the politics of the party are the more important factor. The messaging might be a little different, but Harris is not going to do anything drastically different from Biden if something were to happen to Biden. The difference is Biden has such a I’m 80 years old I don’t have any shits to give that a younger person doesn’t have. He literally does what the majority of the dem party wants. Now you can agree or disagree with the politics of the party itself, but the fact is the person if they are not on the fringes of the party is irrelevant for the most part.

He's relatively moderate Dem that's not particularly exciting. Even his wins have been impressive given the partisan politics but overwhelming not that great overall.
