Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government is pressing the two countries to crack down on individuals it considers terrorists, including supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and people the government suspects of orchestrating a failed 2016 coup in Turkey.
Their rhetorics have changed, to save their own faces in public. Their campaigns are trying to erase their pasts, they’re more aggressive now than ever about having political power. They’ve just become sneakier and people are falling for it in droves.
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson held talks with Turkish parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop on Tuesday before being welcomed with an official ceremony at Erdogan's presidential palace, where two were scheduled to discuss Sweden's NATO membership.
Sweden still has "many steps to take" to win Turkey's approval for its NATO membership bid, a top Turkish official said Tuesday as Sweden's new prime minister visited Ankara in hopes of eliminating the hurdle to his country joining the military alliance.
