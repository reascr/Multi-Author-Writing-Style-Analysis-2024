It's like Trumpian "winning". If you refuse to admit a loss, you can keep claiming victory even when someone else wins. It doesn't matter that reality gives the true winner the office and the title. You just keep claiming whatever it is you want, and keep telling constituents you won, even if it's from the back of a cop car on the way to jail. People laugh about George Santos, but he is only living the shameless life of a loser who won. And even if he loses in the future, he can still claim he won. This makes things so much easier I could never have gotten in to medical school, but according to their model, I can just call myself Doctor and start sending bills to Medicare. I'm set for life.
… isn’t just being a Republican a humiliation? Isn’t “republican” just another word for “struggles to define reality” ? It’s not really a functional political party or working off a functional developed and evolved political strategy so being Republican really means you’re “lost in the world with no other employable skills”.
Are you sure about that? I thought it was just a majority of the house. Parties don't really exist in any of our government rules.
