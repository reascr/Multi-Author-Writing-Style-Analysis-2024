It was the same with Ukraine before Russia annexed Crimea, after that happened there was overwhelming support for joining NATO.
Not sure what part of this is so complicated for people to grasp - Russia's annexation of Crimea made Ukraine want to join NATO again, and dramatically increased public support for NATO in Ukraine.
LOL nice way to handwave away the fact that Ukraine re-started the process to join Nato after Russia attacked - and the claim he couldn't have been elected if Ukraine started to join NATO in 2008 is just straight up nonsense.
And FYI - Ukraine was blocked from joining NATO after the Bucharest meeting, withdrew their application and the majority of Ukrainians did not want to join. It did not change anything.
I even can bet with you that after Ukraine win this war, and obviously ask NATO about joining alliance, and i think I don't need to explain why NATO needs Ukraine as participant of alliance, NATO leaders will softly refuse to Ukraine, saying bullshit like "yeah, doors are always open, Ukraine deserve it, but its looooong process, we are not suuuuure, we need to start negotiaaations, consultaaaaations and maybe in 30 years or more, we will find out, Ukraine will get a chance to not join NATO, but become a XXL VIP ultra best NATO partner, because you know put any stupid reason here" - or simply will start singing the same song that Ukraine been listening for many years from NATO.
Link please. I did see an article on this about a month or so back. From what I understood this was a local bank and was not a systemic risk to their system. Nothing like the a Lehmann's event or the like.
As i said, NATO is military defence alliance and question about joining or not joining is based on national security and defence interests, decisions in which can be taken only by government with military consultations and have nothing to do with public opinion at all. Its not fucking political alliance, which would need public opinion for joining or not joining it. Ukrainian government and military were ready to join NATO in 2008 and had all decisions needed for it already on paper - only vote of parliament were needed to implement it in law, and parliament already was supporting it. Everyone knew that russia will attack Ukraine next after Georgia, no-one knows when it happen, but it was obvious it will happen. It was only Merkel's decision to not allow us to join NATO.
Public opinion have nothing to do with joining to NATO at all. Literally everyone in country can oppose it, but if parliament vote for joining and NATO agree that country can join NATO, all you need is only your president sign on document about joining. All this referendums about joining NATO is only consultative and can't change decision of government about joining or not joining NATO.
