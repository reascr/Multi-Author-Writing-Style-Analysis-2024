The west, western media, and social media are painting far too rosy a picture of what's going on over there. Super glad we are sending serious tanks now, but it's many months late. We should have sent these at the beginning. It's ridiculous to think that Russia was going to let Ukraine win this with anything other than a complete and total military defeat. And that takes a lot.
Soledar is militarily insignificant. The West is looking for them to take take back strategic land in the south, not asking them to give up land just to give it up.
Exactly. I think people here start to create narratives based on wishful thinking. Virtually everything that guy suggested in his post is just objectively untrue.
Reasonable logistics routes, production capability, population, infrastructure, level of fortification, symbolic value, level of damage, level of local support/resistance, resource availability, and consideration with regards to larger war objectives.
It almost sounds like he's describing a game of Command and Conquer. "All Ukraine needs to do is exploit that gap in their line with a tank rush and they're going to be set!".
