Yeah I’ve heard, and it’s definitely no coincidence that eggs are a stand out in price increases due to that, but it’s not the only skyrocketing staple food. Like I said, idk how big of a part of the problem this is, and no matter what the answer to that is in reality, it’s an exasperation of a wider lack of oversight. I personally think that grocers and healthcare should not be allowed to be a for profit businesses. People have to eat, so we either end up subsidizing the population and having our tax dollars go to the grocers, or we subsidize production and our tax dollars go to private mega farms. I don’t have a good answer for how to fix that. But the reason I see this being an issue with food especially is the demand for food as a general category can not drop. With these pricing systems that turns into a form of tacit price fixing. I’ve been hearing that Trader Joe’s, sprouts, and Whole Foods all have eggs in at reasonable prices. The official reason is that they use different suppliers, but I think this type of pricing model contributes to it. They haven’t seen increased sales on those at those stores because they all cater to the upper middle class, those folks don’t start eating more eggs and beans when the water is looking choppy. I also don’t see much conversation at all about Kroger buying out a bunch of other brands when people who are being realistic are acknowledging there are more food shortages ahead. That should be raising alarm bells.
