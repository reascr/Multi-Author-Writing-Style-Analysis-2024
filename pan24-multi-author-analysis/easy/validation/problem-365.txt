"Have you heard of this magic black juice called fossil fuels? Wait, don't call us fossils--that's not nice!".
My answer is, we make a rapid transition to renewables a priority so we can leave them behind and happily ignore their protestations and political leverage/positions, including on focusing too early on carbon capture to their benefit.
True. Because no one has the courage or money to fight them. Things will go on as such until the world is a cinder or drowned from melting ice caps. A few of them, almost eight billion of us...hmmm. I wonder what we could do?? ðŸ¤”.
Even if you run a carbon capture device on a green energy system, you are putting that green energy system to waste in your mission to reduce carbon dioxide emmissions, as that green energy could have been use to reduce emmissions directly, and more efficiently, instead. Because you are now using that green energy for this carbon capture, somewhere else in the world, someone is going to need to use fossil fuels to compensate.
No, carbon capture can only mathematically, at least in current circumstances, contribute to greenhouse gas emmissions.
Are you insane? Profits from oil and g as sales don't exactly go into R&D for renewables (save a tiny fraction which they're doing purely for PR reasons).
