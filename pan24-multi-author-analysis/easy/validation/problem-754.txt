What you're really asking though, I assume, is: is this ready to start developing for market? The answer is unfortunately no, not yet, but we're much closer. Think of it like "we're not there yet, but we can see the finish line clearly now." No fusion tomorrow, but also no more "fusion is always 20 years away.".
We can now focus on the other issues of creating those conditions, more efficient lasers, containment systems, industrial systems for energy generation at scale. Most critically, the existence of this verified result potentially encourages further and larger levels of investment into the space, and potentially makes the idea of a profitable fusion industry a possibility.
Thatâ€™s not what you said. This is just not a fusion power plant. It is a fusion reactor however. The canned response to any piece of fusion research ignores all the developments in the field.
Any headlines that say this is a breakthrough that will lead to fusion energy are ill-informed, as the process here has no scalability. This is absolutely a milestone however, and one that will be listed in the history of fusion power.
