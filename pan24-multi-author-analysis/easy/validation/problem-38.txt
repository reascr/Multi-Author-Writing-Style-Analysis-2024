Literally millions of Chinese are employed at less than a dollar an hour to do nothing but comment, post, share, and influence online rhetoric around China](.
I'm not talking about the user, I'm talking about the literal China Daily staged footage that was Orchestrated by the Central Propaganda department.
I'm not talking about the reddit account that posted it, I mean the actual footage is staged footage from China Daily, literally a news source that is owned and operated by the Central Propaganda department.
It was literally staged footage, first posted by China Daily, while all media is state controlled, China Daily is literally run by the Central Propaganda department, state controlled and propaganda party controlled are very different, feel free to google it.
...No? There's not a single country in the world where the nation has a single heartbeat, where even a censorious government lets things pass because they'd rather trick some (local) people into thinking they were doing something so they could say it was just some random idiots saying it. Because it's just some randos saying something the government knows isn't true without the need for guidance from above.
