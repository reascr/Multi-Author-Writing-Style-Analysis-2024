China is no way near ready for an invasion. China has emptied its strategic national food reserve (pork) due to covid and without that, its people would starve during an embargo in just 2 months. People don't understand the amount of food China imports from USA, South America, Australia and Africa just to feed their own people. They also have not finished building their navy fleet. Their drone fleet though will probably soon go into mass production. The reason China is making headlines is to distract from their own covid problems. They are facing a 2019 like shutdown for the whole nation around new year. So those jets are just a distraction, for now.
If China could manage to incentivize Taiwan economically further (combined with Hong Kong, they receive \40% of Taiwan's exports currently which is about the same as UK's exports to EU) slowly vassalizing it without using military force could be a peaceful end goal that doesn't involve risking China's stability and global economy. Of course Taiwanese citizens aren't that easy, thankfully.
