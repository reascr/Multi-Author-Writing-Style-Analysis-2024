This area is well within the Przewod√≥w village limit, The stirke is said to have happened 6.4kms from Ukraine border according to polish goverment, the approximate distance from the center to the border is about 7-10Kms. This is not a big differnce in area of strike. Not to mention, Lviv and Kyiv co-ordinates that was taken city center which must not be the case it must have been targets in the vicinity of the city. This is well within the range.
Remember we're negotiating with Russia, quietly. Most likely a misfire. I think we're throwing them a bone in the form of a little cover. Realpolitik.
It's not too far fetched. And there is no better time to fake a russian strike in Poland when Russia are currently launching a barrage of strikes at Ukraine.

Yes, that is true. Underestimating a military power is not the right thing to do. Thanks for your positive feedback, will be more careful with my words going forward.
