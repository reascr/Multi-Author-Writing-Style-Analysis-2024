Mushrooms helped me quit cigarettes. I had a wonderful evening in the woods and have not hd a cigarette for almost 7 years. Like a light switch , it just shut off the need/want. Now I can smell one from a mile away and it makes me nauseous.
I’d imagine that decriminalization is a significant step towards reducing arrests and administrative costs. Then once it’s decriminalized wouldn’t the next logical step be to make it safe for the people who do use it? IIRC during prohibition, there were attempts to deter alcohol consumption by deliberately poisoning it with methanol, and that didn’t accomplish any reduction in alcohol consumption as far as I’m aware, it simply blinded and killed people. Similarly, keeping the drugs dangerous wouldn’t accomplish anything towards reducing usage, would it?
