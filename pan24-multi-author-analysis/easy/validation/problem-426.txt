I appreciate someone bringing some reality to the situation, but to add to that, the fine that they get has to be larger than the amount that they would pay to their workers in benefits or they will just sign the checks for the fine and write it off as "the cost of doing business.".
This is because we had the brilliant piece of shit stupid fucking idea to reward the handlers of critical infrastructure if things go wrong, mostly because of lobbying, propaganda, and a general culture of messiah-like worship around capitalists that own this kind of infrastructure. They should go down if their shit fails. That’s the core god damn tenet of capitalism. But it’s not how the real world works, and bad people manipulate a system because the system is predicated on a kill or be killed doctrine. So we fucking reward the rich when shit goes tits up. This means it is quite literally more fucking profitable for the owners of all this shit to light it all on fire than for them to meet their workers’ needs fully.
