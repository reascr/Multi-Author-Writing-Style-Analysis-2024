So, it's another space race. This time it's China vs. US. Nothing like a challenge to get the team spirit going. Seems to me solar makes more sense than nuclear for long-term habitation. But I'm just a sci-fi dweeb. Also thinking long-term leapfrog potential for other projects. But, I'm just a dweeb.
The problem is how much energy can be stored at once for example the moon spins on it's axis once every 27.3 days.even if we cna store it in this case a base it should be simple for a base but then in emergency situations(I am not sure if there ever will be one I am no expert either) you won't have more capacity than you already have.my point is nuclear reactor makes us more flexible while solar energy can be used as a secondary source(as I said I have no qualms with solar energy in fact relying on one type is always result in fault).
That's cool. So, helium-3 and nuclear fusion is a very different story from the headline. The other side of the moon seems like a safer location for an experiment that could result in an explosion 100 times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Japan to end WWII.
