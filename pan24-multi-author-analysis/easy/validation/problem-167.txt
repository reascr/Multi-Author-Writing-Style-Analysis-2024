It's plain as day. The exceptions are not exceptions from appellate jurisdiction, making it original jurisdiction. The exceptions are from appellate jurisdiction to no jurisdiction. Original jurisdiction was already defined previously. If the drafters had meant it the way you're wrongly interpreting it, they'd have written the original jurisdiction portion to say so. Something like, "In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, those in which a State shall be Party, and any other areas Congress may deem necessary, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction." That would be an exception allowing for congressional discretion over original jurisdiction. But that's not what they wrote, is it?
