Trump selfishly set this up for 100% guaranteed failure because he knew Biden had a strong chance of winning if the “rigging the votes “ and coup failed, he could disrupt by Biden trying to pull this off safely (under the conditions, he actually did) - people died from trump childish bullshit (again) but he doesn’t care. In this case you can’t ignore the facts that led up to this pull out and I hope it is exposed because trump should’ve been investigated for the planning and deadlines of this tragic fiasco he planned- but other crimes he committed took precedence ( thinking about it, there must have been hundreds of crimes he committed while in office because we can’t hold presidents accountable while holding office and he could get away with it) - stupid fuckin law and blind spot that needs to be fixed).
I’m glad we got out. It wasn’t perfect but it could have been way worse with what Biden inherited. We had 6,000 total troops when he took over. The numbers were so low that we needed to really depend on local Afghan security forces. This is why we pulled out of Bagram because we couldn’t trust the Afghan military anymore.
