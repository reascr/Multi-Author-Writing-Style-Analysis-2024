They basically built a city from the ground up to be able to host the championship, which is unprecedented. Normally, FIFA expects you to already have all the infrastructure required to host a world cup, and countries "only" need to make some changes and build a few stadiums. I mean, it would be madness to grant the biggest sport event in the world to a desert just because they promise they'll build a city in 10 years, right? right?
even in my shithole country, 1 death would be enough to halt the construction and put someone into investigation, it is almost like they are saying that they died for thre greater good, this wc is going to be a shitshow, i dont like sport, but i would ocassionally watch it because of all the excitement it entails, i am not watching any single match of this crap.
Right!? Like Brazil was obviously a poor choice but at least Brazil has one of the best football cultures in the world and boy o boy does Brazil know how to party so it makes much more sense than Qatar.
