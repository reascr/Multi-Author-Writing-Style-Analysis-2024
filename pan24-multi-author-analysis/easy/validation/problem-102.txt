The phase where indictment is appealed because it's unconstitutional for someone who holds leverage and threatens Senators. This will be appealed multiple times until the Supreme court agrees to put it on it's docket, later. When it comes up it is pushed back to the lower court where that judge is charged with bias because he has ethnic origins of someone Trump has publicly made vulgar statements about. An investigation is made into this judge and his name becomes a rally cry of extremist groups and he is forced to step down. A new judge is installed and there is a national discourse of this judge who makes a statement of impartiality despite owning 2 Trump memorabilia stores, a backer in a Trump golf course, and a condo in Trump's ass. He rules for Trump and the media and everyone watching has forgotten entirely what this case was and pin their hopes on Trump being indicted on charges of obstruction of justice for not providing evidence on a character assassination charge over a rape allegation that was ruled could move forward in 2018 and Trump publicly admits on social media that he knew her, he raped her, and that she was much more rap worthy back in the 90's.
Blah, blah, blah. How many phases are there? I can't keep track. This is just like the Trump is going to be indicted any day now headlines we have been hearing for years. I am not holding my breath that justice will ever be served.
