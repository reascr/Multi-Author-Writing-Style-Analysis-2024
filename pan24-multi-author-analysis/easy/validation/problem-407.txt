"Stop saying we sent the drones to Russia that we sent to Russia, otherwise we'll be forced to send drones to Russia." Not much of a threat when put in context.
Unfounded accusations? Zelensky has incontrovertible evidence, namely, Iranian drones shot down on a daily basis including fragments as well as completely intact drones.
Wow. Appreciate the source. I knew about executing drug smugglers and users but this is the first on deliberately injecting them with narcotics to get them addicted. I need to read more and about Iran HRM.
For this reason and based on other shenanigans, such as falsifying causes of death on official documents, dumping the beaten bodies of people who poofed out of existence for a few weeks out unmarked government vans, shooting protestors (both lethal and non), raiding school dorms and abducting student dissidents, forced confessions under torture and blackmail, and a multitude of other tinpot-mullah bullshit, NO, I'm wouldn't be fucking surprised if they were injecting people with stuff after they got rounded up to default court cases more firmly in the prosecutors favor.
