"Exxon’s science was highly adept and the “projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models”". they use past tense, implying that the models used to be at least as skillful as others. had they used present tense, the implication would have been that they still are. the study itself, which is linked in the article, specifies "the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007.".
In exchange we largely ignore costly externalities such as mass extinction, loss of coast lines, more wildfire, stronger storms, bomb cyclones, an endometriosis epidemic and a generally unhappy population but yeah, we found the cheap fuel and ExxonMobil shareholders made a profit.
Yes? It's saying that Exxon's own scientists were skilled and knowledgeable and came to the same conclusions as other independent/government scientists, not that they were somehow more skilled and knowledgeable than modern scienctists.
