Andrzej Duda, President of Poland, has said that he understands the position of his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said that Ukraine was not responsible for the missile that landed in the village of Przewodów, Poland, killing two people on Tuesday, 15 November.
Previously: On 16 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he was convinced that the missile that landed in Poland on Tuesday, 15 November, was not Ukrainian.
Details: The Polish president said that Zelenskyy’s claim that the missile that landed in Poland was not a Ukrainian missile is based on the fact that "everyone wants to see the evidence they want to see.".
And if people dont care enough about dozens of children being murdered to force their government to enact basic restrictions that literally every other first world country has then honestly what makes you think they'll force their government to start WW3 and end the planet over 2 randos?
Yup. Zelenskyy is watching in horror as Russia murders civilians on a daily basis. Gotta be a helpless feeling.
'That said, whatever the final conclusions may be, it is clear that the party ultimately responsible for this tragic incident is Russia, which launched a barrage of missiles on Ukraine specifically intended to target civilian infrastructure. Ukraine had — and has — every right to defend itself. '.
Sure, Article 5 doesn’t require military intervention, but the Polish people are the second-most Anti-Russian populace in Europe. If their President said Russia killed Poles with a missile, they’d be baying for blood. This response avoids that and saves face for everyone except Ukraine.
NATO has every reason to point the finger at Ukraine here in order to reduce tensions. Also, the situation is days old and still being investigated with little known for certain.
