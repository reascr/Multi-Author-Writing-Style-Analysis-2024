Why not Estonia, Latvia and Luthuania then? My point is, one more border wouldn't make any real difference. Plus Ukraine did offer to drop NATO membership, Russia declined and ask for land, makes me think NATO membership was a handy excuse at a time, since we never really heard about it again after.
If main war goal was to stop NATO expansion why no accept a peace deal where Ukraine drops NATO application? And why 4th border matters but not previous 3? This still makes no sense to me, they were handed their goal on a silver plate and they refused. As well as USA or NATO will invade Russia, can someone really believe that anyone in the world, maybe besides China, wants that massive territory with millions of insurgence rih after Afganistan, especially since Russia has nukes and submarines, planes, maybe ships carrying nukes and cruising around the world at all times, nuclear proof shield is a fantasy at this day and age.
