You would be suprised to know that I attended a party in 2003 in iran. The cops found the house and came inside to arest everyone. They took all bois and girls in the party. Took em to court next day and the judge said cuz there is a probability of sex between every non married couple in the party.he ordered for every one to face rape charges for men and prostitution charges for girls or geting randomly married to one another.
Absolute insanity. And they wonder why people have a problem with “their ways” this is horrible and the fact that the government supports it is disgusting but the victims family supporting it is just gross and despicable, all so they can say their daughter only “had sex” with her husband, refusing to acknowledge that rape is not sex and is not consensual 😡🤬🤯😤.
I try. This is the closest I could that speaks for women. . Then there's the "unless", the commentary, the whole tone of disrespect that decides over women's fate. I give up.
I definitely don't think we can honestly compare the tiny minority of fundamentalist religious nutjobs in the US to a country whos legal system, at national level, supports rapists by design.
