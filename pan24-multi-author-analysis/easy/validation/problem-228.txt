So the software dev field is a bit complicated here, but to generalize it, the more credentials or higher skill the job is the more insulated it is from market effects. It's why the ice cream shop down the street is offering almost 80 percent more than it was 2 years ago but software devs are probably seeing something like a 10 to 20 percent increase (I'm speculating,) but that pressure still exists. At some point there's a potential software dev that stays working IT, a potential IT guy who stays working doing computer repair, and a computer repair guy who stays working at the ice cream shop because of the upward pressure of the wages from the bottom, so it also creates a shortage at the top.
1. I know 6 people who don't have jobs all 6 have said that they aren't willing to work for minimum wage. All 6 have a significant other that works. Money is tight but not that tight.
Oh and I'm getting tired of western countries playing the immigration card for damn near everything - there are certainly benefits but instead of investing in training, education, and paying more so the nation's population can fill the gaps at living wages, many western countries just poach talent for (relatively) cheap labor, depressing wages for citizens while failing to address training and education their own people.
2. I have a friend who runs a surveying company. He can't hire new grads because he pays $2500 a month to start. He has said that he has been told that it isn't enough.
Notable too that the tech industry has been on absolute fire because of growth companies in the inflationary cycle, there's a reason big tech has been doing TONS of layoffs disproportionate to the market recently, and why the number of openings rose so quickly in the last 2 to 3 years (and it's not just remote work/covid.).
It's demographics. People working versus not working, by age. So as population declines, there is an unbalanced number of older people who don't work but still need services. The shortage is the younger people who work.
