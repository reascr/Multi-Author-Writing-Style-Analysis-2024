If maga politicians win the aftermath will be devastating to this country. It won’t be until open relations fleecing American interests to Russia, open handshakes and hugs with Russian leaders, Europe and Canada cutting ties with the US and the dissolution of NATO and 10s of thousands of supposedly Christian nationalists sisters and daughters dying from health risks associated from the abortion ban until the avg conservative voter will realize that they sold their country and democracy down the drain to “own the lives” at all costs because they were stupid enough to believe the psi ops being waged against the US. After true Americans take back their country these former maga supporters need to be treated they the same way woman in ww2 who whored themselves out to the nazis.. publicly shamed and sent out to live their lives in exile to live as second class citizens stripped of their right to vote because of their treason.
