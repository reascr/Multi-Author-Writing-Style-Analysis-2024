It's generally financial bad advice to have 56 billion dollars in one basket. In March, Elon This allows him to both liquidate Tesla stock and do a pump and dump with twitter. He bought 73.5 million shares at a price between $33 and $38 per share, which comes to 2.4b-2.8b. He broke the news of buying those shares on April 4th and the price went up to $51 per share at the peak, or 3.8b. He just make a billion dollars in a couple weeks by having a high profile and that's it. A couple guys who have influence have made similar plays recently, ask r/wallstreetbets. He was following this easy social media trend to make $71 million dollars a day for 14 days of minor effort. And he's before, , and been reprimanded . I guarantee he was bragging to a couple people about his free billion dollars.

It's intentional. The top execs are always struggling for power and sabotaging each other's projects. It's pretty embarrassing how much vicious MBAs have taken over google for a company that used to pride itself on technical leadership.
