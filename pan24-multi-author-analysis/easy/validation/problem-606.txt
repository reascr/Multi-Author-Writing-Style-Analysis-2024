Are we just going to start referring to Paul as hammer man then start posting parachute pants GIFs and MC Hammer songs? Stanley Burrell could use the money.

Err, no, no we didn't. The Shah was already the legal sovereign of Iran, who was deposed after Mossadegh refused to step down when ordered. Mossadegh also proceeded to dissolve parliament. The US then backed the Shah's return to power. A very different scenario to "installed.".
Republicans have been really openly pro-Russia. We know Russian troll farms have been astroturfing online areas. We know Russian money is and has been flowing into our political process.
Democratically elected, initially. Then decided that laws didn't apply to him (like being legally dismissed by his head of state) and literally deposed the Shah (his head of state), and tried to shore up his own personal power after dissolving parliament. You're defending another authoritarian who ran his own coup, acting like he was some innocent hero of the people instead of just another player in the geopolitical mess that is Iran.
