Just like when he threatened the girl that he could make her disappear like her friend, or his helicopter crash that killed 3 top executives at his casinos while he was under investigation for money laundering. He even leased a different helicopter and didn’t use one of his many because his name is on them, he is often known for not wanting the trump name being shown for negative press, he even would have his name covered up when things were taken in for repairs, like a previous landing accident with his helicopter.
Exactly! People like him, putin and kim have just been given everything they want their whole entire life. They have never done anything themselves even a days work. It’s like they were raised to be sociopaths. The good news is that no dictators ever truly get to live without the consequences in the end. Really when you look into it they’re no different than manson, full of shit losers who cant accept the consequences of their actions and blame everyone else for their own faults.
