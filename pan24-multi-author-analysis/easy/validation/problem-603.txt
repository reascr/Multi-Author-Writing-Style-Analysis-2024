So according to Mr present only matters, Bangladesh 1971 genocide, kashmiri pandits genocide in 90s are just hoax aren't they. Cuz one is where west supported Pakistan and other is where west kept it's mouth shut and supported Pakistan. There is a world out there other than the hyped ukraine. Even if the above happened today or like Mumbai attack, the generous and morally high west gave advice to India that keep the business going with pakistan. So keep your circus to yourselves. India has always helped passively to even foes, e.g. Operation Dost where even after criticizing India on Kashmir, India is aiding help to turkey and for your ignorance, India also send medical supplies to ukraine. We are not uncle sam or morally high west to go poke nose to claim ourselves morally high and teach others how to be.
They trade a lot, significant technological and industrial partnerships (including military equipments) etc.
We don't need any promises from anyone. We're not starting or stopping anything that doesn't help with our interests. I'm sure that 'right now' you mentioned will not take much time to happen and when it does either it will be becuz bad people are doing bas shit like in Iraq or will ignore like Bangladesh or when Pakistan started several wars with India. Let's not forget how west turned blind eye when shit hit fan during departure of US from Afghanistan. Not our monkey, not our circus.
