about the first I dont see the government repress that, they dont agree but they dont repress that. Of course people can get mad about everything and is not the problem, but doing something just because you want to make someone mad is not the intention behind freedom of speech/expression.
yes, its a loophole because the intention of freedom of speech/expression is that the government cant repress different arguments, ideas and concepts.
just destroying something with the intention to provoke and this is his only intention according to interviews is not the idea of the freedom he enjoys.
doing something for the sole purpose of provoking others like the intentions here are, has nothing to do with the intentions of freedom of speech or freedom of religious choices. But its a loophole and an internal "problem"(the loophole) of Sweden, no other country has the right to interfere.
Completely different. Protesting the invasion itself from the US won’t do much. Protest for the government to take more action against Russia and aid Ukraine, and that’ll make a difference.
