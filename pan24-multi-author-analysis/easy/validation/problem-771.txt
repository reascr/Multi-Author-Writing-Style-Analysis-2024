I don’t know if it’s better or worse it took so long to get to him before he died. A lot of the inflammatory events could have been adverted had the area been cleared of gawkers and idiots could work together instead of trying to proclaim they were going to be the genius to free him. I just feel so awful for his brother and friend desperately trying to get him out while rescue workers played strategist from a safe distance. The absolute disrespect his body was treated with afterwards is appalling as well.
