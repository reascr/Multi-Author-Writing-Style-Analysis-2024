Yes, but 12 tanks is barely enough for a (smaller sized) company, with no replacements for losses. For reference, on paper, Ukraine fields 31 mechanized infantry brigades and 7 active and reserve armored brigades. Ukraine will take anything they're given right now, but 12 modern tanks is not that significant in the grand scheme of things. Ukraine and Russia are fighting along a 2000km front with 100,000s of men on both sides. What Ukraine might contemplate doing with the Leopard 2s, to the enormous headache of their logistics and maintenance personnel, is disperse them among numerous platoons, and field a high-low mix of tanks, where the modern tanks' better sensors, rangefinders, and sights provide targeting info for the guns of the older tanks and for supporting artillery and drone units.
This was my thought. What is the tooth to tail ratio for the Russian military? Also, you usually have to train support troops. I guess they don't die at the rate that front line fodder does, but still. 2 weeks hardly seems adequate to train a conscript for a support position.
