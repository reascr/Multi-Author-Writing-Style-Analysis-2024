And no, Germany does not backtrack on defense spending. The money is there, but planning is not ready for instant spending. And guess who has been responsible for military planning over the past 16 years? Yes, Springer's favorite german conservatives. Pot, kettle.
Also (if it works the same in Germany as here in Sweden) the Regering/Bundesreigerung/Ruling Party can't really decide anything, they are the executive power, it's the Riksdag/Bundestag/parliament that decides and tasks the Regering/Bundesreigerung with executing said decisions.
Who is Springer? Did not catch their name in the article, nor as writers of the article. It is a noticeable difference in stance from the Zeitenwende speech shortly after the invasion of Ukraine in February, no? Is there really good reason for why they're not planning/attempting to match the 2% NATO commitment on national defense spending before 2025 now? Especially during a time of tense conflict on the borders of NATO that have transformed the post-Soviet terms in Europe.
