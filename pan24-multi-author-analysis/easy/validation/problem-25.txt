I am a gay man. I am right leaning but libertarian. I agree with gay marriage and weed legalization but I disagree with Democrats on some issues. I guess I am politically homeless. I did vote for Biden in 2020 not because I liked him but because I think that Trump has little respect for the Constitution or rule of law, ( confirmed by his recent comments) and his irresponsible handling of COVID-19 and his irresponsible rhetoric and behavior on the issue.
How is it not? I mean sure, in a better world those shouldn't be things. In this world, however, one party straight up hates LGBTQ people and constantly tries to legislate their rights away.
When one party constantly votes to harm LGBTQ people and the other does not, the term 'identity politics' becomes completely meaningless.
