Not to say you’re wrong for feeling that way, but that sentiment is exactly what both the Republican Party and certain foreign governments want you to feel. They want people so disgusted that they want to throw the baby out with the bath water. They want you to lay the blame for the disfunction, inaction and disruption at the feet of our entire governmental apparatus in particular, American democracy in general, and all our politicians equally, no matter how aligned they are with your interests or how effective their lawmaking or policies. They want you to look uncritically at the whole mess and ignore the people/organizations that are directly responsible for both the chaos, and the narrative that the chaos is everyone else’s fault and unavoidable. It’s an been an incredibly effective approach to derailing this country, tapping into our most deep-seated societal fears and (so-far) repressed fascistic tendencies. Characteristics that have long been sidelined and papered-over by polite society, aspirational ideals and moderate voices who understand the necessity of governing. What’s replaced it is orchestrated disenfranchisement, manufactured outrage, and political nihilism. These people want to fiddle while Rome burns, but have zero appreciation for, or understanding of, what the world will look like when it does (except the Russians, they’d probably be cool with it in the end).
Interesting. I didn't think that the 20(well there are only 6 holdouts now) had any connection beyond a desire to get as much as they could out of McCarthy. What makes you think that they've got connections with Russia?
