What puzzles me is the utter lack of mainstream reporting of the missing $30billion disater tax, the recorded comments of Erdogan praising his efforts to bypass building regs for earthquake resistant buildings. Its already yesturday's news.
Turkey has no enforcement of building laws, rampant corruption at every level of supply chain and government, a weird old law that says you donâ€™t need planning permission for any building that is built in one day that has a roof on by midnight (or something), idiotic unskilled construction workers, and where everyone has given up on asking for things to be fixed under a mad tyranny.
Yea. It's the governments fault, but the blatantly wannabe Russia style authoritarian kleptocratic system Erdogan is trying to build won elections and reelection without faking the results and with minimal protest. Yes, obviously there were crackdowns at attempted protests. But after the Maidan movement my expectations for what people can accomplish if they really want to remove their thieving, authoritarian, piece of trash rulers are a little higher, especially when that country is part of Western alliances that protect it from the outside.
