Because "they" the Amungme , Kamoro and other highlanders have NEVER practiced cannibalism unlike Americans like Antron Singleton and two dozen others I could mention. YOUR allegation that "they" have "cannibalistic beginnings" is PURE RACISM about indigenous nations & individuals about whom you are making up fantasy. Now if you or Michael Rockefeller want to sick your nose into Asmat territory asking if they would mind your family building a cargo harbour for exporting Papuan gold, copper and silver that your family wants to loot at Indonesian gunpoint; that's your choice just don't complain if they do decide to remove the colonial trouble maker they've got their hands on.
I apologise, that came out all wrong. I absolutely generalised in a way might have offended you. Sorry, I take it back.
'Separatists'? Do you mean people fighting for their independence after Indonesia invaded their country? That's not separatism, that's freedom. The west, particularly the US, sold them down the river.
(Edit - apologies for my generalisation everyone. I've crossed it out, and tried to better phrase what I was getting at, hopefully in a less offensive way. I don't like generalisation, so hope I've improved it).
