That’s all they know how to do anymore. They can’t lead or govern or problem solve. They had control of the house, senate and White House from 2016 - 2018, all they managed was tax cuts for the richest of Americans. While immigration reform was then and continues to be now, the biggest campaign issue for all republicans. But when they were actually in a position to fix it…nothing…nada…crickets. Because they don’t care. They only know how to be dissenters. They are self serving assholes that use hate and decisiveness to hold power and built their individual wealth. Wake the fuck up, stop voting for these pieces of shit.
Others\: Women, gays, minorities, immigrants, non-Republicans, non-Christians, middle-class, and poor.
I dont know. They seem fairly related, although not directly. What I mean is, would you even trust a gas station cash register to one of them? You know that drawer would end up short every day.
