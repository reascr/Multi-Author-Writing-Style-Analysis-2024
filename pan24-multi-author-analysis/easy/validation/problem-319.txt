I am Serbian. I don't support our current government. None of my friends support it. I don't support any kind of aggression against anyone. I don't hate Albanians. I do have opinions that are not based on the manipulative media. I believe confessions of people who have been there. Both sides. Let me just tell you that most people living in Serbia don't want war. We have had too much pain and suffering in the past. And we are sick of it. We all just want to live normal lives. We are not fcking animals as many western media portray us. Our economy has suffered terribly because of past wars. We are family people who want to be able to work and live with dignity. When NATO bombs where falling I was 10, my sister 1 year old. We didn't ask for that. We didn't choose Milosevic, and we didn't know what was happening in Kosovo. None of our parents knew. I wish that experience to no one. Please, stop talking about Serbs like we are some kind of enraged beasts that want to go on a killing spree. There is a small group of nationalist extremist idiots in every country. And please understand that you don't get all the information to have such strong opinions against Serbian people. Have you been to Kosovo? Do you know what started the unrest? Do you know what Kosovo special forces where doing in Serbian municipalities fully armed with automatic rifles and snipers? Do you know that they where badgering civilians, confiscating whatever they liked, took away what people needed to survive, destroying their businesses? Those people are poor. Do you know how many attacks on Serbs there where in the last year? How many graveyards and churches have been desecrated? Do you know that Kosovo is a holy ground for Serbs? And now a child aged 11, and his brother 21 where shot while they where taking oak branches to their house on Ortodox Christmas eve that celebrates peace and family. One more Serbian boy was beaten by some Albanians on the next day. How is that OK? They are young boys who should have a right to celebrate their traditions with their families. They are civilian, not military. I do understand that Albanians suffered too. I am not one sided or blind to their suffering. When you loose a member of your family in war that stays with you forever. It happened on both sides. But this crazy revenge... I have no words for it. Those seeds of hate are sowed by politicians. I think it is soo stupid that we let politicians and media manipulate us into hating each other. And please, visit Serbia and meet Serbian people before you judge based on what you hear on the TV. I have been to Albania, and I can only say that they are people just like any other. They live normal lives, and they deeply care about their families just like we do. I wish harm to no one. Stop the hate. Enough of wars.
Serbiaâ€™s former province of Kosovo declared independence in 2008 following the 1998-1999 war during which NATO bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, to protect Albanian-majority Kosovo.
. So unless we know both sides of the story it is all going to be speculations.Like the person who claimed in this thread that two people were killed which turned out to be a lie.
