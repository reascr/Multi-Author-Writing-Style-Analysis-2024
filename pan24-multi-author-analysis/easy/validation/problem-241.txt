Exactly. That wasn’t a rebuttal. This wouldn’t have flown in a middle school debate class. It was a generalized whine session, call to arms that could have been pre-recorded weeks or months ago. Just another angry white woman in the south sucking the tit of family connections and entitlement.
I'm a fiscally conservative/socially liberal republican. I have never been at a lower point than I am tonight. The President of the United States is literally a "weekend at bernies" prop that that the dems keep shooting up with drugs and rolling out on a hand truck to the American people and 1/2 of the country actually cheers.
