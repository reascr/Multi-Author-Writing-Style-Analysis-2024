Money diverted, maintenance not done. All the engineers who knew how to make critical parts nearing retirement and no way to quickly build new and better stuff except on paper.
Literally. A lot of Thermonuclear bombs use Tritium or some other light gas to aid the secondary fusion. That shit doesnâ€™t stay in there forever. Think 3 week old helium balloon.
Exactly. They don't even need the nukes for this matter, they could annihilate Seoul and 10s of millions of people within an hour with just conventional payloads. The nukes are just the ace up the sleeve should the US decide they're gonna take over anyways (a dumb assumption, but one born out of paranoia, which the Kim regime lacks none).
Exactly. Given how much grift we now know has riddled their conventional military which has actually been in use regularly, what are the odds that the money allocated for maintaining nukes ended up in some commander's bank account? Especially given that nobody in their right mind expects nukes to ever actually be used.
