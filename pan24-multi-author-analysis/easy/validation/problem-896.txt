There's also the danger of becoming the very thing you're trying to combat. If by trying to uphold and defend civil liberties for all, you slowly start eroding civil liberties for some, fascists will keep finding ways to circumvent such legalities. Sooner or later you'll have no choice but to keep implementing new "hatespeech" laws and thereby becoming an evermore authoritarian system not unlike fascism itself.
Some governments are even using retoric similar to yours and their censorship laws to combat legitimate political movements under the guise of fighting fascism. Look at how China brands the Hong Kong protestors as fascist. Or the way Putin justifies his invasion of Ukraine to "fight the facsists.".
No idea what this guy's deal actually is, like most people, I'm not very interested in listening to obvious nutjobs - but no matter how insane what he believes in or espouses is, I can not imagine a single situation where restricting someone's feedom of movement (across most of a continent, even) for 2 years because of anything they might think or say is reasonable.
I don't. As a question is shouldn't exist. That fact that a question like that can be asked is already crazy.
