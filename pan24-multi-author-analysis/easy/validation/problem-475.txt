There was their Red River Rebellion before that. That resulted in the creation of the Province of Manitoba. This was before Louis Riel started branding himself as a prophet.
Frankly, these people leaving the field as a result of being underpaid and the incredibly stressful working conditions resulting from working in an underfunded education system seems like a fairly obvious outcome. Given that it's the Ford government that continues to both cut education spending and both direclty and indirectly supporting private schools it would almost seem that it's intentional and is being done specifically to seek that end.
3. I like how you quoted me saying that wages aren’t the driving force of inflation but then responded as if I said wages don’t affect inflation.
Please refer to my earlier point about how inflation outpaces wage increases, hence being moot and providing no actual benefit. If wage increases caused inflation, why are inflation rates considerably higher than wage increases?
Also, there is literally no job on planet earth where a 1% raise a year is not a literal decrease in pay; even inflation rates that are considered economically acceptable/healthy are like 2-3%. Doesn’t matter if you’re a CEO or a fry cook, that “raise” is a pay decrease.
