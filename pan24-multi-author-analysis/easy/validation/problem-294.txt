You should have supported them when China broke all agreements and imprisoned the opposition and installed their own political leaders. Now, they have no chance of coming back.
The \west\ also turned its back on economic liberalization by promoting anti-free-market intellectual monopolies. Copyright and patent steal from us all and must be abolished. 50% of all corporate profit is now through intellectual monopolies raising prices above what they should be naturally in a free market. Corporations \hate\ free market capitalism and have worked hard to achieve regulatory capture and propagandize us to believe copyright and patent are about helping poor starving individual artists/inventors and not the billionaires.
I don't know about that. China's economy since 1958 deviated from the Soviet "centralised economy" to a "de-centralised but still totalitarian" economy and there was no intention to ever give up on that totalitarian aspect of managing the economy on a macro level.
No, I don't. No one can predict how long Xi will rule. No one can plan for a life without him in power. The future is unforeseeable by that definition.
