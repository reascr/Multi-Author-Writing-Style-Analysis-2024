It’s stupid, but it is what it is. I had a patient from Netherlands once, and I had to explain to him that I’m not asking his religion for discrimination of whatever it’s just standard practice, something that I needed to write down in the medical record for accountability. He said he’s an atheists, so I ask him if I can just put him down as protestants as they usually don’t have any restrictions for drug prescriptions or whatever, so it’s less of a hassle. He agreed and that was that.
Or, and hear me out, they’ll end up like me where they’re forced to bear the full weight of a lifetime of mental and psychological abuse from these kinds of parents and then turn to drugs as a way of coping and it’ll fuck them up even more until they’re 30 and have no idea what life will hold for them but know that it won’t be good probably.
1. Non-registered donors (“new donors”) take a couple of weeks to process before they can donate blood for the first time. There’s no certainty any of them will be a match for the child or eligible to be donors, and even if they are, they can only donate one unit of whole blood every 3-4 months each. If the child needs further transfusions before the donors can donate again the problem just comes back.
