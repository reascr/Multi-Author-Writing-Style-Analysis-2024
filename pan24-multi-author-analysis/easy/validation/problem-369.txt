The fact that this “uniquely American problem” of maternal mortality not dropping with time seems to be spreading since 2016 is ominous. Continual progress isn’t automatic.
The point is that some doctors suck. Tell them everything, but if they don’t listen, get a new doctor. Some doctors would rather watch you die than lift a figure to help.
Our findings indicate that prepregnancy obesity, a modifiable factor, is a limited driver of racial–ethnic disparities in overall severe maternal morbidity.".
Doesn't completely explain the racial disparity, but maternal obesity (and associated increased risk of gestational diabetes, eclampsia) and teen pregnancy are both monster risk factors for maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality.
This supports exactly what I've been saying. I never said that obesity couldn't account for some cases. My point is that there are many factors (which I listed above) that contribute to higher maternal mortality rates among black women and those other factors are being glossed over in this comment thread.
The person I originally replied to said that higher maternal mortality rates among black women is "largely related to the sky high obesity rates". "Largely" implies that obesity is the predominant driver of maternal mortality rates among black women, which your first source indicates is a "limited driver" in that racial disparity. That means that there are many other factors contributing to the racial disparity in maternal mortality rates for black women that are being ignored for obvious reasons.
We're talking specifically about maternal mortality rates among black women, not women in general. The person I replied to farther up in the thread is suggesting (sans evidence) that obesity is the predominant factor for maternal mortality rates among black women, when we know that there are many other factors involved, all while ignoring those other factors. Do you have a statistic that shows that obesity and teen pregnancy among black women is "largely" the leading cause of maternal mortality rates?
Yeah it's pretty clear what some in this comment thread are trying to do; scapegoat higher maternal mortality rates among black women on obesity while ignoring all other factors. The narrative they're trying to weave is transparent.
