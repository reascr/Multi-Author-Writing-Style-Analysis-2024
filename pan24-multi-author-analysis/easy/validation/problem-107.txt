It's authoritarianism, but it's also vagueness used deliberately. By drafting intentionally vague laws, it lets them sell the laws to the public, and counter opposition, by claiming there are exemptions, but it also lets them prosecute people whenever they like. They want the benefit of a narrow law that only applies in some circumstances because that's what's popular and defensible, but they also want the benefit of a strict law because then they can punish people and feed red meat to the base. The vagueness lets them always blame someone else and say they did the wrong thing. If a woman dies, they can blame the doctor for not performing an abortion, but if that doctor had performed the abortion and the woman had lived, they could also say the doctor was wrong to perform it and prosecute.
If a doctor lets a patient die by not performing an abortion, they can blame the doctor, the hospital, etc, for failing to provide an abortion that was included in an exception. If, on the other hand, the doctor had performed the abortion, they could just as easily prosecute the doctor for performing a forbidden abortion. The vague drafting is deliberate, because it puts anyone who would provide abortions in a lose-lose situation, which can then be used to turn the public against them, or to bring them before a medical board and possibly lose their license to practice medicine.
If they wanted to, they could draft a law with clearly delineated lines, saying abortion is not allowed in these circumstances, is allowed in those, and is allowed in some others when it's necessary in the judgment of doctor. That they didn't draft these laws that way is intentional. They know how not to be vague, and they certainly have access to people outside the legislature who know how to avoid vagueness, but they chose to be vague anyway.
