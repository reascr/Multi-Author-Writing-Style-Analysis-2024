I’m not following how this explanation coexists with the one you were agreeing to (“let’s be real…”). I can only see the statements coexisting when closeted gay Russian soldiers are sent to fight in Ukraine where they can finally be truer versions of themselves by raping men, I guess it’s possible but what a weird mindset. I’m not disagreeing or challenging you on it, I just don’t get it, it’s okay though. I agree with you 100% though on the rest. Vile humans. I made some comments a few days ago to people that were trying to excuse them with stuff like “I think they’re all just good people in bad situations.” Last year, a Russian gymnast competed in an international competition with a Z on the chest of his uniform, stood on the podium like that, and people still whine that they should be allowed to compete because sports shouldn’t be political. I can’t fathom how people are okay with all of it, it all just hurts.
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk responded to the Russian government’s order, stating that Russian officials and occupation authorities may be planning to deport more than 100,000 residents from the Kherson region to Russia under fears that Moscow's forces may lose further territory in war-torn Ukraine.
Thank you. Super glad the first thing I saw in the comments was this, because it sure as fuck was the first thing I thought.
