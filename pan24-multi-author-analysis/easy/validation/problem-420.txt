It's at least $30 in tolls both ways to get to Manhattan from AC. Also, you wouldn't be riding amtrack from AC to NYC. You'd be riding nj transit to outside of philly, to go out of your way to take Amtrack. Bus 319 from AC to the port authority would run like $5 or $10 and take about 30 min to an hour more than driving. Oh, and that isn't even including parking near Penn Station or elsewhere in NYC. Have you ever even done this drive?
Im not exactly familiar with the location but you gotta remember these areas have so much utilities and underground infrastructure that a large chunk of the cost is likely going to be in protecting/redesigning/moving them. I worked as a civil engineer on a hospital near me that was going through redesigns and most of my design time was reworking the utility networks and same with a large portion of the construction phase. NYC/NJ metro areas are like this except on Crack, steroids and then to the 10th power.
