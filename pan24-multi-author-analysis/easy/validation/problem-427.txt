Propaganda, censorship of ideas and violent suppression of protests is not just a hallmark of authoritarianism, it's a requirement for them to stay in power. Violent cowards.
Conversely it's pretty easy to point to what the Russian interference in the 2016 election was. They set up spam internet camps in places like Belarus and Thailand, paying people to propagate fake news and misinformation. There have been massive FB pages with millions of followers that have been outed as set up to do this. Even if US intelligence is somehow amplifying the calls on Chinese social media, which is probably impossible given that they are a locked down system unlike Western platforms with harsh government control of moderation, that is completely different from the analogy you are trying to make.
You can only slaughter so many people. Eventually it will all rebound. Holding together so many people in a vice like grip can't happen in perpetuity. It will always eventually unravel.
Authoritarianism is violent cowardice. They are so afraid of ideas, of people expressing themselves, of being criticized, that they have to react with violent oppression and scapegoating. Sure, China, your CCP always knows best, is never corrupt (except when it is, must be foreigners), and always has the peoples' interests first and foremost and not retaining its own iron grip on power. ðŸ™„.
Empirically, such regimes will always eventually crumble. That's not down to a few individuals falling through the cracks.
