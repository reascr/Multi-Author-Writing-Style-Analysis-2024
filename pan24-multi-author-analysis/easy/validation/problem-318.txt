I don't knock what sort of thing you whack off to but please don't corrupt my feeble mind with it. I'm into feet, and I'll thank you for respecting that.
Similarly their is a substantial difference in a percentage of the population demanding their elected officials listen to their concerns about doing more to protect the environment, and people protesting violently because they do not have elected officials but are being controlled by another country against their wishes.
Sure I'm selfish. The reality of it is everyone looks out for themselves first. Boris was good from my perspective and met my needs.
There is a substantial difference between allowing the government to enforce laws to marginalize the ability of people to peacefully protest so that the protest is not only heard and can not be ignored, and paramilitary forces killing dozens of civilians in various car bombings leaving hundreds more wounded.
That's kind of the point. A very quick glance at the government of the UK shows just how out of touch they are and how little they represent the people (for instance, think about the percentage of second/third generation immigrans in the country and their representation in either of the houses).
He's a good egg. Everyone on this planet does something dodgy, I bet me and you ain't squeaky clean. People expect these politicians to be such amazing humans it's unreal. I don't give a flying shit if they're the worst human possible as long as they're doing the right thing for the people of the country they're running that's all that matters.
