It is considered a point of diplomatic etiquette to wear your host nation's national order when you come for a state visit as a sign of goodwill if you are from a friendly country in good diplomatic standing, so you are usually gifted one on arrival so you can do so if you don't already have one. And also, the pomp and pageantry of the whole thing is considered good for greasing the wheels of international relations.
Long generations? I'm in my mid thirties but my youngest cousin isn't even 18 and our shared grandmother was born in 1928, our grandfather a few years before that. My grandmother had her first child (my mother) at age 31, and my mother had me at 29.
Hmmmm. Yes, the tyrannical murder of a few hundred thousand civilians, interrupting the food and energy supply of hundreds of millions of people and sending your own countrymen to certain death, could be seen as a reason to strip away that medal.
I'm only 28. My grandfather was born in 1918 and my mom is his youngest child. IIRC he fought in Italy near 1944, maybe for operation dragoon, I know he brought back a luger he took from an officer.
