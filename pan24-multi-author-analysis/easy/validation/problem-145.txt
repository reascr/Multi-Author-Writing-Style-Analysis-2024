Ah yeah. Give me more Germany bashing in the comments. Let us all forget that the Ukrainians can't hit a target with HIMARS without US confirmation or why the US haven't delivered long range rockets much ealier . /s off.
20 years of letting their military stagnate, 20 years of trying to appease the Russians because of cheap gas, and now the Germans still have the gall to defend their abysmal foreign-policy record even as Olaf Scholz continues to suck Daddy-Putins dick while spending nearly a whole year coming up with excuses as to why Ukraine cannot be provided with the most numerous model of tank in Europe, with manufacturing/maintenance infrastructure only a few hours away from Ukraine.
You mean FAILED. For decades. Germany has not met its commitments. The strongest economy in Europe and they won't (not can't...won't) pay their debts.
Exactly. If Germany can't take its neighbourhood's issues serious enough, then its neighbours have no choice but to disregard its concerns and rules. Poland had signalled its willingness to break its Leopard 2 resale agreement by transferring its tanks to Ukraine without German consent.
