Not only was Trump's entire campaign defined by Trump talking shit about his opponents (and really anyone who didn't support him) in terms you'd never expect a presidential candidate to stoop to, not only was his entire appeal that he was a crude asshole who said mean stuff...the rhetoric I heard from rank and file Republicans about people like me, people who share my beliefs, and politicians I vote for was just as bad as anything these agents said in their texts. Oh no, they said they could smell the Trump support in a Walmart? Boy do I have some memes about Obama to show you. They framed opposing Trump as a crisis moment? Hey, did you read that "flight 93 election" editorial where the author (an anonymous coward until later) explicitly compared his ideological opponents to terrorists who perpetrated the worst attack on our nation in modern history?
What a circus. Trump really knows how to get the courts involved in his games. This is why we need to get rid of him now! He's never been one for respecting the law or the people, and all this drama is proof enough.
