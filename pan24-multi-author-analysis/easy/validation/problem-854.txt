According to George W. Bush he got “Mission Accomplished” and even landed on an aircraft carrier to declare it. From a military perspective the US did beat the Iraqi military hands down. That can’t be disputed at all. L. Paul Bremmer on the other hand lost the peace by disbanding the military and isolating the Baathist party who were the only people who knew how to keep the country functioning. This created massive civil unrest and eventually an insurgency which was partially ended by electing a prime minister and seating a president as well as a legislative body. The elected body in Iraq asked the US to leave and tone down their involvement in their domestic affairs. The US was not pushed out militarily. Additionally that same legislative body requested the US come back and help them when Daesh/IS/ISIL exploded onto the population.
Eh? When did I say extremely unlikely? You're reading something I didn't write in order to hear what you want to hear.
