Will there ever be an investigation into the handling mishandling of the pandemic? Other than whatever clown show the new house has planned for Fauci? Kushner should have to answer to this under oath. Most people don't even know that he literally and unnecessarily caused distress and death to thousands, maybe tens of thousands of Americans. At this point, my best hope for some form of accountability is someone famous or with deep pockets doing an Oscar-worthy documentary that casts a dark cloud over this evil cartoon villain for the rest of his pampered life. He's despicable.
Thanks for the info. The administration was such a shitshow, that you forget some of these scandals that should have ended multiple careers. Truly amazing this happened.

Remember. The reason why didn't implement a well thought out emergency plan earlier on the pandemic is because Kushner thought this would be a big city problem and they could turn the narrative to blame the cities.
