5. Liz Cheney boombox serenade convinces GOP to take her back. This one is real, trust me. No sarcasm!
Wait, let's give credit to him for some of those other things: grifted millions of dollars from the US Government through his hotels and resorts, grifted millions of dollars from the American people directly by constantly campaigning instead of leading, aggressively/militaristically reacted to peaceful protests across the country causing several riots, encouraged paramilitary domestic terrorists to act more boldly, verifiably worked with foreign governments to funnel money into his personal wealth, worked with foreign governments in an attempt to undermine our elections, most likely traded our government secrets with other countries for personal gain, undermined our foreign policies and pulled us out of beneficial agreements for his own personal gain or for the gain of his allies in foreign countries (like Russia/Saudi Arabia/North Korea), did pretty much anything he could to restrict or limit our country's ability to respond to a global pandemic resulting in hundreds of thousands more deaths OF HIS OWN supporters than necessary, with the assistance of his supporters in Congress and the media he undermined the legitimacy of our elections, he pursued several avenues to steal the 2020 election and spread lies and misinformation for the months following the election, he then sparked an attempted coup on our nation's capitol which resulted in several deaths and may well lead to a second American Civil War.
4. Nothing would do more to weaken MAGA's commitment to a conspiracist worldview than a clearly-coordinated campaign of elected officials repeating the same talking points while denying they're in league. OH WAIT.
I've not generally heard "wasting money on ineffective construction and implementing policy so cruel it was probably a violation of international law" referred to as "getting control", but I guess we have different definitions.
Did he? Seems like he made a "manageable problem" into a "humanitarian disaster" and then he wasted a FUCK TON of money on a wall that was cheaply built and funneled cash into the pockets of the likes of Steve Bannon. He also started a "light genocide" of legal asylum seekers by separating parents from their children and "housing" them in basically human kennels allowing many of them to die from disease and starvation. We have different definitions of "control.".
Ah yes. He's a great negotiator... HE did all this. Oh, but wait. Nothing significant has changed over there? Cool, never-fucking-mind then. Also, Israel's leadership is just as corrupt as he is, so...
