An interesting detail not mentioned there is that in the pov video you can see one of the Russians on the ground looking back at his armed comrade, knowing what’s about to happen. In the drone footage of the aftermath you can see that same dude managed to run a few steps before being gunned down. To me that makes it very clear it wasn’t an execution but a return fire that was over in mere seconds.
Stop regurgitating propaganda then. This incident was both miniscule compared to the other crimes of Russia and was caused by Russia. You don't know what you are talking about and you are supporting Kremlin propaganda (or you're a Russia troll).
However...it wasn't. A russian soldier opened fire on the ukrainians, turning the surrender to a combat situation which got all the russians killed.
One of the russians hid around a corner with a gun, then popped out and shot the ukrainians. Which meant that this was not a surrender anymore but a combat situation. Which unfortunately got ukrainians wounded and all the russians killed.
\5 ukrainians are letting 11 russians surrender. A machine gunner has his gun one the ground, lined up to hit all the russians on the floor if anyone tries to harm the ukrainians. Then one russian starts shooting at the ukrainians at which point they obviously return fire. The machine gunner alone probably killed all those on the floor in the first second. And we see bullet holes consistent with them being shot from the machine gunner, not from the back.
The machine gunner alone could've easily killed all of them in seconds. He's on the floor, with \6 russians already in his line of sight. He doesn't have great situational awareness from the floor and he's ready to shoot any second if any russian tries something fishy (this is important, he's deliberately pointing exactly at them already!). Then he's shot at. To me it's very reasonable that he immediately pulls the trigger (consistent with the audio from the video), then moves his gun to target the attacker, whilst still pulling the trigger (consistent with the bullet holes on the wall behind the russians). That motion would've moved his line of fire over every last russian.
