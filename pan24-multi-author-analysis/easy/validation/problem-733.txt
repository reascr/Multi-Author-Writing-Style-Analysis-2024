If there were a poll I think 90% share your opinion. I sure do. The problem is not that you don't have a choice, it's that by the time you want to, you no longer have the capacity to make the decision. I should be able to put a trigger in place; once certain criteria is met, I get the shot or a pill in my coffee. I want everything to go to my children.
u/platz604 is right about mental illness being a social construct (what separates mental illness from a natural response to circumstances is not delineated by any empirical evidence in most cases; it is just arbitrary). The suffering is very real, but there's no evidence, in most cases, that the cause of it is medical (although genetic issues can predispose people to being more vulnerable to environmental causes of mental suffering). But they're wrong in saying that the solution is to deprive the soi-disant mentally ill of their right to bodily autonomy. They're wrong to say that it's those who are victims who should be forced to pay the price of society's failings.
