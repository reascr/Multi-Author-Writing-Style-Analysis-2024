This has been said a thousand times and it'll be said a thousand times more but it's crazy that the cartels can be this brazen and have little to no consequences. The worst part of it all is that civilians just trying to live their lives get caught in the middle and used as pawns.
Seriously! CAP THAT BITCH IN THE HEAD. Fuck him he deserves nothing but to rot in the ground as the worms eat his corpse. Piece of absolute filth ALL OF EM.
really appreciate second hand personal POV on this type of thing - americans are nearly completely cut off from hard realities in central and south america, the only news really covering the humanitarian crisis beyond spectacular natural disasters are far left global humanism/humanitarianism advocates.
5. United States makes the list. I was outside of Detroit in a little suburb walking down the street when a car pulls up near the bar I was going toward. I recognize the guy as a guy from the plant that I had talked to earlier in the day. He and I had a pretty good rapport (so I thought) and we had discussed what the company wanted me to do and what I was auditing, etc. I don't recall why, but for some reason he thought I was investigating him specifically. He had followed me from the factory to my hotel then where I had parked. He and three of his friends get out of this car and start talking to me, then reveal that they all have guns and that if his name is mentioned in a report, etc., he's going to kill me. I tried explaining that I'm not a police officer and this isn't that kind of investigation. We're just looking for how we can be more efficient, but all he hears is that he's getting laid off. Try as I might, the guy would not believe that I wasn't there to fire him. Had he not done that, he'd probably still be working there now. The scary part was that he was so crazy like to follow me, to pretend to be friendly, etc. I honestly thought he might kill me from sheer stupidity.
