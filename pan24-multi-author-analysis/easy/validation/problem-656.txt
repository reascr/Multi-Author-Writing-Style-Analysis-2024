We're pretty far past warning signs at this point... We're at phase 3 or so of a Russian + opportunists plan to destroy the country by leveraging it's own weaknesses (poorly funded schools, simmering racism/homophobia/etc, criminal wealth disparity, pay-to-elect "politicians", unregulated cryptocurrency financial markets, a huge pile of economic investment being placed into hot air + hopes and dreams while ignoring the fundamental needs of the people, mountains of insecure soft targets, and no laws in place to protect workers or regulating propaganda, etc). We have had one of the most easily corrupted systems of governance in existence for about a century, and never fixed it. Now the back push to fix any of these things because they are "woke" is probably too high... I'm genuinely terrified to know the future of our country. Warning signs to me were back in 2007 or so.
