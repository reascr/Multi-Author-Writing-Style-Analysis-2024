Why not? He is just like the rest of the Republicans, only a little more overt about it. The leadership of the Republican Party actively fund-raised for him. Now that he has been found out, they want to distance themselves, even though they are 100% responsible for him. They should own it.
Following accusations that he lied about much of his resumé and facing long list of legal issues, Santos has now been slammed by his fellow Republicans in Congress as a “bad guy” and an “imposter,” and in one case, he’s been compared to a character from Fatal Attraction.
This is all fine. People like Santos would never reach a breaking point, even after day after day of being called out for lies, scorned by his colleagues and made a mockery of on a nightly basis. I'm sure he will remain the stable individual he has always been, and there's just no way there will ever be a situation involving him where people question the wisdom of removing the magnetometers from Congress. /s.
