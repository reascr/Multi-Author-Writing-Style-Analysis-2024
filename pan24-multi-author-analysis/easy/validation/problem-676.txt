And torpedoes are easily thwarted with early warning sonar. These jet ski drones are invisible to sonar and radar. They're virtually indistinguishable from the waves they ride in on and can be launched from 50-100 miles away and remotely piloted. Not to mention they're considerably cheaper than guided torpedoes so you could theoretically launch a shitload of them at a grouping of ships. Not saying they're unstoppable, but a zerg attack of like a hundred+ of them against a cluster of ships that wasn't expecting/prepared for them could cause a hell of a distraction from a combined aerial assault. Really just depends what kind of explosion and range you can actually get from them.
Inertial navigation involves differentiating a noisy signal to determine orientation, then using that to subtract a huge acceleration offset due to gravity, then differentiating that twice to go from acceleration to velocity to position. Even the tiniest drift or noise in those sensors will make the answer diverge from reality extremely fast. The MEMS sensors in phones will diverge in seconds. US ITAR classifies sensors with sufficiently low noise and drift to be useful as weapons, you can't export them.
