Here's the interesting part; Norway at the time had declared themselves neutral after WW1, and had built down their armed forces to a very very reduced neutrality guard. And those 2 months? Thats longer....A LOT longer than any country had resisted the German invasions at the time. It took longer to occupy Norway than it did to occupy Poland and France. Both fairly large military forces at the time. There's also a discepancy in loss numbers. The Germans notoriously underreported losses. My own grandmother comes from a small rural township, where the history books reports from the German's own loss reports; 7 casualties. In reality the Norwegians made a local stand there and was fighting house to house, forcing the Germans to burn them out. And the locals observed the germans taking casualties in the high 2-digits, then throwing their own casualties into remaining houses and lighting them up. Her brother was commandeered by the Germans to drive his truck with casualties to the fires. He made at least 4 runs with the back of his truck stacked to the roof with dead soldiers.
Absolutely true. Back when Eve wasn't a shit game (there was a time, it was just a very long time ago), I went to fanfest one year in Iceland. (Hell of an experience, I honestly cannot think of a place I'd rather go back to).
