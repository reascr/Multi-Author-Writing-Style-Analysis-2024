That is a perfect plan but I seriously doubt that is going to occur. Ukraine has short and sweet supply lines, they won’t the further from the Dnipro they get. If Russia blows the damn, bad time for Ukrainians. The current CO is not going to let Crimea fall. It would be a shame if he did too, how many Russians died over the centuries to get crimea in the first place. Whilst I don’t necessarily agree with that logic or feel like defending it that is of course the logic of Russia. If Russia has to give it up because it got it thru imperialism then I suppose the USA should give Mexico back it’s lost territory as well. I don’t think any of that makes sense either.
Did you see the video of the Russian newscaster who said that if he supports the retreat he's discrediting the territorial integrity of Russia and goes to jail (Russian criminal code section 280 article 1), and if he denounces it then he's discrediting the Russian armed forces and goes to jail (Russian criminal code section 280 article 3).
