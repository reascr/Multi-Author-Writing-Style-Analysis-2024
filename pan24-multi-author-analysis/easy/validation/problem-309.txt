Basically we're at a stale mate until the UK finally gets it's shit together and starts building the relationship with the EU so ultimately another vote to join can be taken what would be years from now and impossible to say when, if or even if they will accept us because it is a very long time away before any UK government asks that question again.
Basically we are in a shit position with a government what won't back down because it will destroy them, the EU stuck not wanting to deal with the Tories due to the Tories going against anything EU related and things won't change until 2025, then after that it would be a good time to look at that question and see how the EU and UK relationship is going what I think very much depends on how we vote.
The predictions show our economy to finally grow in 2024 but honestly I doubt out government will be much help in making this happen, they are currently trying to destroy anything EU related to try and justify their Brexit claims what everybody knows is total bullshit at this point, but they can't back down because if they did the Tories would be basically admitting that everything from 2016 they have done has been total bullshit and it would destroy the party, this is the reason they are so bent on removing all EU laws even if they are among some of the best in the world for worker rights, health and safety, regulations etc...
Polling is snake oil. Most respected polls from 2013 to the day before the referendum all pointed to ‘Remain’ wining out.
