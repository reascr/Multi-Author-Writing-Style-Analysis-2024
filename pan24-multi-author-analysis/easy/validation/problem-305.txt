That’s not what your first comment said. Your first comment said “at least half the population”, despite the fact that only about a third of this country actually voted Republican in any election in my lifetime. Which is the initial thing I took issue with. I typed a bunch more than this, but I’ve seen this kinda shit before. You’re not arguing in good faith with me, and this discussion is deep in an r/politics thread, so no one’s benefiting. You wanna see projecting? I won’t argue with you about gerrymandering or voting systems because I know you “know” more power to the voter is a bad thing, and from your perspective, the GOP spending 60% of its 2020 budget for my state (in a year where small businesses were dropping like flies) on trying and failing to repeal ranked choice voting is a noble endeavor. I know you would present my position in a similarly unreasonable sounding way. Your research statistics will look different coming from your sources than they do from my sources, and neither of us will acknowledge each other’s sources as anything other than fake news. So imma just walk away now.
