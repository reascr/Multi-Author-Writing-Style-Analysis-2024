Yep used to work at one, I have PTSD from my childhood, seeing my cousin murdered, and working there for 2.5 years, it finally got to me and I had a mental breakdown and I had to leave. Also used chemicals that irritated my skin and lungs so badly and the only thing they would give me was a face shield. I had a broken wrist one time and my supervisor expected me to the the job of 2 people with one hand. One of the jobs I had was pulling the lard out of the carcass, the fat that covers the ribs, I had to pull those out by hand and it's causes a ton of trauma to your fingernails and causes them to fall off. My would fall out all the time.
