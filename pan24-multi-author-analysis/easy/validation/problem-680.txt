After my original vaccination and booster, continuing to use masks in public indoor places (also an exception for the gym, and work isn't open to the public, but grocery stores, buses, etc) I eventually caught it from direct physical contact with a family member before they knew they had it. C'est la vie, but I didn't get it randomly and not for 2 years. Plus, I was 100% fine like nothing happened in less than 2 weeks, back to running and everything. No guarantee without vaccination that the recovery would have been so smooth.
