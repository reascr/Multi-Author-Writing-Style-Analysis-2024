I'm not. This is well documentated, they tend to be more religous and socially conservative than other democrats. They also oppose abortion at a higher rate.
So what we want to consider a binary is actually an ongoing complex process that weaves together developmental biology and genetics, psychology and sociology, and the social context at the time.
Ha! Didn't think of it like that. You know how some comedians have a very racial following, like George Lopez and Hispanics? I was thinking that sort of thing. I happen to be white and a big fan of many black comics beginning with Richard Pryor.
Stochastic terrorism: The use of mass public communication, usually against a particular individual or group, which incites or inspires acts of terrorism which are statistically probable, but happen seemingly at random.
I'm a little confused. Are you saying that mayor Pete's sexaulity was not an issue with black voters? I'm not so sure it wasn't because of data in the article we're discussing. Also, racism absolutely boiled to the surface during Obama's presidency. White republican voters were incensed by him in office. I heard morons in my part of the US call for his assassination.
There’s a whole bunch of chemistry going on during development that also controls the origin of other psychological and physiological characteristics. We know now that starvation in the mother can cause an obesity tendency that lasts for multiple generations. There’s a soup of hormones and enzymes and genes turning on and off and body parts growing and getting removed and crazy stuff going on. It’s honestly fascinating.
I live by a rule that accusations and proof need to be equal in proportion. So serious accusations need serious proof for example. The idea that a child is receiving sexual harassments or sexual assault is a serious accusation, so a softer indirect or even petty "proof" like "they saw two men kissing in the park" or "they drew that cartoon character in a broadcast tv show with big "sexy" hips" is not serious enough proof for me to believe someone has come to harm.
Please let me try to answer you. I am a biologist. I assure you that, if you’re being honest and open-minded, you could find dozens of web pages in a five second search at any given level of biological, psychological, and sociological detail.
