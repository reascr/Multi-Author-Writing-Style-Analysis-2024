And I was wrong about how much fight Russia had left in it, drained away by parasitic corruption over the years. The Soviet Union was no stranger to corruption (nor was the US to be fair, though in the US it takes different forms), but the Russian Federation is akin to a deer utterly covered in ticks and dropping dead before your eyes. If it didn’t have nukes and biological WMDs (of which we have to assume at least some still work, because if we assume they don’t and they do, it would be catastrophic), I’d even wonder if Ukraine could take the fight to Russia eventually as they bled themselves out on an unyielding defense.
I 110% agree with his visit. I also 110% agree for the support he is giving Ukraine. Russia MUST be stopped, and this doesn’t need to be a political party arguement. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine and is actively killing innocents. They must be stopped now.
He done more for the US than previous presidents, and in either case the US is still here and still strong and will continue to be as long as Republicans don't manage to destroy the country, nor is the status in the Middle East going to change any time soon despite the best intentions of multiple presidents. But Ukraine is being invaded by Russia right now. What the world does to help Ukraine matters right now, it's not going to matter if we wait for Russia to annex Ukraine to help. None of that is stopping the US government from helping Americans more, only the GOP is preventing that from happening.
