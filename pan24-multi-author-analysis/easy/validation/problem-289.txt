The freeze peach absolutist could have bought 4chan for likely under a million. Instead, he bought twitter for 44 billion. He doesn't understand that moderation is the only reason for the difference in value. He sees mods as the enemy; people who cost something but give no value, He doesn't understand that it's the mods who create 85% of the value of twitter. Without mods, twitter would consist of a few thousand nazis and pedophiles, and no one else. Have fun, Elon.
We are rapidly approaching a number of cliffs financially, politically, environmentally and socially that having a serious disruption of the ability to communicate effectively will only better serve the interests of the Billionaire class whose only intent is to own everything and everyone. Neo-Feudalism here we come.
Exactly. I wish more of the country understood SF is socially progressive in a lot of ways that the rest of the country isn’t, but ultimately, it’s still pretty conservative.
