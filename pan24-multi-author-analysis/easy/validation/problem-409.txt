No. We need to refer to them as "entitlements", because that's what they are. I pay into the system, I am entitled to reap the benefits. Republicans keep trying to make "entitlements" a dirty word, and we shouldn't let them.

It’s terrifying. I mean, there are republicans officials actively trying to start a civil war, and yet what’s on the news is what Zelensky was wearing and how this means Biden hates Russia and us starting a war with China. Maybe I’m old but I remember that Russia (not it’s people but it’s government) has not been a friend to the US since WWII and that was only by proxy because Hitler was stupid enough to invade in the middle if fucking winter. Where all this love comes for Russia is fucking flabbergasting to me, and they just want to focus on outfits and getting rid of drag shows. I mean what the ever loving fuck.
There are clearly better choices, there are 334 million Americans who are eligible for two terms as President, there are two Americans who are eligible for one term as President, if Republicans want Republican policies to be enacted they should want a President who is eligible for re-election because most Presidents get re-elected.
