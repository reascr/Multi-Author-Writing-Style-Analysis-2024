Oh, I don't disagree with you about student loan forgiveness (as I said, the arguments against it are pretty much disingenuous). I was just pointing out that the forgiveness was directly written into the law creating the PPP loans. Honestly, though, you could argue that forgiveness was written into the law regarding student loans. Even under the law as written in 1965, the Executive branch was given the power to waive or modify student loans however they wish. There really weren't any requirements regarding this. The Heroes Act then gave specific circumstances under which the loans could be waived or modified. It does not, however, say that those are the only circumstances where it can be done.

Congress cannot give away their constitutional responsibility over taxation or spending. You may be right on it should have been dismissed but it hasn't. I believe the SC is going to say that Biden overstepped but we will see.
