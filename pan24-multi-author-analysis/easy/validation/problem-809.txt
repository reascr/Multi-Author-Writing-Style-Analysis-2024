One President intentionally stole highly classified docs with highly sensitive intelligence info including info on nuclear stuff for another country. It's also highly likely, but yet to be proven this President sold/gave away some of the info to our adversaries. He was asked to return the docs, didn't comply, raided, and still done docs are missing.
