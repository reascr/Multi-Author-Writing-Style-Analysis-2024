We've already failed. A lying, traitorous, racist, wannabe dictator made it into the highest office for four years. He installed a majority on the supreme court and stacked many other positions with under-qualified, immoral loyalists. The most watched news station in the country became the front arm of an ongoing, nation-wide disinformation campaign which couldn't be any more anti-american if it were run by Putin himself. Also complicit were (almost) all members of Republican leadership, and some of the wealthiest people (and maybe countries) in the world. They attempted a multi-layered self-coup, and the guy calling for termination of articles in the constitution while having dinner with anti-Semites is still the leader of the party.
Oh God no. Did we learn nothing from 2016? Many people, including me, were just certain that Clinton would crush Trump. How could anyone vote for that buffoon, we thought.
