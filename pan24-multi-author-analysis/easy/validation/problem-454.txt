I just dislike the pigeonholing of any group due to something out of their control. Every individual has something to learn and something to teach. To assume someone is irrelevant or dangerous because they are old, white, black, short, young, etc. is the height of arrogance.
It's fascinating watching brexit spoken about on the worldnews sub as loads of the posters are from nations that wouldn't accept merging their nation into a new state with their nearest neighbours, wouldn't accept unlimited free movement of people from their neighbours or send them billions in cash every year or have swathes of their law making made by their neighbours without a veto and yet the UK is portrayed as somehow being nuts for leaving such a system and doing so by actually asking it's own people to decide.
Lol what??? More than half the countries in the world are democratic. Support for democracy worldwide is still very strong.
Only indirectly. He blames them for the 2008 crash, which he believes led to conditions which led to Brexit. You may disagree, but at least disagree with what he actually said.
