But one thing is absolutely certain, if India had favoured the US government over Russian in the past 50 years, we'd be beyond fucked as a nation. Now this doesn't have to mean "Russia good, US bad", Russia is absolutely clean white underwear with a massive shitstain of a government for what they're doing in Ukraine and Putin definitely deserves to die for what he's done not only to the Ukrainians, but to the poor Russian soldiers who were forced into the war without proper training, gear or knowledge of what they were being asked to do.
If you say so. That sounds like a set of typical libright talking points to me. There are philosophical disagreements about whether humans are inherently greedy, but Marx says the system needs to be strong enough to constrain the greed and place those without at the top. Also, you're right. Communist countries struggle to integrate into the capitalist interconnected global economy. That's why ideally ever nation would be Communist. That would also stop tax evaders.
