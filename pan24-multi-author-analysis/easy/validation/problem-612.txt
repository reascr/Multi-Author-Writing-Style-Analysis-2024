For the MRA vaccines specifically, there were only a very VERY small amount of facilities in the world that were properly equipped to make them. If Bill had shared the patent to other facilities, there would have been a flood of infective or even poisonous bootleg vaccines that would have made the situation worse and eroded trust in COVID vaccines as a whole.
Upon seeing the requirements to manufacture the vaccines, they would admit that they wouldn't be able to do so and move on. But if we went full "open source" and if one unscrupulous manufacturer tried to improvise for the missing equipment and sell through the black market or lied about quality approval, we could face something like a tainted Nestle Baby formula incident, which would then create orders of magnitudes more conspiracy theories and distrust in vaccines as a whole (just look at all the conspiracy that came from the one vial with metal shavings in it).
Yes. But conservatives already don’t like gates. For reasons I don’t entirely understand. But liberals love to jerk off gates. Despite him being deeply illiberal. So I gave trump credit for the cages.
