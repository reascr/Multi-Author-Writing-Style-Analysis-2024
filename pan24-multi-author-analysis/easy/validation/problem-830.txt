Why does every generation, group, cause, wake up and think they are the first to feel a certain way. I feel for people who think it is not fair, but life is not fair. If you need to work harder than you thought, to get what you need the mistake was yours, work harder to till your dead and pass on work ethics instead of money. Your offspring will be better off.
I live in the US, have had an okay-ish job for the last 8 years and in December finally landed what I would consider a great job (making over $25 an hour with no education past high school) and the work itself is essentially baby sitting machines and making sure its flowing fix any problems to keep it flowing, One of the best manufacturers in the entire state of Wisconsin if you ask me and I wouldn’t even consider having children because of the financial burden.
Same. Having a house and a stable financial climate is a hard prerequisite for us. Responsibility for any children a person may have long predates the child’s very conception.
