With a light amount of googling, you can hear recorded calls of Russian soldiers in Ukraine & their wives back home, with the wives encouraging their husbands to go out raping Ukrainian women. Even when the men share how awful the fighting is, and how they don’t want to be there, their families dgaf. So much evidence of torture and raping of children by Russian soldiers. Russians were horrendous to the people they “liberated” at the end of WWII. I know these examples all involve military but it’s consistent over time & this behavior is done by soldiers freshly recruited from civilian life. It’s not just their government, it’s the culture of a broad swath of their population, I’m sorry to say.
They aren’t particularly civilized. They are raised with a strong man approach without humility and self-perception. It’s very visible throughout Europe how they handle the situation of struggling in the war (hint: not well). They are going to have to change, they really do and it’s going to be hard but I will be the first person who applaud the people who do.
