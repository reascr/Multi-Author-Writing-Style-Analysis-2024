If you're in line by 7pm, you get to vote. The US also allows early voting and in many cases that happens for multiple days to weeks beforehand. There is plenty of opportunity to vote in the US, people are just lazy, when it comes down to it. I never understood the argument of "poor" people not being able to vote because when I held hourly jobs within the last 10 years, I worked EVERY weekend. That's when I made the most money. I always ended up with one or two days off during the week...and it wouldn't be difficult to make that day Tuesday and if I happened to wait until voting Tuesday to vote (again, why would I since I had 2 weeks before with early voting), it wouldn't matter because I'd have the day off to begin with.
Exactly. He saw that the way things were, Babiš could have a shot (billionaire, straight up mafia - already was at multiple courts, currently investigated in France for money laundering, populist, and an idiot, who can't even properly speak without pre written text from his PR team) and there was also a bit of pressure from people around him (that he should run).
No. Babiš has framed Pavel as a warmonger (going so far as to send out fake texts from Pavel telling the recipient that they have been mobilized), but it’s all bluster.
