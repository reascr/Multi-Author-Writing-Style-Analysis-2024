They show up to court two or three days later and tell the judge that their son clearly needs help. The judge will appoint the public defender and tell the family that their son committed a very serious crime and there's a chance he could go to prison.
He's going to tell the family and the kid that the best chance is to try to negotiate a plea for minimal punishment and commitment to a inpatient psychiatric facility. They'll say that sucks, but it makes sense, I mean, he did do it right? And he's going to go and talk to the prosecutor. They'll haggle and the public defender will come back and say hey I got you a pretty good deal, you'll do at least 30 days in Juvenile detention but after that you can get out once there's a bed in a residential facility available. Then you'll go there, and you'll probably stay there for 6 months. But you're going to be on probation for 5 years, and if you violate the probation you'll probably go to jail.
