My comments are just saying that we haven't learned our lessons. If Russia collapses, it won't be rebuilt if they start behaving. It will just get worse. The point on the cause of WWII being the poverty in Germany as the aftermath of WWI should be a giant red flag in this situation now. We are entering a very similar situation with a decent amount of encouragement to give them what they deserve. The lessons have not been learned. In fact instead if there is war or domestic instability, then the international world will pull that country apart while taking sides to fund and support, allowing more internal unrest. Take Sadia Arabia's civil war as my giant example of how internationally we've not learned anything. Nor will act in a way to invest in another country's well being if we still see them as a threat.
Unlikely. North Korea is dirt poor and if anymore countries stop buying anymore stuff from them, the famine will be even worse and yet still they remain yo be slave to a fat manchild.
