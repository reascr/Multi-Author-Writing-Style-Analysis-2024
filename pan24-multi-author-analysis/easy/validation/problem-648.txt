More seriously, though, consider for a moment how much it took to get Donald Trump into the White House: It took a nationally televised cable propaganda network spending thirty years tainting the Democratic brand and elevating conservatism, it took Trump having a top rated prime time reality TV show in which he played the part of the (fictitious) competent corporate executive, Trump's win required Republicans winning the Senate in 2014 and Antonin Scalia dying and Mitch McConnell refusing to hold a vote on his replacement, Trump's win depended on hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars being spent on repeated investigations exonerating Hillary Clinton from any wrongdoing in Benghazi, Trump's win needed James Comey to have a boy scout moment the week before the election by holding an historically unprecedented public news conference about an ongoing federal investigation into an American citizen (which he would clarify was not cause for prosecution just five days later, two days before the election), had Russians not hacked Hillary Clinton's campaign Trump probably wouldn't have won, if Russians hadn't targeted Trump, Sanders, and Stein supporters with propaganda Trump probably wouldn't have won, hell, if Republicans hadn't fully milked the Monica Lewenski scandal for all the political clout they could it might have made the difference in 2016.
