Pfft. Even with the most extreme ruling possible, they are no longer in a strong enough position in state legislatures to overturn a Presidential election, and when you look at how their internal divisions are now starting to cost them control of legislative chambers even when they hold majorities of seats, I think their position will only weaken further.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Thank you. People were calling me delusional before the Elections for pointing out all the flaws with the idea that the GOP was about to sweep the map and cement permanent minority rule. Fear of that is useful insofar as it provides a motivator to vote (in stark contrast to the complacency of 2016), but if it threatens to spread the sort of blackpilled doomerism that causes people to assume nothing can be done about the situation, then it becomes a real problem because that is when people stop voting.
