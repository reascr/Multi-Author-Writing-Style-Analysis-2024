I know That loser, Milo, had access to Trump at Mar-a-Lago - where Trump was keeping classified records. JFC.
and I've never been Miserable, even though that's what the Radical Left wants, because I'm too Strong and way too Good to be having any sorts of problems, especially when it comes to a Setup from the Fake News Media and the Democrats, who will stop at nothing to make your Favorite President look bad. don't forget, before I came in, our Military was at Zero, they said, "Sir, we're out of Soldiers," and I said how can that be, and they said, "Obama wanted Open Borders," I said isn't that cute, here we have a Country to protect, and no one's better with protection, just ask President Donald Trump, and you'll all be Totally Protected, you just have to sign a few things, a few Papers, nothing that's a Big Deal, you'll be fine, and then you'll be serving in our Great Army, we have a lot of Good People, they love Germany, not now, but back then, you all know what I'm talking about.
The fact that it is not obvious, is kind of sad. Too many seemingly normal people have revealed themselves to be as hateful, unbalanced, irrational bigots as Trump.
