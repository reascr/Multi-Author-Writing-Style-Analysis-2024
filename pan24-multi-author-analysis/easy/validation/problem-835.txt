Their worst are still better than the other best. That is how they justify this kind of behavior. Once they can't win they will be happy to do away with representative democracy to win because no Democracy is still better than having a Democrat win. They are already rooting for totalitarianism. The media knew about this guy but they snuffed out the reporting because then they wouldn't have all this drama to report on. The medias ultimate goal is to make everything crazy because crazy is entertaining and entertainment keeps people tuned in and engaged. This is why things can't be left 100% up to private interests monopolizing content. With a private person owning Twitter now we will see this kind of thing happen more frequently. The campaign will pay more to Musk to keep news out of the public sphere than they will for campaigning on a message. Then you will just get ratfuckers acting like the other party and paying to keep that information from getting out. Once they win they can't be stopped. People will have no idea who they are voting for and they will stop caring about voting and just demand that peace (white people keeping what they deserve while everyone else is punished) be maintained. And then we will be at war with ourselves fighting over memes sent down from the Ministry of Information and enjoying our 3 minutes of hate each day.
