Stroll over to the conservative subreddit. It's a nonstop parade of shit fits they're all done with him. A surprising amount of them seem to be starting to see the obvious which is there is no way Trump ever wins a national election again. He's beyond toxic to every single thing he comes in contact with and the midterms proved he's a stone cold loser. He's scared off every segment of voter now except the die hard delusional conspiracy theory freaks. Republican voters are starting to realize that the guy they worshipped doesn't give a flying fuck about them or the Republican party after all.
Kennedy was supposedly worried about bureaucracy undermining Presidential ambitions. Qsers see that as "deep state" even though that term refers to a Turkish agency tasked with ensuring Turkey remained a democratic nation. Really, Kennedy was just full of drugs most of the time as far as I can tell. Nothing like a little speed to fuel paranoia.
