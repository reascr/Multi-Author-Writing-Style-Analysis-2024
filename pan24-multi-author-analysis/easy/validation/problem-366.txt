The Ayatollah and regime would like to distract the unhappy masses protesting about the innocent killings of citizens by reminding them how much they hate America.
Wasn’t much retaliation. I remember seeing a missle that looked like a burning trash can on the news launched at our base in Iraq. Trump came out after this to say Iran is standing down. If Iran would of killed our troops, it might of been different. Then Iraq shot down the commercial airline a day later and this conflict-retaliation went away.
Operation Praying Mantis. Lol, we also destroyed a few oil platforms as well. When a Soviet ship showed up we asked what they were doing and they said they were just there to take pictures. All because one of our ships was damaged by one of their mines.
If they wanted to be separated they had their opportunities, what do you mean 22 percent of iran are not iranain how is that a thing, and also entire Qajar dynasty were Azeri , Karim Khan zand was Lor ،Reza shah was mazani , current leader of iran is Azeri and they ruled all of Iran , I'm Azeri, I have kord friends , i have lor friends, i have arab friends and my entire family and childhood friends are Azeri and I see not a single on of them as separatists infact they love Iran in some degree.
The airliner had a quirky story too. I’ll take a shot at remembering, the plane took off and had to return to the airport, and the missle defense SAMs (on high alert because of the Americans) detected the returning plane as an inbound missle. Boom, the plane full of Ukrainians (and others) dead.
All of those minority you mention above are part of iran for so many years , we have pharse in iran we called they've become iranize , iran isn't about just language or religion , it's a identity, I suggests you study Iranshahr or Irenshehr theory to help you out more.as you mention Kordish independent state it's because of so many years of government suppression that minority of kord peoples seek independence and again history proves that majority of them doesn't want to become separated.
