You mean there's no correlation that the Biden Administration wants to take the First in Nation status away from NH? This seems so biased. Our President and his Congress and Senate have passed more legislation in his first two years then anyone expected. He supports very progressive policies, but it is not the President's fault that some of the more progressive legislative ideas have not made it past the Senate (in particular - Sinema/Manchin). The House did an amazing job and I think the Senate did the best they could. I'm not saying that we shouldn't look at other candidates, but we should focus on why another candidate would be more likely to win against a Republican, not how terrible Biden is. I always wonder who they poll when they say that his "polling numbers are very dismal." This is trashy for a Democratic aligned activist group to do. IMO.
This headline and these underhanded, would-be-disguised, RepubliKKKan slander pieces are just a further embarrassment to the already pathetic, nothing-to-offer-but-hate-and-lies, right.
