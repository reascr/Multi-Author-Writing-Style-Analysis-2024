There are so many more references to women fighting, leading battles worldwide across eons. Always love learning new (to me) ones. Thanks for sharing!
The Philippines was predominantly a matriarchal society (maybe similar to how some Native American tribes have a strong matriarchal influence) and it was very egalitarian as well. That is until the colonizers changed a large part of the culture and now machismo runs rampant. (As an aside: men who preferred to dress as females were still an integral part of the culture and even held positions relating to spirituality for example. Interestingly, Tagalog/Filipino language does not have male/female pronouns. It uses something equivalent to “they/them”.).
The assumption that only male soldiers rape is a incredibly dumb one, you don’t know EVERY female soldier and how they act on the battle field, I agree with your historical points (except the “Woman King”) but now you are just making all of them look like saints (don’t get me wrong most probably are) but just because they’re women doesn’t mean there can’t be a few rotten tomatoes in the tomato stack.
Right? Not like women in combat is some weird modern invention. “Woman King” just reminded the world the all female Agojie were not only capable, but fearsome and highly effective warriors. Israel mandates a minimum of 24 months of service from female citizens. My tiny Jewish friend from Israel served and knows Krav Maga and how to use an uzi. There’s historical evidence of female Vikings. There’s the legend of the Amazon’s. There are plenty of examples where women can be trained to be a capable military force and commanders with the side benefit that they don’t sexually assault the population they’re deployed to.
So yeah, I’m impressed India permits women to serve in the military, has an all female contingent, and has deployed them to an active combat zone. I don’t view that as a bad idea.
