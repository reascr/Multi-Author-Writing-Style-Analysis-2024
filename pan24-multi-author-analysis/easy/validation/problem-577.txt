Haha Michigan here. This was a topic of conversation just this morning in our office. A co worker genuinely told someone this being nice, and was horrified when we told her to not say that if she ever went down south. She was very concerned that she messed up.
I remember watching a documentary on what lead up to the first nuclear bombings of another nation, and I recall that the Imperialist Japanese government was training every citizen in Kamikaze techniques.
Yes, yes I do. Not the military might and capabilities but the threat. Why? Because the US absolutely does not want to invade N. Korea and absolutely does not want a war with N. Korea, and I can conceive of no reason at all why this would change short of N. Korea invading S. Korea or launching missiles that actually hit Japan or S. Korea. Why do you think otherwise? What does N. Korea have that the U.S. would ever want? Heck, it doesn't even have decent market potential for selling capitalist crap and making money. It's too damn and tragically poor. To the extent the U.S. is focusing on a N. Korea that isn't content to sit back behind it's hermit kingdom heavily enforced borders, it is only because N. Korea is developing nukes and keeps threatening to use them. It's that last bit that is the real problem.
Welcome to disinformation. They said the same thing about Iraq and Afghanistan, perhaps you are too young to remember, but a lot of friends got hurt there because of those lies. And worse than that, millions of casualties occurred for Cheney's wars, all to privatize some podunk countries in the middle of nowhere. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.
