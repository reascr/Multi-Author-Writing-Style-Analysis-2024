That being said, Trump's presidential announcement couldn't have been placed at a worse time and was met with crickets. He didn't energize anybody and has exactly zero momentum. I imagine he's hoping to recreate his bullying the other candidates in the primary debate stage thing. Who knows if that works twice though.
Let’s be real here; the DOJ is going to do a half-assed dog&pony show trial with Trump, the worst punishment he’ll get is fines & a ban from holding office again, the GOP & enough Americans will be satisfied enough with that punishment that Trump will stop being a major issue in politics, and meanwhile even more dangerous fascists like DeSantis will continue grabbing the power levers in this country while the Democrats stand by and rake in their cut from the donor class in exchange for not stopping it. And Kanye’s mental health spiral will help keep the rest of us distracted after that.
