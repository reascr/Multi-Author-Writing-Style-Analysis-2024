The monetary system creates debt and the debt will keep rising with the more money being printed and its basically a legal way to enslave a huge group of people even though it doesn’t feel like that all the time they like to let us think we have the illusion of choice yet we’re indoctrinated with a set of beliefs from a child and then we have journalists and even presidents getting killed for spreading the truth not just talking abt American presidents look at Mexico the us has gone in there killing presidents who want to help and better then Mexican people and for journalists look at Julian assange who is currently in jail for life for Wikileaks lots of emails and documents from people that hold power in politics and some of the shit they say makes me want to revolt as the people should and if you don’t believe the us gov has taken out presidents in other countries to better the us and basically destroy the other countries democracy and economy look up economic hitman.
