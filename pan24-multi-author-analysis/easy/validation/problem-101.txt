Depends. In aggregate it comes off as a conspiracy, but all the testimony seems to suggest they were just throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what would stick. I don't think they'll find that Trump & cronies planned the Jan 6 violence, but they were aware violence could happen and used violent rhetoric with the mob anyway. The people central to the fake elector theme seemed to think they could justify it based on some obscure untried legal theory, but they also had other advisors telling them it wasn't legit. Asking Pence to refuse cerification was public knowledge and Pence refused publicly. All the court challenges were frivolous but I don't think they were illegal. For someone in the thick of it, it probably felt less like a coup and more like a lot of desperate people suggesting a lot of bad ideas.

Pence is fundamentalist-christian-crazy, but I don't think he's MAGA-QAnon-crazy, and he's definitely not Rebel-Against-The-DOJ-because-they're-the-deep-state-crazy.
