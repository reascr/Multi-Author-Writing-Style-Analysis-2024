The strenh of the Supreme Court is a controversial issue in Israel because it’s seen as unelected elite. However, this isn’t the issue. In the Israeli system of checks and balances the court is the only body that can limit the government power and stop tyranny of the majority .We have no written constitution and only one Parliament House that is controlled by the government . The current government feels like they will be the majority forever. Unfortunately, because of the demographic trends in Israel they are right. Netanyahu is usually pragmatic and he hate reforms but he sees this reform as a “get out of jail” card. Unfortunately he is also right.
So the consequences of this reform could be someone expands settlements illegally in the west bank the Palestinians would fight it in court and court would rule in their favor but the parliament overturns the decision with it’s majority allowing the orthodox right-wing parties to expand settlements and gain more popularity with the haredi and settlers maintaining their power over the government for decades not to mention that this will guarantee another intifada.
Yes. Netanyahu himself is secular and pro LGBT and until his charges also very pro judicial system. Despite that, he understands that the only way for him not to finish in jail is to turn himself into a mix of Viktor Orban and a genie that will make all the fasicsts and ultra religious dreams come true.
