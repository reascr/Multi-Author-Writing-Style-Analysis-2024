My own grandfather, who fought in the resistance in the maquis while he was 18 years old, and did a career in the army after that including a long stay in Berlin always said to me: "The Russians saved us from the Nazi, the Americans saved us from the Russians.".
In reality, the Nazis had beyond shitty tactics and had insufficient high tech weaponry, relying mostly on horses and walking for transport of the majority of troops, and designing hard to repair, overcomplicated machinery whilst taking most people out of factories to fight because they were stupid enough to think they only needed 3 months to win, and thus didn't need supplies or logistics.
We may hope so. It would be the quickest way for Putin to be defeated with the lowest number of Ukrainian casualties. Just that I don't think Putin will be that stupid.
I'm also starting to think that its only a matter of time before fighter jets get involved now, but once again we could see a re-run of the inertia over the tanks that got bogged down in months and months of navel gazing and feet dragging before the British broke the log jam and sent 14 Challengers and then everyone seemed to pile in (although the French are still assessing their contribution it seems).
