That's interesting, thanks for sharing. I've not seen many from Western sources. Even in my country (Bosnia), it's spelled with a K, albeit closer to the original (Kur'an).
The official Nazi school curriculum prominently featured biological evolution, including human evolution. 3) Nazi racial anthropologists, including SS anthropologists, uniformly endorsed human evolution and integrated evolution into their racial ideology.
And? It seems you don't understand this basic geopolitics move. Turkey stands in the way, so that other nations have to make concessions to them. They don't give a fuck about sweden or their contribution to Nato specifically. It's just about leverage.
So all the food banks, homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters, schools, environmental organizations, blood donation centers, community centers, senior centers, hospitals, mental health outreach centers, disaster relief, pregnancy resource clinics, adoption agencies, and everything else Christians do should be banned?
First off, nope. At this stage, thinking somebody as isolated as Sweden joining a defensive pact "increases conflict" is the dumbest shit one can say.
Sweden being in Nato does not increase conflict, also Turkey is just using their chance of blocking to have political leverage. Thats it.
Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, like most Marxists, clearly embraced biological evolution and considered it important in underpinning their atheistic worldview.
This is just plain wrong. Both sweden and finland partake in exercises with nato military. They are very close in military cooperation and diplomatic relations. So when a new war in europe started they obviously thought "Well we're gonna join eventually anyway, why not now".
