This unwillingness to help anyone but the upper class and the corporate world really cuts against their ability to win over enough people to go fully authoritarian. Hating on the trans community and immigrants is enough to win over a certain chunk of the population, but they can't win over the people that would be willing to hold their nose and go along for the ride in exchange for economic relief. We know that lots of billionaires and business leaders personally hated Trump but supported him because of tax cuts. We know that the evangelicals supported him to create the horrible SCOTUS we are left with. We know he got the gun nut crowd because he was a 2A supporter and he got the conspiracy crowd because someone finally paid attention to them. But Trump offered little to nothing for average middle class Americans and when it boils down to it, he might have won re-election if he had.
