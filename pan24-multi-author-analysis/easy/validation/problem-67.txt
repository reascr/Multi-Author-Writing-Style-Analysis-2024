Vlad Vexler just posted his thoughts on Lapin/Gerasimov/etc. Very short video. Main point is, "There isn't going to be a scenario in which Russia gets to win this war militarily. What there is going to be is a play for western exhaustion. So Russia's key strategy for victory is not military, it's political"; no clear correlation between military strategy and these leadership changes; "Putin has a history of shuffling around pieces; he loves shuffling around rivals; he loves placing rivals in adjacent positions, or one above the other" - when people make persuasive arguments about how things should be done, Putin loves saying, "Well, you do it now...".
Fuck that. Give them good shit. Countries started decommissioning Leapord 1s almost two decades ago. The state of any that could be supplied would be poor. Enough fucking about, time to start giving them large numbers of good things. Get this ended before the next batch of mobiks start waving around bullets. 5 or 6 countries have hundreds of them and won't be needing them any time soon.
