and there I was, sitting there, very innocently by the way, had your Beautiful First Lady, you all know who I'm talking about, and all of a sudden I see my people, they're coming up to me, "Sir, Sir," I said what is it, "it's the Radical Left, Sir, they're trying to get Allen to flip," and we don't like Flippers do we folks, and I know a lot about it, I've been watching it happen for a long time, you have people who are maybe good people and then some things happen, we're talking bad things, and then they're maybe not so good, and then there are what you would call some problems, and we never have problems under Trump, but then you look at what's going on, Sleepy Joe stealing your Taxes and using it for Late Term Abortions, it's horrible what they're doing. we used to be over 100% under Trump but now, now we're Dead In The Water, ok, you can thank me whenever you feel like it, have a nice time, don't forget, you wouldn't have a Constitution without me.

Prosecutorial discretion shouldnâ€™t include ignoring provable crimes, no matter the overarching benefit. The law ought to be followed by everyone, all of the time, equally, or else society, especially risk-seeking sociopaths, will rightfully treat the law as optional.
