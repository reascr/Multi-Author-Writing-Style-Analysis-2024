One time I was the victim in a drunk driving accident and the police got me mixed up with someone of a different gender from a different state who had a bunch of warrants... I shit you not this took me 10 years to clear from my record in the police and court computer systems. Did I go before a judge you ask? Why yes I did! With my ID, and printouts from the DMV of my driver's records from Nevada and the other state. The judge meh, flips through the papers concludes I must still have an additional driver's license in the other state. I said 'I brought you the printout of my driver's record from that state your honor. I even have the post it note from the police chief that told the officer he made an error and to give me my license back. And the actual ticket with the wrong number and my ID to show it's an error.' He wouldnt listen or look again because he had made up his mind to side with the police and the error. So I basically asked him to do his job and look at all of the official documentation I brought... and I was then immediately threatened with contempt if I said one more word and removed from the court room by the guard for disrespecting the judge.
