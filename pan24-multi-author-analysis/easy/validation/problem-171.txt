The some of his policies if I recall are ending the war on drugs, making immigration easier, and voting reform (such as ranked choice voting, which would have prevented the run off by doing an instant run off right there and then). His website goes more into detail though on other policies. I linked it above.
Why the libertarian national party doesn't just pick the one congressional district in America most favorable to them and get someone in Congress to carry their flag and actually propose legislation is beyond me.
Forcing the run-off was the whole goal. It’s to show that people are discontent with the 2 party system, because they are. More people are registered independent now than either democratic or Republican. Providing an alternative choice is what his campaign was about, and 81,000 people took that choice. If Warnock and Walker wanted to prevent a run-off so badly, than they should have been more caring about the voters who supported Oliver. Even now, Chase has offered a platform to Warnock and Walker to walk to his voters to try to win them over in the run-off, yet both Warnock and Walker haven’t even acknowledged it. They ignored a large amount of voters in the election, they deserved what came to them. I’m happy to see the establishment now waste millions of more of their dollars trying to fight over the seat.
