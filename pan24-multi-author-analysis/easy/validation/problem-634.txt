Worst case scenario would be partisan state legislatures ignoring the popular vote in a presidential election and giving their state electors to the losing candidate that is in their political party.
This would likely cause massive protests and unrest as many Americans and political candidates would not tolerate their votes being ignored. It could devolve into chaos and violence where states may try to split with the US or have situations where both presidential candidates claim victory and start running the country separately where government agencies and parts of the military pick sides and ends up resulting in a unimaginable civil war and bloodbath perhaps leading to the collapse of the United States.
Right. I recognize that but why wasn't it also the strategy in New York. Pllaying by rules that you that are only acknowledged by your own side is it fools game.
