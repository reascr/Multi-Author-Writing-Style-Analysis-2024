The USSR was formidable. Then the kleptocracy set in and everyone has been trying to steal as much as possible ever since. Most didn't think they'd ever need it. They felt the reputation of Russia was enough. I seriously doubt their nuks even work, they're massively expensive (lots to steal there) and if they really needed them, it would already be the end of the world anyway. Now, all the good stuff is gone and they have an army with nothing but leftover crap, if there's anything left at all. All that self enriching has put Russia into a dire position that could likely bring the end. There's a lot of sharks just waiting.
FWIW: Ukraine has stated that if you surrender and are used for an exchange (which is optional), they will declare you captured or injured in battle (depending on your situation), exactly to avoid them getting prosecuted once they get back.
Slim to none. There have been reports that Putin was "persuaded" to start the war by men in his inner circle, and at least Patrushev (a pretty likely successor) is definitely an even more unhinged fascist than Putin.
Sorry. Only so much place in my heart, and all of it is taken up by the lives of people, who never held a gun in their hands, ruined for nothing at all.
