Joining Garcia on the board is fellow conservative Bridget Ziegler, the wife of the Florida GOP’s chair and co-founder of Moms for Liberty, who also recently donated to DeSantis; Mike Sasso, an attorney who donated over $9,000 to Florida Republican candidates, including DeSantis, last election; Brian Aungst Jr., a Central Florida attorney; and Ron Peri, who founded the ministry “The Gathering,” which regularly spews nonsense about “Christian Nationalism.”.
I mean... idk. I grew up around pretty much exclusively republicans. I was 15 when 9/11 happened. Before that, they were also racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, gun loving, white business owners, or down on their luck momentarily broke millionaires. They decried "welfare queens" while taking disability, social security, writing every personal expense off as a business expense that they could, etc. They viciously joked about "violent thugs and criminals" (black people) and illegals while hiring undocumented immigrants under the table, committing crimes ranging from DV to SA fraud to theft, drugs to murder and suicides. I knew and saw a lot of violence, criminality, hatred, and not a lot of brown faces from the direction they were coming.
