I agree with you, mostly. They did set a bar for him that was both unreachable and in no way his own - and they have been trashing him for not even reaching for it.
Basically, Biden made a general stimulus proposal. Then Manchin made some general comments on the idea of a stimulus bill, including saying that he didn't want the sending out of stimulus checks to take precedence over getting vaccines out to the public, while also suggesting that maybe the checks were a bit too broadly targeted. A lot of folks in the media and liberal establishment started freaking out and interpreting it to mean Manchin was going to block the stimulus checks. But then the detailed proposals for stimulus are made, and the stimulus includes both the checks and spending to help get vaccines out, so Biden made Manchin's main worry irrelevant, by ensuring that the checks wouldn't be getting priority over vaccination. Also the income cutoffs for the full stimulus check were left unchanged compared to prior stimulus checks, but the Biden stimulus plan was tweaked to have a much faster "taper off", meaning that fewer people got the partial check.
So Biden didn't get Manchin to sign on to the stimulus by browbeating him, he got him to agree to it by changing the act in order to please Manchin (with the checks and also by lowering the $400 unemployment benefit boost to $300). Manchin wasn't the one who was pressured and changed his mind, he was the one who forced the bill to be changed, and ended up getting what he wanted.
