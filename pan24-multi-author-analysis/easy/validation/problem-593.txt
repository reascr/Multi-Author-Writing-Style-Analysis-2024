Doesn’t stop them from claiming Lincoln. Everyone loves Lincoln. He usually ranks as the best President for historians and the general public. Born poor, studied and worked hard, great orator, freed slaves (that’s Khalessi level stuff), kept country together, etc. Also, he was an ugly guy: “Mr. Lincoln's person was ungainly. He was six feet four inches in height; a little stooped in the shoulders; his legs and arms were long; his feet and hands large; his forehead was high. His head was over the average size. His eyes were gray. His face and forehead were wrinkled even in his youth. They deepened with age, 'as streams their channels deeper wear.' Generally he was a very sad man, and his countenance indicated it. But when he warmed up all sadness vanished, his face was radiant and glowing, and almost gave expression to his thoughts before his tongue would utter them.”.
