Edit: his first two administrations "was marked by the consolidation of social programs like Bolsa Família and Fome Zero, leading Brazil to leave the UN's Hunger Map.[9] During his two terms in office, he undertook radical reforms, leading to growth in GDP, a reduction in public debt and inflation, and helping 20 million Brazilians escape poverty.[10] Poverty, inequality, illiteracy, unemployment, infant mortality, and child labor rates fell significantly, while the minimum wage and average income increased, and access to school, university, and health care were expanded.".
What is essentially a kakistocracy, will soon be replaced by a functioning, near-meritocratic government.
This is not true at all. Most of Lula's ministers are political appointees. To be clear: I voted for Lula, and having ministers by chosen by politics is fairly common here, and important to make sure that Lula can govern with support from Congress. But let's not pretend like all ministers are there because of merit. Haddad, Alckmin, Renan Filho, Tebet and the ministers from União Brasil for example... they are there because of politics. Not because they are the best choices.
