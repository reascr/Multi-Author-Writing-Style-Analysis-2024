It's not that they're that stupid. It is that they are that easily misled, lean into confirmation biases, and their ideological bent requires loyalty to the leader. When a lot of their copium was starting to run out, they turned on one of their fellow Trump supporters and accused him of being an FBI operative leading conservatives into a Honeypot. Ray apps had to go into hiding because of the death threats from MAGAdittoheads and they are still floating the conspiracy theory and asking (bad faith JAQing off) why he isn't in jail wow good old-fashioned Christian homeschooling Patriots are rotting away under house arrest. The leaders of the conservative movement are not stupid but they do play into the confirmation biases other intended audience and use that audience distract conversation the same as they always have. This is the problem when people confuse shock shock comedians do the 3-hour set every weekday for actual news.
