Classification is complicated. Remember, some (not all, but some) of Hillary Clinton’s classified emails on a personal email account were on matters that were retroactively classified after the fact and weren’t yet classified when they landed in her inbox.

We don’t know if Biden’s documents threatened national security or if these were rather mundane documents — probably will never know unless the DOJ reviews and releases a broad summary, but my suspicion is if you looked at every corner of the federal gov’t, both parties, and all branches, it is probably not that uncommon that some very small degree of classified documents end up lost in other boxes/storage of other documents and get forgotten about.
That is not how it work. Biden returned the documents as soon as they were discovered- he get slap on risk.
