Yeah 100% you can’t just have departments of people allowed to subjectively decide if you can or can’t exercise your 2A. I’m all for requiring training and class work, background checks, waiting periods, strict ownership requirements and liabilities for storage security, etc etc, but shit like this is nonsense and does not increase public safety.
No. Proponents of the law will point to shall issue wording while ignoring that cops get discretionary power in who gets a license. Until the permit process is developed and in place there can be no gun sales in Oregon. Just getting the infrastructure could take years. There are no public ranges for people to use and no money for the permit system. It makes people pass the same background check twice. All in all, it seems like a feel good law more than an actually useful law.
Really? The party that wants universal healthcare and free school meals are "set on not addressing socioeconomic issues"?
Compromise? As someone who lives in Oregon and have closely followed gun control in the state since 2014, there is no compromise desired by the controlling party and their donors.
