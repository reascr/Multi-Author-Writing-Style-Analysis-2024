Oh, neat. It's time for the "Republican leaders won't support Trump," stories before he wins the nomination bc the Republican base still likes him and the "leaders" all fall in line and suck his dick. Feels like 2015 all over again.
IMO if this is what his campaign will look like, he will likely: (1) fail to bring in or sway enough new voters to his ticket, (2) lose a not-insignificant portion of his prior voters, (3) remind everybody who’s already voted against him why they must reject him again, and (4) all-but-guarantee yet another devastating loss in the popular vote. Any GOP mega donor seeking to abandon Trump likely felt vindicated in watching Trump’s announcement, because it was just so tired and stale.
