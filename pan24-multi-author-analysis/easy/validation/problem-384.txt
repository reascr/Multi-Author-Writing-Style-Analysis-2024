wait a minute, I had many many more millions of votes than that ok, many more, but it's much much easier, just so you understand, it's a lot easier to count to 11 thousand than it is to count to 3 million ok, a lot easier, and I'm doing you all a favor, they say that I'm too nice sometimes, that's probably true, I gave you all Massive Tax Cuts because we pay too much in Taxes but then the viciously horrible Democrats, who have hurt us a lot, don't forget the Radical Left has turned us into a Third World Country, we're losing majorly under Sleepy Joe. you have, we're talking, 121,000 Soldiers, basically all of them for Trump, I won the Military by a lot, close to 100%. I did Veterans, I did Space Force, I did way more things than Obama ever could, I was even nice enough to give you Judges, and there have been a few who haven't treated me fairly, and that's a real shame, a real shame. it's very disrespectful to the 45th President of the United States. ok, you can thank me now, thank me tomorrow, it's not a problem, enjoy yourselves.
