In some ways it's like breaking into a home, being forced out, and running away screaming, "I want that house that's not mine, that I'm not even occupying anymore, before we can talk.".
The rebuilding of Ukraine should include updating infrastructure to the most technologically advanced systems.
LOL! Several years ago, I got an alert on my camera app and witnessed a couple of people breaking into my home by watching them, from my job, climb in a basement window. I called the cops to report it, kept dispatch updated in real-time by tracking them on camera from room to room (they were relaxed and making themselves comfortable), cops showed up, were met at the front door (which the burglars cracked open with the chain attached), and they proceeded to smugly inform the clearly annoyed cop that they are in fact squatters. Now that they were ensconced in a house, they 100% believed that the only possible recourse was for a judge to issue them an eviction, which would have taken several months at least. Cop shoulder-bumped my front door while wannabe squatter was mid-sentence, which broke the chain and knocked the man on his ass. His wife ran out of my kitchen, mouth stuffed with my leftover birthday cake, and started shrieking about SQUATTER'S RIGHTS YOU CAN'T TOUCH US, PIGS and they are both taken down, cuffed, and led out.
Interesting. Are they bringing any bargaining power to the table? Because they have none. I hope Ukraine smashes every last one of them out, including crimea, before they say a word about ceasefire. The russians would have shown them no mercy in a reversed scenario.
