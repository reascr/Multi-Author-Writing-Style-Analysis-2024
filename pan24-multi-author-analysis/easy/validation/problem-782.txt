The graph on p.1 summarizes the comparison over 3 quarters, from Sept 2021 to Jun 2022. Effectively, their new methodology produced higher growth estimates for the first quarter (7% vs 5%), slightly lower estimates for the second quarter (3.7% vs 4.4%), and substantially lower estimates for the 3rd quarter (0% vs 3%). Their methodology is intended to provide more timely quarterly revisions to estimates, rather than the single annual revision that is currently done. Both their new method and the annual revision leverage the large QCEW samples, while existing quarterly estimates rely only on smaller samples from a different survey. I think the takeaway is that, if their methodology correctly mirrors the annual revision, job growth is being overstated in the quarterly estimates in the last two quarters, and the trend indicates flattening growth.
where's the lie? Biden cited the numbers that were available at the time. if those numbers are later revised that doesn't retroactively turn his statements into lies.
