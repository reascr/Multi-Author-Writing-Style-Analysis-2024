They saw the Russian jets pathetic performance in Ukraine. The Russians can't use their own plane in their current war against a smaller neighbor with a much smaller air force. Russian military equipment is garbage and the SU-35 is no exception. A lot of countries cancelled orders for Russian military equipment after seeing the extremely poor performance of the weapons in Ukraine. The US doesn't care about who buys the SU-35 because it's not a real threat in combat. It's great for killing unarmed civilians and keeping megalomaniacal dictators in power. It will be a perfect fit for Iran as long as those idiots keep them aimed at their own unarmed civilian population and don't try to point them at Israel where they will be quickly destroyed. Khamenei has been struggling to repress the women of Iran. Maybe this will do the trick.
It's not a superb fighter by western standards or by nations that can manufacture their own aircraft while keeping the sensitive upgrades, but for nations that can't make their own and are not in any alliances to get things like the F35 or specialty F16s like the Indian F21, it's the best on the open market.
I think it first got stuck under Trump. But Egypt wants US and French aircraft more now for whatever reason.
