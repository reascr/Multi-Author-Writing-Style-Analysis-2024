Claim that nazis were denazified, zombies put back in their graves, Jewish space lasers dismantled and the Martians are going back to Mars with all their tails between their legs and go home claiming victory. That's about on par with the bullshit their media spawns.
Tl;dr Russia doesn't have the industrial capacity to make competitive military hardware. It doesn't exist. So their GDP is not really relevant.
Completely self destructive. Between the massive brain drain from people and businesses fleeing Russia, the continual sanctions, and the massive casualties, Putinâ€™s botched invasion is going to cripple Russia for generations.
A pole once told me. "Most country's flags symbolize something with their colors. Like the french flag is blue for liberty, white for peace, and red for glory. Well ours does too. It's red for the russian blood we wish to spill, and white for the russian skulls we wish to stack.".
America couldn't occupy Iraq with only 200k (they ended up with over 500k) and that was after utterly crushing one of the world's best militaries in a few weeks, and with the majority of the local population actively supporting their presence. Russia never had a chance of occupying Ukraine, just maybe the land bridge to Crimea.
