This. And the other thing us westerners need to get through our thick skulls is that they are always seeking to dominate. Always a zero sum game. There is no win win situation when dealing with them. "Win win" should always be be auto-translated to "we'll work with you because we're not strong enough to subjugate you....yet." Isn't it obvious? Look what they do to their own people.
That's the real strenh of democracy vs authoritarianism: it's much harder for one psycho to amass enough power to start tearing up treaties and changing the whole country's direction on a whim, and if it does happen it’s much easier for his enemies to restrain his excesses and boot him from power.

Yep, absolutely. Everyone is so outraged by the actions of Russia and China, and it is so easy to justify our offenses in their eyes. Doesn’t make what other countries do acceptable, but it does certainly negate the moral authority and superior we seem to regard ourselves with. The United States and Western countries have and will commit similar atrocities if it benefits us.
