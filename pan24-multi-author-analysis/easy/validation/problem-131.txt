Relevant excerpt: "Archaeological evidence suggests that the Israelites primarily emerged natively from Canaan. A number of scholars do not believe that the exodus has any historical basis at all, while only those on the fundamentalist fringes accept the entire biblical account "unless [it] can be absolutely disproved". The current consensus among archaeologists is that, if an Israelite exodus from Egypt occurred, it must have happened instead in the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt (13th century BC), given the first appearance of a distinctive Israelite culture in the archaeological record. The potential connection of the Hyksos to the exodus is no longer a central focus of scholarly study of the Hyksos, but this supposed connection to the Exodus has continued to inspire popular interest.".
For such a massive event that would have had social, economic, and cultural consequences ranging for hundreds of years across the region, there is zero archaeological evidence to back up the biblical accounts.
Yes? Regardless of who wrote the story or how much of it was based on actual events, if any, they likely intended an actual real life Pharoah based on the timing of it.
