In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I agree. He's done a good job, but his general image and demeanor will make it difficult for him to shed the "elitist left-coast limousine liberal" framing. When you look at every Democrat President in the past 50 years, they've all had a certain folksiness about them (see Carter and Clinton especially). Come to think of it, most of the Republican Presidents too. Even the ones that went to Ivy league schools and grew up in New England. "Not looking too urban or coastal" is an important facet of winning the Presidency.
Hypothetically, sure. But most politicians are busy just getting that word out to their own constituents (and don’t do that great a job of it). I’m across the country and every week see a headline that is “[good thing about CA] [insert how Newsome caused it here]”.
