No. Republicans hurt republicans. Conservative nationalists hurt republicans. The supreme court hurt republicans. The money pumped into the economy and never removed hurt republicans. Gas companies that are turning record profits hurt republicans. Abortion rights hurt republicans. Trump coming in at the end only hurt them because they have someone to blame and the countries short term memory has been obliterated. Republicans keep eroding our rights for either profit or their religion. Nothing else and people are sick of it. Only the loyalists are left for the republicans and it’s seems enough of them turned out to vote. The next battle begins now because in 2 years, it’s gonna be an all out war for presidency. The only one left to blame after that is ourselves for letting this mess continue.
