In New York old line Democrats who depended on support from police unions, etc., lost their seats. Democrats who want to win have to offer a vision that's worth fighting for — a "just transition" that invests in an economy that actually provides what we need, like affordable housing, education, transportation, and healthcare, and lets people make lifestyle choices without getting banned or jailed.
Same. I’m an elder millennial that loathes so much of the nonsense our generation does. I can’t tell you how many of my friends and colleagues sat out 2016 because “both candidates were bad.” I’m so sorry for our fuck up that led to Trump, but keep up the good fight Gen Z, and keep showing my dumbass generation how it’s done. Your anger is very much appreciated. Bravo!
