I think you have the answer to that given how little Covid was mentioned in the recent elections. Democrats stayed away from talking about it, here in NY the GOP tried to some degree to use school closures as a talking point, but really that was it. Nobody was running with a platform that involved talking about protections against Covid or the like. By 2024 Covid will still be talked about, but just as one of many circulating illnesses alongside RSV, flu, pneumonia etc. Heck, it's already kind of reached that state.
I'm having trouble finding the exact quote, but it was something along the lines of people "losing their private health insurance" as a result of single payer and presenting it as if that is an actual loss rather single payer eliminating the need for that parasitic industry. It was, to me, fear-mongering. I don't mind honest debates about the cost or the efficacy or whatever about universal healthcare vs. private, but I'm sick of Democrats not representing the case fairly.
But I'm still angry at him for undermining the case for universal healthcare in the primary debates, and I'd prefer someone else run in 2024. He is not bold enough to handle the mounting difficulties this country faces.
