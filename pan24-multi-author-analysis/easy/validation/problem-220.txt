I wonder if it has anything to do with politicians actively targeting specific groups or the Guardian and BBC giving breathless coverage to the most wretched voices available or the promotion of its most famous author who actively campaigns against trans people until her PR team tells her to stop cause a kid got murdered.
Uhh… yeah! Exactly. And you want to deny young biological males the choice to have some control over the matter before that happens. I’m the one arguing they should have it.

It might be that fighting these idiots, the primary "weapon" is to show that the "Christian" conservatives aren't Christian, and that the military conservatives no longer follow conservative principles (how is it "small government / best government is that which does the least" to have a jihad against people who don't fit into white cishet norms?). Pointing out that some of their talking points are from Moscow is helpful to show that these people are dangerous, but doing the first two things is "enough" .. or should be... should have been if done earlier.
