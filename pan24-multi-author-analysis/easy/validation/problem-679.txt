Several of Bolsonaro's allies visited the USA shortly before or during his stay there, which indicates that he probably didn't just go there for some time off and was very likely conspiring with them. One of these allies was no one else other than the (now ex) secretary of public security of Brazil's federal district, which had direct responsability in keeping things safe, but he was spotted visiting Bolsonaro on the eve of the attacks to Brazil's congress and he gave last minute orders to the local police that facilitated the invasion. It's extremely obvious that Bolsonaro went to the USA with the intent of creating a headquarter where he could orchestrate these attacks while being away from Brazil's jurisdiction while he prepares his plan B move, which is to seek Italian citizenship so he can escape extradition in case an arrest warrant is issued for him.
That makes a lot more sense to me. I was so confused about why they are charging an ex-leader when said person didn't "do" anything specificly to kick off the riots thousands of miles away.
