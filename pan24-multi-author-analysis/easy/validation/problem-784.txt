I read it. And I have always believed that Ukraine can and will win, and it will be a bloodbath before it happens. But the point is that even if Ukraine might win they will only do so by fighting for their life against a superior enemy. Because if they slack they will not win. The only reason they have managed to survive this far is because they have done everything by the book, and Russia has failed at a lot of simpler tasks.
just typical American schizophrenic online mentality. You find it on American comment sections of either side (left or right). You are either for the narrative or you must be some kind of spy sent there by the opposing side. You can try to argue with them that you are having a rational argument, but it's like trying to convince a religious person. In fact these political sides are like religions at this point.
