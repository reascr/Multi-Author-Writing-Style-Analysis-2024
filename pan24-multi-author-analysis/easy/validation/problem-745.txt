Like most things excreted from Patrick's multiple orifices, this is at most sound and fury signifying nothing. Apologies to Shakespeare for using his words in relation to this fine specimen of Texas thought. OTOH, the preceding phrase is exquisitely apt for Patrick.
between making it harder for everyone to vote and then the threat of having to go to the pols 2,3,4,8 times before an election is settles seems designed to do 2 things, ensure they get the outcome they want and it kills most people's desire to vote, this seems like the right wing end game of the last 50 years; tell people gov doesn't work, prove it when they elect you, make them question the validity of elections, make them redo a few, watch voter participation drop to single digital.
I've skimmed it. Especially striking was the proposal for an electoral college for statewide offices. Methinks the solons who came up with that plank either didn't consider that Reynolds v Sims would apply to such a body or (more likely?) they have no clue that SCOTUS decision is on the books. That is, Loving and Harris counties wouldn't have one elector each.
