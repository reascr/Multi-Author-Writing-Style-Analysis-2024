The entire missile strike seemed pretty inconsequential, yes, they hit some of our energy infrastructure, but we are used to it by this point, the situation with electricity didn’t get significantly worse from it. They even fired 2 of their “hypersonic” Kinzhals at Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia, which we can’t intercept, they hit their targets, but so what? It didn’t really change anything. I guess it just shows how upset Russians were about tank deliveries that they decided to fire their wonder weapons at us. Well, at least North Korea has Russia’s back, they will console them about the “evil west trying to inflict defeat on them”. I would be very concerned if my country’s best ally was North Korea, but it seems Russia welcomes it.
Interesting. I suspect you're right though. Russia is trying to regain control over the operation from Wagner. I also don't see how anyone could "take over" the command of the whole operation and not immediately make changes. Putin would be furious if no changes were made, even if making changes would not result in any sort of real victory.
