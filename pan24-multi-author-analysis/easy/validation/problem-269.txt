Well, yes. The Republicans' only platform is tax breaks for the ultra-rich. That's literally the only thing they want. But, no one would ever vote for them if they were honest about it (just the ultra-rich). So, they have to put together a coalition of people who are willing to vote against their own best interests. Almost all their voters have to be idiots. It's no wonder they have a stranglehold on the least-educated voters. They also court all the 1-issue voters. They don't give a shit about abortion - they are rich and can travel to get one. They don't care about guns - if banning guns lowered taxes on the rich, the GOP would be leading the gun-control fight. They don't care about religion, or any of it. All they care about is getting to 50%+1 - so they can lower taxes on the ultra-rich. They will say and do anything to get there. So, they have no choice but to make people angry - so that those people will vote for them. They have to be like social media, chasing whatever's popular and gets them the most support. They've got to trick people into thinking the left is evil - so that people will vote against their own interests.
confrontational? That seems to be a nice way of saying divorced from reality and ignoring the rule of law. The republican party is no longer a political party, it's a cult.
