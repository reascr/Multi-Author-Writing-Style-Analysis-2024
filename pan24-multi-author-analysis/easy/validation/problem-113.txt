To be fair, wether one is religious or not, I think it is fair to try to respect everyone’s beliefs and assume that not every individual shares a congruent faith who believes in “god”. I can’t say “ all Muslims are X or all Jewish people are Y or all Christians are Z” without making a blanket statement inference. Religion has been the cause of many a people’s problems since the dawn of man but there are individuals who exist who follow a religion and are genuinely good individuals. And let’s not forget, it’s nor relegion itself that creates all this heinous, barbaric moments in time but also man himself who uses his religion and hand to bring down another human being. It takes both a concept / belief/.. aka religion.. and a modern day materialized body of flesh creature (human) for such atrocities to even happen. Many people have religion and want to live peacefully. It’s those in power who use it to their own discretion at the expense of the own people the govern that is the issue. When that women was killed in Iran (or wherever it was) by the religious police recently it became the people vs the government. Both sides mostly consisted of people sharing the same belief yet warring with each other. Going to war with people of religion would be an endless war. We can complain about it or we can find a way to live with each other. I.
The point is, this ideas can spread mostly because religion creates a fértile enviroment for then, if we teached people to think, to analyze and use method to build world views we would be faar more advanced as Societies (but to be fair its not a religion but a power thing). Instead we get irrational humans with ground beliefs that defy reality and logic.
Really? I guess I wouldn't know since I've been blocked. That's the type of fool to start shit, apologize, talk shit when you're out of earshot then sucker punch you. Quality humans in.
