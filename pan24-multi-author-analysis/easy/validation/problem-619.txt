I lived in NY for 25 years and am aware of the rural components as well as the politics at large in the state(I still keep up). Those tend to be conservative places, not really democrats. They would not have went for the toughest gun laws in the country if they were what you were saying. For years it was difficult to travel with a gun until that got brought to the courts, like other ones of their gun laws. In many areas it is difficult to get things like pistols and the SAFE act is incredibly confusing(almost by design). NY in general is incredibly hostile towards self defense, if you defend yourself with a gun, you will most likely still go to jail even if it was justified, you have a "duty to retreat" in NY.

However. One side of the aisle in this country very clearly wants to establish one-party rule. And until those traitors can be rooted out Conservatives must be kept out of positions of power by any means necessary. Democracy demands it.
