In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
I don't know about that. Sometimes you have to yell to be heard...even if Dems hold the house, there are places like Florida and Wisconsin where protests and political activism are gonna be necessary if they ever want their voices to count for something. It's important to craft policy to help people, but we can't forget that there are some places where the democratic process has been corrupted to the point where it doesn't matter anymore whether the people there support you. We need to take steps to address that, and getting loud in those places is a necessary part of making sure we put in the extra effort to help those people have their voices returned to them.

Exactly. Every race is local, so candidates have to pitch ideas that resonate with their electorate. A deep Blue district might be supportive of progressive rhetoric or DSA slogans, but purple or lean-Red ones aren't going to.
