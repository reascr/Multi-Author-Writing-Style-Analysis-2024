USA: hold up, europe needs to be more independent but it doesn't mean you can do this. Buy our stuff.
... Thankfully we have had multi-ethnic militaries going back centuries, multi-ethnic military alliances going back as far, and we currently have the UN peacekeeping forces and NATO itself to look to for guidelines on how to create a cohesive multi-cultural military force.
It’s a total sham. I was provided a really shitty ladder to hookup a tv mounted high on a wall at work. The ladder was so light it literally slid out from under me and I fell to the floor and had a compression fracture on my back. I got an ER visit, which included a CT scan and ZERO pain relief from pain I would put on scale of having two simultaneous tooth aches. I also got two visits to a orthopedic doctor which consisted of asking me how I was doing and a reply “let’s see you in a month”. I literally spent 60 seconds or less with the doctor and no actual treatment. The cost for all this……..$43,000.
Consider that the West has crippling economic sanctions in place, that Russian energy Europe needs is quickly being re-sourced (and this winter will be the worst of shortages), that Russia has broken its word on Ukraine so can no longer be trusted with a handshake deal, that the Black Sea would be totally cut off to them with a hostile Ukraine on their border, and there is very little Russia could offer to see those things changed.
It was worker’s comp. But I get to see the worker’s comp registers at work. Even if I am not paying it‘s BS that my employer would be charged that kind of money. I literally could have gone home and laid down for a few weeks and had the same result.
