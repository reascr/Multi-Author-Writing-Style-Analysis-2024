This is exactly it, maybe even further than you've taken it. Medvedev isn't really anyone anymore. He's in every way that matters a clown and a scarecrow, there to play to the extremes and make Putin look more moderate. He has no real power or influence and I'm being driven mad by the amount of journalists reporting the things he says as if he's a spokesdeer for the Kremlin. He's best seen as almost a version of Solovyov who draws some perceived legitimacy from the state.
Really? Most of the russian/soviet emigrants I've seen have been more than happy that they've left. Getting a letter from the government that "you're not wanted back" instead of "we need you to go be cannon fodder" seems to be prefreable.
"America. Love it or leave it". This is their Vietnam War. The war protesters were right and the warmongering right wing was wrong. Same thing now in Russia. Better to leave now and not go back. Horrors await those who stay.
You're basically summarizing the russian mentality. "As long as it doesn't affect me, they can do whatever".
