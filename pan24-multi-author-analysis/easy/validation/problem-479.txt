Look at the type of poll Republicans are flooding the media with right aligned polls all showing Republicans up while non-partisans like Marist, NYT and Monmouth are showing democrats up. So places like RCP and 538 are showing skewed results because of this flooding. The polls don’t seem to match reality when it’s coming to early voting numbers and it’s being theorized that young voters and new voters in 2018-present aren’t being accurately represented because they don’t count as “likely voters” because LV is usually adjusted for voting in at least the past 3 elections. You also have these partisan polls under counting the youth. The IA poll that came out right after the PA senate debate showed Oz up by 3 but their weighted sample of young voters which their range they used was 18-39 was only 14% even though normal participation on average is 20-28%. That’s not even counting that they used a massive age range and under weighted while had a majority of their respondents be white people between 40-64.
