I do believe that regardless of how many crimes committed as a woman it does scare me to be attacked during my runs at 5:00 am. I was along the FDR the samee time and day, the day before the woman who got attacked last week. I couldâ€™ve been running that very next day and that could of been me getting attacked. Or any woman running that path. So that is a little terrifying. I generally have always felt safe in Manhattan but this is coming from someone who commutes and does not live in Manhattan. I live close to the city. I think that they are trying to push a narrative to scare people. But still do think some of those crimes are concerning. Plus the amount of people pushed on trains. I do think crime is a little crazy this year. But is that a society issue? Like I doubt crime would stop if Zeldin was governor honestly.

Interesting. Herkimer and Oneida both seem like exact opposites where Zeldin often visits and Hochul doesn't even pretend exists. Just shows how each candidate prioritizes different areas.
