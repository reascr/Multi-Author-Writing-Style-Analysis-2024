Could he? Would he? Bush could claim to be a moderate because he billed himself as a compassionate conservative, at least during the first election (which he lost but had the SC give him because of FUCKING FLORIDA!). Ron and the GOP have moved on to making cruelty the point. The country isn't split 50/50 Dems Republicans, there are independents and Fairweather non-voters. Is Ron going to pivot to the "middle" in two years, ans are those people going to believe it? Speculating so far in advance is really hard but like I said, the bloodthirsty cruelty seems to be a motivation for him not to even want to pivot.
