Well, there's 20 permanent House committees and 4 joint House/Senate committees, and each one has somewhere between 9 and 30 members from the majority party, so if it's a sad intellectually impoverished majority like Kevin's yeah a lot of the congresscritters have to do double duty.
George Santos is a joke. He hasn't a once of integrity, let alone any pride or dignity. He thinks his job is there for the taking and how he got there is inconsequential. The message to lie about every aspect of your life and steal what you need in order to get what you want, should be alarming and pathetic to everyone. But, it's just one more message coming from the Republicans these days that will harm them in the end. His presence drags them all down. They have absolutely no foresight whatsoever and the foreshadowing from the midterms seems to have escaped them. I think GS's constituents are ticked and feel duped by him. I hope that they boo his ass off every stage, out of every venue and every public place he goes into. He sucks.
