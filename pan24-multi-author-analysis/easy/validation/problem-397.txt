there were a million fucking priorities on day one. you seem to be jumping on this as a way to low key shit on Biden for not doing the thing 2 years ago you just became aware of. you might have noticed the previous administration did A LOT of damage. plus there are a few things going on right now. people have to make calls on what's the most important thing right now, and even if the rules had been changed it would not have changed this at all. i'm really fucking tired of people nitpicking Biden over not being able to see the future and do the one thing out of the billions that require his attention because it's on your radar right now. the notion that this president has the time to go over ever thing trump changed and address them is pretty silly.

Possibly. With hundreds of regulations to address, it is possible this one hadn't gotten to the top of the list yet.
