It's because fox news doesn't sell truth or lies, they sell an experience. An identity. Watching it makes you a better American. Ever try to disprove something said on FN to a fan of it? It won't do you any good because it's not about that. It has nothing to do with politics either, Republicans don't actually care about any of the issues. Fuck they don't actually even know any issues, they think trans people using the wrong bathroom is an issue. I live in Ohio and constantly hear about illegal immigration from people who have never even seen an illegal immigrant. There was never going to be a border wall because it was impossible to build in the first place. Trump never had any intention of building a wall, in fact he desperately needed someone to stop him from doing it for it to work at all. That's why barely anything got built despite him actually having had the power to build it. Im worried abpur what he actually did while we were busy worrying about that wall nonsense.
