No. The FBI is full of Republican sycophants that are desperately trying to influence politics.. just like with Hillary's emails. They've had an open case trying to "parallel construction" the stolen information on the laptop more than two years. Hunter's lawyers have been getting regular subpoenas for his personal and business records from the FBI... the lawyers must have a pretty good idea that the FBI has no case left so now is the time to go on the offensive because there's no more legal harm to Hunter that's not public knowledge. They won't be feeding the FBI more evidence at this point.

Sorry, “everyone with a brain knows because it’s basic common sense that if a laptop existed that was evidence of crimes committed by the POTUS’s son and had been in the possession of the opposition party for over a year they would have handed it to the FBI by now and they haven’t because it’s not real and they obtained the photos by guessing someone’s password and downloading them which is illegal and if they engage law enforcement they’ll be the ones getting charged.”.
About time. He must be a masochist taking shit for this long. Oh wait….he may be a masochist. Haha. Poor guy. Traumatic brain injury as a toddler. Poor impulse control as an adult. Yeesh.
Unless you can show me evidence of either the actual laptop existing (as is the claim that requires evidence) or that they’ve engaged law enforcement at any point in the process rather than actively avoided getting them involved?
