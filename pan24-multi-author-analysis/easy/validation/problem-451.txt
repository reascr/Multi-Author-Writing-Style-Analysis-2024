I think about it more like...if I was a protestor and I was getting messed with on the streets this is now much more a fight for my life. I will avoid being 'captured' at all costs.
This is basically a hostage situation, they are saying if you want to destroy me, i will kill them, we are all hostage of iran government in iran, when outside of iran asking how's going they give the phone to the one that would say it's fine, the recent protest show the world more than ever how bad the situation is, so they push their government to at least stop helping iran government by negotiating and take more serious action.
Lol you’re just flat wrong. Iran isn’t some unstable pushover country like a war torn Eastern Europe post soviet bloc or poor nation in Africa with tons of infighting. They’ve got a large military, a large population, and the UN would not get involved with that. You’d basically need to count on the US war machine for any meaningful shit to happen and that’s be a direct war that would just make the situation worse.
