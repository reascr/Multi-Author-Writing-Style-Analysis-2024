Mainly politics, I suspect. My brother used to work at a northern radar base a long time ago and was telling me that foreign jets routinely enter Canadian air space to test if we're watching. They were usually escorted out without fuss, but not in such a predictable pattern that whey would know exactly when they had been detected. Sometimes, Canada would do the same to Russia. The general public isn't aware of all the little dances done by the air force of every country. Recently though, a particular balloon dance has been widely publicized and everybody want to hear what's happening and what our officials are doing. For political reasons then, it's important to demonstrate air power by shooting stuff down, to reassure people that we can do it if necessary. It's not usually deemed necessary.
Exactly. Hell if they have achieved interstellar travel, then they would easily have the tech to easily remain hidden from us. We'd have a) no idea they were watching us and b) they could annihilate us at any time, at the drop of a hat, if they so wished.
