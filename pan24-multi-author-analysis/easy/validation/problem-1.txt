My point still stands - with all their democracy and freedoms americans were unable to prevent the invasion. Moreover, some Americans even supported the invasion. But no one called them fascists at that time, because everyone knew that it's the government to blame and its lies and propaganda. What's the difference now? Are you implying that we, russians, as a nation are somewhat bad or inferior? Who is a fascist here?
These are obviously not laws passed in the interest of "protecting our children", given their callous disregard for life both at home and basically anywhere Russia conducts its foreign policies and "special military operations". It can only be concluded, along with those distracting and dividing with their culture war legislation against the LGBTQ+ community everywhere, that they are just projecting, are hugely insecure in their own sexuality, disproportionately pedophiles themselves, and afraid of allowing that light of justice and truth shine on themselves lest it disturb the shit out of everyone.
Not sure what else you drew from that. I could go more into detail if you're confused but I'm not here to type you an essay on the matter...
