Also, if the commander who lives this everyday with intimate knowledge about his enemy’s tactics and such tells you it’s something they routinely observe and experience, you’re proving to everyone skeptical of your reporting standards that you’re trying to stir shit by giving your own “opinion” that tensions are “brewing”.
Nope. People like to play the America bad game and make false equivalencies and say “well what if this country encroached on our sovereign borders” without even understanding this this is typical Chinese imperialism, the same thing they’d critique the United States for.
Weird. The video I saw was more of American aircraft, you are approaching Chinese airspace and we will intercept you if you come any closer. And the American airplane responded with something like we will be maintaining distance. Chinese plane remained with American plane till the American plane veered away. There wasn't anything escalatory or de-escalating which seems to make more sense for such professional encounters. Both sides are highly trained pilots.
While I automatically disregard everything Fox News reports as a rule, I’ll give cnn consideration but with an automatic position of distrust and the default that they are deliberately manufacturing content designed to create outrage and fear partly due to money partly due to control.
Not sure what you mean. The story is about that single flight with CNN reporters on board (a recon aircraft, not a fighter). The referenced part is about the encounter with that specific ship, so it's probably the same person talking anyway.
Is it possible that both recorded and transcribed exchanges took place during the same encounter with the same ship? Certainly, but the way the OP article & video are edited, you are left wondering. Maybe video of one of the exchanges is not available, but the text article should provide more context.
