Iirc the US army actually tried to get extra funding from Congress for research into green energy because they deemed that relying on countries like Saudi Arabia was not a reliable source of energy and a national security risk.
And then what? Let's think about the situation here: The EU's has been fairly consistent over the past decade () so to no one's surprise that means renewables are replacing some of the existing fossil fuel power plants. Subsidies cover part of the cost of construction, generation, and maintenance and they sell all of the power that gets generated to customers for money. If there's a power deficit due to a lower "capacity factor" they have to make it up by spending even more of their money to build more renewables which further eats into their profit margins. Based on the numbers above that's an effective power generation rate of 7%. I don't know about you but frankly I don't see how that is a winning proposition even if there were massive subsidies.
(but yeah, using czar/mogul/tycoon/chief/pharaoh/w.e. instead of the proper position/office is cringey).
