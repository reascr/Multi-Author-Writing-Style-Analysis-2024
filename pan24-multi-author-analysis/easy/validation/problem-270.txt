But it is my experience that theology tends to make people into atheists, or at the very least, agnostics and atheist in all but name (with the rare exception who swings the other way around).
The only two people in church I know who have read the Bible are one, a super zealous convert, and two, a militant atheist who got offended when I mentioned the bible. I guess the pastor probably read the bible too.
Under our current brand of corporate feudalism, where companies use public funds to privately purchase stock buybacks and thousands of jobs are sacrificed regularly to pad a company's bottom line for the 500th time, this means anyone beneath the poverty line is functionally a slave and likely going to suffer at least several existential crises over the course of their working life.
