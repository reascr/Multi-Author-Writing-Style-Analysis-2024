Condemn evil, violence and hatred wherever the source is, no more finger pointing or picking sides. When Israel commits evil call it out, When Hamas does something shitty then call it out. All enemies of peace should be shamed.
The United Nations, international human rights organizations and many legal scholars regard the Gaza Strip to still be under military occupation by Israel.\[5\] This is disputed by Israel and other legal scholars.\[6\] Following the withdrawal, Israel has continued to maintain direct control over Gaza's air and maritime space, and six of Gaza's seven land crossings, it maintains a no-go buffer zone within the territory, and controls the Palestinian population registry, and Gaza remains dependent on Israel for its water, electricity, telecommunications, and other utilities.\[5\]\[7\].
Yes. The IDF actually takes active and pretty extreme measures to protect Palestinian life, while Hamas throws them to die on purpose so that dumb sheltered westerners will support it.
