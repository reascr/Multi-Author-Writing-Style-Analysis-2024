The population isn't buying electric cars because they want them or think they are better. They are buying them because the government people decided it was better. It makes everyone's taxes and cost of living go up. If the electric car was truly the superior vehicle, the government wouldn't need these incentives. Also, electric cars aren't really all that environmentally friendly. Yes they don't pollute at the back of the car, but the energy needed to make them go has to be produced somewhere. The environmentalist can hold up solar and wind, but people tend to charge their cars at night, and wind is unreliable and needs fossil fuel plants to back it up. A lot of the energy is lost in the transfer as well between the electrical lines and the actual charging. It also requires mining of rare metals and aluminum that make red water that can't be recycled.
Absolutely. And we’re moving there. But it’s not quick and each country has different challenges. In all of my comments, I’ve only brought that point up. Also the battery issue (which is important), but simply saying this, people have assumed I’m against the change. So much for discussion.
Fossile fuel car requires specially designated and constructed depots for refueling. I believe that says quite a lot about how much worse fossile fuel is compared to rechargable batteries.
