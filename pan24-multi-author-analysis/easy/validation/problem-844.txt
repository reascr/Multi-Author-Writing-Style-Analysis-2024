The strategy is to go to war with progressives, the LGBTQ community and black history teachers. Hence we see the DeSantis playbook of defending good Christian families from the evil LGBTQ community, who are all pedophiles with no family values, and progressives, who promote critical race theory, Wokeness, ANTIFA and BLM, and violently attack Christians, trash their cities and want white people to pay endless retribution out of guilt for past wrongdoings they had nothing to do with. And all right-wing media is in lockstep with this message pumping propaganda 24/7 until it becomes accepted as common knowledge. Because any messages repeated often enough becomes truth.
