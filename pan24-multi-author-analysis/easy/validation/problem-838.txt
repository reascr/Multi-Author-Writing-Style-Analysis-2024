There's a very interesting about this very issue. While a large portion of the public already no longer supports the war, there are other factions at play here. I hope Putin eventually falls due to this war, but it's not at all clear that that will happen. It will take more than just the loss of public support.
That of course doesn't mean Ukraine has to bow down to Russian demands to avoid further casulties but it's at least important to be aware of them, especially as "outsider" because it's easy to throw lives at the enemy you aren't "responsible" for and as much as people point out Russia's "wave tactics" and carelessness towards the lives of their own men, it should not be forgotten that Ukraine has to match that intensity and that comes with its cost too (and while I believe that Ukraine is doing better as defender overall, Ukraine's losses are also scary even if we take the more optimistic numbers).
Says who? In literally every war that Russia has fought, they lose ten of millions. I mean in WW2 they lost 27,000,000. Granted it’s not a World War, but I don’t think the Russians care.
Exactly. You can take the most elite special forces in the world and if you send them on a suicide mission they’re still gonna get killed.
