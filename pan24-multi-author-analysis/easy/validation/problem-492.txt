>The Shah and his prime minister had an antagonistic relationship. Part of the problem stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh was connected by blood to the former royal Qajar dynasty, and saw the Pahlavi king as a usurper to the throne. But the real issue stemmed from the fact that Mosaddegh represented a pro-democratic force that wanted to temper the Shah's rule in Iranian politics. He wanted the Shah to be a ceremonial monarch rather than a ruling monarch, thus giving the elected government power over the un-elected Shah. While the constitution of Iran gave the Shah the power to rule directly, Mosaddegh used the united National Front bloc and the widespread popular support for the oil nationalization vote (the latter which the Shah supported as well) in order to block the Shah's ability to act. As a result, the oil nationalization issue became increasingly intertwined with Mosaddegh's pro-democracy movement.
No. They're still allowing inspections required under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The inspectors/inspections they refused are the ones covered by the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA). Since the US and Europe have violated the JCPOA it's no longer functional and Iran doesn't feel it's obligated to honor its commitments under it. They are, however, still honoring the NPT (presuming the 84% enriched uranium is for peaceful purposes.).
