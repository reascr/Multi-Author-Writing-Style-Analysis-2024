I’m a pro-life atheist. By which I mean I think abortion is immoral, but I still think it should be legal. I have no belief in god. I will judge the shit out of people killing fetuses though, because there is no way to determine when it goes from being a “bundle of cells” or a “fetus” to being a “baby” with any certainty. And I hate that the left has just totally gone crazy and said that “don’t have sex if you aren’t ready for a baby” is such an evil thing to say to people. It’s your body your choice when you have sex too, we aren’t dumb animals. As little as 10 years ago my stance was the same as Biden’s and was viewed as acceptable by pretty much anyone, nowadays both sides have hunkered down and gone insane on the topic.
Demanding unwavering loyalty to their organization. They forget and ignore that they are civil servant employees hired by their employers (voters) to do the job they were hired to do, are paid their employee wages by taxpayers, and are accountable to citizens.
Citizens have forgotten and ignored that they are employers and as responsible employers they have a responsibility and duty to ensure their civil servant employees are doing their jobs, meet their expectations, and our loyal to them as employees.
