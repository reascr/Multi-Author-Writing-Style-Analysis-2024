Exactly what i came here to say. I doubt Putin and Russia as we currently know it will be around by then. I don't see them building any new nukes. Hell they might not even have an army when this is over.
So, what you're saying to me, is that the Western inspectors would know so much more about how Soviet and post Soviet rockets work, that they would be able to identify massive flaws in the entire Russian strategic rocket fleet and keep those flaws secret from the massive entirety of the highly skilled experts on the Russian end, on the off chance that the Russians wouldn't identify these threats and when they went to use them, the rockets wouldn't work?
Hi. Author of the OPEN-RISOP here. I'm a former SIOP advisor who also was in the intelligence community. I suspect that most of the Russian ICBMs and SLBMs are targeted against the United States. The Russians would most likely use their "sub-strategic" nuclear weapons (cruise missiles, air-to-ground missiles, and gravity bombs) to hold European and Asian targets at risk. Just my two cents.
This fundamentally misunderstands several things. We inspect their missiles under New START. The count is generally accurate.
