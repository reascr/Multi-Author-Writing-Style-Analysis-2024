"I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I've studied better than anybody, you know it's very expensive. They’re made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here almost none, but they’re manufactured tremendous if you’re into this, tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything.
You talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right? Spewing. Whether it’s in ChAIna, Germany, it’s going into the air. It’s our air, their air, everything, right? So they make these things, and then they put em up, and if you own a house within vision of some of these monsters your house is worth 50 percent of the price. They're noisy, they kill the birds. You want to see a bird graveyard? You just go, take a look under a windmill someday you'll see more birds than you've seen ever in your life. You know in California they were killing the bald eagle, if you shoot a bald eagle they wanna put you in jail for 10 years. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true! And you know what? After a certain number they make you turn the windmill off, that's true by the way. But this is, they make you turn it off after you, and yet if you've killed one, they put you in jail, but that's OK. But why is it OK for these windmills to destroy the bird population, and that's what they're doing.
And you see these magnificent fields and they're ruined, and you know what they don't tell you about windmills? After ten years they look like hell. You know they start to get tired and old, you gotta replace em a lotta times people don't replace em. They need massive subsidy from the government in order to make it. No we're doing it right, we're doing it right. And you know our numbers, enviromentally, right now are better than they ever been before, just so you know. Because I'm an environmentalist, I am I want the cleanest water on the planet I want the cleanest air, anywhere.".
Meanwhile, it was American surveyors who charted the entire northern half of the island, American army engineers who installed radio towers and weather stations throughout the island, and represents the largest infrastructure project in the norther half of the island. Who owns the land? Some aged monarchy with nebulous connections to a failed viking settlement, or the people who actually built airbases, weather stations, and radio towers? (The real answer, of course, are the native peoples who got there first and whose culture is adapted to live in the harsh land without logistical support...but the USA probably is a distant second in legitimacy, and Denmark a doubtful, erroneous, outrageous third...).
Malicious morons. But its cool, when bad things start to happen in America it will happen to all of them too, they will blame democrats, but still they will suffer their own foolish actions.
