Yea, and I mean for what it’s worth, I am optimistic for the future. Just not the near future lol but maybe like 20-30 years down the line when the U.S has split up into several different countries one of those countries will figure out how to do things better. But who knows.
I’m not sure you know what that means. They’re escalating the culture wars by expanding and simplifying their propaganda; pushing for book bannings and library shut downs; planning widespread violence; and amplifying their attacks on the LGBTQ community. And the only meaningful pushback they’ve actually gotten legislatively is a very bare bones gay marriage bill that does basically nothing to actually protect it. Otherwise, the other pushback they’re getting is nothing more than empty platitudes and moral high-grounding from weak and corrupt Democratic politicians. And the liberals and centrists in this country aren’t willing to actually do anything about this besides throw a transrights out on Twitter.
