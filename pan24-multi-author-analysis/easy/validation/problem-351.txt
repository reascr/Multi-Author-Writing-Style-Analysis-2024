I'll shout this for the cheap seats again... CONGRESS PASSED THE LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDED PPP LOANS That is why they happened. That is why they are legal. That is why they aren't being/can't be challenged in a court of law. The legality and procedure behind the PPP program and that behind the student loan forgiveness plan is entirely different and done by two different branches of the federal government and why the student loan plan is challenged and will fail. Congress has the power to allocate/spend money; the executive branch has no such power. And if you want to tie that to the PPP loans being unfair/failing then you need to point your little finger of blame at congress.
Not necessarily. If the Supreme Court allows the Texas ruling to stand, it opens up the government to be sued for basically every program they have. I don't see the SC blocking the relief for going through.

By literally disregarding any understanding of legal standing. A 1L from a half-decent program could explain why none of the plaintiffs should be able to present a case.
