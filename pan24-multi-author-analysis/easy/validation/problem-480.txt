Like my 4 decade of awareness of their existence has only shown me they're rich, oppressive assholes. The only thing they have going for them is they try not to be publicly dicks. They manage to do much of that in private.
Japan has been advocating for it to become the "sixth eye", which I don't think will ever happen - if only because the US wants to keep ROK happy and as an ally, so that means holding Japan at arms lenh (since neither Japan nor Korea will tolerate being in a close alliance together, given their history).
Yeah we were sold out from politicians. Maybe they figure they can nationalize some of these companies assets if shit hits the fan but it will be too late by then if your population has been brainwashed thanks to a favorable algorithm to be sympathizers to Chinese and Saudi influence.
Poland has Aegis ashore. That's a tech that the US shares with very few countries. I think the only countries that have been granted export licenses for Aegis systems are the UK, Canada, Australia, Norway, Spain, Japan, Korea, Romania, and Poland - with Poland and Romania operating the land-based Aegis Ashore. That should give you a hint as to where Poland ranks among US allies.
