This is far beyond lying, it is getting scary as hell, he is now believing his own lies and living in his own fantasy world. probaly getting feed disinformation so he can tell the people the "truth".
Calculated? It doesn't exactly take an Einstein level IQ to lie your way into a losing invasion, and then keep on lying. Putin played his entire propaganda hand when he literally delayed his invasion plans by one week in a facile attempt to pull a gotcha. "Haha your intelligence agencies said I planned to invade on Feb 14th, but you fools didn't realize that I would delay my invasion by a week... You complete fools I have outsmarted you all" And then everything that has transpired since has only served to reinforce the complete incompetence of Russian governance at all levels. He's not the mastermind you're giving him credit for. He's a failing dictator with a failing reputation, propped up locally and exclusively by a propaganda machine he has slowly been losing control of. Russia is a failed state that hasn't realized yet its a failed state. Shit is gonna be ugly for a while after the complete collapse, but that will be pussy foot china's problem to deal with.
