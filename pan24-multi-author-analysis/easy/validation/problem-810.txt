That depends on quite a few things. China does not want an unstable and potentially unfriendly nuclear neighbor. They can tolerate North Korea because they have their entire existence by the balls. NK only exists because China allows it and benefits from it. A nuclear armed and unpredictable Russia, or even worse a breakup of Russia with multiple opposed successor states, does not serve China's interests. On the surface, one might think it does by keeping the West focused there but in reality China probably wouldn't risk it in case the instability led to the West taking advantage of the situation to install someone pro-US/EU and anti-China. If Russia fell into chaos, China would at least temporarily have aligned interests with the West even though their end goals would be different.
Cancer medications are forever advancing. I know of a man with leukemia who was given no more than three years to live at the age of 15.
Possibly. He died a few days before I was born, so I didn't get to see it myself, but he's certainly not the enduring folk hero in the States that he is in Canada.
