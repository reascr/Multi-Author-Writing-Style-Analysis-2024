US military is no stranger to waiving criminal records and allowing an option to enlist in lieu of prison for certain crimes. Not like what Russia is doing now but mercenaries are often pretty damn nasty and get away with it because at the end of the day it takes some nasty people do nasty things to other nasty people. The military itself has a huge rape problem that got worse the entire time I was in and continues getting worse since I’ve been out. I’m not equating US military to Russian military that would be ridiculous. US military are professionals and Russians are clowns. But at a macro level we call a lot of other countries out for things we also do. Shady mercs being one. And I will not defend contract mercs regardless.
