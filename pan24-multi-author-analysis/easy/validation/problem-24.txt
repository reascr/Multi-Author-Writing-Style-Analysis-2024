I’m not an expert…. But I do work in an area where funding projects and projecting future revenue is a big park of my job (lead innovation for a large company) so these options routinely fuck my ability to do my job well (i need funding for projects with no short term ROI). From my understanding, the alternative is a stock buy back… essentially… you go public to raise $$ and are expecting to give a return on that investment as long as the lended $$ is outstanding… so you pay the $$ back via a stock buy back, that way you no longer are responsible for what is essentially interest on a loan.
This is not other countries and we are not set up like them. Each country has it's own ways of doing things. You want all their good stuff, do you want all the poor crap those countries have too or just the good parts? Each country has a way of getting from point A to point B. They have their own complaints too but they do not use such poor arguments of how we in the US have this or that and they do not.
