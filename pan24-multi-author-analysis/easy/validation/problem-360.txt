- French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said Thursday that Paris has suspended plans to take in 3,500 refugees currently in Italy and called on "all the participants" in the EU's migrant relocation mechanism to adopt similar measures after Rome refused to assign a port of safety to the Ocean Viking.
What disgusting condition? No asylum seeker complaint in italy for poor diet or lack of foods. Heated rooms, TV and volunteering staff even entertaining children. Uk recently was mentioned for inadequate foods for asylum seeker/immigrants. But all Europe is not uk. I have never seen italy or Spain starving the immigrants who arrive on the boats. If it would be as bad as you say, they would never reach for help in Europe. But I agree it is true thst some cou tries offer inadequate diet. I believe something needs to be done urgently. Europe is not as big as it looks on the map. We do need immigration for jobs, workforce. They need to be supported, educated so they can live and prosper in their countries. Legal immigration is welcome, i doubt anyone would object to it. Or people fleeing the war. But trust me, a few of them look for an comfortable easy way out.
