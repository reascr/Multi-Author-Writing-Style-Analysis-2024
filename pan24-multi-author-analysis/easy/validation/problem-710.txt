That’s a ton of people, and these people will move to lower income jobs and will make the fight for living wages more difficult; because they will be more willing to take federal minimum or less than what Americans see as a living wage.
Dems are pushed by corporations to push for immigration policies like this, so that the labor pool becomes flooded with people very hap my to accept the federal min wage and that makes the bite out of workiing class Americans ability to fight for living wages.
Also just so you’re aware, corporations pay dems to push immigrations because they are more likely to accept the federal minimum wage And that makes it significantly more difficult for working class Americans to fight for living wages.
hmm TONs of people. Care to define that using a percentage or some number? Like 1000 people? that could be a ton but compared to the total US population is it?
