I won't object if a woman seeks an abortion because she was raped or a physician identifies some sort of severe medical problem in the pregnancy. What I do object to is when abortion is applied outside of that sphere, when people decide that the best way to prevent a child from being born into poverty is not welfare and charity but to prevent the child from being born at all, when a mother decides that a disability is enough to invalidate the life of the unborn, or when they decide a foetus, a potential human life, is disposable because they just don't feel like raising a kid.
Ty. Wasn’t it fine before? I mean, why is it better at 16 weeks rather than 10? Anyone would be able to tell they’re pregnant after 2 months, am I missing something?
There's personal freedom and then there's deciding to enable decision-making that ultimately strips other people of agency and devalues human life but I guess human life or even basic morality doesn't matter to someone who openly desires mass population reduction on a scale that would make Pol Pot look like a humanitarian by comparison. What good is your delusional supposed utopia of space travel if a staggering amount of humanity will never see it?
