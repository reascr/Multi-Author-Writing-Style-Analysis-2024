The article here is wrong to put the blame on Biden since the GOP has blocked immigration reform and efforts to deal with this more seriously. Truthfully there are limits to what he can do. However I do think it's a crisis. These huge influxes are really straining local cities who just don't have the shelters to handle them, and that means people are inevitably left behind or in the streets.
It doesn't seem that the resources are properly allocated since cities around the country have been declaring emergencies over influxes of migrants. Even California's governor said the state is at a tipping point. We already have a huge backlog of asylum applicants.
Seriously. The reality is conservatives never really care about what their criticism is about. As long as it is anti-democrat, that's all that has ever mattered. They literally don't have a platform besides being anti Democrat.
