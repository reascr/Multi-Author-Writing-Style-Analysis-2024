But he doesn't need to take a lot. Every voter he takes is a GQP voter. The GQP has lost the last four presidential elections in a row. The only reason they have a chance at control of the House is through gerrymandering assisted by the SC. Now imagine they lose 5-10% to a third party. They lose every state wide race, even in red states.
