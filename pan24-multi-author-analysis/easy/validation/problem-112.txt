Because Erdoğan has demanded that it be the official name at the UN and for diplomatic matters. The English name is still "Turkey" but people who think that that makes them look smart use "Türkiye" now even though they shouldn't. Erdoğan and the Turkish people certainly wouldn't use "The United States of America" when speaking in their own language if Biden made the same demand at the UN. Actually, no Turkish people uses "Türkiye" when speaking in English, they're 100% aware how cringe it would sound. Reason for that demand from Erdoğan: "I'm a strong leader See I can force them to say "Türkiye" ".
exactly. every country uses their native names for places, because it's easier for them. imagine every country now demanding to use their way of writing or even their letters is just dumb.
Absolutely. Sometimes nothing happens, sometimes they don't like your face, want to make an example or want you out because your discourse threaten them and that's it, they'll throw things like "Attack on the Turkish identity" at you and you're done.
