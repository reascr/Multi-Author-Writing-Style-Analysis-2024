I do not condone any of Russias actions. There is no kind of justification for any offensive war. Still, deliberately threatening your neighbour (by joining N.A.T.O. and installing missle systems next to the Russian border) is definitiv a rather unresponsible move in regards to the safety of the people of your own country and the other country aswell. The U.S.A. are even more to blame, as they knowingly and openly persue an agenda of world hegemony, when peace demands for a balance of power. This however does not mean that Russia (and in another contexts China) isn't driven by the same notion. Ofc in this case, the main responsibility lies with Russia for escalating the conflict. But if nations don't learn to leave the others the fuck alone than thousands upon thousands will die, be harmed, traumatized and live in poverty just because of this stupid attitude.
Really? Point out the part where Zelenskyâ€™s national pride forced Putin to send his army to go kill ukrainians. Or did your dear podcaster conveniently have no explanation for that leap of logic.
