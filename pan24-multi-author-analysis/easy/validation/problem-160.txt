2nd, it's obviously, childishly impractical. Most buildings can't just accommodate a new bathroom being added after the fact. So that's just off the table. And if you think just adding a specialized trans or non-binary stall to existing bathrooms like how handicap stalls exist, you don't understand the issue. The stall isn't where the problem comes from and, once again, puts a target on trans people's backs while not actually solving anything. It's a "solution" so cis people don't have to think about or understand the root of the issue.
Blatantly violated federal anti discrimination laws. When are people going to realize Republicans don't care whether a law is legal on a federal level or not? The absolutely vile cruelty is the point. They want members of the LGBTQ+ community dead.

A separate “other” stall is absolutely horrifying and dehumanizing. It’s like negotiating with a terrorist and “meeting in the middle” because BoTh SiDEs This literally solves nothing. It’s also completely nonsense that “well if you have a dick women will be uncomfortable” If you’re seeing anyones junk in the bathroom, you’re doing it wrong. If someone is going around the bathroom visibly showing their junk they need to be arrested regardless of gender or what bathroom they’re doing it in.
