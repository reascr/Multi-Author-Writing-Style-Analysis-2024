Dude. I keep telling people he is just a filler trying to pivot how bad trump was. Just so trump can run again. Santos eats glue but trump wants to keep your guns. This is a dirty parlay.
Myers seems to be a terrible journalist who is dogged by accusations of unethical and dishonest behaviour, he claims to be good buddies with Vish Burra, the convicted drug dealer and MAGA swamp monster who became Director of Operations for Santos after Santos was accused of fabricating almost his entire history (when asked if Santos' scandals around his lies and campaign finance issues played a part in Burra wanting to work for Santos he said "Of course, thats my brand").
Agreed. The House GOP is one big magic show and we need to pay attention to what the other hand is doing. At the end of the day, Santos is just another automatic vote for the MAGA agenda and isn’t worth the attention. He didn’t get to where he is to do the right thing.
