More two income households so it's not viable for one of both parents to be chained to their office desk all day and night. If you work for an old school domestic company that doesn't given two shits about government regulations ("black companies") then unfortunately your working life is not dissimilar to the stereotypes about life as an employee in Japan.
Aside from the unfortunate souls with an abusive employer/boss, which is absolutely not limited to Japan/Asia, most people that work crazy hours are going to be small business owners or people in professions that would have crazy working hours in almost any country (medical, etc.).
They are heavily invested in the education of Japanese children (who will become their employees), and the prosperity of the Japanese Middle class (who are their main consumers).
Don't know, dude. That's a cultural thing I'd be interested in finding out: do the regular run of the mill Japanese want 8 hour work days. I honestly don't know. It's obvious to me as a westerner, but I'm obviously not Japanese. I'm curious to see how this plays out. Hope for the best for the workers. Japan is hardcore with employment.
