It's crazy to me that 1 - women there risk getting killed just for demanding basic rights, and 2 - the men who support them are in danger as well, such as their World Cup team. It really shows me what I take for granted every day.
if you want non censored intel from inside iran, which is trusted, you can use r/Newiran, it includes videos from the said time with uncensored footage of what people are suffering from inside iran, without any lies, unlike the r/Iran and r/Iranian subs which have shown to delete and ban people over posting content about the protests in masses, I'll leave you with this intel source, and if you can share it around, the more people know accurately about this, the better.
They get raped. They ask for abortion pills from their families. They literally pick the pretty ones to take to jail. They get beaten by men much stronger than them. Ffs they coukd go to prison for not wearing a piece of clothes on their hair. It's not SAME risks.
the national football team has in it multiple footlickers of the regime, they basically have bowed down to them disgusting fucks up there, have had interactions with them, were funded by them for other things, and have posted support for those said disgusting fucks historically and STILL DO, they celebrated scoring goals in some matches, while people in iran were mass murdered in mahabad and other parts of iran.
And no. That’s not what I’m trying to say. I know this is a fight for both men and women. They are both a part of it and they have both suffered under this regime. This goes without saying.
the 1st match they stud with iran as a form of 2 faced facade, but now we have seen them not do it, for multiple matches, it is not because they were threatened is what Majority understands from it inside iran because of their history with those disgusting fucks and people are right about it, we literally due to that celebrated america winning in the WC 2022 against iran, and that so hard that you could hear it in each city just by being in any neighborhood or street of any damn city.
Forgive my lack of knowledge on this. If I am wrong then I'm sorry. Is there any chance they've had a change of heart? I thought they were threatened by the government after that first match.
