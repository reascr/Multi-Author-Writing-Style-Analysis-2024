Grab and go airport food is the worst. Not only does it cost twice as much as it should, it's terrible quality. $15 for a "salad" with processed chicken and bagged lettuce. Bleh.
Absolutely the fastest way to fix this appalling situation would be to require that ALL people who receive a paycheck from a government entity, whether federal, state, or local, receive a national minimum wage and no more: no expense funds, no housing allowance, no travel allowance, no funds for running an office, no franking privileges, no entertainment budget, and most especially no funds from PACs, friends, relatives, campaign donors, or any other outside source. Absolutely no income from investments of any sort. No outside incomeâ€”NONE. They get the minimum wage for 40 hours per week, PERIOD. All of their tax records become public. This would apply to the military, as well as to. e.g. state university athletic coaches and personnel. All government pensions would be set at the minimum wage. I wonder how quickly things would change.
