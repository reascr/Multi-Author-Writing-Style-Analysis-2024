Exactly. So many people are caught up with Sony fighting this and Microsoft promising to keep Call of Duty on Playstation but they are completely ignoring that the big publishers are gobbling up the smaller ones like crazy. It's starting to leave the future landscape of AAA gaming looking pretty bland. Look at EA. Everyone loves to shit on them for buying up studios, interfering in any major IP, milking the IP dry, and then the second they make a rushed game that didn't preform to their standards shut the studio down. That's a future I'm afraid of seeing out of all these acquisitions by the big studios. I love Playstation's first party games but they are starting to feel kinda similar to everything else they put out. It's (mostly) all single player, 3rd person, action/adventure games (please bring back Killzone or Resistance). I love that Xbox has Gamepass but they can't put out a high quality exclusive to save their life (looking at you to prove me wrong Bethesda). I miss when these studios could afford to take chances and make a weird game or one that goes against what they normally make but now it's all about pleasing Business Daddy by making the next blockbuster franchise or the next sequel or be shut down. I know indies are there and that's where a lot of the variety comes from now but I'm talking specifically AAA games here.
