If Democrats can keep their shit together, soon enough, the Republican party (as we know it) will reach a point where it will either sink and drown or continue swimming, let's not throw it a life preserver, let's put out the best candidate we can offer, one who represents forward-mindedness, reform, vigor, an answer to these rigid reactionaries, the beginning of something, not a candidate at the very end of his career, not someone who won the last election on the basis that he simply "wasn't the other guy". We need a trailblazer, and although I voted for Biden, he's not it. Sure there are plenty of moments where he has impressed me, met or exceeded expectations, and certainly moments where ha has not. I will continue to support him, but he's just not it for 2024.
Your characterization is completely wrong. No, his husband never did characterize his reactions as "robotic", he very much pushed back against that idea. Neither have I ever heard anyone of his staff characterize him this way. Having a tight control over strong emotions when needed has nothing to do with being robotic, neither has being an introvert.
