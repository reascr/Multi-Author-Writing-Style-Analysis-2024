In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yup. This is why many advised McCarthy not to do this; because it sets a precedent and opens the door to GOP getting swept right out next time they lose the House. Well, he did it anyway. So...he will reap what he sows.
The destructive role of these primitive, dark age, radicalized, ignoramus, fascist-neo Nazi, supremest idiots will take the nation down with them especially with state legislatures imposing superstitious anti human, anti-intellectual primitive, barbaric laws against individual freedom and individual independence!
It's fine. Every single cop and a big chunk of the military is fascist, so they won't see any legal consequences.
