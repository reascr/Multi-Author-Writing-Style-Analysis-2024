She was convicted because she went to her probation officer for his sign off on goverment paperwork that should never have been needed in the first place (the state and county should have a record of whether probation has been completed without requiring arbitrary personal signature seeking) and her probation officer didn’t know the law any better than she did, and also didn’t know how to use the government computer systems.
Give me a break. She’s a convicted felon! She made all of these problems for herself. Now she’s unhappy with the consequences of her decisions and she’s attempting to pass that burden on to the rest of us. Pass.

Her criminal history is...special. She's been in trouble for shoplifting from Kohl's, stalking and harassing a judge over one of her cases, forgery, and tampering with evidence in a case. She tried to run for mayor before they told her she was ineligible to be on the ballot.
