I'm just trying to understand where the limit might be, and it seems logical that 15 or 16 year olds, or older, should be able to carry the most common advanced military firearm of the era as they go about their day to day lives, just as they were able to when the Bill of Rights was written.
So, extrapolate these rulings out to the full spectrum of the history and tradition relevant to when the second amendment was authored, and any teenager old enough to have served in a militia (15+ based on historical record) should be legally authorized to keep and bear arms as they go about their day, even if 8 hours of their day is spent in a school.
I call BS. We had just overthrown our government (i.e. English rule) using our muskets. The founders wanted the people to have the ability to overthrow our new government should it become oppressive. The 2A was not meant to give us the right to murder our neighbors .
