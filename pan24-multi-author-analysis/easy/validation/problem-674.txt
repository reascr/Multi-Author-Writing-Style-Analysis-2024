All companies, businesses, even governments need to evaluate what actual minimal personal information is actually needed to operate as opposed to wanted and "good to have" off customers to access services and how long do they need the information for. So many companies hold onto personal details long after you have left or stopped using them. Passing info to third parties needs to be banned. Unused accounts need to be deleted and not "paused". Plus a huge crack down on fake call centres with big penalties when raided.
Healthcare companies misuse Personal Identifiable Information too. Some US companies will search for a patient using their Social Security Number instead of assigning them a user ID of some kind. The secondary affect of this is that database tables in those companies are littered with SSNs because it's how you ID people. If just one of those tables gets sent to the wrong person or accessed externally then it's a much bigger problem than if the world finds out User123 takes insulin.
