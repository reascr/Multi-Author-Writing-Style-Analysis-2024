"The iron cross itself is, however the specific one they use was the decal on vehicles for the Wehrmacht. The one seen on Ukrainian vehicles is straight, with 90 degree angles and looks like a + sign. The Balkenkreuz the Bundeswehr uses has curved edges and resembles looks like the cross used by other nations. These symbols are seen on armoured vehicles not donated by Germany, but on things such as the BMP or on trucks. Ukraine also scrubbed the Balkenkreuz off of vehicles such as the Flakpanzer Gepard.".
"Pacification" campaigns, though, were conducted multiple times before WWII under various circumstances, in response to several Ukrainian uprisings. It's not like Ukrainians always loved the Polish rule before OUN.
I feel that Poles quite ingore the fact that their country was in imperial rule of significant parts of Ukraine and then pikachu-face when they see that they were not always revered.
I'd like to add a note, that there were a lot of effort put by both nazis and soviets to clash Ukrainian and Polish populaces during the war. We can't forget about that.
