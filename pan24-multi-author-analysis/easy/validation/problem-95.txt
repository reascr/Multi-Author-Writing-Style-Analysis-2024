Let us not forget that these are the same people supporting the destruction of public schools through school vouchers and pushing private school educations. This asshole is quite literally admitting to one of the major issues that critics of the program have. That private schools can be exclusive of minorities. Typically the GOP line has been to play this off and just claim that schools will have independent admission standards. Yet, here we see the truth. That they would most certainly try to influence those admission standards, and that exclusion is the point. Fuck them.

Exactly. They think it's some bizarre contagion. I can't imagine how backwards their thinking is, and what they tell their kids daily.
