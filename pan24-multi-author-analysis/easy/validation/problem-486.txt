So um.. does Iran think hunger makes people more cooperative? Anyway, these women are already risking their lives and they know it.. I don't think this is very impactful.
Iran is much more of a pariah state on the international scale moreso similar to North Korea, and despite it's people being largely liberal historically especially relative to Arab societies, the government much more strictly enforces things like forced hijab relative to Arab countries.
True. There not much acceptance. Buuut, where can xou pay with gold? Or where can you pay with your currency in kther countrys? There you also need an exchange, like with bitcoin. For now it's more like an store of value. Medium of exchange might come over time.
Personal attacks aren't warranted. If the vendor doesn't already accept BTC you're fucked. End of discussion. Your options are steal or starve.
