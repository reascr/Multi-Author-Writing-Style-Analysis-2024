What may have been printed in dictionaries in Nazi Germany isn't really very significant as compared the the human atrocities that were committed, and would've still been committed if Hitler ranted on about the "master ethnicity" or whatever absolutely evil insanity at the time.

Jewish custom prohibits inter-faith marriage (this is interpreted differently). Also, during periods of European history inter-faith marriage was illegal to include Nazi Germany. This sort of makes Judaism a de facto race at the very least. In that there's a distinct genetic lineage by virtue of the fact marriage are usually from among one group. Which in turn means births are often from that same group.
