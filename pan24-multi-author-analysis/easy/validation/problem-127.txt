Problem with that is it will lead to a pyrrhic victory - Russia can in theory send several million people and build several thousand newish tanks over the next few years. But doing so will completely demolish their economy for decades to come. It would be a prolonged death of Russia as a country as it means spending 50% of it's GDP on warfare rather than on... literally anything else. Doing so also means abandoning all other fronts and letting West to set the rules for countries like Armenia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Venesuela, Syria and so on which will be devastating long term as some of these are major energy resources exporters themselves.
Yes. Also like the Civil War faction but mostly like the country itself. There's been several Russias in the past (the most famous historical example being Kievan Rus) but Belarus was named Belarus before the other White Russians came to prominence. .
Considering Belarus political stance there also wouldn't be NATO assistance. Even for Ukraine we only started sending over gear few weeks into the conflict when we have realized it's actually possible for Ukraine to win and they were aligned with west. Belarus is not. It might get it's chance if Russia gets defeated in Ukraine and something happens internally that gathers their attention. Like their tsar dying creating a power vacuu,. In that case it could be possible (but still risky) to potentially do so without a massive loss of life.
