That has been like this for years and has happened quite a few times. Also, Demos are not forbidden because of political reasons (a judge would be removed from office immediately), but because it's a hazard that can't be controlled ,the police has not enough people or other reasons like that...
There. I fixed it for you. Modern human civilization can not function without hydrocarbons. I'm all for transitioning to renewables (+ nuclear), but it's nowhere near close to replacing hydrocarbons. transition is going to take a long time if we want to do it without collapsing the current system. There is no other way.
It’s subsidising fossil fuels by € 17,5 bn yearly, not meeting binding targets (like the Paris Accord) and ignoring court orders to protect their citizens from climate change (Urgenda), not to speak of other environmental issues like nitrogen (again that had to come to the high court).
P.S. if you want to be green, using less energy in general is the single best way to save carbon. Your electric SUV is not making anything better.
