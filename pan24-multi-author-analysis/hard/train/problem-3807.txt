If US joins some war, I have no problem with that. If US initiates any new war, I am fully for same sanctions as Russia has, or worse.
If Europe upped its military spending it would absolutely roflstomp Russia. Nazi Germany alone almost did it -- add France, the UK, Poland, etc. and it isn't even close.
Not really. It's not like he's Trump on National Television announcing the capabilities of the US military. Then directly comparing them to countries he thinks are inferior to his while declaring an act of war. It's just some guy on the internet talking theoretical logistics.
Sure they are allies with China out of necessity. But we don't know what modern China is capable of. As they haven't been truly battle tested in longer than most of the population can remember. However I imagine they aren't doing that much better than Russia and both their people and economy would cause a lot of destabilization and infighting right now. Far more than Russia believe it or not.
They aren't "looking down" on Africa. They are using them as a baseline because they are one of the only countries with military might of noteworth. That meets said specific baseline in the theoretical deduction.
They fell for the Russian propaganda somehow. History has always been my favorite subject and I've always been fascinated by military might as well... Anyways the point is if they had paid attention and did a just a little bit research and listened to what our history teachers were saying at even the basic level. They would have known Russia was more bark than bite. Nukes are the only real deterrent they've got for NATO.
Because NATO can't bring down Russia even without nukes that quickly and there would be much more notable resistance.
In a straight conventional war with no nukes, Russia + China loses against a war-ready United States.
Afghanistan was a win, but we weren't gonna stay there forever. Obviously the government we tried setting up did not care at all like Ukraine.
