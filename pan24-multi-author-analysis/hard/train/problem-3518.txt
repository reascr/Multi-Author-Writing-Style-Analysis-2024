People genuinely believe that everyone in a red state is some upstanding, hard-working farmer. Most of the agricultural sector is made up of agribusiness and factory farms and most of the employees are migrant workers getting paid next to nothing. A lot of small towns in "Real America" are stagnant towns, rife with drug abuse, and have suffered from several generations of brain drain. The only areas that are growing in those red states are more liberal, urban areas.
So the blues will keep all the economic, industrial, academic, and trade centers of the former states... the reds will get the farmland, and other sparsely populated areas.
I know that it's not really a red state/blue state divide, but a rural conservative/urban liberal divide. I get that big cities in the South are liberal and small towns in the West are conservative. But maybe it's time to let the states divorce. Give it a 5- or 10-year phase-in period to let people sort themselves into where they want to be.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but part of me agrees with MTG, as odious a human being as she is.
