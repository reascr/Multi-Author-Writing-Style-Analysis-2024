The thing that Republicans don't get about Democrats (and everyone else who isn't an asshole): We actually want it to be OK for a Republican politician to dress in drag The problem we have is when they dress in drag then turn around and marginalize and criminalize others who do so. It isn't the drag that's offensive or shameful - it's the hypocrisy.
It isn’t hypocrisy, though. They did it as a joke, and what they oppose is taking trans people seriously. It is completely consistent.
It’s pointless to dig up photos like this and wave them around as a gotcha. It’s just evidence that they see it all as something to make fun of, and the fact that others take it seriously probably makes it even funnier to them. Best to attack ideas and the crazy shit that currently comes out of their camp.
C’mon now, you can be supportive without selling yourself so damn short. If you could afford the most expensive cosmetics, tailored dresses, and spent hours doing your makeup you would definitely look as feminine as a drag queen.
It’s so dumb that the left jumps on these pics as some kind of gotcha. Crossdressing for them isn’t some sign of latent trans identification, it just proves that they think it’s something silly to do. It’s harmful and nonsensical to suggest that the only reason people crossdress is because of gender dysphoria. Many people just do it for fun.
