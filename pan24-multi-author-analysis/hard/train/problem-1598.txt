This is what I’m trying to figure out. What’s the actual grievance? What has Biden or whoever done or not done in the eyes of the right in regards to this disaster?
Incorrect. While I agree with you that shutting down that strike was wrong, this incident wouldn’t have been prevented with increased sick leave. It happened because the rail companies are using fewer workers and longer, less adequately manned trains. The strike didn’t address that issue, it addressed a symptom of it. It wouldn’t have stopped rail companies from running the trains the way they do.
Now, if you wanna blame people like Manchin and Sinema and the GOP for gumming up Congress to such an extent that corporations go effectively unregulated, I’m with you. But there’s no direct line between Biden’s actions and this specific disaster.
The point I was making is that if Biden had just clearly stated the issue to the public, repeatedly. Showed up in Ohio, and viscerally tore down the governor for not declaring a state of emergency so that he could render aid...Then Republicans would have been completely castrated.
Biden could have also visited East Palestine before going to Ukraine and held a press conference and yelled at the governor while explaining this issue to the public and the people of Ohio.
