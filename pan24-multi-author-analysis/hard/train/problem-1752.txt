But Trump did not do the same thing, and the only way you could think that is if you stopped reading after seeing the words “classified documents” in a headline. Trump deliberately removed hundreds of classified documents to his private residence in his last days in office, refused to turn them over for months after being asked, lied about how many he took, filed nonsense lawsuits to throw up roadblocks in the path of investigators, and went on to invent bizarre excuses about declassifying them telepathically. That’s what Trump did, and that’s what we’re justifiably angry about.
No I don’t, because there’s no evidence that Biden deliberately removed classified info from its proper place, and when it was discovered the Biden team did the correct thing by promptly reporting it and handing it over. Reacting differently to two very different scenarios is not hypocrisy.
Hypocrisy is found on both sides. The same people that got mad when Trump did the same thing are downplaying this so I'm just trynna show the hypocrisy. If you were mad when Trump did it, you gotta be mad now too before you wonder about where I was.
