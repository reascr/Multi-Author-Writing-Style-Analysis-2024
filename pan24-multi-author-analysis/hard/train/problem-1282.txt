- a teenager who is born intersex or has any other gender identity issue MUST NOT have any affirming care under any circumstances, even though such care is done with a MD and psychologist and following all latest guidelines, and completely voluntary by teen and parent.
Even though we talk about the choices parents and doctors make, and it's important to note that these kids "aren't making these decisions alone, by themselves"; it's very important to remember that they aren't deciding to be trans. They just are trans. In response, we must decide if we're going to help them or just let them suffer.
The decision rhetoric is very frustrating, especially from allies. Like, I get you want to humor the point, but you gotta press them on every time they try and imply that this is a choice. It's just the "gay lifestyle" bullshit all over again and we're failing to meet it. You keep someone honest on making the claim that these kids are choosing to be trans, and they either have to reveal themselves to be a total head empty bigot, or their arguments break down.
I wanna make clear I'm not arguing for anything transphobic, just that the comparison's not entirely ridiculous. If we're talking about grooming, IMO it's a fair retort that no minor finds religion without being groomed into it. Tactically, it's a good "glass houses" argument that third parties can understand.
