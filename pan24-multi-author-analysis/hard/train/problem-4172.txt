At least France is trying its best to oppose bullsht like this. In America things keep getting worse and nobody seems to actually do anything about it. .
Yep. We just had that politician who shot up houses of other politicians. Totally expected, though, given how the Murdoch family created these angry people.
The Aussies unleashed Rupert Murdoch on the world. His family and their empire have damaged humanity more than other person in my lifetime. For example, Fox viewers have no clue how he created them for his exploitation!
I was thinking more extreme. Cut off food to their staff, especially their security teams. Make them fend for themselves. Anybody who supports their anti-humanity efforts gets completely shunned from the benefits of society. Tatoo their foreheads. When they show up at hospitals for critical care, they get none. And if the support staff have all of their own resources, cut off the staff that supports that staff. Cutoff their families. Class warfare BY the wealthy has continued unabated forever. It's time to fight back by making them see the benefits of the society that the PEOPLE create, not billionaires.
Yeah I wish my fellow Americans would realize that we'd all be better off uniting against the billionaires, and the power of a good ol' general strike.
