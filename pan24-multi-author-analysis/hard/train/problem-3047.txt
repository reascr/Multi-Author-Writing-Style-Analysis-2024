Even if Lula falls short I'll take someone who is working on reducing deforestation over someone who is actively committed to burning the Amazon any day.
"Look, I know Lula has a proven history of reducing deforestation. But that isn't evidence that he can accomplish this again in the future We have no idea what will happen in the future We certainly can't base our judgements off passed events, because reasons" - you.
Your point here contradicts your assertion that you have to see Lulas plans in order for him to accomplish his goals...
Lula wasn't perfect in his first two mandates. Regarding environment, deforestation was low but it still happened so they had every right to complain. Now we are in different times, not only Bolsonaro was way worse, but also Lula is showing to be even more open to address environmental issues.
I mean, while deforestation wasn't as big back when Lula first took office (in 2003) his first term saw drastic decrease in deforestation, which held for his second term and his sucessor's (Rousseff).
When Lula went into power in 2003, he caught a way bigger yearly deforastation rate compared to Bolsonaro (21.800 km²), in his first mandate it was reduced by 34% and in his second mandate it was reduced by 51%. By the end of his second mandate, the deforastation rate was of 7.000 km², with a total reduction of 67,6%.
