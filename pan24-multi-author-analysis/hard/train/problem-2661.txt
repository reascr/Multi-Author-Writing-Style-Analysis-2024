Title is a tad misleading. If a Chinese fighter jet was that close to a contested area of ours(that’s also located near the continental U.S.), at minimum, we’d do the same.
> The Chinese fighter jet was so close, the CNN crew could see the pilots turning their heads to look at them – and could make out the red star on the tail fins and the missiles it was armed with.
You immediately criticize the US as playing dick, yet you didn't criticize China's many things at all especially on that particular sky/sea where they have no jurisdiction in the first place? So how are you balanced and unbiased? You've thought first about what big bully nuclear China felt but not the bullied smaller neighbors? The Hague Ruling is the real balanced and unbiased, no big, no small, no powerful, no weak, international and outside of any pressure from big neighbors.
The Hague Ruling already proved it all could be done legitimate and peacefully, which nations should abide. That there is a lawful way via international means away from pressure from any bigger claimant, without bloodshed.
