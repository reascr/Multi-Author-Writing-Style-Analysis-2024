Which actually makes sense. If they lift the stay before making a decision the cat is already out of the bag.
Say they lift the stay but ultimately rule that the debts can’t be forgiven based on the executive branch alone, do the people who get their debt forgiven in that window before the door is shut have to now repay the loans? What happens to the people who still have their loans but didn’t make that window to get their loan forgiven.
What about all the people who already paid off their loans? What if you finished paying your loan this year? President doesn’t have the power of the purse. This is absurd. This issue must be addressed by congress not the executive.
Because this is what is proposed by the administration. The core issue is that people are trapped in debt at a young age and have no means of getting out from it.
Most people that are pro debt relief are also pro allowing it to be removed with bankruptcy or removing the extremely predatory interests rates.
Fixing the interest rate problem is far more defensible, politically and morally, than wiping out voluntary debt as a massive gift to a subset of people that already earn well above average.
