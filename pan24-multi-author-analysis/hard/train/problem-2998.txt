One crowd has a history of persecution from institutions, and thus dont trust institutions in general.
A belief may be irrational, but if it exists at scale in the larger population, what really matters is what can be done about it and what should be done. In this case, not blaming Black people (because of their history with institutions) for being afraid of institutions is the right course of action.
The Tuskegee experiment is just one of a long line of events where people in authority treated Black people as disposable. It was (and arguably still is) indicative of deep seated problems in the culture of American instituions. Hence why the author points out that it's not a distrust of the medical community specifically, as it is a distrust of institutions.
As for black Americans, they have a systemic history of distrust in the US government in a wide array of ways including medical experiments. The Tuskegee experiment is, what I'd consider, the most immediate thought to why.
I'd assume a majority of the 1M deaths. They didn't trust the vaccines, masks, distancing while crediting Trump for fast tracking the vaccine. It's both his fault and not his fault.
I'd agree with the first comment that I'm sure some of her voters passed from Covid so if that's the case, she might have kept a lead by now?
There has been data provided through the pandemic showing that a larger amount of Republican affiliated people had higher numbers of deaths. I'm too lazy to post links to it right now as I'm responding.
