Don't fall for this lie. In no way are mega donors going to be searching for a "new party". They will just Frankenstein one from parts they think are untarnished using some from bodies they dug up (like adding any successful issue they can gut - see alternative energy) and the conservative soul will inhabit it.
Do not be fooled by the new reborn right wing promising a kinder gentler nation. In fact the branding will be so slick as to be obvious.
Careful with this media lead as a whole. The GOP is trying to "rebrand" and in order to do so they must imply that they died somehow.
The Republican party has lost its way. I think it’s largely because the demographics are rapidly shifting to a younger and more diverse electorate.
With the ongoing and rapid changes in the electorate, it’s a matter of speculation what those conditions would be for the GOP.
Unless there is a radical change in both policies and messaging, I think the GOP runs a real risk of becoming the permanent minority party in the US.
While the GOP is still in an incredibly strong political position and may yet achieve their goal of destroying American democracy...
