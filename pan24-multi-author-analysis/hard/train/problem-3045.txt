China is a perfect example. People can't search certain things, and information is quickly banned if the state sees something wrong with it. See the doctor that first started spreading the work if covid ..he was quickly stopped. And while it galvanized a nation, China is largely back to normal in regards to citizens not really having a voice.
The whole Pegasus surveillance regarding dissidents in certain countries proves that surveillance technologies need to be used with great caution...and need to be tightly regulated.
I see your theory, but in practice the good the internet and technology does is very easily snuffed out in authoritarian regimes that utilize surveillance technology.
Authoritarian regimes are only going to have an easier and easier time controlling their populations as technology moves forward. China is on the bleeding edge with facial recog, social credit system, etc. Eventually, or at least what they're banking on, the system will be so strong it will snuff out any opposition before it is even able to materialize.
