A Bradley carries a M242 25 mm chain gun, which... If I were in a T-62, I would not be confident that my armor was going to protect me. Perhaps a T-72 or T-90 can stand up to it, but from what I hear, Russia's increasingly having to rely on older hardware. If a Bradley can perforate an enemy tank with a fully automatic weapon, the fact that it hasn't got a big cannon like a tank does really isn't that big of a problem.
People who think western tanks are invincible are about to get shocked to see that anti-tank weapons (especially mines) don't care where the tank was made.
I don’t think anyone thinks they’re a super weapon but they are far, far beyond the majority of the tanks Russia has been using. Just having a decent gun stabilizer and thermal imaging puts them well ahead of the T-72 and almost any T-72 variant besides the T-90 (which was going to be labeled the T72BM until the gulf war made the T72 name sales poison on the export market) and even then I’d expect them to be on par with the T-90’s at a minimum.
In Ukraine it’s been Soviet tanks vs Soviet tanks. The change in capabilities will definitely push tank-on-tank kills since Leopards/Challengers/Abrams are able to acquire, engage and kill T72s from distances where T72’s will struggle with just acquiring the target.
They are, the Leopards are main battle tanks, Bradley’s are closer to light-medium armor infantry fighting vehicles with some serious ability to . The Leopards will do heavy tank stuff, like blow up other heavy tanks, vehicles, emplacements, and really anything else they want. Both are needed, both will do some serious damage in mostly the same but slightly different ways.
