Yesterday there was some quote from someone high up in Russia, along the lines of "Ukraine can stop the suffering if they just surrendered our territory that we occupied".
A good way for Russia to avoid having their soldiers be taken as prisoners of war is to get the fuck out of Ukraine.
The thing is innocent Russian civilians are not being killed by Ukraine as opposed to innocent Ukrainian civilians are non stop being killed by Russia invaders.
Fake surrender is not pow, Russia it self has been bombing civilians targeting civilians infrastructures since day 1, can it get more ridiculous than this.
I'm pretty sure they are referring to the Russian who pretended to surrender then began shooting getting all the ones around him who surrendered killed. Don't fake surrender is the lesson here.
I think people are mostly irritated at the innocent Russian civilians because they're not doing doing much to try to stop it but that's the problem with autocratic government. A democracy it could be fixed fairly easily with through voting and impeachment.
