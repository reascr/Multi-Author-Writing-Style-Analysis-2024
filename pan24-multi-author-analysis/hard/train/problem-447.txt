Personally, I'm not willing to read the article or anything related to this case, so I'll have to live with my ignorance. I am going to re-up my conceal carry license because I just want to drink and watch a drag show in peace, and these conservative dickbags don't seem to like that.
Iirc, Colorado lets you get an 'x' under sex for nonbinary people. This makes me wonder if the hate crime perpetrating mass murderer actually has that.
If a black person killed another black person because they did not like black people we would still consider that a hate crime. The fact that this person is claiming to be non-binary does not change the fact that they committed a hate crime.
Wait, how could the attorney attempt to lessen the hate crime by giving the client a non-binary identity? Like is that actually a thing?! Being Non-binary isn’t mental illness so why would that lessen the charge?
Being non-binary means nothing to the case though? Like it doesn’t make it that they didn’t KILL PEOPLE? Like it’s not the best defense even, and there’s no reason to appeal cause now all the court needs to do is use they pronouns and also correct anyone who doesn’t so like, that’s it? It’s not a Fucking defense for murder.
