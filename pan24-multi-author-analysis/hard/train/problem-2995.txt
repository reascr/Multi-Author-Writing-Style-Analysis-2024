Those who violate the new provisions would receive a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a moving violation.
People buy pets impulsively for the holiday and then return them once the regret sets in. Or releases domesticated rabbits into the wild where they will be unlikely to survive .
Now all that being said, when I opened the article there was a video about an alligator playing and my immediate thought was "For fuck's sake Florida. That is not a dog.".
Except it's not at all like you said. You thought I thought it was by Republicans and switched based off of finding out it was democrats that proposed it. However i switched not because democrats proposed it, but because the bill was actually decent. It just so happens that it was a dem who put it forth.
Edit: got this wrong. Was proposed by dem and actually not a bad law. Bans declawing aang other inhumane practices.
No, I originally thought it was another authoritarian bill put forth by the Florida Republicans. Then read the bill and found it it was actually a pretty humane bill that includes banning a lot of horrible practices like declawing cats, and found out that it was not put forth by Republicans but democrats.
