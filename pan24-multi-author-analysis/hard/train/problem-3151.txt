Or the supply situation is untenable and the Russians are making the logical decision? Supply of Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro has been severely hampered for months now by the destruction of fixed links like the Antonovskivy Bridge. Pontoon bridges and ferries were never going to be enough to sustain operations in Kherson in the face of an ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive, especially since the stopgap crossings were constantly getting identified and hit by long range strikes.
No. Stop spresding dumb falsehoods that have no basis in reality. If the Russians were ever going to use nuclear weapons, there would overt signs and western intelligence would know about it.
As much as this is a victory for Ukraine, I'm just dreading the amount of damage the occupation forces did in the 7 months they were there. There's already been reports of Russian forces looting the city on their way out and it wouldn't surprise me if the Ukrainians find mass graves of murdered civilians like they did in Bucha.
The fact that Ukraine likely doesn't have to fight 50,000 Russian troops for control of the city is a great thing, but it doesn't mean much for the progress of the war (which is obviously still going in Ukraine's favor).
