So, let me get this right. Jordan is threatening to use the power of a subpoena….when he ignored the one the Jan 6 committee sent him? Why would anyone submit to his subpoena, when he did not?
I’m not arguing with you but the subpoenas seem to be invalid if you can’t enforce them. I believe I’ve heard no teeth. It takes years to get someone to even respond to a subpoena. I believe two plus years of delay tactics is easy with little effort. The system is broke and this is just more proof.
Why would anyone answer a subpoena from a group that refuses to answer them? I’m lost! So should the Democrats hold there own investigation into Trumps children at the same time. Again this congress was elected to address immigration, crime and the economy and have no plans to do anything but obstruct.
Edit GOP had no intention of doing anything about immigration, crime or the economy. That was gaslighting. After all they are trying to deflect from the biggest crimes in America, the INSURRECTION and the traitortrump document theft. While seating frauds and seditious traitors.
While I fully support Senate Dems in both we are looking at 2 years of investigation wars and ZERO legislation.
The joint Dem House & Senate investigation is now moving just to the Senate. And there are rumblings of Dem Senate investigation of Alito and Thomas.
Nah, forget that. Ignore or executive privilege every sham subpoena. Gym Jordan being chair of justice while being investigated for OBSTRUCTION of justice is just one of the many ludicrous unfit debacles of this GOP House.
