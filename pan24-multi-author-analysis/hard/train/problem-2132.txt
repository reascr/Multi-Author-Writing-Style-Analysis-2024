It would be insane not to consider companies offsetting their emissions to be net-zero. That is literally what 'Net' means.
Humans cause just over half of the climate-changing emissions, with somewhere around 40% being caused by natural sources in our exit from Earth's last ice age. So unless we can reduce our emissions by 166% we are going to have problems anyway, and there is no way to bring total earth emissions to zero without deliberate offsetting.
But to do that UN scientists say that global emissions must be slashed virtually in half by 2030, and after that they should be reduced to net zero by 2050.
Antonio Guterres said businesses as well as cities and regions should update their voluntary net zero pledges within a year to comply with the recommendations by UN experts, as he trained his sights on fossil fuel firms and "their financial enablers".
The UN expert panel, convened by Guterres after UN climate talks in Glasgow last year, set its sights on drawing a "red line" around greenwashing in net zero targets from companies, cities and regions.
A central recommendation from the panel is that net zero plans must be in line with the Paris Agreement's most ambitious aim of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.
