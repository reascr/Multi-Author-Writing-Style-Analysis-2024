If we didn't have these systems that reward land area more than votes, it would actually push Republicans toward the center. They can run radical right because they know they can lose by as much as 9 million votes and still walk away with the presidency. And you have similar forces at work in the senate and house.
I don't know who the Republican nominee will be in 2024, but whoever it is, I can almost assure you they will lose the popular vote.
Problem is the way our system works and due to the fact our Presidential election isn’t based on popular vote that can work against us and it has. Especially considering the extreme right now has a stranglehold the Republican Party. Not sure how much the average Republican agrees with the more extreme crap, but it hasn’t stopped them from voting for this sh\\. Hell the Republican may not have a large majority in the House but they were able to win a majority and look what they have done so far.
Actually. my main point is that this sort of thing is incompatible with a Republic such as ours. It’s not what a Republic should be doing and that’s not in our best interest when it comes to our survival. If nothing else Trump should have reminded people of that.
