Cuckservative governments in both countries have been intentionally fucking those systems up to force privatization. So yeah it's still a capitalism problem.
IMHO, that's the same thing with capitalism. It requires critical thinking, wisdom, and attention from citizens. (e.g. enforcing anti-trust laws, keeping economic inequality at healthy levels, making sure the social mobility ladder is there and is very wide, and functions both way, i.e. rich but dumb and lazy people fall, poor but intelligent and hard working people rise, making sure education is free, including higher education; making sure unions have high degree of freedoms, and rights (as they're the checks-and-balances of the upper-class and their corporations), making sure parliament is elected by proportional representation, so that people from the lower and middle class can get elected with support from unions, and make sure taxes are fair, and inequality low, making sure the field is level and people rise on merit alone (but people don't fall too low, i.e. a rather equal society) and etc. etc.).
Ideological? What? The people doing that do it for one reason: greed! That's not ideological. That's extremely practical. They just want more wealth, more influence, and more power.
