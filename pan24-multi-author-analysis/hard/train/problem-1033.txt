Democracy tells about the source of the power the offices wield (demos - the 'mob' or people). It is contrary to monarchy (bloodline) where the confusion comes from, theocracy (god), and dictatorship (power/might/military).
I could accept this, if I did not explicitly brought up an example of this not being the case. A republic can be easily a country where the upper class or some arbitrary group elects the officials. One could argue that the US was originally not a democracy, as only land owning white men were able to vote. But this is a false view of history, trying to apply current day morality to past structures and events. In their time the original US system was a fairly progressive one, that was viewed as democracy by its peers, and was intended to be a federation of democracies in a democracy by its founders (however irrelevant that is).
Now, I know some states are trying to popularize the notion of illiberal democracy, which is fundamentally absurd, imo, same strategy as Republicans stateside like Mike Lee seem to embrace, enjoying the trappings of democracy while trying to pull the ladder up behind them, etc. I think it’s an ugly, power hungry strategy.
At the end of the day, however, you simply can’t make the argument that democracy is not integral to the function of any republic, and if your state structures are granted legitimacy by democratic consent of the governed, if they are built on the foundation of popular democracy, pulling up the ladder so fewer people are represented is nothing less than authoritarian, anti-democratic, and caustic to the legitimacy of government. Stripping people of their representation is destabilizing. That, btw, is the same notion as concentrating representation in the hands of fewer people. Also destabilizing.
