As a Finn, and who also who has done their military service. I think it's dumb that it's a law that you can't burn your own Finnish flag, it would be your own property and have a right to do what you want with it.
Doesn't mean I agree with it, doesn't mean I don't think its not disrespectful. But I wholeheartedly agree that it's just a fucking flag and my despite if someones or mine feelings get hurt that someones burning their own property doesn't give the government a right to persecute them for that.
I agree, though I don't agree on their agenda, the demonstration was perfectly legal and burning any other flag than the Finnish one is not against the law so I don't really see a problem here.
Which is kind of sad really. So much wasted potential. I think it has to be changed at some point in the future. The burden on that flag has really become too great.
Maybe some flag which really means something. I remember patriotism lessons in school, flag colors Is something about blood of motherland defenders, faith, soul, church and that kind of shit. Everything about “great past” and nothing about, I don’t know, the future? That’s the main problem: our great history, Nikolai 2, Stalin, we’re biggest country on the world, WW2, WW2 again, “everybody respected us when we was USSR”, and again WW2. The whole fucking country is living past. It makes me sick. I swear for my whole life in Russia I never heard anything about our future, only bullshit about good old days and stories about bad future of the West.
