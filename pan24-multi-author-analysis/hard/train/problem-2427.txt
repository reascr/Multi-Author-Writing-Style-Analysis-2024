You're right. It didn't work on Germany, it didn't work on England, it didn't even really work on Japan before the nukes. And it isn't going to work on Ukraine either. In case anyone wants a long form explanation as to why that is, here's a link to someone who's clearly done their research.
As of early 1945, most of the highest officials in Japan wanted to continue the war and found surrender less favorable than total destruction.
Hirohito wanted to negotiate more favorable terms than total surrender, but that caused his generals to stage a failed coup in the days after the bombing of Nagasaki.
Furthermore, Hirohito told the public and his military two different reasons for the surrender. He told the public it was nukes and told the military that it was the USSR joining the war against Japan.
Japan declared they lost not because of the two bombs but because Russia joined hands with the US and declared war. I do agree that the atomic bombs may have played a part in the capitulation but not the major one.
„The role of the atomic bombings in Japan's unconditional surrender, and the ethics of the two attacks, is still debated.“.
„The role of the atomic bombings in Japan's unconditional surrender, and the ethics of the two attacks, is still debated.“.
My understanding is that the nukes had very little, if anything, to do with Japan's surrender and that this story served more as a face-saving measure for both sides:
I'm starting to ramble but the Soviets were the brute force strenh that won the war in Europe but they weren't the main reason why Japan surrendered.
Japan got to bow out with some dignity now that they could point to a superweapon as the cause, but the real reason was that they didn't want the USSR joining the fight.
