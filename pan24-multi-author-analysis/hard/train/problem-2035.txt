Either she is well aware that her comments are homophobic and vile or she believes that the Republicans that support her are just as vile and stupid as she is and won't care.
If they don't call them a bottom they just straight up say someone sucks dicks or has sex with men because being gay or a woman is the ultimate dehumanizing thing for conservative men it seems.
Crazy (but also not that surprising) to see conservative women use such rabidly misogynistic language to attack a (presumably) gay man.
It's almost like she's mad that her party sees her as the weaker sex and is lashing out, using language that denigrates him in almost exactly the same ways conservatives and misogynists denigrate women.
It definitely seems like conservatives exhibit some kind of racial-sexual inferiority complex, and I think that's worth pointing out anytime "cuck" comes up.
Have you noticed the connection between conservatives' "great replacement theory" and the fact that a large percentage of "cuck" porn is large black and brown men fucking white women?
