They were probably more concerned about Russia escalating the conflict and involving nukes, but seeing as Putin has constantly threatened nukes and nothings happened I guess they might re-evaluate their precaution.
If Russia begins to take a lot of damage inside their own borders it just gives them a reason to point towards nuclear weapon usage. They can drop a warhead in Ukraine and at the same time point towards the attacks inside Russia and their civilian casualties as an excuse to try to end the war quickly.
Then the Russians send nuclear warheads at Ukraine to quickly end the war. They know NATO won't retaliate over Ukraine. Currently they don't have any actual excuse to fire nukes, attack deeper into their homeland and that stops being the case.
It sucks for the Ukrainians but that is how you avoid them just going nuclear. Turn Ukraine into a never ending meat grinder. Russia already has an aging declining population, they can't hold out for years taking casualty numbers like we are seeing.
You keep supplying them as is and make sure they mainly stick to killing Russians inside Ukrainian borders. It will never give Russia an excuse for using nuclear weapons against them since they are the aggressor to begin with. Even China would cut them off if they nuked Ukraine currently.
