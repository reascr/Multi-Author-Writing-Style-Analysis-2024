"Besieged Rep.-elect George Santos lept to the disgraced former President's defense Friday, telling reporters '(Trump) and I took a wild trip to Tijuana three summers ago' where the pair allegedly 'saw a real donkey show and this old guy who we think was a shaman gave us these mushrooms that totally made us trip balls'.".
"Despite an incredulous public, Trump double-downed on claims made by Santos, declaring him 'the baddest dude you've ever met' and 'one tough hombre' - statements that seem to back up Santos's claim that he dropped out of DeVry Technical College to undergo 'Alpha-Plus training in the Navy SEALS' and that he owns a crossbow.".
"Transcripts obtained from DeVry by the New York Times indicate Santos held a steady 2.1 GPA in accounting before dropping out and spending the remainder of his student loans on a 'sick set' of throwing stars.".
This. So much this. He pulled in $4.4mil in 2019 and heâ€™s a billionaire?? Even if he was worth $1 billion his assets only made him .4%??? No way in hell.
