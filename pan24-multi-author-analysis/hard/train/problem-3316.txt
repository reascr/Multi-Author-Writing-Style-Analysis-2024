Problem is there's only two types of Republicans left (at least judging by their public statements): extinguished and MAGA.
Kasich, Cheney and - shudder - Ryan are all seen as traitors by the base and would never be able to lead the GOP caucus even if they were somehow miraculously elected Speaker.
The Republicans have more votes in the House so there is no way a Democrat can win the vote for Speaker so nominating a progressive wouldn't do anything. It appears that McCarthy will be nominated by the majority of the Republican party, but if Democrats choose someone a semi-sane Republican who would peal off even a few votes from the Republican party they can deny McCarthy control of the House.
If Republicans really do end up with 219 seats and Democrats could find a rational Republican that their entire caucus could get behind (and poach a few Republican votes) they could install a rational actor as Speaker instead of McCarthy who would be beholden to the crazies in his caucus. There won't be a Democrat Speaker, but we can make sure there's a sane one.
No, neither one are my preferred candidate for speaker. But either is better than McCarthy, and neither would be too keen on 24x7 Hunter Biden investigations and impeachment trials.
From the outside, I'm not prepared to say how practical it is. But I think Jeffries should at least consider the idea.
