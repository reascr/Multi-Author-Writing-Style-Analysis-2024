Lower population growth=aging population=less workers of productive age=more people of retirement age to support=huge economical issues. Add this to other economic issues that china are facing we might be in for a very rough few years ahead.
And now with global trade wars against China, industries leaving and their workers demanding much better lives. They got very rough times ahead of them.
Go look at an updated age pyramid of China, their economy is already going down the toilet. What happens in few decades when their working force is almost half of their retired people?
Retirees do not drive the economy like workers. They also do not pay into the system (anymore). And China doesn't have a social safety net like the US. Retirees in any country are, in a sense, liabilities, not assets.
If you live on a farm in rural China a child is an asset (free labor). If you move to the city a child is a liability (like a very expensive pet). Plus most Chinese workers in the city live in squalid semi-poverty conditions. Not exactly conducive to growing a family. They usually don't qualify for any public benefits because they live in the wrong province illegally.
