If it's the former, there's not a whole lot to say, because nothing happened. If it's the latter, they're not going to want to say anything. And even if they want to, they can only say so much, because pursuing charges means that they need to assemble a grand jury for an indictment, and grand juries are secret proceedings.
I thought the special grand jury had already said they thought there were crimes but couldn't refer charges for indictment, and the thing on Tuesday was presenting to a grand jury with the power to indict.
I think it's unlikely that much will be released following Tuesday's hearing because there are two outcomes from the Special Grand Jury: (1) no crimes were committed or (2) they think crimes were committed.
The hearing on Tuesday will largely be about how much (if any) of the special grand jury's report can be made public.
Some good news - there's a hearing in GA Tuesday about what from the completed Fulton County special grand jury report is made public. One of the prominent attorney analysts seemed certain that some kind of indictment or other serious move would follow from it. This might be a good week.
