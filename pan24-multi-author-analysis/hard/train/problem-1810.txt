Fruit is the product of sex and a reminder to kids that sex is happening They see fruit at home, on TV, and at school. You can't go into a grocery store without seeing fruit. They even get sneaky and try to sell dried fruit like it's candy Won't someone please think of the children?
OMG Kids are the product of sex, as well I just realized that kids seeing OTHER KIDS is also a reminder of sex.
Sadly, it's more than just grapes. Plants of all kinds are out there just willy nilly having sexual relations out in the open. Sometimes they make bugs join in with no consent. Some are even having sex with themselves! I just pulled this off Scientific American:
"Fruit development normally beginsÂ when one or more egg cells in the ovular compartment of the flower are fertilized by sperm nuclei from pollen.".
While we are at it. Milk is white - you know what else is white and expressed as a natural consequence of sex ? Semen. So no more animal based milks. The abominations that are nut milks must be stopped as well because nut is a colloquial term for a man's ejaculate and nether regions.
