Trump became the nominee in spite of the GOP, not because of the GOP. He resonated with GOP voters in ways that even the GOP wasn't aware existed.
Pretending that the GOP "isn't aware" of itself is unsupported by their own history. Trump was just the latest and loudest in a 70-year string of lying, conspiring GOP leaders.
These aren't either/or "grievances" and it isn't helpful to rank one conservative injustice above another. My black, LGBTQ friends are attacked for being both and wouldn't agree that one kind of oppression is "truer" than another.
Like right now they're less racist than they are homophobic, and they're more transphobic than that. Let them "win" against trans people and they'll go after the gays. Let them win against the gays and they'll go after their once token black people. Let them win against black people and they'll start rolling back what it means to be "white". The Irish weren't always in the "club", and without black people to contend with, they can be expelled again.
