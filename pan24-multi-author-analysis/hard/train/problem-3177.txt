Finally moved into a spot with my partner and roommates. I had to quit my old job then(too far) obtain 2 jobs in my new area I lived in, save up and pay tuition and my part of rent, also i was obviously no contact with my family, but, unfortunately, that meant I could not see my siblings. Eventually my partner and I found our own spot, no roommates, and were able to add 2 furry babies to the pack.
On my 23rd birthday last September, I had a feeling they would come to my apartment demanding to see me. They did. I broke, mentally, that day. Honestly, I have never been the same since. The amount of anger, rage, and hatred I have in me scares me. Im no longer depressed and ridden in anxeity, but I know I have to see someone for my anger.
Shockingly, I still consider myself somewhat Christian affiliated/agnostic ( still working on that ), despite all the pain I have suffered from this horrific religion. It is not brainwashing either, its because I choose Love, Happiness, and kindness. That is what Jesus is really about... right?
And you're right about Jesus. He wasn't just a hippie. Sermon on the Mount showed another side. But he was still accepting of everyone too. It seems like we'll be judged on what we decide to do with our free will.
