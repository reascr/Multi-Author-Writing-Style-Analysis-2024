We do nothing about it. For decades now, the citizens of the US have been at ease and have forgotten what it means to stand up for justice. As it turns out, that's a recipe for the installation of fascists throughout the government. It's not enough for a few thousand of us to online comment.

"No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.".
