I amazes me that adults need to have simple concepts explained to them. The government isn't just giving away this money and weaponry. It will be similar to the lend lease act during ww2 where we basically indebt them with contracts that repay the aid amount in x amount of dollars, at x amount of interest, over x amount of years. Noone is giving anyone anything for free. Ukraine will be paying this back for a hundred fucking years, with compounding interest.
So while we spend a lot of money on our military, whether or not we send our old stuff to Ukraine doesn't free up that money. We were going to spend it either way.
Much of what we're sending is stuff that was going to "expire" soon. Ammunition has a limited shelf life, for example. We were going to buy new ammo anyways. By sending it to Ukraine, we're actually getting more "value" out of it than if we destroyed it (value in terms of stopping Putin from running roughshod over Eastern Europe).
Even if it were money, it's less than in the long run if we didn't send it. Ukraine is a breadbasket and also sitting on a lot of untapped oil and gas. If Russia were to take over Ukraine they'd control even more world food and energy markets. Also, they'd be poised for their target, probably Moldova.
