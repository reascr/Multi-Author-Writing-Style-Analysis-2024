My sympathy for people expecting dual standards for either the rich or famous never existed. Until all people incarcerated for weed offences in the US are released I don’t see why an effort should be made for her.
American has been “Leading a war on drugs” for a good long time. There are loads of people incarcerated for weed in the US. Then someone goes abroad and vapes weed against the law and people get upset that she’s being punished. Ok you can argue about the nature or degree of the punishment and that she is being used as a political prisoner. It’s not like there are any countries above those kinds of games. I mean if she was vaping weed she should have been caught for doing drugstore and banned from the sport for a while anyway. I seriously doubt this is the first time she’s ever done this.
I’m curious why people should care about her so much when there are so many Americans in US jails? Aren’t there something like 1% of all Americans in jail, mostly for pretty minor offences?
Who cares, people were advised not to go and thousands of men have gone to jail, for a lot longer for the same thing in the states.
