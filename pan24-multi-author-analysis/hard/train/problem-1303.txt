We live in SE MI, but spend a lot of time in the Traverse City area. It's eye opening just how belligerently far right some of rural areas we travel through can be. Hell, for over 5 damn years we drove past a billboard just outside of Cadillac saying "We Love 45" with that shit stains smiling face plastered on it. It was a good day when we saw it had finally been covered up.
There was another Michigan sub created by right wingers because they consider r/Michigan to lean too much to the left.
I love living in Michigan, but it parallels Florida in this specific way - the further north you go, the more south it gets.
Life long Michigander here and it is a great place. Lots of water including inland lakes. 4 Seasons. Yes long winters but truth is if you learn to enjoy winter sports and activities you will fall in love with the winters. However the housing opportunities here are not good right now and if you are escaping because you think we are a Super Blue State you are unfortunately wrong. Look at our election map. Only the metro areas are blue so Michigan has tons of work to do. Also if your state is red we need you to stay and fight. But if you decide to move here we will surely welcome you with open arms or should I say open mitten...lol.
