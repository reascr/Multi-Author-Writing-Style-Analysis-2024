Same thing is being done in the Salton Sea in California. Its a saline body of water inland which got polluted by farming runoff decades back so not much wildlife. But its very rich in minerals like lithium.
Discoveries of lithium deposits in third world counties are not as exciting as they seem at first glance. Countries and landowners take a cut, you need skilled mining labor, funding for the project, permits, water rights, cheap electricity and accessible infrastructure like roads and shipping access. Having a deposits and being able to mine and refine it at a competitive price is another thing.
Nearly every analyst calculates a lithium shortage for the next 5-10 years. The average mine takes 10 years to get to production and can cost $500-$900 million in funding to get started.
There are also "ESG" ratings for projects. Car companies, etc want to know they are sourcing Lithium from environmentally responsible sources. They also need stable production. Lithium mines in politically sketchy places are a risky bet. GM just invested something like $800 million in Lithium Americas Thacker Pass project in the U.S. Just to secure a stable source of lithium for their vehicles.
