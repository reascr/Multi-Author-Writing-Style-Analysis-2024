Hereâ€™s a fun fact . To Regulate rail safety it has to be voted by congress as it is law. A president nor any cabinet member can unilaterally change laws. The brake rule change was done by congress and has to be changed by congress . This would have passed the house Bidens first two years but would have never made it out of the senate due to a couple corporate democrats and lack of actual majority . So ironically there would have been no way for Biden to pass this anyway .
Well Biden is supposed to give a speech on the objects we've been shooting down. So he should mention that he wants congress to make a law, that all trains now have the ect braking system that was an executive order that the last adminstration repealed.
What's right, though, is probably not to try to pass a regulation, which will then be immediately prevented from going into effect by court injunctions because Congress in 2015 explicitly required that this exact regulation be repealed.
Legally he probably can't reinstate the old rule, because congress changed the law, which is why he wants congress to pass a new law allowing the rules so the supreme court won't throw it out, because he cares more about the rules actually ending up good, than simply sounding good for sound clips.
