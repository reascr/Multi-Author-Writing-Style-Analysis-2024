Basically they are using ukranian blood to weaken Russia so they don't have to deal with them in their own countries.
To this day Ukraine does everything to the point of shaming countries to gain help and stop countries from supporting Russia.
Europe has been making efforts to get Ukraine on their side against Russia since the end of the cold war.
This ends with the restoration of Ukraine's borders and a demilitarized zone around the border for Russia. So long as Russian military doesn't enter that zone there is no conflict. If they enter it Ukraine would be free to use whatever means it wishes to destroy it as far as the west would be concerned. No need to invade Russia. Just bombard with missiles any military near the border ensuring Russia can never build up forces for another war.
Which is why I'm sure if Ukranian strikes into Russia continue, Russia will start using their civilian population as human shields. They don't care about losses, and the optics in the West are bad for Ukraine if civilians are hit as collateral damage.
It might be expensive to support Ukraine, but it's gonna be even more expensive to the world if Ukraine loses.
Ukraine WAS expendable up to the point NATO started helping: now they are invested so losing is not a viable option.
