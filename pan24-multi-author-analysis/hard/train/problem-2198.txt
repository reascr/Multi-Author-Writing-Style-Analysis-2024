Keep in mind, this happens all day, every day. There are ALWAYS Russian spy ships off US waters. In fact, there are almost always Russian and Chinese spy ships IN US waters.
Spotting spy ships is something the us military does on the regular. They really don't have very good stealth or field craft.
Seizure wouldn't be hard if it did enter our waters, as long as it's Chinese or Russian.capture is just a occupation hazard. north Korea is what worries me.
But a north Korean vessel filled with north Korean soldiers that we already know are incredibly stupid/crazy getting stopped.
My theory is there was an aircraft down or vessel in trouble the Russians were trying to get to, and to avoid an accident the Coast Guard was letting them.
I know you're joking, but I was genuinely asking someone else in Hawai'i which island this supposed Russian boat was puttering in the vicinity of. Not out of concern but curiosity and potential source of laughter at the thought of one of the many cruise ships that putter about between the islands being in sight of the "Russian" boat with a bunch of very confused tourists.
