Also to add weight to that theory, quite a few of the barracks I went to when stationed in Germany had been built in the build up to WWII.
In fact the mechanised German army is somewhat of a myth as well, as a lot of the logistics was done by horse. Add that to the fact basically any footage of the German army not being mowed down would have been created by the nazis, and would thus have been made to make them look good, and you can sort of see how we are still affected by some nazi propaganda when looking at the regime historically even today.
yep a lot of footage that gets used in documentaries is from nazi propaganda, which still propagates some insane myths, theres also the difference of allocation of resources because of corruption as an anectode:
when my ss grandpa kept gloating about how good german technology was and they should have won, my wehrmacht grandpa who served in the east yelled at him that the shiny toys werent in the east and they had 1 anti tank gun towed by themselves with 3 shots and were told to hold off an armor division.
