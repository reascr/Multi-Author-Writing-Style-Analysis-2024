Yes it is because you didn't make an argument. FEE has also written articles in favor of ending qualified immunity. Would it be relevant that they're funded by the Koch's if you used that as an argument in favor of qualified immunity?
I 100% agree with what you said. I'm a big progressive, but I really get irked with the progressive support for the federal student loan program. It was a bad program that for-profit colleges lobbied for. People need to treat colleges as a special interest group. I think that getting rid of federal student loans is by far the best solution.
It has become clear the federal student loan system is dumb and broken. The idea pitched here to have "universities issue loans themselves" is also pretty dumb and will come with its own baggage in the long term, so I dont agree with that, but even propaganda usually has a kernel of truth.
I dont think a person with no interest should be forced to take, and pay, for classes in art and philosophy just to get a job in physical therapy. I know having a basic level of liberal arts education seems like a good idea, but I've lived long enough to realize forcing people to do, and pay, for things they don't want to do never works out. They won't actually learn anything. I do, however, think a physical therapist should absolutely be able to take classes in art and philosophy if they want to and they shouldn't have to take out a loan to do so.
