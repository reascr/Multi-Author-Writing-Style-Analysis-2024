1. Voter outreach is crucial, but not enough on its own. New and additional strategies are required.
If you want an example on the left of what happens when you don't reach out to those who don't agree with you, look at Bernie Sanders' Presidential campaigns. Bernie never expanded his base of support much beyond young upper middle class White liberals because he didn't reach out to establishment Democrats, or temper his campaign message to appeal to moderates, or vary his stump speech to speak to the concerns of a varied electorate. Bernie expected voters to come to him and it doesn't work that way; one of the critiques I remember from his 2016 campaign was that his phone volunteers were more interested in winning arguments with the people they were calling than they were interesting in making more calls and swaying more voters.

Yep. Essentially a bunch of wealthy, geriatric capitalists with a leaning towards social justice but not at the expense of their pocketbook.
