The point isn’t how Californians view themselves. It’s how Americans would view a succeeded state, California being a likely candidate for its GDP and ideal borders.
I mean, if California succeeded from the US in an economic collapse, it’s pretty plausible to believe that Americans would still consider it to be an “American” territory, vassal, or rebellious state. If several states broke apart from the US, there would be a strong following of people who believe the US deserves to reclaim and reunite and that should be a political goal. Now imagine if Russia started arming these breakaway states.
It’s not just that this is some off-beat Putin opinion. Most of the older generations of Russians, especially retired, have a very strong opinion about “the motherland”.
This, and the fact he views all the old Soviet/Tzarist territories as “rightfully” Russia’s. The West stopping him from grabbing Ukraine is seen as a direct attack on Russia because, according to him, Ukraine has no independent culture or history worth respecting. It’s similar to how China views Taiwan. Dude wants to be a new Peter the Great and is mortified at the possibility of failure. His legacy, worldview, AND life are all on the line. I don’t have an ounce sympathy for the bastard.
