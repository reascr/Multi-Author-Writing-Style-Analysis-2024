Which is really funny, because they've accepted monetary aid from Taiwan for other natural disasters before.
It's more likely that Taiwan would give assistance to China without precondition than China to Taiwan.
It's not just political differences on the Taiwanese side, but also China. The Hu Jintao era is now regarded as the most 'open' China has ever been, and probably the best period of cross-strait relations.
Hard as it is to imagine, throughout the 2000s and early 2010s relations between China and Taiwan were pretty good. There would always be the territorial dispute and occasional sabre rattling but for the most part, it was live and let live and trade was growing. In fact, even today, Taiwan’s biggest trade partner is still China, it’s kind of why the issues faced today are quite tragic because things were getting better.
Honestly, Taiwanese people just want to live their lives, and trade with people around the world, including China. It's quite sad that the CCP, due to its ego, continued to ignore the need of Taiwanese.
