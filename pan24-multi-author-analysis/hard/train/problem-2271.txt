What a misleading headline. He won nothing. All this vote shows is that he has a majority of the party backing him, but that's meaningless because that's not how Speaker votes work. If anything, it shows he doesn't have the votes to become Speaker.
This was nothing but an internal party poll. The actual vote is the full House, not just the majority party.
The issue is you only need the highest number of votes to become speaker. So even if some Republicans break and vote for someone else, they have to vote for someone else that nearly the whole Democratic caucus would also vote for.
If you only need a plurality of votes, then IF nine or so MAGA reps voted for somebody else, Nancy Pelosi would get 100% of the Dem vote and be re-elected Speaker. That's not going to happen.
Yeah, of course that's more likely. But your original posit was that the speaker election is a choice between McCarthy and Pelosi -- which is just purely incorrect. So I walked through the other options that could be on the table after McCarthy fails.
188 is a catastrophe. I thought he'd be closer to 200 and I was still skeptical he could get to be speaker.
lol, ok. Pelosi pulling in 15 of the remaining 19 votes of the 2021 Dem caucus is still a lot easier than imagining how McCarthy can get 30 of the remaining 32 Republicans in 2023.
