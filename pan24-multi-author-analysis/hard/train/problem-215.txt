Shit, we can take it even further back. Unions were busted by the government for fun all the way back in the 1870s and early to mid 1900s. Strikes have been put down through violence when all else failed.
Protesting doesn't work in the US. It never has. It never will. And I don't know what else we can do.
The US government doesn't care about us at all. They don't care about our voice, our actions, or what we actually want. All they care about is power and wealth.
Oh it will certainly be a benefit to the mega wealthy. One of the exemptions to the 30% tax is business to business sales. Zero chance that gets abused.
I wish it was a joke, but they're super serious. I highly doubt it has a chance of passing, but that that is the idea they've come up with is scary af. There's even an exemption to the tax for business to business sales. No one will take advantage of that. Right?
Correct. For example, somebody that has retired with a few million in assets is far from being filthy rich.
This kind of stuff makes them untrustworthy because they never defined "super rich." It's not defined as the 1%. It is usually defined as 400k! That is like top 8%.
