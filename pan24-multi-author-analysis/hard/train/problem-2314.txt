You're looking in the wrong place for the problem. These people just just don't have enough money to pay for food, rent and heating.
Tory voters are thinking: "living on benefits is supposed to be hard, to encourage them to work and stop people scrounging, single parents and immigrants".
Britain pulling out of a continent-wide single market and doing other things that raise the cost of living, as well as years of conservative government doesn’t help.
Considering how much strain the NHS is under and thus limited ability to diagnose mental conditions, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a lot of undiagnosed children out there.
Spoken like someone who hasn’t dealt with a picky eater, special dietary needs, or multiple children (y’know, that thing the country as a whole needs if they don’t want to keep relying on immigration?).
It's not even that. It's like asking them to take a nonperishable food from a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of packages of it, that they literally couldn't get through even if they really really tried.
