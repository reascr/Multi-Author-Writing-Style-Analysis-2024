Here's a fun fact the law doesn't address, which is kind of a tell: 30% of first language French-speaking young people in Quebec do not graduate high school.
The reality is you won't go anywhere if you only speak french in Alberta for example, Canada is not really bilingual outside of Québec and New Brunswick.
So why can’t a person just immigrate to, say, any of the many other provinces or territories, them simply move to Quebec if that is, for some odd reason, their preferred location?
Basically, you can only apply for Federal immigration streams if you don't intend to reside in Quebec. If you do end up residing in Quebec, no one is going to stop you, but there are grounds to revoke your PR for misrepresentation. Even if you get citizenship, one ground to revoke citizenship is misrepresentation and fraud.
So while no one is going to stop you from moving across provinces, all it takes is one overzealous immigration officer picking up your file during an audit and making your life hell. Revoking citizenship requires a much higher standard than revoking PR though. So you can always say, I intended to reside in Saskatchewan, but I am a trained battery engineer and I had to move to Quebec for the job at the battery plant.
