And being called on his lies is relatively new to him, so he lacks the self awareness needed to know that he has to lie better now.
Funnily enough, that's one reason why I think might be the most plausible lie he's ever told. Him just existing in Congress at the moment is a distraction to how utterly shitty she is. So her telling him that is something I could actually buy. The test is whether the lies from the Congressman claiming to be George Santos become more realistic or even more absurd from here.
Santos is probably lying bc that's what he does but doing stupid shit to endear herself to republicans is kind of simena's thing so who knows.
I would agree with this if Santos were just lying about the "right" things. But the fact that he lies about everything makes him more of a liability than an asset to them. Most speculate that the only reason McCarthy hasn't booted him yet is because of the GOP's slim majority and McCarthy feels it's more important to have a GOP member who's a liar but will still vote with him vs. having him replaced by what most likely would be a Democrat who would vote against him. If the "Red Wave" hit, I doubt he'd have even been seated.
The problem is that I think he sincerely believes he did nothing wrong and therefore there's no reason to change.
The man has on two separate occasions been evicted for non payment of rent to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. And those were recent. He dresses as if he stopped at Savers on his way to the HoR. He refuses to explain where even a penny of the money he loaned his campaign came from. He's been shown to be scamming people for relatively trivial amounts of cash. Given his overall history, I'm more willing to believe that the only thing he actually has to his name is whatever pay he's received from being a congressman for the past month.
