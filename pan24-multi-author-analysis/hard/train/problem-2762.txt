There's "forgive and forget" and there's "this is a demonstrated weakness in our economy that Russia will attempt to use as leverage again if given the chance".
Russia wasn't America's problem to solve, only Russians can do that, but we needn't have callously made it worse.
I'm afraid there won't be any reparations from Russia, their buddies from western Europe won't allow it. Ukraine will be left in ruins for decades, which will be considered as a win for Russia. Sure their economy got a big hit from sanctions, but as long as their neighbour suffered even more, it was worth it. That's just russian mentality.
Sorry, but that's naive way of thinking. Putin is not a cause, he's a symptom. He attacked Ukraine, because that's what common Russians expect (not all ofc). For Russia to act like an empire. It always has been this way, Russia never leaves its neighbours in peace, no matter who rules in Kremlin.
Oh yeah, I remember, Europe was really peaceful over the course of Stalin's rule. Its not like there was some huge conflict.
