It will probably mutate and adapt to spread among mammals, and it probably will happen in some other animal first.
I think it is because it's a diverse collection of mammals infected from this particular strain. It hasn't been confirmed, but it's looking likely that it is the case. Sea lion, seals, bears, mink, foxes, dogs, cats, and more. That is a divergence from previous outbreaks of H5N1.
53% with the current H5N1. But they’ve been mutating it since as early as 2012.. Pretty sure the one that’s unleashed on the human population will have a higher case fatality rate.
Mortality rates usually look a lot worse when you’re looking at mostly sporadic cases spread out over time than they do in an epidemic/pandemic. When there’s only a handful of cases over time, people who have mild cases don’t seek medical attention or get a diagnosis, they just assume they have a cold and rest as much as they can. The only cases that are being recorded are the ones that were so bad that the sick person went to a hospital or sought out some kind of medical care where they were actively tested for a specific illness.
