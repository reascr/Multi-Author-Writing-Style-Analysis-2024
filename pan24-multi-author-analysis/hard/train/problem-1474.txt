There's a significant subsidy for the electrical upgrades in the Inflation Reduction Act, which should lower the cost of switching.
Yes. You get pretty much instant heat from the induction stoves too, and temperature control is reproducible across different pots and pans in a way that's a lot tougher with gas stoves.
- If you have gas now and want to get rid of it, you must replace with induction if you want a comparable cooking experience.
Cooking on gas is a lot better than cooking on electric there is an actual difference. While induction is nice it's actually pretty loud and it doesn't work on every piece of cooking equipment you have.
I don't think I've seen the spatter thing; you notice it more with a countertop unit I think simply because you end up using it places without a backsplash that a proper stove has.
The cooling fan in the countertop units is noticeable, (and full-size stoves vary a lot on that score) but I don't think it's a big deal when compared with the huge amount of noise that an effective vent hood makes.
