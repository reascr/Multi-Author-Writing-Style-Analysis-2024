I never understood how these election deniers thought they had a winning argument. Let's think about this logic for a moment.... Joe Biden won Arizona in 2020 because more people voted for him. The Republicans threw a hissy fit, lied about fraud, and tried to invalidate votes/overthrow the government. So.... Kari Lake thought ANY of those voters were going to forget that and vote for her? If I lived in Arizona and had voted for Biden, how could I possibly accept a governor who won't accept my vote?
You're absolutely right. The thing is.... Biden voters (made up of democrats, republicans, and independents) didn't take kindly to the Republican party attempting to negate their vote, thus motivating them to get out and vote in the midterms (where turnouts are typically lower).
Contrast that with a hypothetical where a "sane" Republican who respects election results runs third party and who garners that hypothetical "at least 1%" of the vote.
In a race like the one that just went down in Arizona for the Governor's seat, where the margins are less than a single percent -- yes, I think someone who appeals to 1-in-4 Republicans likely had an impact. It should be noted that the ad was a BANGER, too. Imagine yourself as a traditionally Republican-leaning voter in Arizona, but you have feelings of deep unease about Donald Trump and his election denial (yes, there are a minority of Republicans who feel this way) .... and you see this on TV:
