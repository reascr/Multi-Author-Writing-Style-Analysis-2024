Gillibrand was more interested in removing an obstacle to her Presidential run than about justice for women.
If this is important, then finish the investigation. I note that Gillibrand hasn't spearheaded that.
Also, Gillibrand didn't have anything to do with the drip, drip, drip of more women coming out about Franken. He probably would have survived that first one.
By who? I'm tired of men giving men non-stop cover for their behavior while treating women who point out their questionable behavior worse. It isn't any woman's fault when men treat women as property so stop it, it's a bad look.
I remember this play, $12 dollar fed minimum wage is too little, must be $15. Did $12 or $15 happen? Nope. Instead we got higher maternal mortality rates because Roe was overturned.
Aww, yes but of course after men go after a woman for speaking truth by calling her a "traitor" and "opportunistic" and sending massive amounts of threats her way they wonder why she's reluctant to do it again.
No way in hell would that happen. That's what makes a man "smart". And again you nor anyone knows she did this to boost her bid for president. Maybe it was due to her own experience of being sexually harassed by her male colleagues in the senate. One of those women was a congressional staffer.
