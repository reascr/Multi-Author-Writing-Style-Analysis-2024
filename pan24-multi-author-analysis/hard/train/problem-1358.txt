I think the idea is that you're forcing the store to pass along the savings to customers that don't use a manned checkout. But it's just a phenomenally dumb idea.
Yeah this is a pretty bad idea IMO. The number of jobs lost to self checkouts is not that big, and frankly being a cashier is a shit job anyways.
I really don't want to have to make small talk to the person spending 1 minute per item stacking shit carefully into bags despite me saying "just throw it all in one, I'm not going far". I don't like it.
I don't like this. The problem of stores not treating or paying employees well isn't caused by self-checkouts or automation. Removing automation and self-checkouts won't make stores treat employees better or pay them more. Automation and other innovations that create a need for less labor should help everybody, but in practice those things often benefit the corporations to the detriment of workers. That's the fault of the system, and it's the very foundations of that economic system that need to change.
It's in the same category as automation in that it streamlines the business to require less labor. A whole lot of customers are just fine with self checkout, and many actually prefer it. From that point of view, it's hardly a burden.
Stores should always have assisted/traditional cashier checkout available, and I'd be okay with laws requiring that they do. Not just because people like you don't want to check themselves out, but because people with disabilities and people with different needs are much better served by them. Elsewhere in this thread, I'm arguing in favor of the usefulness of self-checkout lines. The flip side to this, though, is that I'd be completely against a store having that as the only option.
