Edit: that's where my expertise ends though. I have no idea how to make it more efficient. Raising cattle in the plains is obviously easier than raising them in the jungle. Which brings up another more macro level question. Why are they trying to raise cattle in the jungle?? I mean I know why ($$$) but it just seems like an interesting commodity to specialize in in the rainforest.
I did a project on this for my university and Brazilian cattle ranches are also just plain inefficient. I believe it takes four more times the land to raise a cow/bull in Brazil than it does in the most inefficient areas of the US. That's why so much land is needed for these ranches. It's a compounding issue but still part of the equation. Finding a way to increase the efficiency and productivity of ranches in Brazil may also help significantly by reducing the land needed to produce X amount of beef.
Imports of Brazilian meat are the biggest driver in new deforestation, as we (Brazil) already have enough cattle and farmland to feed our entire population. Exported Brazilian beef reached sales of almost 10 billion USD in 2021.
3. There's only a beef-eating culture in Brazil because the Portuguese invaders (among others) brought such culture to the territory, in their process of extracting all the mineral wealth (silver, gold) from the territory to send it back to Europe. Had they never invaded and conquered, the rain forest would be just fine today.
I agree in a more general sense, since beef is an extremely trophic-level inefficient source of sustenance. So much water and space used to raise food with nutrients you could effectively get from food that's more efficient with the world's resources and total space, and also to grow/raise.
