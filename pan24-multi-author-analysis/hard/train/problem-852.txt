It takes 5-10 to approve a nuclear reactor construction before and building is completed. It should not take this long considering how safe the newer designs are. So much energy can be produced that nuclear power is than any other power source in the long run. If you want to go the environmental protection route, solar produces more chemicals and lithium batteries needed for renewables also gave great environmental . Realistically, we need nuclear and renewables to work together for our energy needs.
In any event, nuclear is an opportunity cost; it actively harms decarbonization given the same investment in wind or solar would offset more CO2 and also not destroy more parts of nature to mine the finitie resources. Yes, FINITE, yet you people want to invest hundreds of billions into an infrastrucutre that will be completely worthless once the fuel source is gone.
Also does not help that the necessary mining for the finite resources required for nuclear energy turns more of nature into dead craters. But yeah, keep trying to greenwash nuclear power.
Nuclear energy is the biggest theft from taxpayers ever. They pay for all the costs so that somebody else gets to keep profits.
