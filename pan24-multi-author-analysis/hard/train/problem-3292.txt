The article only mentions the military in reference to driving ambulances and performing other critical jobs in absence of workers because of the strikes. NOT forcing people to work at gunpoint.
Oh I agree completely that the politicians are being asshats(always are). I made my comment when a bunch of redditors were saying the govt were using the military to force people to work.
I am aware that the government has used the military to step in and fill the roles of striking workers in the past.
Shutting down strikes seems to be an unsettling trend right now... Canada, US, UK, possibly Korea... the government should be protecting the workers because there is no one else that will.
If you think having the military step in to minimize the effect of a strike, therefore undercutting the collective bargaining power of the worker has nothing to do with breaking the strikes… I’ve got news for you.
In case any fucking idiots are reading this and thinking about angrily downvoting - he's talking about using the military to replace emergency services while they strike, not strike-busting at the end of a gun.
If you read the article then you’d know that he means he’s using the military to replace ambulance drivers while they’re on strike to keep the infrastructure running. It has absolutely nothing to do with breaking up the strikes.
