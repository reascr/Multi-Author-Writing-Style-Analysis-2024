To be fair this could work in Ukraine's favour. China really doesn't like the idea of legitimizing territorial separatism as much as they want to support Russia.
China doesn't want to establish the idea that a country can just take land from another or support separatist movements. Taiwan doesn't violate that worldview because it's an unresolved civil war and both sides, at least officially, claim to be the same country under different governments. China's deal is probably Russia keeps Crimea, Russia otherwise fucks off and Ukraine can join or not join any international organizations as it seems fit with Chinese economic support for both sides of they agree.
If nothing else it helps make Russia dependent on China, so when the dust settles in Ukraine they have a big thumb on what happens with whoever is left running things in Moscow.
That’s where I see the two stories lining up - when western countries say that China’s plan isn’t acceptable - China says it’s the reason they need to support Russia.
I wonder whether this is an attempt to play off the west as hostile towards Russia, and a reason for China to get involved.
Maybe it’s a coincidence that the stories of China potentially supplying military aid to Russia and this story are circulating at the same time.
