It might be true that Gibson forgot his gun and they left the footage in, but he was running in the trenches and to command. Mark Lee was the one in the battle charge who was unarmed, and I'm certain that was filmed as intended. That last scene was very deliberate and wouldnt have made sense if he had a rifle.
The only way to keep these units attacking is by shooting them if they don't. And now that they've run out of convicts- is Putin willing to start shooting Mobiks?
They(Putin and Co.) probably just wanted to quickly get rid of the people who have a very legitimate reason to turn around and shoot at the very government that put them in jail in the first place. To them, those penal soldiers are the last people they want to train "properly", for fear of them using that training against the Russian government, instead of the enemy(in this case: Ukraine).
Also you have to remember, generally if soldiers become veterans in Russia there is a fear they might take against those in charge, so the system is set up to try and stop them getting that far.
Russian's tactics throughout history have pretty much always involved some level of out numbering the enemy and out lasting them. No one high up probably wants to try anything much different. It's not the kind of place that rewards new ideas or trying things different.
The Kremlin sees Stalin as a tactic genius and defender of Russia. To everyone else it seems stupid but the only problem from Russia's point of view is if the people back home get sick of it.
