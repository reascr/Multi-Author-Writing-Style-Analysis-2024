All eyes are on China now, and there are serious cracks showing, even with their insane rise in power. Hopefully the trend continue with them about to enter stagnation territory as they have pissed off everyone with their wolf warrior diplomacy plus the structural faults in the construction sector and population problems and also other areas.
The main problem becomes the big tent approach of both parties. Since there is only really two parties (the others are to small) they are rewarded for trying to fit as many people as possible within their camp/tent. People who in another system would rather make their own party and try to win influence that way.
Because people in position of power are always the people who want that power the most. You will never find a wise buddhist leader of a country because they dont want to BE a leader of a country, they are already happy meditating on top of a mountain. The people who want power however, are easily corrupted by it and want to retain it as long as possible.
