A classic thing you'll see in articles like this is the conflating of gun DEATH rates and gun HOMICIDE rates. These two metrics measure very different phenomena and should not be used interchangeably unless you are being intentionally deceptive to push an agenda.
The article claims that North Carolina has a bigger gun problem than Illinois and uses the metric of "age-adjusted gun death rate". Of course the average reader is going to use that to say that there are more murders by firearm in North Carolina than Illinois, when in fact that is not the case when you look at the total number of firearm homicides in each state and compare that to their populations. North Carolina has a lot more suicides by gun than Illinois does, but doesn't have more homicides.
Chicago isn't even in the top 20 cities for violence. Per capita gun violence is much higher in red states than blue cities (which are mostly higher population than entire red states).
It matters because something like 60% of firearms related homicide is found in 2% of counties If I recall that correctly. That's a high concentration of violence in typically economically struggling urban areas with gangs being prevalent. That violence being produced by gang members fighting over drugs, territory, whatever. If you don't belong to a gang , don't deal in drugs, and or don't live in one of those counties then your chance of being caught in their fighting in drops significantly.
