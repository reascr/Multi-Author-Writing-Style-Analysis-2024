lol you're so amusing. Especially the pretend smart guy trying to be condescending routine. Your arguments still don't hold water though. Especially in the cases of joining a hostile military or treason the State Department can enter a finding that the act was done with the intent of losing citizenship whether the respondent agrees or not, and the respondent then has to rebut it in court.
Joining a foreign military from a country hostile to the US is/can be a voluntary action, therefore your US citizenship can be revoked by the government by order of the constitution.
“You might lose your U.S. citizenship in specific cases, including if you: Run for public office in a foreign country (under certain conditions) Enter military service in a foreign country (under certain conditions) Apply for citizenship in a foreign country with the intention of giving up U.S. citizenship.”.
A person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by voluntarily performing any of the following acts with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality.
Such employment, however, will result in one's expatriation only if done voluntarily with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.
