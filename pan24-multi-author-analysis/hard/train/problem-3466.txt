Part of the answer might be that the US is keen to offer to replace European made tanks that are sent to Ukraine. This is likely to result in long term export deals sending US tanks to Europe. However, this plan relies on European nations giving away their European made tanks to Ukraine so that the US can replace them with US made tanks in the hope that it will lead to long term export agreements.
Of course, cheap American tanks right now are more appealing replacements than full price German tanks later in the future, so countries might not be willing to make such agreements for replacements, so Germany keeps holding out on allowing exports to Ukraine.
If the US sends it's tanks directly to Ukraine, it will be less able to replace European tanks and European countries will be less inclined to send so many of their own tanks to Ukraine because they will not be as needed and US replacements will be less available. In this case, Europe keeps it's European tank manufacturing and does not become dependent on US export tanks, which is bad for the US.
However, it's hard for Germany to do that when the US is offering cheap, or even free replacement tanks, which night mean a permanent end for the German tank export industry. Once you have American tanks, it's hard to switch back and once Germany no longer exports tanks, it's hard to start doing that again. The logistics problems of tanks go far beyond the battlefield.
Oh, right if we give them tanks to fight with, then it's no problem. But if we fix them, a definite red line has been crossed How could I have missed this.
Now, yeah, it's easier to maintain for the end crew cause anything goes wrong, they pull the engine out and replace it, send the old engine back to depo to get fixed. All it takes for that to run smoothly is money, not time. They are lying.
