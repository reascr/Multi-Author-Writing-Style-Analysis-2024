Also, "They will just wait for the next opportunity to weaponize a tragedy." That's pretty rich coming from this point of view. Your opinion is certainly from a neutral viewpoint eh?
They're so insecure of the flaws in their own party that now the shooter is no longer one of us. AKA straight white conservative males, toting semiautomatic guns despite many of them having previous arrests and sketchy histories.
It's now one of THEM nonbinary people... toting semiautomatic guns despite having previous arrests and sketchy histories.
Weaponized? How about a maniac who had no business carrying a semiautomatic rifle using it to senselessly murder 5 people.
I'm not sure if you understand. The right wing in America is, for some reason, gloating at this shooter being non-binary. Somehow they 'win' if they can cast this asa non discriminatory killing or even better a shooting by a member of the LGBTQ+ community.
I do not think its the lawyer but the shooter this is a another way to rub salt in the wound of the LGBTQ community. Lets see if anyone steps forward and gives credence to the claims. He was willing to kill everyone in that club he is more than capable of lying and trying to hurt the community even more.
