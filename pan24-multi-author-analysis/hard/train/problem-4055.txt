I would recommend the whole article, which goes on to describe and analyze the unique challenge faced by being a politician, which is a 'front stage job' who suffers from depression, which is a 'back stage' illness. The Atlantic has a metered paywall; if this synopsis interests you, I'd recommend using one of your monthly clicks.
I suffer from a mental illness, and not one of the more 'media friendly' mental health diagnoses such as depression or anxiety. I'm well treated for it (schizoaffective disorder), as you can hopefully tell from my relative coherence. I'm posting this article partially because of an interaction I had the other day in this subreddit, wherein a commenter joked that C-SPAN callers were undiagnosed schizophrenics, and I was downvoted for asking them not to make a punchline out of the illness. I'm sharing this article and this story to hopefully help humanize those with even the less savory mental health issues, and maybe give someone pause before the next time they joke about "schizos", call Fetterman a 'vegetable', rush to attribute violence to mental health issues, or in some other way do their part to ensure that those with serious mental health issues and/or disabilities do not take part in public life.
A great book about this, for those looking to learn more, is "Lincoln's Melancholy". It makes a persuasive case that Lincoln wasn't a great man despite his depression (then understood as 'melancholy') but because of it.
Abraham Lincoln had depression. This is well known, so I'm always confused when people make such a big deal out of politicians being mentally ill. Literally our greatest one was mentally ill.
