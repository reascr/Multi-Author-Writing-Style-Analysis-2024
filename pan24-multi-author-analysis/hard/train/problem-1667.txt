Bro how will nationwide riots scare conservatives into reform? Half of them, and 90% of the cops, want to go out there and beat/shoot ppl. That’s what the whole Rittenhouse saga was about. We do need reform, serious, serious reform. But it’s going to take more than marching in the street, and I think the conservatives want there to be riots.
They want there to be “riots” (peaceful protests they can disrupt and attack) - they don’t want actual riots. If there were actual riots across the country the average white conservative would be terrified. That riot would likely never reach their small, rural communities, but attack the politicians at their homes with threats of violence and see how fast things change. With true riots if Rittenhouse were to show up with his gun he’d be shot rather than able to shoot unarmed protestors.
He showed up to protests across state lines, brought a gun with him, and made it clear he was there to kill people. He was “defending” himself in the same way that I would defend myself if willingly I jumped into a pit of lions.
He brought a gun to protests. He 100% wanted to hurt people. You don’t Cross state lines with a gun and show up to anti-police protests intending to just watch. I can guarantee that to him “playing vigilante” included killing liberals. That was his goal. And saying he was “attacked” is misleading as even his side of the story leaves it a little muddy as to why he was attacked. If I saw someone step into my school with a gun you’d be damn right I’d attack them. If they shot me would it be categorized as self defense?
He went across state lines with a gun. He brought that gun to “defend” a complete stranger’s business. That makes no sense and is a garbage defense. He placed himself in a dangerous situation clearly with the hopes that he would get to shoot someone. If he didn’t want that, he wouldn’t have come. It’s literally that simple.
