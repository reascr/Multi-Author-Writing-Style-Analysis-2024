This isn’t about Jewish voters, it’s about messaging to Evangelical zionists. American Jews vote Democratic pretty overwhelmingly, and aren’t that big a demographic. Any time Republicans appear to be speaking to or about American Jews, they’re really just messaging to Christians about Israel or attempting to their own party’s antisemitism problem.
Because when they act like they're pandering to the Jews they're really pandering to Evangelicals who believe Jews need to control Israel before Jesus can come back.
Also, many anti-semites actually support a nation of israel, that way they can have a reason to try and pressure Jews in their country to move somewhere else.
I guess it doesn't help that instead of supporting the Zionist left, the left in the world seems to go further and further into antizionism - rejecting Israel's right to exist at all. Hard to convince Israelis there's a chance for peace when your entire existance and right to live is questioned and not your policies. And I know that because I am one of the few who still vote left.
As an Israeli Jew, unfrotunately you are wrong. This doesn't hold if you look only at American Jews- but globally speaking, and even moreso in Israel, the younger you look the more right wingers you'll see. In fact, iirc, Israeli youth leans furthest to the right in the OECD, after hungary.
