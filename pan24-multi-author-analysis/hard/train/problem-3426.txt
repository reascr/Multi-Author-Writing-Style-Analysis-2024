what has been a learning moment for me is grasping the one good thing (possibly the only) about career politicians; on the rare occasion they try to do something good, they know how to get it done. this country was in such a post-watergate morass of various kinds of angst since trump, i think only a real slick politician with a ton of varied connections (unlike say, jimmy carter) could pull the country back to a semblance of normalcy. i don't like joe biden much but I think he knows how to work the system better than any president since LBJ.
The question was about how Biden had anything to do with stomping Republicans last week. Working with Pelosi is one of the ways.
I was referring to Pelosi, who would have been fine with getting infrastructure done with Republicans in power.
That's what he had to do with it. Joe's presidency so far has been about being the opposite of Trump. How? By demonstrating that democracy works by governing well (passing major legislation twice) and by cooperating, especially with capable women.
