A protest is a dialogue of the people, by the people, and for the people. For example, if you're upset at where things are headed- step outside alongside your friends, neighbors, and compatriots, bang on some pans, yell out some slogans, get some anger out, and maybe organize some next steps.
Protests can be effective as a tool of change. There are other tools in the toolbox, mind you, and the state is aware of that. Why else do you think they (the state) would attempt to quell protests using violence if there were no point to them?
The thing, the protesters having weapons probably wouldn't make this that much better since the government would just have better weapons. And those weapons do nothing without some sort of legal foundation for the protesters to grab onto.
Source: Have handled the equipment and had to shoot rubber bullets at violent protesters. If you’re interested in more info:
Fired using an ordinary rifle eg M-16 using similar propulsion to what normally sends a bullet through a human that is 2x-4x farther than the close distance that “Rubber Bullets” are normally fired at.
“Rubber Bullets” is the term for a packet of 3 metal balls / cylinders the size of a medium-large marble covered in a thin layer of hard rubber.
