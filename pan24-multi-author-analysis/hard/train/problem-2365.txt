Honestly, everything you wrote is a mess. If universal healthcare is a basic right, then literally the ONLY way to judge how progressive someone is on healthcare is by splitting hairs on how it’s administered.
Americans need to learn that A) Canada’s healthcare system is very different depending what part of Canada you are in and B) actually the perfect system for the US and what the Dems should be pushing rather than a national program.
The problem is that when you’re talking about the Canadian system, there is a huge difference between federal and provincially-run healthcare. The whole country is only about as populous as California, and the biggest province (Ontario) is only slightly larger than PA. Because scale is so important in healthcare provision and insurance, and because most of the big provinces are run by conservative governments, the provincial systems have been allowed to get much worse than they would be under federal control. Trudeau is also kind of gutless when it comes to pushing back on mismanagement in the provinces, especially Quebec.
