I had long covid 1 and a half years after being hospitalised, then it went away but when i get too stressed it comes back a little only for a few hours but it is still there, sore chest muscles headache lack of energy . I am hoping once i have got a little exercise when i have good days which are way more often than bad days now i will be able to strenhen my system to eventually not suffer the odd day here and there, it sucks.
Just suffered two weeks of flu and i have not had flu before corvid more than once in 10 or so years so yes maybe my system is fucked up a bit but it is most definitely way better than what it was and is getting better all the time.
The press is fucked there are no headlines about the wait times being beyond acceptable or the fact that hospitals are struggling to have even one doctor in a&E.
What the article said was "Covid and hospital and ambulance delays all blamed", blamed, there is no evidence that this is true and the newspaper you are quoting is the "WalesOnline".
