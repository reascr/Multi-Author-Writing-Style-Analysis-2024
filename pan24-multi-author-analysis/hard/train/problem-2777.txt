It doesn’t matter if it’s legal. The Canadian constitution has what’s called the ‘notwithstanding clause’ which basically lets provinces temporarily ignore parts of the constitution. For example, Quebec has already used it to ban government officials from wearing turbans, hijabs, or other religious wear.
Telling individuals that they can't wear religious symbols is NOT religious freedom. You just swapped out Christianity for Atheism.
I agree with you to some extent when it comes to the burka - rather than a religious symbol it could be understood as a symbol of oppression of women.
I definitely agree with you about the burka, but the wearer will turn around and say she is a feminist and wears it by choice because she feels liberated (face-palm, head-shake).
These things constitute wearing a visible religious symbol and thereby put into question the neutrality of the state. Quebecers, especially women, fought to no longer live in a theocracy in the quiet revolution. Those who wish to proselytize, or who feel their religious belief system should permeate other aspects of civil life such as education or dispute settlement, should consider immigrating elsewhere.
A Jewish man who left the Orthodox Jewish community recently sued the Québec government, as he had only received a religious education by essentially memorising the Torah. He argued that the role of the state was to ensure each child get a general secular education.
