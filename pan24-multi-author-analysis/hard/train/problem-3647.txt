Now idk if they were going full banzai charges or if its massed seaborne drone attack as I have not personally read the paper but from the looks of Russian Baltic formation of ships.
This actually sounds like a US advise as the US has ran multiple simulations of Torpedo/munition swarm attack effective against modern Surface fleet Navies.
The US armed forces after running a naval warfare simulation and finding out the US fleet can be sunk by a fleet of a swarm of Iranian Ship drones.
Donâ€™t US warships have those automated mini guns that blow anything that gets close out of the sky? Do the Russian ships not have the equivalent or are drones too small to trigger those turrets?
I suppose the advantage over a missile is loiter capability. Although, why not just have a drone that carries a missile?
Well both sides are already using drones to drop grenades on each-other, I guess this is the next step. It's scary how efficient we are becoming at killing each other, and the young and poor will end up paying for it.
