The important part of the sentence is actually tradition. You can count on two hands the number of smaller countries bigger countries have invaded and ransacked in the last two decades.. this used to be far more common.
I could, but this is reddit and I ain't writing a thesis. So I'll just note that 65 countries have declared independence from Britain alone. Britain was not alone in running around the globe conquering everything it could, it was just the most successful. China and Russia have so much internal strife because they're both several former countries stitched together by military and economic might, and of course the USSR used to have several more countries under its thumb.
Nah, at this point far too many of them are convinced that the only reason NATO isn't invading mainland Russia is because it's too busy fighting Russia in Ukraine, and that the moment they pull out you'll have Poland invading Kaliningrad, Finland attacking St. Petersburg and Turkey teaming up with Georgia to attack across the caucasus mountains.
The thing in favor of all of these events is the growing tension in Iran, the newly redefined national identity of Ukraine (notice how we have all committed now to calling it Ukraine not “the” Ukraine), and the overall commitment of Eastern Europe to hand Russia a pretty big fucking L after centuries of being a fucking problem for everyone there.
I agree with you in principle, but American politics is fought along these grounds. And as long as Putin is in power, in danger of causing serious issues for the government.
If enough ordinary people stop obeying, Putin has no power. Power is just a function of how many people follow. The richest most powerful person in the world, if left alone in the middle of the woods with all their money, is still just an ape in fancy clothes with a bunch of paper.
