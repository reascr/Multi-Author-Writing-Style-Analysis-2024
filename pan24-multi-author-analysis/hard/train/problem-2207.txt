Remember This shooting attack was a direct or indirect result of Israeli army killing 9 Palestinians with months what Israeli government doing is just making terrorists its an endless loop if you really think arresting innocent people would decrease the number of terrorists think again.
You just said Israel doesn't target civilians by explaining how Israel targets innocent civilians because they are related to someone who committed an act of terror?
Lol, you literally said that Israel targets innocent civilians who all they do is just be relatives of someone who did terrorist attacks that's the most radical thing I had ever heard.
But I'm referring to a specific set of terrorist incidents in which many civilians were murdered that pushed Israel to make checkpoints and build a barrier wall around some of the west bank.
I'm Canadian too, and this is a crazy complicated conflict with a lot of factors and history. And yeah, some shitty people on both sides that can make everyone else look shitty.
Not to mention that the surrounding Arabs (including some Palestinians) have been trying to destroy Israel since immediately after it came into existence, so I think my timeline holds up.
