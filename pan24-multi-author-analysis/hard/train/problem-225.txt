middle aged, white male, gay, always vote D and am so grateful, and proud of gen z’s who voted Dem to save our Democracy in the midterms Please keep showing up!
As a lifelong independent, I just want thank the young voters, I wish I could currently say both sides are same, that they have their pros and cons but lately it's just not the case.
It’s a very strange line of thought to think a 16 year is any less competent at making a decision on who they’d like to vote for, especially when compared to the average voter.
The young people that voted this month don't have that apathy, and I'm not sure that the Republican propaganda engine that's so effective on old people can even reach, let alone sway, these young voters.
Even more reason to allow them to vote, if they’re willing to challenge their parents, they’ll do this regardless of whether they’re allowed to vote, difference being if they can vote they’re able to actively contribute to change.
So the ability to change political alignment is a bad thing, and should be considered on whether you allow someone to vote? I’d say the opposite.
