Most people either don't know or don't care about Elon's antics. This is a case of living in the reddit echo chamber. Need evidence? Tesla still can't manufacture cars fast enough to meet demand. Try ordering just about any model and you'll be on a 6-9 month waiting list.
If you go to order a Model Y right now, you’ll get an estimate of 3 months before you can take delivery. That isn’t terrible, but it’s quite a wait. They always have a backlog. Tesla’s problem has always been regarding supply, not demand.
You can find videos from 2012 and 2013 wherein pundits predicted that Tesla would go bankrupt soon because legacy automakers would all make this seamless transition to electric. They take was very common. It’s also aged like milk.
We’ve been hearing that since 2012. No other automaker still comes close at that price point. More importantly, how exactly do you plan on taking your Bolt on a longer road trip? Cross country? National park visit, perhaps? The charging infrastructure for anything not a Tesla is abysmal. Even if you can find one, ChargePoint and EA chargers will need hours to get you 10%-90%. Moreover, they won’t get better any time soon.
