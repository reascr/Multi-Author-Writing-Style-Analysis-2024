Because 18 years ago things were looking up in Hungary + cheap engineers for German car manufacturing. Orban used to pretend to be better and maybe he was.
Orban didnt need to rig the election itself. He won fair and square, but due to gerrymandering he got supermajority.
Because Poland is on the verge of being sanctioned as well. They need each other to protect each other. And aside for their russian stance opposing, polish government loves the hungarian government and are trying to replicate whatever Orban has been doing for 12 years.
Because pro-EU Hungarians succeeded, and then the anti-EU Hungarians are both shitheads and are in power.
Just so you guys know, we have had really strong anti-EU propaganda for at least decade now in hungary despite the money pouring in. Currently there are giant fliers all around tge country with bombs on them that have "EU sanctions" written on them, saying "Brussels bombed europe's economy".
You literally can't open youtube wihout hearing a propaganda message on how the sanctions don't work because the war is still going on and that the EU is killing us with them.".
This is a huge point of internal conflict in hugary it is common for political parties in election time to use catchphrases like "EU labor, EU wages.".
