What so they can claim we are invading for oil? Let them be and let them fight for their democracy. It’s gonna be Afghan 2.0 if we get involved anyways.
You have to fight for what you believe. Maybe we can’t deter the US military with our rifles and “cosplay” but it is much better than dying without a fight.
How does Biden justify a ban on assault weapons when this shit can happen Willy Nilly. I’ve never been remotely with the GOP but the concept that I can at least own a rifle and die by it is much better than the idea that some regime can shoot me and my wife cause we want our rights.
I’m not a gun toting bible thumper or anything, but I have to admit that with 1.2 guns for every man, woman and child ‘government crackdowns’ like this aren’t even possible in America….
I’m not sure where to start, I don’t think that any of the ‘crackdowns’ in the US compare to what’s taking place in Iran right now. I don’t understand the point of the link you sent, but I would like to know what you were trying to convey if you care to elaborate?
