The main thing that Twitter has going for it is that it is the social media platform of choice for public figures (celebrities, politicians, etc). Once they lose that, they're basically irrelevant. And if they fail due to financial issues before that, those public figures will find somewhere else.
Not saying it isn't \wrong\, and Bernie is calling for new laws regardless. It's just not what existing antitrust laws were intended to deal with.
The only exception would be in purely terms of antitrust issues. But there is no single organization that controls that much of "the media".
Yeah, that's a neutral law in a time period in which a "market" was a broadcasting area. There's an obvious problem if one company controls all the local airways.
Like, I'm just not clear what Sanders thinks the government should actually do about the problems of twitter.
Sure, but Bernie seems to be implying that the government should do something about twitter. That would be a violation of Musk's free speech if it did.
But if he's saying that Elon Musk shouldn't be able to own twitter, then that can become problematic. I'm not sure I even understand how Elon is part of the discussion in terms of anti-trust stuff. He doesn't own multiple media companies, and there's no way to "break up" twitter, since it is one website.
