The Iranian protesters are armed especially in areas where there's a large population of Kurds, there's videos of guns battles happening between the protesters and goverment forces. Guns are flowing from Kurdish factions outside of Iran, I'd also wager other Middle Eastern powers will supply arms to the protesters. Russias armed forces is way too busy in Ukraine and their State police forces are way too busy suppressing their own people to really effectively help Iran out.
Of course Russia does have a lot of armored police vehicles and other equipment meant to squash protests. But it remains to be seen if they can actually spare any forces to send there. Kazakhstan is a different case, being a part of the CSTO and they helped them when they weren't waist deep in a massive war yet.
Aren't there any weapons being smuggled from Iraq's Kurds to the Kurdish people of Iran in the regions where there are a lot of them?
I hope for the best for the people of Iran! I know some people from the Iranian diaspora in my country and they are very worried and extremely angry to say the least.
I would think there are some weapons flowing through considering the amount of Heroin and other contraband that also makes it through the border.
