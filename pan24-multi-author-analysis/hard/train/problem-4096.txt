That’s why it calls for “peace talk”, to prevent further dilemma. However, Xi has filled his “cabinet” full of his men, and I am not sure if they have the wisdom to handle this.
Probably because he can’t stand the world’s 1st/2nd famous dictator (counting himself) fail either .
I agree. Personally, I think Xi’s government is having difficulty dealing with the situation. On one hand, it wants to unite with Russia to challenge the US-led world order (since Xi has been in charge at 2013); but on the other hand, if China publicly stands with Russia, then it has no position arguing Taiwan belongs to China.
By that I mean they cant argue Taiwan belongs to China using the reason of “respect sovereignty, territorial integrity foundation”.
bro what, how does standing with russia leave China without an argument that Taiwan belongs to China. Who are they arguing to ? Nobody is going to change their minds if Taiwan is chinese based on how they treat Ukraine, not to mention the whole point China/Russia creating a new world stage is to not care what anyone thinks of their own stratetic moves.
I can only see one move that would fix the current situation for Ukraine in regards to China Russian cooperation.
