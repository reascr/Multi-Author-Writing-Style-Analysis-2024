It's not just Italy. Plenty of times I've gone to see bands in clubs that are in shittier parts of cities in the US and the "parking jockeys" are there with the "I'll watch your car for you" shtick too.
If they actually were still there I'd give them something, but the majority of the time it was just someone looking to get drug money and they would have gotten enough from others so left before I got back and the car would be fine.
I've apparently developed such an effective "fuck off" face that when I was in Rome a few years back even the roma beggars averted my gaze & left me alone.
The method I've always used is, "Cool, if you're still here watching it when I get back I'll hook you up.".
That’s been a thing for a while. One of them assaulted my mom in the early 2000s because they didn’t feel she gave them enough money. The Italian police were very nice though.
That’s how Italy works. We went to a bad part of town for a soccer game. The kids would walk around and ask for money to “guard our car” and guess what.
