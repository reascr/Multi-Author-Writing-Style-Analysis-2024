The UN exists solely as a formal mechanism, that all members have agreed upon, which facilitates the collective efforts of its members to engage with each other and coordinates the agreed upon actions of member states.
In effect, yes they're two different concepts. I wouldn't say it's a poorly educated perspective. It's common for folks to be unaware of the UNs purpose and function as it, indeed, can be very conceptual like most legislative frameworks.
Let me ask you a question: when someone says UN, are you thinking merely of the framework, or the realization of that framework when populated with the constituent member states that take part in it's machinations?
Am I misunderstanding your wording or are Member States a separate concept from the UN? Because from a poorly educated perspective that sounds like "Congress doesn't appoint this position, Congressmen must vote on the appointees.".
Yep. A lot of ppl seem to think UN is like government of governments that can order governments around. They are just a platform where governments talk, like a free online forum.
