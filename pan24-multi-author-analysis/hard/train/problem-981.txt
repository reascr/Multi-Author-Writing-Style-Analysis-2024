That's the reasoning behind it. The official reason is that "they are flawed, and only a government chosen by a majority of people can fix them up".
It's not against the new government. It's against the set of rules they want to pass to make the government above the judicial system, making de facto the govt able to overturn the Supreme Court if they feel like it.
It seems like changing the functioning and power of the judicial branch is something that should be done by 2/3rds public vote or something and just not a simple government majority.
Well, in every democracy there needs to be balances for both side, the court system balances the government but something needs to balance the court system so that they wont have roo much power. HOWEVER, giving the government total control over them is NOT the way to do it.
That would allow the government way too much power to pass laws that could hurt some citizens or create a lot of unbalance power.
Like government decisions to make 20% of their citizens into second class citizens? By allowing orthodox jews to skip required military service and making them 1st class citizens over everyone else?
