"Plant milk" has actually been a term for a really long time (since at least 1755), usually describing the fluid inside plants or liquid resulting from grinding seeds or nuts. "Milk" does not mean animal milk exclusively.
Milk comes from animals. Vegan milk comes from grains/seeds. And they produce it by pressing the grain/seeds. Therefore, it's juice, not milk.
> Milk means the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows, which may be clarified and may be adjusted by separating part of the fat therefrom; concentrated milk, reconstituted milk, and dry whole milk. Water, in a sufficient quantity to reconstitute concentrated and dry forms, may be added.
To be clear, I have no problem with people who choose to consume almond milk, or any other alternate form of milk, but it should be called juice. Almond milk should be milk flavored with almond.
But It does have a qualifier in front of it, it's say "Almond Milk". Almond is a type of plant, hence it's a "Plant Milk". Still a milk even by your definition.
