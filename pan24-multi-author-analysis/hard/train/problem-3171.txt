People lie for reasons all the time. The pathological part is when you lie about nonsense for no reason.
The fact that he lies so consistently is one thing, but the shit he chooses to lie about is just so fucking weird. It is constantly so easily verifiable, over and over again. Being caught it any of these things would make most of us feel ashamed. Being caught lying about being a HM extra would ruin me...
I was talking about his lies about his personal life. I am not a clinician, so I am using pathological liar in the broad not the technocal sense. I also agree he may have suffered because of being hit in the head so many times.
That is why he had so much support from Elise Stefanik, whom WaPo and NYT said knew at least some of the deceit but campaigned for him anyway. At least with Hershel Walker and Donald Trump, voters knew the two were pathological liars. Most politicians embellish, like saying they speak Spanish fluently, but had one year in high school, but the new crop of Republicans no longer stretch the truth, they just make things up whole cloth. Facts just don't matter any more and that is the point. If you can not win in this reality, you gaslight and create a new one.
