buried their eggs in shallow pits like crocodiles and they were incubated using solar radiation and geothermal heat - like Crocs or some Turtles.
Essentially - although not the exact paper it doea show that Sauropods used their front legs for propulsion, not their hind legs, and indicates how flexible they were.
As for what you said in a comment lower down, models for sauropods are based on known articulations and soft tissues. I suppose this is one of the weaknesses of paleontology; with soft tissues almost never preserved, we have to make educated guesses by observing currently living organisms with similar skeletal structures and trying to use that to figure out how dinosaur soft tissues may have worked nearly 100 million years ago. However, we could be entirely wrong - it wouldn’t be the first instance of a massive misconception about a dinosaur’s fossil (like how Edward Cope reconstructed a plesiosaur fossil, but put the head on the end of the tail). All that we can do is try to make the best educated guesses and inferences based on extremely limited specimens and trying to draw comparisons to current life.
At any rate, I have to imagine that Titanosaurs would be able to lie down somehow. A creature that can’t stand up after falling to the ground (eg, being knocked over in combat) would be no a death sentence for it. While it may not have been able to squat down its rear end, I have to imagine that it would have been capable of lowering its body down. Like, modern cows can’t bend their knees enough to walk downstairs, and often sleep while standing up by locking their knees, but they are capable of lying down and standing up.
