I’m young. I consider myself “conservative.” Fuck the GOP, I have never and will never vote for them. They aren’t conservative.
Cut the military budget in half. Make taxation fair - why the fuck am I paying more in taxes as a blue collar worker than billionaires? Healthcare should not be for profit (public health and profit are diametrically opposed and can’t coexist, add in that for profit healthcare costs us all more in total, and for profit healthcare is truly against conservative values), make a true public option. Start there, those are true conservative values.
Those are textbook values that align with the definition of conservative values. But they’re the pposite of GOP values. The GOP is not conservative and does not represent the textbook definition of conservative values whatsoever.
Those are all traditionally conservative values and align with the definition of “conservative.” The GOP is not conservative, and the Democratic Party is actually right of center as far as global politics are concerned.
while we agree both that the dems aren’t liberal, and the gop not conservative, and we both share pretty well overlapped values, i think you may actually be confused by what the textbook definition of conservative is. you don’t sound remotely conservative. you might want dig into that a bit more before describing yourself to people as conservative.
