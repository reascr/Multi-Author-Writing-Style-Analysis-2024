I thought she was still being repaired by EB in New London. Very sad she got transferred out of state, but there's also not much happening in the Atlantic.
The Connecticut is one of the modified Seawolf classes like the Jimmy Carter with the special midship insert. Too valuable to scrap given how long it would take to get a new equally capable boat online.
Got a source of any kind whatsoever? Where did the POWs and KIA come from given the only boat mentioned didn't lose any personnel and is in US port?
The first part about the POWs and KIAs did lead to comments about a captured US Navy boat and personnel. Although I read the article where the rumor started from, and I didn't see anything that would lead me to believe anything happened recently. It most likely was referring to remains from the Korean War. So, it could be that the news article was modified to remove the confusion, or the poster that started the rumor is an idiot.
In January 2021, when Biden took office, there was some conspiracy theory going around Chinese social media after a state news article was quoted as saying that the US naval officials (specifically the Navy) were meeting with PLA officials to discuss the return of POWs and KIAs in the present tense. And people were speculating, hang on.. the PLAN captured some US servicemembers?
An interesting question, if a US sub was detected within undisputed Chinese waters, would the PLA be legally permitted to fire upon it? Or have an unscheduled anti-submarine drill.
