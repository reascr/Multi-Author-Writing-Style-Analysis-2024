It works fairly well in France. While some words slip through, the Académie Française has been the official gatekeepers of the French language in France for over 300 years.
Not only do members not live at the Institut, it houses the oldest public library in France, has an impressive art collection its amassed over the years, and is impeccably maintained. You can visit it yourself, if you'd like.
What are you talking about? Their members have real jobs and lives. Hell, not all of them are French or even live in France - one member is a Haitian-Canadian who lives in Miami.
Who cares if some permanent secretary continued to use a 3.5K EUR flat after retiring? Or a 5K EUR /month flat? Or paying 3K EUR monthly stipend to a widow? That's.
Yep. The laws around language are pretty typical for most countries. They set a standard for which the government is to operate. The official language of the US is English. There are regional exceptions for Spanish and other languages though. The laws Ukraine passed in 2022 after the Russian invasion are clearly geared at limiting Russians and sending a message to Russia.
>Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 19 June the Ukrainian parliament passed two laws which placed restrictions on Russian books and music. The new laws ban Russian citizens from printing books unless they take Ukrainian citizenship, prohibit the import of books printed in Russia, Belarus and the occupied Ukrainian territories, and prohibit the reproduction in the media and public transport of music performed or created by post-1991 Russian citizens, unless the musicians are included in a "white list" of artists who have publicly condemned Russian aggression against Ukraine.[14][15][16].
