How so? He had a disastrous record as Governor of Indiana in that he killed a bunch of people by mishandling an HIV outbreak in the state. Then went on to alienate everybody with ).
I think the headline pretty much says it all, but it is kind of interesting reading, and watching for the Lincoln Project ad linked to in the article. Pence is gearing up to run in 2024, but who expects that to go much of anywhere?
After that, he was about to lose the governorship to a Democrat, which was unheard of Indiana, and he saw a way out by stepping out of the race to be veep for Trump. I believe he fully expected to lose, but thought he would be seen as the serious mature adult in the room who stepped up to save a failing campaign, and get some good karma with the GOP establishment.
For real. In some ways I think he may worse than Trump, because he enabled him while doing his evangelical schtick that Trump was an imperfect vessel etc.
I wonder how he really reconciles his tenure with Trump in his own conscience. Say what you will about him, he’s legit religious, and it seems if I were the same way I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. Of course he’s also a piece of shit, but he’s not the same caliber of “Christian” as the rest of the GQP. Perhaps trump was his god testing him, and he failed miserably, lol.
