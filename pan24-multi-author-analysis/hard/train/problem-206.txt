Think of it this way: His overall demographics are declining so he is using his last chance to mobilise large swaths of young misinformed Russians to fight his war in order to defend himself against the unipolarity of the American empire.
The West's strategy is to draw the Russian forces into a protracted conflict with high losses in order to force Russia to go to extreme measures like this to weaken Putin's domestic support. The West has no problem supplying Ukraine with ammo and armaments, we can build it faster than we give it, and most of the giveaways have been surplus equipment anyway.
I wonder how they will be paying for this doubling of the Russian soldiers, and what armaments they plan to produce along side them when they can't even keep up with losses in Ukraine.
This isn’t ww2, throwing numbers at the issue won’t work when Ukraine is being supplied high end modern military equipment, the cannon fodder from Russia are being killed miles away from the frontline because of Ukrainian drones and artillery….
The West has to supply more advanced weapons to Ukraine such as the Gray Eagle drone, GLSDB, a Western tank, and a Western fighter plane to offset Russia's huge superiority in manpower. During the Korean War, China had overwhelming superiority in manpower, but this couldn't overcome the UN's superiority in weapons.
