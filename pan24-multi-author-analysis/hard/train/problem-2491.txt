As an American, we proudly inherit a country that allows for difference of opinions and viewpoints. That’s what it means to be an American- so the rage about that in my opinion is ridiculous. Her status as an American citizen means that our government has the responsibility of protecting us home and abroad, full stop.
She fucked up- traveling to other countries you are agreeing to abide by their laws. Was the possession of her illegal substance further trumped up by the Russians? Absolutely. But she did it herself so I have zero sympathy for why she was arrested and jailed in the first place.
One less American in a Russian Gulag, if she were jailed anywhere else. She’d be serving out her sentence.
Yes she should serve her jail term, which she did, many times over! Russia however just arbitrarily changed the punishment and people like you seem to ignore that part.
Except that's not what happened. Yes she's an idiot for not checking the law. But the law in Russia specifically states that having less than 6 grams of Cannabis carries a fine or 15 days in prison.
In 2006 Russian policy reversed again to lower the possession limits for various drugs, with the criminal limit for cannabis going from 20 g to 6 g.[1] Less than 6 grams qualified as an administrative offense punishable by a 5000 ruble fine or 15 days detention.[1].
