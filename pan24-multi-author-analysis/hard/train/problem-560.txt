There is also likely bigotry playing a factor. As 'protecting french language' heats up, there is a lot of pressure for Quebec to accept more west Africans (as they can protect french, most other immigrants flip to english). But that'd make Quebec dark skinned, when a reality is a large number of those defending french language are actually using it as a dog whistle to protect old stock white francos. Quebec has one of, if not the worst demographics on the continent and their language will significantly drop if they are not willing to target darker Quebeckers for immigration. Instead, racist tension builds and builds in Quebec (they are not alone of course).
Video account from people of colour who immigrated to Quebec and face discrimination and other issues, despite your denial:
Yeah right, because implying that people living outside Montréal aren’t « real human beings » isn’t racist at all….
Also, calling Montréal anglophones "foreigners" is weird as fuck dude. When they were the ones telling my parents to speak white.
Montreal's police, like pretty much every other important thing that actually impacts citizen, is of provincial jurisdiction. And as such are not subjected to Canada's federal bilinguisme law.
I know it's so weird right? When I go to Germany, cops communicate with the central in German. They are weird like that.
Also, I don't hate anglophones in general. Just the stubborn entitled ones who refuse to learn a single word of French and attempt to paint themselves as done kind of oppresses minority.
