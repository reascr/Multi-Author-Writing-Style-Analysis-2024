The Republican loser is claiming that redistricting hurt him because in the towns that were new to his district, he was an unknown. He seems to think that being an incumbent means you don’t have to work to gain voters’ confidence anymore and should give you an automatic advantage over any opponent.
That means you're basically conceding very close elections because you told your supporters to only vote in a one-shot way instead of the easy way and a small percentage aren't going to make it on election day.
A lot of local elections have very small margins, but because our media is mostly produced on a national scale rather than locally, not a lot gets said about those elections and we forget they even exist or why they matter.
I feel like a lot of voter apathy can be addressed by just highlighting the importance and tight margins of local races.
This is a bit how I feel about our state rep election since it was my first time voting in this town (moved last year) and the Dem won by a vote, in a recount.
