There are also videos of people in Mariupol who live in damaged houses, without windows, walls half destroyed, they're freezing, because they have nowhere else to go. 21st century.
In Mariupol, invaders are demolishing houses in the historic part of the city. "Another cover-up of the consequences of bombing by russian planes.Â This is how the history of Mariupol after the Second World War turns into garbage.".
