We're also likely to see more wars being fought over energy, food and clean water, which will cause and exacerbate already existing declines in living standards.
Refugee crises, famines and droughts will become a lot more common place than they are already today, as after all, many places where humans exist will cease to be hospitable.
Climate change won't directly cause a huge fall in human population. What will cause that over time will be the inevitable fall in living standards (healthcare and hygiene, education, housing, ect) that come along with climate change. This may not be universal, and some countries might be able to avoid the bulk of it, however most won't.
Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if we're already over the brink and we just don't realise or want to acknowledge that yet. Next 50 years are going to be hell to contend with.
Further, pray that nuclear armed nations don't fall apart or do anything stupid. Nuclear winter is its own form of man-made climate change after all...
Climate change is unavoidable. Our strategy needs to be more on coping with climate change than preventing it.
