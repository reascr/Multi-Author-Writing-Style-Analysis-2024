Yes, I mean it’s practically unknowable. On top of that, atheism as we think of it today is a relatively new concept. Sure, the nominally atheistic despots of our age may have pretty high body counts, but how does that compare to the multitude of instances throughout time of someone killing someone else because they don’t believe in the right god?
edit: I lied, I did cherry pick a bit, there were more in the middle ages that I skipped over, I'd never heard of them, and figured their small death counts weren't going to move the needle much against the backdrop of "atheist despots have killed more humans over time", and around >30M net-on-net deaths in my table above.
Please give me some names then. I literally searched "worst despots", then looked up each one's religion and death count. Give me names and I'll do the same for them.
Yeah exactly, for _some reason_, this got narrowed this down to "atheist despots" in particular. Wonder if the reason is the absolute multitude of religious wars in history perpetrated by a different type of despot: A monarch of some type.
