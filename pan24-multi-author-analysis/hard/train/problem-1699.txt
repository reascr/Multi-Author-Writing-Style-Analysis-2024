That "pre-crime prevention division" is YOU! Take a look at your life, a look at your choices, how you've treated or mistreated people. Reflect on how self-centered you've been and how you affect other people.
Before you double down and say civilian gun ownership is at the center of the issue, just look at some countries that outlaw it completely: Cambodia, Myanmar, North Korea, Somalia. They don't allow citizens to own guns, but are subject to either government genocides, totalitarianism, complete unenforcability, civil wars, or rampant arms blackmarkets. On the other hand, you have countries like Switzerland where there is about 1 privately owned gun for every 4 people and they haven't had a mass shooting in over 20 years. So gun ownership or gun control aren't the issue itself.
The Chicago killings are also committed by guns, so that doesn't refute the argument that guns are a threat. In fact, that highlights the need for more gun control and less indulging the NRA and their paid for GOP puppets.
Weapons manufacturers, politicians who they own and gun fetishists who vote for those politicians are still preventing what is needed to end the slaughter, comprehensive gun reform. The vast majority of Americans including many responsible gun owners want it butâ€¦pfft.
