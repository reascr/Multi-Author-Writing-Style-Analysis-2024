Xi fancies himself a dragon, but he has turned the prospect of the Great Empire of China arising into "Xina: Super North Korea".
Fairness Doctrine might have been the precursor, but that was temporally too far away for this incarnation to focus further on.
If China proceeds with military aid to Russia, then MNCs and countries still doing business as usual will be co-conspirators in many peoples' eyes and unlike in the 1940s, we can record the who, the when, the how, and understand why in ways that will not allow these people and organizations to just pretend it's business as usual in any sort of aftermath.
What china won't do though, is sacrifice anything in order to help russia - they will extract every penny of discount they can from russia, and make favourable trade deals etc, while making sure to supply russia with just enough to keep going.
The stupid thing is though, China and Russia don’t have to see everything as a war situation, they could just be friends with everyone around them, stop annexing them and just trade with them instead.
I honestly don’t see China supporting Russia the same way NATO supports Ukraine with weapons and such. China shown from the start they wanted to take a neutral stance like India, like most of Africa and some of South America- only Iran and North Korea have pretty much sided with Russia.
China may have similar ambitions but their approach is different, they want the West to respect them as the wiser, more sensible adult at the table compared to the volatile and untrustworthy Russia. They want leverage economically over both Russia and the West; they can keep reaping the benefits from Russia: oil, gas, etc. whilst the war’s going on and they can gain the benefits from the west by being the lesser of two evils.
