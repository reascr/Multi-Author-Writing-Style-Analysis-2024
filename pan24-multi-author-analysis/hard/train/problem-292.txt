Coincidence regarding timing of his tax returns coming out? To me this looks like a threat to republicans who want to stay in power, lean in harder or fall down with him.
He would only threaten this to win over Republican Party officials to support him. He and they know him running as a third party candidate would split the vote and ensure a democrat win. Heâ€™s not an idiot, and would not do this to win an election.
If he does end up running as a third party candidate, it would only be a vehicle to extort more money from his cult, and to screw over the republicans who turned on him.
The Republicans can't really help him right now with his legal problems, and as far as being a tightwad, who says he would spend any money even as a third party candidate?
Going third party would also allow him to grift up until the general election in 2024, and would also give him legal cover, as the DOJ would consider him politically untouchable after say the fall of 2023.
I think he would form a third party, a malignant narcissist such as Trump would be far more humiliated to lose then GOP primary to Desantis than to lose the general election as a third party.
And there is the one thing that could potentially split the Republican Party in half Donald Trump running as a third party candidate I hope he goes through with this.
I'm kinda torn, I'd love to see him indicted by Valentine's Day, but on the other hand, a third party headed by Trump could be a thorn in the side of the GOP for years to come. Guess I'll just have to make some more popcorn and think on it a while.
