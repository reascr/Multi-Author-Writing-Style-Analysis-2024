True. But the marginalization of Jews has existed since Christianity emerged as a sect of Judaism in Roman Palestine. Once they decided they needed to demonize the Jewish people, it opened up a can of worms in the form of lies and conspiracy theories. Even back then they had their Alex Jones equivalents, asserting things like, "The Jews invented alcohol to weaken the minds of Christians", and the popular, "The Jews killed our lord and savior.".
