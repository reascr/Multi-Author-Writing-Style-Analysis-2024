It was an intelligence gaffe by an incompetent administration. When you're a Republican, you're putting other Republicans in your administration who almost are always morons. Just listen to clips of conservative Supreme Court justices during arguments. How did they even graduate law school, let alone become judges?
I don't know how they graduate law school - probably simply by knowing the law and passing the exams. And those have nothing to do with actual politics and party leanings. Just learning facts.
But they all became SC judges just by knowing someone, and being biased in favor of whichever presdient got to submmit their names, and then because of who was in control of the Senate. We can thank McConnell for most of it, who has his own agenda and plan to mold the justice system his desired design.
(Edit: McConnell launched his schemes long before Obama got into office, according to intrviews and reports).
As a younger Republican, I was pleased that Gore ended up losing. Now, as a much more mature and knowledgable adult, I am sorry. And even more sorry that HC lost, although if Trump hadn't been president, I doubt I would feel that strongly about it.
