Except they can't even do that right. It's really hard to blame the dems for not helping the GOP pick a speaker.
Maybe, but from what I’m seeing, no matter who gets the speakership for the Republicans, they will need Democrats’ support to get almost anything done.
Get some sort of concessions thrown the Dems way and all of the sudden you have a functioning House of Representatives; that maybe, maybe…..has a shot at getting something useful done in the next two years.
The democrats should get behind the absolutely most reasonable, least power seeking House republican and throw their votes to that person….
Real question from a casual observer: is there a moderate/ non-Trump Republican (or a conservative Democrat) who could win with the backing of all of the Democrats and a few Republicans?
The reason is that they could make dropping the ‘Hunter Biden’s Penis’ hearings, keeping the government open, and being at least somewhat reasonable caveats for their votes. If the speaker goes back on his (or her) word, they call a no confidence vote.
