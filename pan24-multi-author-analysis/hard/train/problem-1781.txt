All I can find about CA is something from 2021, but that doesn’t explicitly involve background checks in order to run for office. Do you have any info on that case to help refine my Google-fu?
Also, one cannot be considered a candidate until they have raised or spent $5k in campaign funds. So yes, filings are required for the federal level.
1) Filings are not required to run, they are only required once you spend or raise more than , for the fed elections. I can’t recall there being any filing fee at the fed level.
Oddly, the releases of tax returns wasn’t a thing until Nixon did it, and it’s been tradition since then.
But fiduciaries aren’t protected by the Constitution in the same way and it will probably be argued in court that without an amendment, it is an illegal barrier to candidacy.
You're right that the courts would strike down attempts to add additional eligibility conditions or prerequisites for running for office (beyond ballot access procedures) that aren't already in the constitution. But this isn't that. The constitution doesn't talk about tax record confidentiality at all. It's not in there. It's a pure statutory creation, and there are already several cases where the IRS must disclose a tax return by law. Candidates can't veto legally authorized disclosure of a return by a tax agency any more than they can be forced to disclose it themselves.
Doing this would avoid the First Amendment issues with requiring the candidates to take the speech action of disclosing their returns. The confidentiality of tax returns is merely statutory, not constitutional if it doesn't compel the candidate to do the disclosure themselves. As we saw from what just happened to Trump's returns, exceptions to tax return confidentiality already exist, and the exceptions used in his case are not the only ones. This would be another worthwhile exception.
