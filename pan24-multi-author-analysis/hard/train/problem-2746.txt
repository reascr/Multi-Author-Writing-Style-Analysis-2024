You don't have to though. Drinking water out of single use plastic bottles needs to die. Soda pop really shouldn't be labeled as food and returning to glass is infinitely more sustainable environmentally.
The solution is to ban single use plastics or to legislate that these companies that produce it also create the recycling centers for it and promote them to be used.
So no until we find something alternative to replace this single use plastic bags or everything with it.
What essentials are you buying that have no alternative to single use plastics packaging? Batteries for your XBox controller? Seriously?
Sure. But in the meantime, with CFCs, there were hundreds of thousands of people who stopped buying the shit because of the harm it was causing.
When we realized CFCs were destroying the ozone layer, we didn’t say “well people need to stop buying products that contain CFCs!” We banned that shit and it WORKED.
Again; when we realized CFCs were destroying the ozone layer, we did not throw our hands up and say “well people just want their aerosol hair spray What can we do It’s up to consumers!” We banned it AND IT WORKED.
