My point was that if the major penalty for murder - a long-ass time in prison, or even death - isn't going to deter someone, then the minor additional penalty of having a black gun - generally less than a year if it's actually prosecuted in addition to the murder charge - isn't going to change someone's mind. And IIRC, there have been studies done that say criminals generally don't consider penalties when they commit a crime because they don't think they'll get caught.
Laws were never designed to prevent crime or to keep someone from doing a thing. All they do is define a certain act as bad so that we can punish the person who committed the act.
My usage of black didn't refer to the black market but the color of the average AR15. How do you suggest catching all of these supposed black market sales?
That'll surely help. I mean, if the penalties for murder/attempted murder aren't enough, the lesser penalties for possession of an illegal gun are certain to stop them.
Make sure the proposed gun control laws would not have prevented the crime they are "in response to." This is an obligatory characteristic of all gun control legislation.
