On Wednesday the Supreme Court hosted nearly three hours of oral arguments in a case many experts say could do more damage to democracy than anything since Donald Trump’s attempted coup.
Moore v Harper revolves around an idea cooked up on the fringes of conservative legal thought that could turn federal elections into statewide power-grabs, and possibly do more to weaken the power of voters’ ballots than gerrymandering ever could.
They are not in a strong enough position in state legislatures to do any of the things the blackpilled doomers are claiming they’d do, and the Republicans are already losing control of legislative chambers even when ostensibly holding majorities of seats. That has happened in Alaska now and is beginning to unfold in Kansas. This process, once started, will not reverse itself and has a good chance of happening in the US House in January.
But of course no matter what happens, people will refuse to accept that the situation is fundamentally winnable.
People need to stop ignoring the truth of the situation on this. Moore v. Harper is not going to save the Republicans no matter how extreme a decision they issue. The old assumptions about pendular alternations do not hold during realignments and as the Republicans’ internal factions continue their infighting and as the party continues alienating their own voters and falling off a demographic cliff, they will not be in any sort of position to overturn results or gerrymander themselves into permanent majorities. The fearmongering on this ignores reality.
