Britain was the main reason the condemnation of the slave trade was included in The Final Act at the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815 iirc. This was a few years after the slave trade was banned in Britain. Abolitionism was an extremely popular movement in Britain at the time and slavery was abolished completely a couple decades later in 1833.
So, by the time of the 1900s there would likely be very few people left living in Britain who could say what being a slave was like, if any.
Well hang on, back in the 1900s Britain had the world's biggest economy, we stopped the slave trade and lost economic value. We dismantled our empire and lost economic value, but the people wanted these things to occur to progress our society and way of life. Brexit is the same, yes we'll lose some value from the EU for a bit but we'll be fine in the end.
It became too costly to keep them, and the majority of the British population believe the same thing about the EU it's too costly to our society and our pockets to continue to be a member.
Precisely my point, it took a long time to complete the change, Britain lost money and power because of it, however they did it for the good of the people.
Brexit is the same, it will take decades to complete, it may cost some money but in the long run it will be better for us all.
