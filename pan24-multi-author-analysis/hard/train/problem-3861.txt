Macron wanting to get out of there, isn't a bad idea. France is isolated in Africa, with US&Uk/Muslim Brotherhood/Russia/China doing everything possible to destabilise the region.
With China massively investing overthere and US intention to invest the area, Africa looks more and more like the battlefield those two decided for their proxiwar.
China also has been investing heavily in Africa, and providing developmental aid with more favorable terms, lower interest rates, and often fewer restrictions than Western aid. Again, it's not out of benevolence but it does engender good will towards China.
I think you have your cause and effect reversed. It was the countries in Europe that colonized and exploited Africa. Russian and Chinese involvement in Africa (and the Global South in general) was a response to Western exploitation and colonization.
Russia and China are new to the game with regards to Imperialism in Africa. European nations are a full very much making bank on their exploits.
Eh... Look up the African Frank. France has had economic sovereignty over most of western Africa for over half a century post-decolonisation.
The only thing that France can do to gain more influence in Africa is to help put Africa on a path to true autonomy over itself and it's resources.
The west treats it like a giant farm and mining operation. No wonder overall Africa wants to get away.
