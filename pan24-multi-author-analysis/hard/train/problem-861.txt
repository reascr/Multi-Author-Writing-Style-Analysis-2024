Honestly, BBC WS is one of the only news radio stations I can still stand listening to any more. They’re professional and present the facts, instead of ranting and raving; they cover news from all over the world, which has made me more aware of geopolitics and events outside my country. That’s how I learned about the recent end of the Tigray War, about the Sri Lanka President fleeing the country earlier this year, the unrest in South Africa, etc.
Center of mass is around your stomach, not your face. If they’re shot in the stomach and some of the birdshot hits their genitals, then maybe, but it seems like they’re intentionally aiming slightly downward to inflict as much pain as possible.
No, you are supposed to fire rubber bullets by aiming at the lower part of the body (thus the shooting at genitals comes from). Those who did that are actually abiding to minimize permanent damage, whereas those who shoot protestors on the face know what they are doing and are looking to blind them.
They are also aiming at the eyes of protestors, and threaten doctors who attempt to treat protestors, with violence. This regime is disgusting.
