Ah yes, a poll by "Euroskopia," a nebulous organization claiming to be " an alliance between the main social research and media companies in the EU" which posts irregularly, focusing on how "divided people are over the Ukraine and with a surprisingly high amount of media in Russian.
No I am not from Germany and can tell you, reading through many forums or FB and I also daily work and communicate with 150-200 people and when topics come to war, most of them are much more neutral than in first month or so, general support for Ukraine is getting weaker, but that is not what politicians will tell you they have their own agendas with ashes left behind the front. War is now a perfect distraction from failed EU system and opportunity to fix some of it.
Unfortunately Ukraine will pull the shortest straw from all parties, how short we will see. I just hope this shit ends soon.
It is easy to eat up all the crap Russian and American propaganda serves us, but the truth in is between.
I think most of EU is. General population doesn't want Murica and Russia playing war games on our backyard, but EU is weak and they are explointing this.
Most people see what Russia is like to its own citizens and I’m pretty sure most Europeans don’t want to end up as a puppet state for them.
