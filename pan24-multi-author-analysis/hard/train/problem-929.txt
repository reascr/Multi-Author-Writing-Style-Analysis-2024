Good point. It’s 1.2 Trillion. I’ll give you an upvote. I just wonder how the EU would take it if the US said fine, we are shutting down all our bases and removing all US forces from EU countries in response? There’s a lot more than just economics at play here. The U.S. has over 100k troops and dozens of bases in EU countries. That’s a lot of savings for the US government and taxpayers. There are reasons why very few countries maintain overseas bases. It benefits the EU a lot more than the US otherwise the EU would be looking to build bases in the US.
Why should the U.S. care what the EU does? Not a single country in Europe is in the top 4 trading partners for the U.S. and only Germany is in the top 10. Britain is in there too but at 7. The EU just isn’t relevant in the western hemisphere anymore in terms of trade.
Brussels' decision to abandon its free trade ideals would be a major setback for the global economy. It would impede economic growth, increase poverty, and lead to job losses. This would be a bad thing for both individuals and businesses, and should be avoided at all costs.
