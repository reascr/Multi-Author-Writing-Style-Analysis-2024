The problem is not retreating, it's retreating competently. It wasn't a total debacle. This means they are still very much capable of being organised, and if they can retreat swiftly, then they can probably do the same in offensive too. Would it be efficient? Not necessarily. Would it be deadly? Absolutely. And Ukraine cannot afford to lose as many people as Russia can, unfortunately.
Don't destroying these Russian units means that they will continue destroying Ukrainian cities and killing Ukrainian soldiers.
I reckon that there are other factors that are limiting the delivery speed and number of weapons and vehicles to Ukraine than just politics.
I'm sure. If it would have been possible, Ukraine would have cut of and destroyed /captured the Russian units on the right bank of the river. But the Russians managed an orderly retreat and didn't gave them an opportunity for it.
Just dumping thousands of vehicles across the border wouldn't work. Setting up the logistics and supply chains, training of crews and maintenance personnel etcetera takes time. While this work is in progress, only limited numbers of vehicles can be deployed.
