Going way back to the 90s there was AM talk radio that was a constant stream of right-wing propaganda. It was a little more subtle than today, but it managed to slowly steer people into a polarized way of thinking so that there was no grey area or nuance.
There is definitely some influence overhead pushing certain messages either through media or hand-picked politicians, corporate façades and such. And the sad thing is that it's gotten so entrenched at this point all they have to do is say that solar panels are "woke" or that the big solar companies are using the panels to spy on them.
I'm not saying that solar panels stop the libs from turning america into a communist country, but ever since solar panels were invented the Soviet Union collapsed and the US is still capitalist.
But in 30 years the solar panels will need replacement anyway. You can get solar panels now, reap the benefits now, then replace them in 30 years with the money you save from the solar panels now to save even more money.
In 30 years the solar technology will be significantly better and rural communities can adopt it at that time.
You are not going to reap the benefits unless you meet very specific conditions. The cost of installation is high, so you need federal and state rebates and net metering with a utility that pays a guaranteed rate back to property owners for the lifespan of the solar panels.
People who have already adopted solar in rural communities complain loudly to their neighbors about the high cost of investment and how their utility bills still remain high in the winter due to the weather.
There was just recently near me some genuinely packed town halls of angry bumpkins trying to block the installation of a solar farm in their “quiet community” their chief argument was how much noise it was going to make. Not during construction mind you, they were convinced it was gonna sound like a steel mill or something….
