Another important aspect of GDPR, is that it also sets rather strict limits on what kinds of data you're allowed to keep in the first place, and what are its legitimate uses.
If I'm not mistaken, GDPR sets out guidelines and timeline for the steps required by a business after a security breach that affects private data. If those steps are not taken in the given timeline , then massive fines are levied against the business.
Also I believe it also lays out massive fines if a business is found to be willfully lax in its security that leads to a breach. So for example, if they know about a flaw in their security but don't choose to fix that flaw and that flaw is used to against access to private data, then they will face the massive fines.
It's about time that corporations who have data breaches are forced to compensate victims at a cost that would be higher than the cost of making sure this didn't happen in the first place.
Make an example out of them, make it clear to the corporations that it is unacceptable for them to value our privacy with such little regard. The fines are always a slap on the wrist, the damage to their reputation seems to always be negligible. It's highly likely that accounting and legal have made the decision to cut the cost of adequate security in aid of profit, and our data be damned.
