(While a -- meaning, a life sentence with the rider "and you're only ever getting out of prison in a pine box" -- is an option, they're vanishingly rare and are generally reserved for aggravated murder, typically serial killers. (The logic for not applying them to lesser crimes than aggravated murder is that it might give a criminal intent on such crimes an incentive not to leave any witnesses alive: there's an old saying, "may as well be hanged for (stealing) a sheep as a lamb" which applies.).
He's 48, he just pulled a life sentence with a minimum 32 year tariff (your typical murderer on a life stretch serves about 18 years in the UK, IIRC).
He was sentenced to a life sentence, where after the 30 years it will be reevaluated if heâ€™s no longer a danger to society.
His sentence is for his whole life - even if freed for parole there would be heavy regulations on his daily life and what he is allowed to do.
The UK only very very rarely sentences what is called a "Whole Life Tariff" and it is only offered in the event that the Prosecution asks for it to be submitted due to the nature of the acts committed being so extraordinarily criminal that current sentencing regulations would not be able to cover the crime committed. In this case the Prosecution did not feel that the case met this criteria, however the Judge did note she personally disagreed.
