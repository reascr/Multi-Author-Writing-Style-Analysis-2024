I’m guessing you don’t know much about water treatment in general, much less the specific type of treatment plants used in East Palestine, a tiny rural community.
As someone who has experience with both rural water and Superfund clean up sites, your concept of water purification is of systems that do not exist in the real world.
They are making a point that the municipal tap water is safe (and any independent environmental group can easily sample and have it tested to verify).
The drinking water that comes from municipal water sources is treated and safe. I wouldn't drink the water in creeks or rivers before or after this incident.
People don't typically drink directly from creek water. The amount of processing that water plants use are very likely to clear any of these chemicals. At least, modern or Major population centers water treatment plants...perhaps this small community doesn't have that solid of a water infrastructure.
And assuming that they are being honest about that, it is an important point to make, so the people who have municipal tap water will drink that so bottled water will be available for those on well water who need it.
Yeah, I didn't want people to misread my comment as trying to say everything is fine, just noting that what they're drinking is not the water that actually is a problem.
One thing to note is this is the municipal water supply, which has been treated. This means absolutely nothing as to the lakes and rivers. People drinking municipal tap water at this point are likely fine, but it's the local produce, fish and well water that will cause problems.
