TLDR - yet another minor political party has made the 10,000 signature requirement to be recognized. They claim to be centrist, but stuck their foot in in the last race endorsing the Republican candidate.
They do have a platform, though itâ€™s almost a copy of the democrats voting rights platform, so will likely siphon more votes from democrats than republicans ðŸ¥².
The Forward Party is the only one I can think of, though their platform (ranked choice voting, non partisan primaries, and independent redistributing commissions) is almost a subset of the Democrats platform.
Any party that runs their own candidates instead of endorsing members of Democratic or republican primaries/ general election is being a spoiler unless proper reforms have passed.
If you want to fix democracy, vote in the democratic primary, and push candidates that say they're for ending FPTP and doing, at the very least, ranked choice voting.
Maybe one day we'll run a decent Independent that will force the Dems and Republicans to change their platforms, or lose.
Well, i may not be into that party, but i do think people are tiring of the political parties. I've been an Independent for years, and do like the Progressive Dems, but they too get corrupted by the Corporate Democrats.
