The Bruen ruling overturned an obviously corrupt and discriminatory law, and it’s pretty much the only thing the Supremes have done recently that wasn’t batshit crazy.
You'd think that given the Bruen ruling states wouldn't waste time trying to pass what seems like obviously unconstitutional laws that will get struck down but anti abortion people did the same thing so who knows. I think the next year will be a very interesting year for gun regulation one way or another.
This is a requirement for all gun control legislation. "Would not have prevented the crime it is being passed _in response to_" is I believe in the Constitution somewhere.
The SC needs to be fining state attorneys general a few million dollars for playing "I'm not touching you!" games every time they flout the law like this. I don't know if that's possible but it would be appropriate for citizens in Illinois, California and especially New York to be relieved of some of their tax money over this frivolous nonsense.
And they invariably end up worse off than they were before and they can't understand why. : ) Thank you Illinois for this perfectly crafted test case.
It is an interesting point because alcohol kills 95,000 Americans/year, which dwarfs gun violence, alcohol _really is_ something nobody needs unlike guns, and banning it because that would "save lives and keep society safe" should be a moral imperative. All the public interest tests gun control advocates like to advance wrt guns also apply to alcohol.
