I'm glad it works so well for you! Some poor bastards can smoke everyday and still get breakthrough nightmares. I'm very thankful I'm not one of them.
That's wild. I don't remember if our satcom guys were the main comms link or not, but they were the only ones who stayed busy all year. Between the wind, the sun, and some kind of orbit issue, they burned through a set or two of actuators over the year.
From my own experience, the exact same strain of cannabis can alleviate enough anxiety to let me feel sleepy and fall asleep at night, then relieve enough anxiety the next morning to let me enjoy my morning routine, which has an energizing effect.
Cannabis makes users fall asleep faster in the same way that alcohol makes one fall asleep faster -- it chemically alleviates anxieties but that disrupts the sleep cycle during the most restorative and important part of sleep - the REM cycle.
Not dreaming is a sign of chemically stopping the natural sleeping process, alcohol intoxication has a similar effect. That's why doctors are recommended to only prescribe cannabis for sleep related anxiety disorders for a temporary amount of time and treat the underlying anxiety problems through other methods like therapy.
Tell that to someone who normally can’t sleep because they are in excruciating physical pain that marijuana alleviates. People aren’t smoking pot for problems melatonin fixes.
