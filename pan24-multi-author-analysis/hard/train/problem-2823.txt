We are not talking metaphorically. This is not just harsh conditions in a poor country. We are talking about abducted children (as young as 11) taken from a country and made to work without pay, without safety equipment and without contact to anyone who speaks their language.
We simply failed to abolish slavery. For example, most chocolate (and by most I mean all the chocolate that is not coming from a fair trade circuit with a x2 price premium) is a product of slave labor. Occasionally child slave labors.
Similar stories can be found in clothing, food and electronics industries. Cheap stuff nowadays is based on forced labor.
Free labor can never compete in a market with enslaved labor. Every American worker should be pushing for legal recognition of undocumented workers because it would improve working conditions for ALL of us.
Hire undocumented people for less than minimum wage and deny them legal rights and workplace safety.
It is bad enough that California made it illegal to for employers or their attorneys to contact immigration. DLSE has literally had ICE camp out in front of their offices on days of hearings of undocumented immigrants. Since DLSE doesn't give that information out to ICE, there is only one explanation.
