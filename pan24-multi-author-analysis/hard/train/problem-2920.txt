This lack of regulation leading to innocent deaths, for example, is the difference between a "no-regulations" state like Texas (where chemical plants blow up next to residential areas, just like in India) and California (where they do not). And a key difference between the USA in the 21st century and the USA in the 19th century, before these laws and regulations were enacted.
You don't understand America regulated this in the US after the exact same thing happened almost 100 years ago?
It's not complicated, it's just fools whose brains are incapable of connecting dots from point a to point b.
Republicans love spouting free market principles... no regulations because the people are smart. This is what a lack of regulation nets you. Bodies. Still obtusely pretending this isn't conservative rhetoric 101 or that you are tired of politics, doesn't make you moderate... It makes you stupid.
This is a very ignorant comment. Regulations and safety measures arise when a country becomes more wealthy. If your industry is young and still developing, it's pointless to set high safety regulations because no one can follow it and there are no government resources to enforce it.
