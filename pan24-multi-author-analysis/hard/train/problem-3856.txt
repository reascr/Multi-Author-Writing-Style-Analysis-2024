What has been the purpose of the police, historically? Enforcing slavery and strike-breaking. The entire institution is predicated on oppression. There's a reason people say "Cops and Klan go hand in hand.".
Thats the thing, though. As adults we deal with this type of conundrum all the time. We constantly have to recognize and restrain our emotional responses.
Feelings are not mystical. They don't somehow create a justification for bad behavior through their very existence. Sometimes your mind's initial response is the correct one, but oftentimes it has to be moderated or ignored. Doing that, having that amount of self-discipline, is the bare minimum that should be expected from any functioning adult.
Likewise, we should condemn the anti-intellectual mindset, which states something along the lines of, "I feel this way and feelings are important. It must have some meaning and validity. That means that being racist must have some value and is therefore not wrong.".
Well, yeah. They’re the most common extremists here. Kinda goes without saying, I’d think. We don’t have a lot of other types of extremists, like ISIS or militant leftist groups.
To be completely honest, I’m surprised at how many mass murders aren’t tied to extremism at all. The majority of mass shootings aren’t politically motivated or demographically targeted at all, just straight up killing for killing’s sake. For every Pulse Nightclub we have four Gilroy Garlic Festivals.
Not that one’s any better than the other, it’s just hard to believe how much violence isn’t motivated by any kind of specific hatred or extremism.
