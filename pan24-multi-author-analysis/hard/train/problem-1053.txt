Who’s we? These will be a Eurofighter replacement, likely akin to the F-22, that won’t have a production line for a decade. It probably won’t be a mainstay aircraft, and all the partner nations already operate F-35. Japan just ordered like 40 more. Waiting 10 years to buy aircraft that barely exist right now instead of waiting an extra year or so for F-35 just isn’t what’s happening.
There is a reason the F-22 is so ahead of everything else and we still barely produce and use them. They are outdated in 2022.
I don't understand this. Yes, noone can compete in dogfights with the F-22 and we don't export the F-22, but noone is dogfighting with jets.
I would also add there are indeed jets that could compete in a dogfight with the F22. The Su-57 for example would absolutely hold a candle to the F22 in a dogfight. Where the F22 has the advantage though is it's stealth capability. Making a dogfight unnecessary.
The last F22s ever made were actually built in 2011. They are certainly not "so ahead of everything else". In fact they are slated to be completely retired by 2030 due to their extremely high operating cost, limited range, outdated avionics and the availability of newer/better stealth technology.
