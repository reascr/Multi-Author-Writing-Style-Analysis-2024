If it’s Belarus from Belarus you risk nato involvement for this strike? Unless your testing the nato response this is an insane first strike.
It needs to hurt bad enough to be just a little scary and remove any doubt as to the unified response of nato. The future of humanity may very well depend on it.
The minimum response required to ensure that no more missiles can go into NATO airspace, since Russia apparently can’t ensure that on their own.
One stray missile landing a couple of kilometres inside Poland, assuming it was even fired by the Russians, is nowhere near the threat level posed by the Cuban missiles.
Associated Press (western media) reported on Wednesday, sourcing U.S. officials, that initial findings suggest that the missile that hit Poland was fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile.
The Polish Foreign Ministry confirmed a Russian-made (important wording) rocket FELL on their territory. A S-300 was found at the scene, a missile that both Ukraine and Russia use, a missile made in the USSR when Ukraine was an independent Soviet Republic.
Russia has been repurposing them as ground attack missiles and Ukraine has been shooting Russian strikes down with S-300s.Ukraine confirmed 73 missiles out of 90, and 11 drones were shot down.
