They keep complaining about Nazis in Ukraine and point to the Azov Regiment. A group of no more than 2500 people in a country of 44 million people.
By that measure, Russia has justified the West's invasion of Russia to denazify Russia, because I can guarantee you there are at least 2500 actual Nazis in Russia.
By threatening and attacking countries that have literally no interest in russia he is making them hostile towards russia.
But I think that has more to do with a successful Ukraine being a threat to Russia, specifically the “Russian world” that perpetuates their system of dictatorship. That’s the real reason for this war, anyway. Putin doesn’t think Ukraine should exist and them actually being successful is like a slap in the face to everything Putin stands for.
Ukraine is the one fighting for its country (motherland as Putin says), & Ukraine is the one fighting for true independence from Russian rule and influence. This is crafted to confuse people that dont pay attention close enough to know the truth... because when both parties accuse the other or when both say the same thing --- what happens? People don't know who to believe so they remain passive & neutral.
When they are bombing cities & civilians... they accuse the other side of being the ones responsible. It spits in the face of the citizens of Ukraine that hes already bombed & tortured & raped & murdered --- that he then accuses them of it ... this twisted fuck deserves to suffer for this. Nuclear weapons & the publics fear of them have also been a catalyst to Putins feeling of being untouchable... because who is going to stand in your way when you have the ability to end mankind as we know it. That ability was handed to an ex-KGB agent that values nothing other than his own image as a strongman.
