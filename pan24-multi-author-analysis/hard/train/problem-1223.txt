At least you'll know well before your wheels fall off and have a chance to stop, unless you're a maniac and ignore your car shaking violently lol. With self-driving cars they could randomly kill you at any second.
Yet another reason that self-driving cars are trying to solve entirely the wrong problem. We should be revising our infrastructure so that cars are less necessary, not trying to lower the barrier of entry to driving even more than we already have.
I would venture to say that enhanced autopilot is probably OK too because it just adds lane changing and integrates navigation decision making on the freeway.
Commercial airliners have way more simple automated systems than a self driving car, and they still are constantly being updated and improved. This is with highly trained crew and intensely monitored machines that have been operating for decades. Tossing something complex and untested in a car for your average driver to play and saying “be careful” with seems borderline negligent.
Pretty crazy that they were able to ship a car with beta version of “Full Self Driving” is insane. Ridiculous the regulators allowed it and horribly irresponsible that the company did it, thinking that some fine print made it all okay.
