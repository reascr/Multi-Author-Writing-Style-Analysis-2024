We do have vaccines for H5N1 which have been stockpiled by a fair few countries, so we should able to start out on some action in advance.
So then why is the death rate of H5N1 50% if a simple flu vaccine provides protection? That doesnâ€™t make any sense. We would need an updated flu vaccine targeting H5N1, and that would take a year at least.
We do know how to make effective flu vaccines and H5N1 vaccines have been stockpiled for some time, but we can't say we know what the expected pandemic flu would look like.
Even so, an H5N1 strain only 10% as virulent as some current strains would probably still devastate the first population it hits. Lockdown and prevention would become a lot more black and white.
Among strains that have passed between birds and mammals, there are subtypes and these vary by location, time, etc. We can say that our current vaccine stockpiles (and new prototypes) could be effective against a future human pandemic version, but there's no guarantee. We could hit the jackpot and have it highly effective, we could find it mildly to reasonably effective like our yearly flu jabs, or we could find it utterly ineffective.
