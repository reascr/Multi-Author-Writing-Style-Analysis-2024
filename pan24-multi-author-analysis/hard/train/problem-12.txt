Unlikely to occur, thankfully, as the National Guard is less likely to brutalize protestors than the police these days...
Ironically, calling in the Guard probably DECREASED the risk of violence, due to how utterly borked police departments are these days, especially in Georgia..
I'm WHITE and worked as an EMT, and I don't even feel safe around many Police these days (I worked in a major city, and could trust the police there- bit the police in the exurbs are hyper-aggressive Good Old Boys...) They tend to be super militaristic, with a constant siege mentality outside the very best departments and a few good apples here and there...
National Guard, on the other hand? I was in Army ROTC and trying to JOIN them (original plan was to be in the Guard after grad school and work as an ENT, to get clinical hours for Medical School applications...) so maybe I'm biased. But would feel MUCH safer around a National Guard unit than a bunch of riot police as a protestor...
What’s funny is that the national guard made us feel a lot safer in some places in 2020. Their presence made the cops way less aggressive because they knew they were being watched.
I saw national guard subtly step between protestors and cops in a few times in 2020. And there were videos of some of them dancing and talking with protestors. I definitely felt safer with national guard around because they seemed to keep the cops more in line.
What’s depressing as hell is that it is safer for the public to have soldiers maintain order than normal cops. When soldiers have better de-escalation training than cops, you know you have a problem.
