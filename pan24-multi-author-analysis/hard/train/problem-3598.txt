Who’ll refuse to compete? The athletes from those countries who trained for years for this, or their governments who won’t allow the athletes to compete?
Yeah I’m sure cancelling the Olympics, and throwing all those athletes’ years of work down the drain, will help the Ukrainians so much. Just like my thoughts and prayers will.
If it’s something that can actually aid, arm and fund Ukraine, sure. But a boycott of the Olympics when the Russian national athletes already aren’t allowed to compete under a flag, anthem or representing Russia, isn’t going to accomplish anything.
Sadly, though, Russian doping scandals indicate that the country doesn't (respect the rules and Games participants).
If they didn't ban Russia post all their blatant doping and cheating, I would not expect the IOC to let something as small as starting the biggest war in Europe since WWII to stop them from competing.
Not only is Russia a belligerent country, they have a long long history of cheating and doping and almost certainly still are doping. If they let Russians in, nobody should ever take them seriously again.
