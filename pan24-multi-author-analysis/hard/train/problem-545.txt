Like, Stonehenge is a cultural artifact, but bread is more conceptual, since it's not the singular loaf that counts, but the cultural importance and craft around that bread.
Intangible because what's really being recognized is the idea of the baguette and the process of cooking one, which can be passed down through oral tradition, recipes, stuff like that. It's more the idea of the baguette. It's so importance in French cuisine and beloved by people all over the world. The idea of the French baguette has inspired a lot of art.
French people are very particular about their baguettes. Each french person eats approximately between 1/4 to 1 full baguette per day; bread is eaten alongside dishes at lunch and dinner, and as "tartines" for breakfast. And the french like their bread fresh, so many of them buy new bread every single day (either they buy a full baguette or half a baguette, or "demi-baguette").
Interesting for a food item that's barely a hundred years old... And like the croissant, Viennese in origin.
If you ever come to France, try a few bakeries, and sample their baguettes. You might be disappointed after reading all of the above - when all is said and done, it's still just bread, after all; and I don't know if it's the best bread in the world, as different breads serve different functions. But still... it's damn good bread.
A good french baguette has a crusty exterior and a soft plushy interior. It is at its absolute best when it is right out of the oven and still warm. But it is also excellent a bit later at room temperature, toasted with some butter spread over it, used to sauce a dish, to make a sandwhich, as a vessel for cheese, etc.
