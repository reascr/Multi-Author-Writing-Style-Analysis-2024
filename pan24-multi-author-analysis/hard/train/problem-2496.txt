Yes, the law does block direct or indirect ownership of residential property owned by Non-Canadians either personally, through corporations, or through other types of agreements. Seems like they've thought that part out and tried to close any potential loophole that could exist by using a corporation.
Basically, the first "Prescribe real property" refers to prescribed exclusion in the Regulation (See section 3(1) under sub-title "Residential property - exclusion" in the Regulation), while the same term in paragraph (c) is defined by section 3(2) of the regulation (Which applies the Prohibition to vacant land zoned residential or mixed use in the property census areas).
So if judges read this as literally as a computer would instead of realizing that the wording was messed up, every prescribed real property or immovable that subsection (c) was meant to bring into scope of the residential property definition is excluded, because a prescribed real property or immovable is of course not "other than a prescribed real property or immovable".
I think better wording would have been to strike ", other than a prescribed real property or immovable, that is situated in Canada and" from the beginning of the definition, and to add "situated in Canada" in subsections (a) and (b) after the first occurrence of "building" in each of the two subsections. Or, possibly, to keep the "situated in Canada" restriction in the beginning of the definition since it wouldn't make sense to purport to regulate any foreign property in this law.
It’s not a uniquely Canadian problem, the US sees the same thing, and no one here has seriously suggested a foreign home purchase ban because it won’t drive down prices (it’s mentioned that only 6% of BC is foreign owned) and will just drive foreign ownership underground through domestic intermediaries.
I'm not an expert on Canada and their laws, but you just prohibited foreign investment that would directly or indirectly lead to housing construction and wealth accumulation by Canadians. That assumes that foreigners are actually fully prohibited by law from buying and building houses, which might not be fully true, but that's what the title suggests.
