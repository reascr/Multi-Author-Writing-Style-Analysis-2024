"Hong Kong, China has been a WTO member since 1 January 1995 and a member of GATT since 23 April 1986.".
Yes there is. You need to have independent sovereignty to be a member of the WTO. Hong Kong used to be sovereign, and now they are not. I never said they needed to be a democracy, but China destroying their democracy proves that HK is not independent and therefore they deserve zero recognition under the WTO.
HK was allowed to keep its special trade status under the the condition that its democracy be preserved until 2050. China destroyed it a full 30 years early. China can not be trusted and now neither can HK.
Go on, ask China if HK is a part of China. The suit is made in China, so it should be labelled as made in China. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too, if China wanted HK to retain its special status then they should have kept their grubby hands off of it like they said they would.
China unilaterally taking direct control of HK makes HK a security threat. The WTO has zero jurisdiction over the national security concerns of the US.
