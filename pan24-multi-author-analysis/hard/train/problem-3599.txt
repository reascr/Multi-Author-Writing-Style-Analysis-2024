These rules didn’t apply to this wreck. The contents of the containers weren’t actually “hazardous” according to the law. Silly, I know. It’s not just Trump’s deregulation… it’s decades of Industry whittling down regulations.
EDIT: For clarity, I’m not defending Trump. He shouldn’t have repealed the rules. But THIS accident wasn’t his fault. It’s easy to blame Trump because emotionally it fits the narrative. But Trump’s deregulation is a symptom of longer trend by the GOP and (some) Dems under the thumb of big-business.
Remember that the GOP didn’t back the Rail union’s safety requests at all. And the Dems publicly backed the union only to hold a show-vote that ultimately stripped them of their right to collectively bargain. Neither party’s leadership supported the unions’ safety suggestions when push came to shove.
Hazardous yes but not hazardous enough to apply the brake rule. The whole system is broken is my point. You can’t blame Trump because he’s just one part of the whole regulatory clusterbacle.
You certainly can blame any and all parts of the "regulatory clusterbacle", especially polticians like him. Yeah he isn't solely to blame, obviously, but as a prominent mouthpiece for the ideology that is responsible I'd say it's fair to cast such aspersions.
Rather than blindly assigning blame or upvoting comments that align with our biases, we should approach complex issues with an open mind and a willingness to listen to all perspectives. Only by working together and engaging in productive dialogue can we hope to solve the pressing issues facing our society and our planet.
The safety rollbacks cited by the White House in response to the East Palestine spill are certainly cause for concern. It is important for government officials to prioritize the safety of their constituents, and taking steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future should be a top priority. Hopefully, the situation can be addressed in a bipartisan manner to ensure that the necessary safety measures are put in place to protect the public and prevent further environmental damage.
Sharp accusation against Trump admin hiding something in East Palestine. But throwing JusticeForEastPalestine tag on vague claims does little justice to the cause. Let's call for concrete evidence before jumping on the outrage bandwagon. FactCheckFirst.
