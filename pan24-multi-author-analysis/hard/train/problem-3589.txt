Florida as well. Our state minimum wage is already adjusted with CPI, but thanks to a referendum we're increasing it by a dollar a year till 2026 and then with CPI after.
Illinois has raised the minimum wage but officials in individual townships are allowed to opt out on the increases. They need to increase the federal minimum wage.
Year 15 of wanting a minimum wage increase over the federal in PA and not getting it. We're one of the highest COL states in the country that STILL continues to stick with the federal minimum of $7.25. And we have a state preemption in place for topics like this (or gun control) where local municipalities can't override the state law with a stricter or more advanced minimum. Every state surrounding us (including West fucking Virginia!) has a higher minimum wage. You'd have to go to such far-flung lands as Indiana, Kentucky, or New Hampshire to get an equal bottom floor. The last time we saw a boost was 2008. This is yet another example of our Republican-controlled state government hamstringing (rust belt) blue cities from improving themselves.
