Depends on the terms of the deal. From Israel's perspective, a deal like what Obama signed, is worse than no deal. So, if such deal is signed, there is a high probability that Israel will strike. But, there are terms that Israel would find satisfactory.
In a nutshell, strike or no strike is not function of deal or not, but function of how close Iran is to getting the bomb. I.e. if there is no deal or there is a bad deal, but Iran doesn't do sudden moves: then there is no strike. A deal can prevent Israel's strike if Israel is convinced that terms of the deal make it impossible for Iran to make such sudden moves.
That said, Netanyahu was always clear that he is willing to use military force to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon, if diplomacy fails.
Israel will be ready to risk an all out, devastating war to prevent Iranian nukes - if everything else fails.
Israel is a shitty neighbor because they don’t want Iran, which is a country that constantly threat Israel’s existence, to create a nuclear weapon.
Thus, nuclear weapons will be used, without a doubt, Israel will nuke Iran and won't even think twice if it means preventing them from achieving a nuclear weapon, there is quite literally nothing worse than a nuclear Iran for Israel.
Israel knows it doesn't have strategic bombers, it's pretty much guaranteed it developed a nuclear penetrator bomb to compensate for it.
