I agree 100% but idk I don’t think we should spread verifiably false info because that discredits the actual bullshit trump did.
I have fact checked this before and I thought that he did donate his salary for the first 2 years, with the last two years unknown? Lemme check and get back.
I’m not disagreeing with that at all. Just saying we shouldn’t spread verifiably false info. Just discredits the actual criticism (like grifting the SS w/ his hotels).
It only discredits the argument against him when people pull slanted logic that deviates from the argument at-hand.
And in this case, when we're solely looking at accepting or rejecting an accusation, we need to be particular. Don't give people an "out" or any wiggle room to act in bad faith.
The person you responded to isn't wrong at all. However, ensuring specificity with claims/accusations is incredibly important and the inability to do so just gives ammo to the other side that "These guys can't even make up their mind about this or that, the Whataboutisms and Ya but...s are ridiculous" etc.
