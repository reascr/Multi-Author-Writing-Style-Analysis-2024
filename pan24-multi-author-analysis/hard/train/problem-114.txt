“And that was the third porn star I cheated on my wife with, right around the time that I tried eating long pig with my good friend Epstein. Did you know we had a suicide pact?”.
"It was the best suicide pact. Nobody has ever seen a suicide pact like this one. People would come up to me and say "Sir, your suicide pact is the best, most powerful suicide pact I've ever seen."".
Yep. Thats what pisses me off to no end. Time and time again its been proven Barr has used his biases to influence the DOJ in an unethical way.
I mean he wasn’t wrong because his cronies successfully brushed the investigation under the rug. So who here is stupid? Trump who continues to test the limits of his corruption or us (America) for not holding him accountable? Im honestly not sure anymore.
If you ignore Trump for a second, this is blatent corruption by Barr and Durham whom are both government officials.
But the media, including left wing media, allowed him to go redemption tour to re write his history making appearances on every media outlet after he resigned.
