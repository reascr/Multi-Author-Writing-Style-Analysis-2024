I haven't interacted with any of them, as I live in Romania. But having minorities rights in all European countries seems to be what we should all aim for. I think there is a lot of misinformation in Ukraine - like refugees being astonished that in Romania there are Ukrainian schools.
Your all (you and the other fellow Ukrainians who commented here here down-voted me) attitude left me a very bitter taste. That is, after the initial shock passed. Fool me, I thought Ukrainians are... not like this.
Why should Kiev force its language on other parts of the country that don't speak Ukrainian? Ukrainian speakers are the majority in Ukraine but the country is not "theirs" to do with it as they please.
Ukraine is doing this to revive their own language in their country, I donâ€™t really see the problem in any of this.
I'm pro Ukraine, but I don't feel personally threatened by Russia so I'm less biased then most people here. If any other country did this, redditors would be all up in arms, rightfully so, but because it's ukraine doing it to its Russian speaking citizens, then it's OK.
The bigger fish to fry right now is the literal Russian genocide of Ukrainian people and culture, but let the Hungarian government cry about this I guess if it makes them feel better.
