Cool, I'll pass on your outrage to my Ukrainian friends who are frequently left without power, struggle to get food and have no income.
They'll be super fucking happy that you care about some protesters getting arrested because the majority of Russians are either too cowardly to resist or outright support the shitness they're inflicting.
Idk why but I’m imagining how daft it would be for the Russian gov to arrest Russians for paying any sort of reverence or attention to Ukrainians such as Khrushchev or Brezhnev, or idk a Georgian like Stalin? Is that anti-Russian?
I just think that Russians call anyone Nazis (namely fascists) they don’t like. Especially, those who said something bad about Russia. Ultimately, they justify to themselves why they are hating and killing people.
There were up to a million of Russians fighting alongside with Nazi Germans. I am not sure if Nazis really tried to exterminate Russians. They were ruthless towards communists and were truly exterminating Jews, Roma people, gay people.
