The really sad truth of the whole thing is, and Trump definitely knows it, he will never be convicted of any crime that he might get charged anywhere in the USA. That's because he has a Constitutional right to a jury trial and the process for selection in any court in this country will always afford him and his attorneys to have multiple Trump supporters seated on it, and he has conditioned them to be absolutely impervious to any facts that are critical of the big man baby.
All joking aside, I sort of recall Pelosi referencing some rule/law that actually allows Congress to send the Capitol police out and arrest someone in an instance like this and lock them up the Capitol's dungeon-like jail cell, but they never use it.
We live in a country where it is often said that no one is above the law, not even the President, but that's not really true for someone who enjoys the level of blind support that he does under our system of justice.
I've always though laws are only laws if you can actually enforce it, Trump has been testing the integrity of our justice system for a while now and so far I am not impress.
