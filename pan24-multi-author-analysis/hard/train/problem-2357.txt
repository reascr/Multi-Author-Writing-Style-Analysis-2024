Yes. The way most people talk about using insanity as a defense, not many seem to understand how difficult it is to prove to a psychiatrist that you were suffering a debilitating mental illness before you committed the offense. People who get found not guilty by insanity, almost always have a long history of psych care before the crime. You can't just decide after you commit a crime that you were insane.
I don’t think this is leading up to an insanity plea. This is an unhinged narcissist holding on to delusions of grandeur. He really has to convince himself that he’s special and he’s doubling down on it big time as the walls come tumbling down around him. Look at the NFTs. Most of us thought they were a joke but they were real. He sees himself as a superhero. This is extreme narcissism. The bigger question is why do so many Americans not see this and I believe that is because there are a lot of emotionally unwell people in America. Mental health here doesn’t get the attention it deserves and personality disorders are rampant. There are a lot of narcissists in America and they look up to Trump because he’s a public display of what they want to be. I’m an American by the way. There are still people here with empathy but often it feels like we are aliens on another planet when dealing with Trump supporters. They don’t understand us and we don’t understand them.
