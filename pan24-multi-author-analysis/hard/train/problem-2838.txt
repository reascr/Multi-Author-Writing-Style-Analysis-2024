Or just keep it going. It's like Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the point wasn't to actually find evidence, the investigation was proof enough that something was going on.
So sounds like you have a fake scandal over story wrote that the author wouldn’t put their name to spear headed by a disgraced lawyer with a history of lying and a connection to the Russian oligarchy under multi federal investigations for fraud. On top of all that nothing will ever come from the laptop. No prosecutable crimes were discovered and no DA is ever going to indict on any evidence from that laptop.
The laptop was gave to ghoulini. Who Is currently being sued for billions of dollars in connection to his other lies around the election. On top of the criminal investigation of his involvement with the fake electors fraud and his fraud guaranteed company and his American first campaign finance crimes with lev parnes.
Pretty much wasting everyone’s time and money, just so republicans have another fake controversy to get worked up for. Pretty much anyone pushing this bullshit all is a pretty terrible person.
