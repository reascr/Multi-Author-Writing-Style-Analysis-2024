Protected the rights of women, for example universal women's suffrage was introduced in 1934. Scores of women in parliament even in the 1930s. Introduction of latin alphabet and Turkish as we know it today. Free primary education. Modernisation. Pursued peace. Turkish war of indepence was last war under his reign. Normalised relations with Greece despite deep emnities, which is why the Greeks nominated him for a nobel peace price. Basically made Turkey what it is today.
This is what the Turkish public wants to see. Why do you think Erdogan is pushing the vote until after the elections? It's a close race between him and the opposition and he needs votes.
Turkish people want him to do this, that's why he's delaying the vote until after the election because polls show a very close race and he might lose the election.
If you're pro-democracy, why don't you respect the fact that Turkish people elected him and he's doing exactly what Turks want (because he needs votes in the upcoming elections)? Many of you "pro-democracy" westerners would actually suppory a non-democratic coup to replace an elected leader who won't do what you want.
Now Turkey still doesn't have a real democracy but is run by clowns and is regressing on Ataturk's vision otherwise.
The Turkish government is the only one claiming the PKK did that, and their credibility isn't great. They have a ton of motive to make it look like their military actions are somehow justified.
