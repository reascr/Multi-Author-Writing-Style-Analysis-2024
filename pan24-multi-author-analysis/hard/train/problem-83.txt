48% of Georgians are conservatives and will vote against a Democratic senate majority every time. Even if that means they're putting an incompetent lunatic into office. He could be relied upon to vote in lockstep with the GOP. That's all they cared about. It's why nothing broke through. You could have video footage of him throwing puppies off a cliff and they would have still voted for him. At no point was a Georgia Republican voter going to vote for a Democrat.
If a seat that was democrat goes Republican, it’s a stretch to say only republicans voted for the person. Even if it isn’t the case in this particular seat, there were democrats in New York at least saying they voted Republican out of protest.
I literally said it wasn’t the case here, but it was happening in the area. You hyperfixated on the one tree of this district when I was pointing out that your general idea of “blame the republicans for the votes” doesn’t work when new York’s redistricting made a bunch of areas a 45%-55% swing for either side, and yes democrats do vote for republicans sometimes because believe it or not they’re allowed to.
And so they flushed out all the independents, too? How are you trying to justify thinking nobody votes across party lines? No wonder the Democratic Party has no urgency to fix any problems in itself.
