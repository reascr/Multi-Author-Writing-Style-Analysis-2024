The hype came when people made their own copies (doge, etherium) and started speculating on the rate of change. Dirivatives, speculation, buying on fake moves and hype, the "iron hands" turning into "diamond hands" nonsense, etc. made it a roulette wheel, and that's no way to use a simple ledger.
The idea is to transfer some money to a new wallet for every transaction, use that wallet to pay for something, and never use that wallet again. Your money should be in the bank, not on the ledger.
I believe it will continue, and thrive when people forget about it. Remember, it's just a ledger; it has no monetary value.
This is what bitcoin was meant to help mitigate, but people turned it into a poor man's Ponzi scheme. When a regime changes money, or is replaced, your bitcoin would still remain the same. But that requires a stable bitcoin, which won't happen until the cheats and crooks are unable to move the price up and down at will.
Compared to this news the bitcoin is relatively stable. At worst it dropped like 50-75%, but not 90% like this article. So might still be stable enough when you really don't trust your government.
