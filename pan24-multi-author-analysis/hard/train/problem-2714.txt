She apologized for her wrongdoing and said that she wasn’t aware of Jewish stereotypes about money, which is unfathomable. It’s pretty clear that she realizes she was wrong.
You don’t have to see it. She admitted wrongdoing and is being kicked off the committee due to that wrongdoing. The 12 Jewish congress members who condemned her were offended by her remarks, and it’s really not up to any of us to say that they’re wrong.
So again, when I hear that 12 Jewish members of congress were so offended and condemned her statement, I just hear that they were posturing to stay on their good side.
If it does, will maga republicans support trump in 2024 or at least vote to censure him? I’m addition to ALSO saying that israel controls congress, trump has said way worse things about Israel and Jews, both while in office and post office.
To be critical of Israel is to be antisemitic, as far as AIPAC is concerned. They want the US to never question their actions so Netanyahu never has to worry about consequences of defying the UN over his humanitarian crimes.
Also her criticism of Israeli humanitarian crimes is more a pretext. The real reason is, of course, as a left-leaning Democrat, she is the enemy and the GOP operates entirely in bad faith and sees Democrats as an enemy to be conquered and destroyed.
