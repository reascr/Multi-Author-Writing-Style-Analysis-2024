I brought up MAD in another subreddit about the whole nuke situation and I got ripped apart about how Ukraine isn’t NATO and the treaty wouldn’t apply, yada yada ad nauseam.
You folks didn’t know shit about Ukraine a year before, while both Russians and Ukrainians have lost friends and family members there, families split apart both figuratively and objectively speaking,relatives killed, and im not taking about soldiers here, and NOBODY knows how to stop it.
People are different, some people are doing the best they can, helping refugees with food and clothes, money, transporting them out of the country through available borders, some provide funding for them, some donate to funds that help Ukraine refugees and army but you won't read it on /r worldnews cuz it is filled with Ukrainian war propaganda which is understandable. We have no power to stop an army in a totalitarian regime, but we're doing the best we can.
If you need motivation / guide look to history on how to fight authoritarian regimes. Maybe even Russian / USSR collapse might be illuminating.
And yet no-one but Russians can fix that, do something, anything. Things can change without violence, but apathy will change nothing. If you are not willing to do anything, nothing will change as no-one will do it for you.
