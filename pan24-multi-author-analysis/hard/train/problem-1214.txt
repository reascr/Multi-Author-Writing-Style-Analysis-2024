Not necessarily. There were plenty of "almost nuclear war due to a misunderstanding" during the Cold War. Having the UN as a glorified meeting table for the entire world has done wonders for the logistics of modern diplomacy.
Yes, in an ideal world, we can keep global "peace" without having to deal with 3 countries that have agendas that they would prioritize over peace.
The purpose of the UN is to make it possible to keep global peace. The US, Russia, China, etc, aren't going to take orders from other countries and would just leave, rendering it useless.
Right, because the UNSC should only have members who don't cause problems... such as... USA/UK/France/China?
Well the United Nations Security Council isn't meant to be the global police. The only way they'd ever act that way is if _all_ of the permanent members were in agreement (no vetos were used), in which case the decision would be safe to pursue with no major global conflicts arising from the decision.
You're never going to get a rotating assortment of nations enforcing their resolutions without the current permanent members also agreeing on them.
As you said, any controversial things which _might_ lead to big global conflict would happen outside of the framework of the UN Security Council. It would be via multilateral defence agreements or other kinds of treaty organisations.
