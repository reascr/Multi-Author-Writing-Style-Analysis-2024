What was actually said was far worse. He believes what Trump said was fine because he lies so much and suspending the constitution is just a fantasy of theirs.
In case the nuance was lost, Trump said the act of voter fraud terminates our rules and articles. The news reported Trump said because of voter fraud Trump wants to terminate the constitution. Dishonest reporting.
First, Trump didn't use the word "terminated", he said "termination". For a news story to quote a literal word that wasn't said defies the purpose of quotes.
Im not here to debate if Trump is right or wrong, if there was fraud or not. Im only setting the record straight and calling out fake news. Here is the tweet, read it for yourself.
No need to debate. I make no claims that he is right. If Trump is so wrong, why need to lie about what he said? If you fell for this lie, what other lies do you accept as fact?
Second, they are twisting what Trump tweeted. Notice the news doesn't show the actual tweet just telling you what to believe was said? What Trump said was voter fraud allows for the termination of rules, regulations, and articles including ones in the constitution. That is a far cry from claiming Trump tweeted the constitution should be terminated, and he never said "return to power".
