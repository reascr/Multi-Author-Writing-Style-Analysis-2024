There is a long list of Republican politicians who have been fostering hatred towards the LGBTQ+ community, for years before Boebert entered the scene, in fact the GOP has been working against gay and trans individuals theough both legislation (including failed attempts) and rhetoric so why is Boebert getting the bulk of the blame? Are we supposed to be distracted by the shiny bad woman apple? Like the GOP isn’t a party that priortizes the needs of straight white men?
Republicans are literally pushing women to death’s door through abortion bans, so while we bash Boebert, let’s try to keep in mind who is on control and who is setting the stage and dictating who is to be hated and who is to be approved. It isn’t crazy Boebert. She deserves to be dragged for her hateful comments, but the entire GOP needs to be turned into dust for it’s hateful agenda.
She calls these people degenerates and groomers, she was absolutely pushing hate in those tweets. The fact that you can't acknowledge that tells me exactly where you stand on this issue, and why you don't have a problem with any of this. There's plenty of people out there who are willing to take their kid to see a man in a dress and a wig, just because you have a hang up about it doesn't mean everyone has to accept your intolerance.
Just because you know some lesbians who don't like drag doesn't mean we should ignore politicians pushing hate and violence. Like, cool, you know some members of a minority community that "dislike" other members of a related minority community. That doesn't mean we shouldn't hold the people who hold the levers of power accountable when they propagate hate.
