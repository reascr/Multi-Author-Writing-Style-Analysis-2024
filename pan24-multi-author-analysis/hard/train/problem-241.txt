I am confused by your comment. Do you mean to say that if a legislature legalizes slavery the prosecuters should protect slave owners?
I think one reason that our democracy has been so reselient is that we have democracy allocated at so many levels. The prosecutors are acting within their right here prioritizing the cases their community cares about (which they have the discretion to do according to state law). If a community feels that their prosecutor is doing a bad job keeping their community safe they can elect someone else.
After all, if a community feels that their prosecutor is doing a bad job, they can elect someone else.
Shouldn't prosecutors follow state law, since that is their job? State laws are written and passed representatives that were democratically elected by the voters. In other words, state laws on abortion represent what the people of that State want. Prosecutors should respect democracy, and follow the will of the people.
Democracy does not magically lead to good government, good policies, and good laws. The opposite can happen. That is what the will of the people mean. If the voters want to bring back slavery, ban abortion, ban immigration from Asia, etc., we can, and it will be perfectly legal. Prosecutors and judges need to respect Democracy.
I am saying that prosecutors should respect and follow the law, because the law was passed by people democratically elected by the people. Why is slavery illegal? Because of the 13th Amendment. If we, the people, were to get rid of the 13th Amendment, and slavery becomes legal again, then the prosecutors should be protecting slave owners, because that is will of the people.
