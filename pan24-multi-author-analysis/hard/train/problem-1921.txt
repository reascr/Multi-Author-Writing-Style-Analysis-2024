The modern era would seem to support that the ability to build "Modern" Naval weapon systems was key. Today the West appears focused on building a carrier centric Naval fleet that can win a WW2 battle.
The US is investing billions in Aircraft Carriers, while China invests millions in ballistic anti-ship missles?
China has heavily invested in anti-ship missiles. Anti-missile defenses can only handle up to so many missiles before they are overwhelmed, and China has got the stockpiles to overwhelm them.
China may not have the ability to project across the globe like the US, but they can make it very hard for us to operate in their backyard. 24 hours into a conflict, the US would likely still be working on missile sites and air force bases/air defenses so they could actually move into the fight.
The USAF would only have limited bases to operate out of in the area, plus whatever support from carriers that are in the region. China would have access to its entire air force, and have much more anti-air defense in range of the fight.
