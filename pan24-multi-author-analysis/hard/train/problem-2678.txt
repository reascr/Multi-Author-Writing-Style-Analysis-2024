What would an investigation show? We already know there is a tesla factory in China... Does that create a liability in terms of blackmailing the head of twitter, spacex, etc - yes it does.
Doing an investigation assumes there is something hidden that we need to find. There is already a known business relationship and it’s not really about doing an investigation it’s more about understanding whether the intersection between a global market and geopolitical interests needs to be controlled.
If there is a problem with it make it illegal. Elon is just a scapegoat at the moment. Heaps more similar business relationships with China.
Same with China, he want access to the Chinese market and the manufacturing infrastructure. He is flirting with undermining US support for Taiwan with recent tweets.
Same with lithium, even if it is mined in Australia or Chile, it’s most likely refined in China, with 61% of the worlds lithium refining capacity.
But anyone looking for lithium or rare earth minerals in the next 5 years will need those two countries. The lithium might be mined in Australia… but it’s refined and turned into batteries in China. USA imports 95% of its lithium from China. That includes TESLAs need.
