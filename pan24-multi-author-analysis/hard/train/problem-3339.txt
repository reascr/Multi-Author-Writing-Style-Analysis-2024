Not to mention what the winter would do to the Russians in the battle field, they look well supplied for winter. Putin does not have winter supplies for all these soldiers. He thought it would be done in a week or two.
A week ago. Yet they only yesterday USA highest general said Ukraine should not stop until Russia is gone, and USA will make sure Ukraine can keep advances in the winter time.
All a "short truce" would do is give Russia time to regroup and rebuild its forces, and Ukraine currently has the momentum in their favor and truly has Russia on the defensive. That's what Russia is trying to do with this, and Ukraine isn't taking that bait.
And let's not forget, this isn't the first time Russia has pulled this sort of stunt, just look at Moldova and Georgia as an example, they aren't going to stop. What do you think happens to Belarus if they suddenly also decide to move towards warmer relations with the West? And other countries like China is keeping a close watch on the conflict as well, as they too also have dreams of imperialist expansions to neighbouring territories, and in fact have done so in recent memory, just look at Tibet. And we know they're really eyeing up Taiwan right now.
I'll be completely honest here, I don't care if it's considered uncalled for. Because to me, it really seems like that person doesn't think ahead on this issue, how wide ranging it truly is, what it'd mean if the West capitulated to Russia on this issue.
My country doesn't have any nukes, but I'd sure as hell want us to get some if that's the future we live in.
