While post natal centers are indeed popular among women, I don't think no non-birthing parent leave is main reason, considering way more women prioritize "government aid on post natal center fee"(roughly 75%) over "giving partner parent leave"(roughly 38%) according to.
I learned recently South Korea has post natal centers where about 75% of women will go to recover because no non birthing paren leave means that you’ve basically got to take care of yourself after giving birth. It’s usually out of pocket for them too which is unusual contrasted with the rest of their birth experience/expenses.
Could this be due to women seeing men as poor/non viable caregivers? Or because it’s considered a poor career decision for men to take the leave? Or cultural norms that mean women don’t want to be a burden to their partners, etc? Not trying to be a jerk but I know SK isn’t the warmest place to be a woman so I wonder if these aren’t part of the equation for them.
Can I ask if you’re a woman or mother? It can take between 6-10 weeks (or more) to truly recover physically from birth especially C section and I wonder if you could comment on gender norms about care and household chores, wondering if those wouldn’t factor into their decisions to seek respite elsewhere. Any idea how long somewhere like say, Samsung might offer for NBP parental leave? Is it considered a bad career move to actually take that leave? I know at least in Japan taking ur vacation is pretty much frowned on.
The report I saw was from a Korean woman living in Korea but this is an interesting perspective. What I understand is you’re sort of saying it’s like the plastic surgery phenomenon, where a cultural norm has taken hold and it’s a manufactured “need”. Interesting that there is a false racialized narrative about women’s bodies, western women are victims of a similar campaign that has led to inappropriate over-medicalization of birth mostly due to corporate greed.
