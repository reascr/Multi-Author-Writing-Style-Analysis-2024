It will be ages before the Taliban faces any serious opposition in their country, but these internal conflicts might plant the seeds for an eventual democracy movement (like in Cuba or Iran) sometime in the future.
There has been speculation for many years about internal rifts within Afghanistan's Taliban, but the Islamic extremist group that retook power over the country in 2021 has largely managed to act as a cohesive military and political entity. Its commanders and politicians take their orders from a powerful leadership council based not in the capital of Kabul, but in the Taliban's traditional homeland of Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan.
During the two decades of war with the West between the Taliban's previous reign and its current one, women gained a huge foothold with access to education and the workplace. Those basic rights have been all but erased in less than two years by Akhundzada, despite a huge international backlash that has seen the Taliban regime shunned by the international community.
Influential figures in Afghanistan, seemingly frustrated by Akhundzada's refusal to consider Western demands to restore women's rights in exchange for desperately needed financial support, have issued rare public criticism aimed at the supreme leader.
Behind this powerful entity is a reclusive supreme leader, Mawlavi Hibatullah Akhundzada. Since the group came back to power with the U.S.-led military coalition withdrawal a year and a half ago, he has issued a series of draconian edicts dragging Afghanistan back toward the stone age.
