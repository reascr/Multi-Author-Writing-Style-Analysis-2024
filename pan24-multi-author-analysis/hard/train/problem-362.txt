Tax cuts NEVER go to hiring workers. Hiring workers is a 100% tax deduction. Tax cuts does one thing, it makes taking money out of the company cheaper thus COMPETING with investment into the company.
Cuts don’t just make it cheaper to take money out of the company, it makes it cheaper to hold onto income for future investments if nothing immediate is available. It also increases foreign investment, which increases productivity.
This is a very simplistic view. Cuts change the incentives for certain hiring credits like the WOTC, which impacts hiring decisions. Cuts also raise the rate of return on new investments and raise the cash flow on those investments. They can also boost long term growth through improving productive capacity.
It depends. The expanded child tax credit certainly helped a lot more than that, and the doubling of the standard deduction did too.
The 83% figure is for the year 2026 when all of the individual cuts have expired. Why would you use that year specifically unless you’re trying to spread misinformation?
