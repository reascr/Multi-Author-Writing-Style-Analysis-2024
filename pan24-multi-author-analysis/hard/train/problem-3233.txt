They've also made public statements acknowledging that they're making bank selling gas now that Russia isn't getting lip service, and that it is important to make sure their donations to Ukraine reflect that.
No, but the more "real" answer is that Ukraine will somehow "pay" for it in other ways, such as offering contracts to European companies to do certain things in Ukraine etc. There's many nuances on why anyone is helping but reality is that nothing is ever free, it's a bleak view but that's the truth. Shell was already awarded contracts for gas or whatever resources they were supposed to process but had to pull out of Ukraine due to Crimea, so more of that will definitively happen in the future and once the war is over I can see Ukraine become very westernized due to huge European influence within the country after the war.
They are making so much from the gas price increases and the need for Europe to replace Russian gas, the Norwegian government has said that they want as much of that profit to go back to ukraine as possible as to not be considered war profiteering.
Whatever Norwegian grants that go to Ukraine will not have to be paid back but they might come with demands of anti-corruption work or pro-democratic goals being met but the situation is very different for Norway right now because of how much money is coming in from gas as a direct result of this war.
