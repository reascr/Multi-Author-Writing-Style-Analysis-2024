I debate the abortion issue a lot. People have, on several occasions, brought up the United Nations' take on abortion. I realize the United Nations and EU are obviously completely different, but the situation is the same for the language they use. Doublespeak to appease less progressive Nations. People will point out that the United Nations doesn't view forced birth as torture. And doesn't guarantee access in all cases:
"States parties must provide safe, legal and effective access to abortion where the life and health of the pregnant woman or girl is at risk, and where carrying a pregnancy to term would cause the pregnant woman or girl substantial pain or suffering, most notably where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or is not viable.".
Ty. Wasn’t it fine before? I mean, why is it better at 16 weeks rather than 10? Anyone would be able to tell they’re pregnant after 2 months, am I missing something?
According to most studies something like 1/3 women don’t even know they’re pregnant until after 6 weeks.
And the gerrymandered in officials are doing everything they possibly can to prevent us citizens ourselves from voting on it.
And now I live in a US state that bans abortion before 1/3 of women even know they’re pregnant. Through absolutely no fault of their own.
