That’s exactly a colleague of mine (who is an Emirati American) said. There isn’t any accountability in the Middle East as rich/royal family can get away with anything and everything. A good example is the murder of Khashoggi by MBS. It’s common place to do that and MBS was taken aback by the international uproar. Same way, Qatar has no clue that human right abuse and bribery are not every day occurrence in other parts of the world.
My only real problem is that it almost comes across like Qatar's biggest sin in this whole ordeal is that they bought the world cup through corrupt means instead of the gross human rights violations.
Bribery and corruptions exists in a lot of places but in Qatar its slavery and abuse of women and minorities in a huge scale. If a woman is raped she is jailed.
That is very purpose of the channel, have you heard a lot of criticism of Qatar by any other country?
Its like how fox news first started with good journalist and some opinion pieces over time once they got viewership they pivoted slowly and now is basically a opinion tv and not a news channel.
No, it was always there just that once the international press pool landed there is a spotlight on everything that is happening. In some ways glad the filth is shown, one of the most despicable kingdoms in the middle east.
