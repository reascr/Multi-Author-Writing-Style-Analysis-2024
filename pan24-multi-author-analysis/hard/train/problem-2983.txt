South America as a whole is %83 Christian over 439 million. Damn more Christian than the USA. So why aren't these Texas Christians welcoming them into their homes into their communities ?
Because S America isn’t Christian according to a lot of Texan Christians. Many believe that Catholicism is a cult, that they worship the pope, and other psycho shit (these are common Southern Baptist and Church of Christ beliefs). These fuckers actually go on mission trips to S. America to try and convert them to “real Christianity.”.
I would say most are 10x better Americans than the homegrown ones. Generally a strong commitment to family, taking responsibility, and busting their asses doing whatever jobs they can find.
Haven’t found the religious fundamentalist aspect to be true for most. Even for those who are: fundamentalist Catholics from S. America tend to be pretty left wing economically still (believing in the government not just letting people starve or be homeless— wow, that makes America sound bad). YMMV because most Venezuelans I know here in the US are almost straight up Fascist.
