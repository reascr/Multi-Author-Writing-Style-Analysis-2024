Satellite? How do you tell apart dead from injured or healthy, or even who is a russian body or ukrainian? What if the bodies are inside a building or under rubble or in a foxhole or in a forested area? What if it's a cloudy day? Sattelites don't see everything.
How would UK and US know the true numbers? They're not physically on the ground/frontlines counting bodies, - Ukrainians are.
And from what I've been gathering, those 500/day basically come from men "rushing" ukraine positions... not from defensive positions taking massive losses..
In the last 10 months, they haven't been able to bring that number up, and that is with massive losses on offensive attacks by Russians not by Ukraine offside attacks (as far as we know).
Considering that was probably the biggest hit Russia has taken so far (in lost lives in a building), it's probably not a repeatable number.
Given that Russia is invading Ukraine, raping, genociding, kidnapping, killing, torturing its people; yes, I want the death count as high as possible. That is going to bring an end to the war sooner rather than later.
