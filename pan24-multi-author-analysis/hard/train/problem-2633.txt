That's why Erdogan loves Turkish people in Germany. Here they vote for whatever provides social security, at home it is erdogan.
Sure, those exist. They are the good ones that - for whatever personal reason they had left Turkey - enjoy living somewhere else. I am not talking about those. They are usually older, smarter and liberal.
You get 2 votes to influence geopolitics and can use it for conflict. On a national view point that all makes sense but we don't live in national bubble, we live in a global bubble and our understanding of democracy should retled that. So, yeah... I think people with multiple nationalities should be given the chance to choose, but they shouldn't be given extra votes.
So you're in favor that a citizen living away from the country of their citizenship shouldn't be allowed to vote in that country's national election?
If they're under a work visa for a couple of years they only should be able to vote in their home country since that's where they will be returning to, they shouldn't be able to vote in the country they work temporarily in.
Whilst being an immigrant for 2 decades I chose to never vote in any election in my own homeland even though I had that right because in my view people who don't live there and don't have to suffer the consequences of their choice shouldn't be making choices for those who DO live there.
If your point in voting is to make things better, rather than the mindless tribalism that just wants to cast a vote for "my party", you're way more qualified to do that where you live than in a place you haven't lived in for years/decades.
