Let me do you one better, Hamas would not exist if not for the endless war crimes and oppression of the brutal Israeli Occupation. If Israel didn't exist, then neither would Hamas!
If you didn't want to imply that Israel should be destroyed, then maybe don't say so. Just a hint for next time - wouldn't want people to misunderstand what you are saying again.
Gotcha. So your brilliant suggestion for those wanting Hamas gone, a terrorist organization whose sole aim is the genocide of all Jews from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean, is for Israel to "stop existing".
What makes you think an independent Palestine without Israel would've been immune to the same kind of radicalization we see all across the middle east?
You said that in Israel's absence, a secular government would be in control just like before Israel; In real life, before Israel the place was basically a colony, and not controlled by the local arabs. If it was controlled by the local arabs, they would establish a country that's similar to Afghanistan today.
