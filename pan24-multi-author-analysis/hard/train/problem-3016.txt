Ask your coworker if he supports Kanye’s statements on nazis and hitler. Preferably in a group setting.
“Yesterday, you told me you really liked Kanye’s positions. He just said he likes Nazis and Hitler, what are your thoughts on that? What made you back a Nazi?”.
Edit: I asked my coworker about Kanye's recent statements about Hitler and Nazi's. He said that Hitler did do a lot of good. He created a lot of technology we have today and he brought the world together by being the bad guy. He also said that you shouldn't hate anyone, including Nazi's, and they're entitled to their free speech. Kanye, according to him, was just taken out of context and is a victim of woke cancel culture.
My coworker praised Kanye yesterday and told me it was proof that Republicans, and Trump, are not racist.
Well, a few black people I've conversed with on Facebook still support Kanye after he said Hitler was a good man today. Do they know that Hitler hated and murdered black people too? Like I get white people doing it. Those who do are just closeted antisemites who Kanye is giving a voice to. But black people? That's like being diabetic and voting to eat cake for dinner everyday.
