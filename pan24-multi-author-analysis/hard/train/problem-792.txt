Are you sure about this number? I was checking Wikipedia and if you introduce biofuels (which is burning gas that you have to grow as well) it's on 44% now.
And biofuels are like 10% of that 8-10%.. Its mostly burning trash and generating gas from waste food production.
Leave the reactors that exists on, maybe reactive old ones if they are save and commercially viable but building new ones is too slow ( especially in Germany xD).. And new reactors need longer time. Germany wants to reduce 65% co2 from 1965 to 2030. If they start building reactors nothing will change until then ( in the electricity sector ofc). In that time period PV got 50% cheaper and maybe 1-3 percent more efficient and wind energy got 20% cheaper and more dense in energy and Germany would have 50% more renewables ( and that with the building rate of the former government which was horrible)...
I think it was an approximation for this year that statistic is from 2020. First half year the electricity percentage of renewables was like 49% and in the 2nd half of the year germany will use less energy and this rises to 55%.. But it is just a forecast ofc.. A cold year and this number sinks .
But these wind turbines here are pretty old and bad. Mining the coal is the problem but tbh Germany needs the fossil energy to offset the missing gas..
And yes Germany needs all sources right now, due to current situation I'm even temporarily pro-coal. And it makes me sad .
