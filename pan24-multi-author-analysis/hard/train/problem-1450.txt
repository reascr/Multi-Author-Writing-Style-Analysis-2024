A plethora of targets, with a limited number of systems that can effectively outrange them. Most of Ukraine's artillery is the same stuff as the Russians are using. All told, the Ukranians have around a bakers dozen modern, long range NATO standard artillery pieces like the HIMARS and Excalibur rounds with very limited ammunition stockpiles for either. 99% of what actually makes up Ukraine's artillery is the same 70's era Soviet stuff that the Russians are using.
And besides, nobody really knows how much weaponry and ammo Russia really has, or how much of it actually works. Given the piss-poor state of their gear that was supposed to be maintained and combat-ready at the start of this war, one can only imagine the state of their surplus stock. Whatever hasnâ€™t been sold off to black market dealers, that is.
I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. Are you suggesting that Russia's military has been around for billions of years and has another several billion years worth left of munitions at the rate it's currently burning through them?
Thankfully a lot of the higher tech munitions need frequent maintenance which Russia can't do currently, hence why they're getting missiles from Iran.
It'd probably be a waste of limited munitions, Russia still has the S-400 which is decently capable, it doesn't make sense to fire missiles 500 miles into Russia just for it to be shot down. Russia also has a strong affinity for mobile launch vehicles so even if Ukraine's missile made it the 500 miles into Russian space without being intercepted, there's a good chance the launcher was evacuated.
