To over-extend the metaphor a bit, though... If you're at dinner and the kids are being obnoxious assholes and throwing things the correct is NOT for the adults to get up and leave. The kids will keep being obnoxious assholes and will eventually knock over a candle and burn the house down.
EDIT: To be fair, though, I'd love to just watch some older more "conservative republican" members grab some of the Q-crazies and sit them down and say "be quiet!" (to continue the earlier metaphor).
I 100% understand this position, and I go back and forth on whether I support it. I worry about how much damage a "remainder" republican party will do on the way out - but I think there's really no other alternative.
And if you listen to the people on the GOP, there are a lot of people that don't like the GOP either because they think the GOP is failing to pass the bills they want (which they aren't because the GOP is incompetent). If there is no conservative party in the US, there is still a conservative movement which is angry and ready to burn things to the ground.
