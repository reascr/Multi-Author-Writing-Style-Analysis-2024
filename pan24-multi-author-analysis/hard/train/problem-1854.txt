You missed my point. The fact that it takes a license to own a firearm in France makes it a privilege, not a right. Thus my statement that there are "no gun rights in France", only government granted privileges.
Did you miss the part where "Anyone wishing to hold on to their weapon (must) seek to obtain a legal permit" No gun rights in France, just a government granted privilege for the well connected.
>Anyone wishing to hold on to their weapon and join the ranks of France’s 5 million legal gun owners can do so if they seek to obtain a legal permit.
"Anyone wishing to hold on to their weapon and join the ranks of France’s 5 million legal gun owners can do so if they seek to obtain a legal permit.".
Yes. In big cities like Marseilles or Paris it's mostly gang related with more modern weapon or ex soviet stocks coming from Eastern european countries but in the country side lots of murder or aggression are made with these old timers weapon. It's not the same volume as gun violence in USA mind you but still.
