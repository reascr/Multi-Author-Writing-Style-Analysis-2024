They call them all pedophiles. Pedophiles are the lowest of the low so labeling LGBTQ+ people pedophiles makes them seem subhuman. Therefore killing them is ok because they're not even really human.
Killing people is not normal. Telling someone they should feel responsible for a murder is wrong. As a independent I also think it is distasteful when political parties try and use someones death to promote their ideologies. Violence and killing is wrong, shooters are wrong, period.
I think using innocent deaths to promote political ideologies is wrong. Killing in general is wrong, regardless of what your beliefs are. Creating martyrs and blaming large groups for the actions of individuals is Not Good. That is in essence how wars are started and I donâ€™t support it.
Please explain why half of the political population should feel responsible or guilty for the actions of radical individuals. Republicans are not collectively shooting everyone up. We are all individuals and we all have the choice to make our own decisions. The people that decide to take lives and murder have to deal with their own twisted decisions. Why help them out by sharing their burden. They were in the wrong and they should receive punishment for their actions.
