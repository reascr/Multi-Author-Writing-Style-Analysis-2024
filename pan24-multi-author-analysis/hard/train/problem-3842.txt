Nah, I doubt insurance companies want this. They don't make money by insuring high-risk drivers. All this will accomplish is raising rates for everyone else when their parents inevitably lie about them driving when the premiums become outrageously unaffordable.
Yeah and then the parents see the rate increase and decide it's better to lie about having a teen driver. Then little Timmy wrecks the car on the way to the coal mine and everyone else's rates go up to compensate. Saying car insurance companies want more 15 year olds driving is like saying life insurers want more smokers.
The real sin is that insurance is so freaking high and is not based on your driving history or if you took driver's ed but that you're under 25.
The real issue here is that they raised the age at some point in the past 30 years. I got my learner's permit here in PA in 1984 when I was 15-1/2.
When I was a kid in PA (45 years old now) you could get your learner's permit at 15, and take your driver's test at the age of 16.
Back in ancient times when I was learning to drive (late 80s), my home state of SC allowed 15 year olds to get a learner's permit and a day license. You could drive at night if an adult 21 or over was in the passenger seat. It became a full license at 16.
