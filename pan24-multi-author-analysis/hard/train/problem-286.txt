No, Mr. Yglesias doesn't actually have any logical arguments. Actually read the whole article instead of the first few paragraphs. Mr. Yglesias goes on a rant proclaiming that sending US steel to fix bridges will take away from building apartments (note there is no law that states apartments HAVE to be built with US steel and this bill only covers infrastructure)... or that people leaving certain jobs for other jobs (that might be paying more/better or just simply improves their life by switching) is going to hurt the economy; or that we'll see massive inflation. Mr. Yglesias is talking out his arse, he has no coherent or intelligent argument at all.
... not needlessly expensive. Our infrastructure is in the crapper, has been for decades now. Engineers have been screaming about how bad a lot of dams, bridges, electrical and other important infrastructure conditions are. The fact that this kept getting kicked down the road is why it's so expensive.
It’s going to result in increased costs and longer wait times for almost any decent sized project. As someone who manages federal funding on infrastructure projects, it’s already awful enough dealing with the existing bureaucratic layers.
The article is pointing out that bad policy will needlessly limit the amount of infrastructure we're actually able to build with this money, and that many of the projects will be heavily delayed for the same reason. He's literally calling for more infrastructure to be built and the headline reflects that.
