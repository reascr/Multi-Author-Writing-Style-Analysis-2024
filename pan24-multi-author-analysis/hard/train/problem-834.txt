I have had fantasies of a "Thanos snap" to make some corrections, but the problem is the people who elected her would likely pick another person as bad as she is.
No. You seemed to have missed it. You attacked redditors about not being keen on religion, and then talked about the importance of all lives, etc. The \POINT\ was marjorie three names hates Muslims so much she doesn't want to acknowledge the tragedy in Syria and Turkey since most of the victims are likely Muslim. She voted against expressing sympathy over the victims of the earthquake. At best you stood up a straw man that had nothing to do with my comment. If you were attacking Marjorie three names' bigotry, that didn't come through.
While Trump was in office, he promised to reduce the trade deficit. It soared to new heights before Covid. He promised to use tariffs to bring home manufacturing, and it didn't work. Ironically, because of the covid impacts on the global supply chain, more manufacturing will be coming home to the US under Biden.
You're correct. She can't tell the difference between Turkey as a country and Al Qaeda as a terrorist group. She puts them all in the same hate soaked bucket.
