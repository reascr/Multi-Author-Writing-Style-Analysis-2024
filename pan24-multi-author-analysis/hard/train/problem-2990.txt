Honestly folks, this used to be a party of ideas. But def no longer. Every time you'd think, "they can't get lower than this," they (the GOP) go ahead and prove me wrong. I don't think we ever end up with a one party system, but can't quite see how the future plays out; Dems and Independents?
Is he really the future of the Republican Party though? I havenâ€™t seen many in the Republican Party claiming that.
I wouldn't know what to call the Freedom Caucus anything other than a faction. That seems to be driving the Republican thinking In recent times, the progressive wing of the Democrat party has indeed grown, but it's been there for quite a while. They've never exerted enough influence to create the three-ring circus the Freedom Caucus has.
The Freedom Caucus will prevent the newly elected majority from actually governing. Instead of addressing energy costs and global inflation, their first order of business will be to set up a series of investigations, then block anything that comes out of the Senate, bi-partisan or not. Their playbook is a "rinse and repeat" play going back to Newt Gingrich's failed Contract With America. Look for them in late 2023 to shut the government down. The last time they pulled that stunt, it cost the government more than $50 billion, and they got nothing of any significance.
I would personally like to see the old Republican party, they've had some decent ideas. The new Republican party is bizarre at best. I blame the media for giving some of the dumpster fires too much oxygen.
