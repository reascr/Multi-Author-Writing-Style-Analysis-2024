I believe he is saying he is listening and possibly going to apply more pressure on the wealthy elite who enjoy western Europe and America by sanctioning them and their adult children. Like for instance we have and adult offspring of the upper class( Iranian government) living in New York.
I'll likely be downvoted for this, but....America can do a lot to help the protests by putting sanctions on the upper class in government who enjoy/Live in Western countries as well their kids and freezing assets abroad. This is actually what a lot of Iranian commentators have been calling for from western countries. I'm actually glad Biden spoke up about this, now it's time for him to take action.
edit: note that I acknowledge in my post that Biden does indeed misspeak. I've received the same response a dozen times. You don't need to tell me Biden misspeaks because, and this is the part I want you to read carefully, I acknowledge that Biden misspeaks.
Love all the people blindly defending his words instead of admitting that every time Biden speaks he “misspeaks” or doesn’t make any sense. He’s fucking old and SHOULD NOT be president. Words matter. You can’t say “we’re gonna free Iran.” You don’t have to defend him just because he’s democrat.
Biden, America or anyone else doesn’t have to “free Iran” … they just have to stop lining the pockets of these Ass holes. They just have to condemn them for their atrocities. Otherwise the blood of innocent kids will continue to run in Iranian streets and the thugs will continue to squash the resistance as they have many times before in the past 43 years.
