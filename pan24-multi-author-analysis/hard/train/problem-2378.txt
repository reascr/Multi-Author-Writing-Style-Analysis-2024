This ban is for government-issued work phones, not for the average consumer. Government employees can still do what they want with their own private phones. This ban does not stop anyone from using TikTok with their own personal property, so really no reason for the Chinese government to even care about it.
I thought that the U.S. banned TikTok on government devices a while ago. It is Canada that did it recently. Either way, it's a hypocritical statement from the Chinese government, considering that virtually every non-Chinese app is already banned there.
This an absurd statement on its face and the exact same one that China is making (both explicitly by “chiding” the US, and implicitly through their own far more extreme censorship).
At some point it's going to become direct bullying but by that point China will probably be impossible to stop.
Thanks Richard Nixon If it wasn't for him we probably wouldn't be dealing with this bullshit from China right now. Even dead, that asshole is still fucking up this country. Thanks, dick.
