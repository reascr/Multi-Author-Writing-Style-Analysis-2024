Seems like too many caveats which leaves things open to interpretation. Just make it a law or don’t and move on to figuring out why the documents were able to be handled so poorly in the first place.
“President must have logs kept of all interactions from the day they are certified as the winner of the election, until they die.” Is my actual stance on this matter.
Bud, if I can come up with 3 easy questions about caveats, what do you think our friendly, fascists-in-training political party (GOP) will do to obfuscate laws? This has been the whole reasoning behind my posts… If you add caveats, you open yourself up to exactly the kind of questioning I presented… And I assure you much more powerful, well-funded organizations could take any caveat and bend it to their advantage.
Perhaps the real question is why aren’t we all outraged at our classification system allowing such poor handling of sensitive material?
Some of us have been outrage for a while about how over used the classification system has been abused unnecessarily, lump it all in and maybe we get some improvement.
