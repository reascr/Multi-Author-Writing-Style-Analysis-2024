"Let them think we are all such mincing dandies. Then, when they are lulled into comfort, we strike!".
"... When the spectre of nuclear war was raised, Russia chose the more honorable option of retreating rather than risk the horrors of such a war.".
Which is already happening. Ukrainian forces are now not even 7 miles outside of Severodonetsk. If that falls or is even rendered useless as a major hub because of front line combat, effectively the entire Luhansk Oblast falls, and Russia becomes dependent on only a handful routes to keep the entire invasion force manned and equipped, something that becomes easy to prey upon.
The loss of Kherson is a symbolic loss for Russia, but the loss of Severodonetsk will be strategically a catastrophic loss, and very well may be what loses them the whole war.
Well the biggest part is the day Ukraine was part of NATO is the day Russia loses all interest in stepping foot anywhere near it militarily. They'll need to resort back to tearing it down from within via fake news and puppet politicians. But that will take a long time to work as the memory of what they've done won't fade quickly.
