Again, I’m not justifying the invasion or anything that happened after. I’m just saying that both sides are trying to simply something that should not be simplified.
Also, I’m not against small studies, but if you click to look at the studies in the url you shared it goes to a German 404 error page. Also, I would imagine that the National Agency of Ukraine for Civil Service would probably have more reliable stats rather then a graduate student calling 1200 random Ukrainians from a UK based phone number. If I was an ethnic minority and someone called me to ask my status for “totally educational purposes” what is my incentive to not lie and say I’m part of the minority (why make myself a target?)?
Due to the complex history of the area, the “some Ukrainians” that you are referring to would probably not consider themselves Ukrainian. They would mostly likely consider themselves Russian, speaking Russian, on land they believe belongs to them.
The Russian Federation, which is only 31 years old - has no historical right to claim Russian language speakers abroad are under their jurisdiction. It is fucking absurd.
Yes, Ukrainian is the official State language, but that doesn't mean Russian is being banned. Eastern Ukraine is mostly Russian-schools, Russian-language signage and Russian-language daily life.
But let's assume the 98%+ of Irish that speak English all democratically decide to change that somehow. Why would the modern UK invade a sovereign country with an EU Military Defense Pact, simply because they speak a different language?
