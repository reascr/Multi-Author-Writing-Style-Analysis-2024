You can’t initiate any other legal process without dating your documents where required either… its not like thats a new phenomenon. Imagine going to the bank and being upset they wouldn’t cash your check because you didn’t sign it or put the date on it.
Secondly you can’t overturn something that hasn’t happened yet. Biden was not the president until the results were certified.
Whether you approve of Biden or not he is 1000% correct. Democracy is at stake and if Republicans take over we WILL lose our rights. You can bank on that. Yes inflation is high but it’s corporate greed causing this high inflation. Product availability is better now but corporate is still using pandemic excuses to keep prices high while they make record profits. Republicans have no plans to reduce inflation- reduce crime - they just want power. They continue to blame democrats for what they know was actually caused by a president who totally ignored a pandemic allowing it to fester to the point where we had to shut down and to this day Trump continues to encourage the divide he is responsible for in this country. It’s a long road to recovery and republicans are not the solution - they are the problem.
