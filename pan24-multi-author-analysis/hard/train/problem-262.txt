My friend and I are both in healthcare in Florida, so we get updates from the department of health whenever they have to send out newsletters or information packets. Yesterday we got one while she and I were in a call and it was about essentially thinly veiled threats of ramifications if we did not tell people that the vaccine is dangerous to take and that patients should do basically anything else instead.
Well, being one of those people, I can tell you that we got flu shots (as did our loved ones and the healthcare workers who interacted with us, somehow without a fuss), were extra germ-cautious, as were our loved ones (somehow without a fuss), and masked when appropriate.
-The flu is far less contagious than COVID and is typically symptomatic when contagious. COVID is almost as contagious as measles or chickenpox, two of the most contagious viruses for humans. COVID also can present as an asymptomatic infection while being contagious, thereby not alerting others of the danger.
However, comparing influenza to COVID is a false equivalency in terms of the pathogen. They are two different viruses with different contagion rates, medical complications, and mortality rates.
