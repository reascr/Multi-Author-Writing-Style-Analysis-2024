Serbia denies that Serbian citizens were involved in preparing military actions aimed at destabilising Moldova up to the overthrow of power, as stated by the President of Moldova based on data transmitted by the Ukrainian special services.
He added that Serbia cannot but react to this, because the appearance of such information harms the country's reputation, and the participation of Serbian citizens in armed conflicts abroad implies criminal liability.
Secondly, by saying things like "Ofcourse Serbia will help Russia", one is artificially pushing them towards Russia by creating sentiment among the pro-EU people that Serbia is "bad".
Yet the intelligence of two non-EU countries is accepted as accurate on a mostly-Western platform and is used as an excuse to insult Serbs and incite hatred. And then you ask yourself how it pushes Serbia towards Russia.
Are Serbs driven into the arms of the EU and away from Russia by the actions of non-Russian countries?
The two countries with the intelligence that has been spoken about, Moldova and Ukraine, are not EU members. Pretty wild that Serbia can be be driven away from the EU and into the arms of Russia by the actions of non-EU members.
These types of generalizations are completely unhelpful and only serve to drive Serbs away from the EU and towards Russia. Obviously the government of Serbia would not be involved in this type of plot, the risks would be far too great even if they felt inclined to do so. However, it's no secret that a substantial of the Serbian population has a pro-Russian sentiment and thereby serves as a potential recruiment pool for Russia.
That does not mean "Serbia" is helping Russia, it means some Serbs may have been recruited by Russia. Big difference.
