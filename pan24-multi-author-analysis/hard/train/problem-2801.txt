What you're describing isn't criminal. It's administrative, so you wouldn't hear about any repercussions. The PPP program is well known to have been replete with fraud, but that's different from tax fraud. The PPP loans are regulated by the SBA, not the IRS.
Oh, I know how they do it. I'm a tax professional. I'm just saying the part of the code you're referring to isn't a "loophole", it's a legitimate strategy with very real consequences. The fraud comes when a taxpayer lies on their return, not from the advice or direction of the tax professional.
The same handful of fraudulent “finance advisors” like tax attorneys, accountants, CPAs, etc. seem to figure out these elaborate schemes, and then it gets circulated through friend groups and other social circles.
I’ve overheard quite a few conversations where people shared a tax evasion scheme, most involving somehow manipulating their “small business” for personal gain, where the person doing the talking did not share the source “to protect them” but freely shared the details of the scheme for others to follow.
