The reality is that both sides have done awful things and, if given a free hand, will continue to do horrible things. We shouldn't be funding either of them. Violence will cease when both Israelis and Palestinians love their own children more than they hate each other.
The only path to peace between Israel and Palestine is if they both stop trying to kill each other. Supporting Palestine shouldn't mean condoning their worst actions, but all too often it does.
You keep saying what support of Palestine shouldn't be. But you don't seem to be offering actual alternatives beyond vague platitudes of building them up.
You do understand there isn't a binary option of stop Hamas and let Hamas bomb them right? The illegal settlements in the West Bank doesn't stop bombings in Gaza.
I haven't seen a progressive support Hamas or their objectives given their objectives are genocide among others.
Supporting Palestine doesn't mean supporting Hamas. Criticizing the Israeli military doesn't mean supporting Hamas.
