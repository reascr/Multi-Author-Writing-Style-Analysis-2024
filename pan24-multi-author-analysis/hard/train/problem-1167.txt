Not to mention the issue of Ukrainian civilians, including numerous children, kidnapped to Russia and scattered. Getting the land back won’t bring them back, and I don’t think Ukraine is going to tolerate throwing them under the bus for Crimea.
Or maybe the vast majority of Ukraine citizens don’t want to negotiate and want to take back their land and get security guarantees from Europe and the US so they don’t need to do this again in 5-10 years.
I could see one depending on what Ukraine would accept, as I don’t think the rest of the world (especially Europe) wants this to continue and potentially turn nuclear.
“Breakaway” regions return to Ukraine, though potentially act as some de-militarized zone without any formal EU or NATO bases.
Annexed Ukrainian territories must be returned back to Ukraine including Crimea, Donbas, Luhansk, Donetsk and KRASNODAR, yes Krasnodar region was part of Ukraine before USSR. Look up maps of Ukraine year of 1919.
Russia would have to keep Crimea. I don’t see Putin surviving if Russia has to give this up, and putting a man with thousands of nukes in a nothing to lose situation would be risky.
