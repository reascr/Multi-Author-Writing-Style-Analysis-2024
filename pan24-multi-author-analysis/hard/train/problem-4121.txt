That’s because Dems lost the senate and McConnell was obstructing. The senate will continue supporting Biden but we’re likely losing the house so there’s a lot less Biden will be able to do anyway. It has nothing to do with if Biden runs or not.
There might be a slim chance Biden can pull that off this term. This election showed that Americans don’t want extreme right-wing politics, they want centrist politics. Lastly, don’t associate the actions of rogue citizens who believe in extremism with those who sit in congress. Most DC republicans don’t stand for any violence. Yeah, most. Not all.
The problem is, no one young is capable of compromising. The government is supposed to be bipartisan and Biden was and is the best guy for that.
I agree that DC republicans are far more willing to do nothing than do something, though. We need to wield the popular vote and majority of people who support our agenda against them. Force them to work with us or they will lose seats.
We have a 50-50 senate (51 at best) and the GOP will control the House. No young democrat can wield that Congress. They are too progressive. Biden can wield it.
