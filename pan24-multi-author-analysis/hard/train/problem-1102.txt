At some point claiming elections were "stolen" without offering any proof should be considered a criminal offense, as it is a direct attack on American Democracy.
Well yes, because their leaders and Right Wing media networks are constantly lying to them about the accuracy and legitimacy of our electoral systems.
Then the GOP politicians and media outlets repeat fraud, which just reinforce GOP voters to not vote.
Not even, they've been told it's rigged so much but their people they're probably not voting which leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy.
I think the “our voters aren’t voting” line is just ANOTHER way for the Faux News crowd to claim that they SHOULD be winning. It’s easier than addressing the fact that they are out of touch with the voters, that they only win by gerrymandering, that they have only won a single popular presidential election in the past eight. It’s their ‘silent majority’ nonsense all over again.
I cannot speak for the entire country but here, in my slice of Wisconsin, the GOP are out to vote in numbers as high as I’ve ever seen.
