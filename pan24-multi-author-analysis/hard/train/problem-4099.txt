The way I see it, America doesn’t need to intervene here. We just need to wait and Iran’s current regime will fall to a popular revolution by the end of the decade. Intervening now will just give all of Iran an enemy to rally against.
The best thing we can do is keep protesting globally, sharing social media from Iran of what is happening on the ground there. It doesn't hurt to call on any of your reps to publicly denounce the mass murders of protesters. The best thing to do is anything you can.
Inaction/thoughts/prayers only help the oppressor. Sharing what's going on in Iran, and sharing the social media of protesters, are all good ways to help from overseas.
I can also direct you to the Iranian activists and accounts to follow if you want to stay informed. Instagram and social media is how we are primarily spreading information. People to follow are Tara Grammy, Nazanin Nour, Nazanin Boniadi, and Masih Alinejad. Accounts to follow are @middleeastmatters , @iraniandiasporacollective, and @from_iran .
There are also protests every weekend in dozens of cities all over the world. They usually occur Saturdays and Sundays. If you need help finding one, let me know or PM me where you are and I’ll do my best to find one for you.
You can also contact your representatives to speak about the human rights violations. Furthermore, ask them to sanction individual members of the regime and their families, similar to how we sanctioned individual Russian oligarchs for Ukraine.
