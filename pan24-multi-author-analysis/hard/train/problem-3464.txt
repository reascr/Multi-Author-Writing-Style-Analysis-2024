I have to say one of the nice things about reddit forever ago was you had a lot less jumping to conclusions/pushing narratives/wishful thinking stuff.
We just had a balloon, suddenly we have more floating objects. They're also balloons. It's not aliens. Ignoring all the usual issues with that, the idea that we just coincidentally shot down a balloon and then aliens used a balloon like object to "do whatever" which they also didn't react to getting shot down, is just not even worth considering.
I wouldn't even rule out the possibility that the whole alien saga was invented by the US military or secret service to cloak experimental planes and balloons.
My two cents on this is that I donâ€™t believe our current technology would easily pop out alien airships that defied everything we know from physics and at least our current capabilities to come to our planet to float around in the sky.
Plus if they're advanced enough to travel across light years of space to come to earth, they definitely won't be using balloons that the US can shoot down to observe earth.
