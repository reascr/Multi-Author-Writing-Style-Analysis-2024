The dollop did a hilarious about this. I don't expect you to watch the whole thing for an explanation. But they are essentially a ball that fathers escort their daughters to. There they have them swear their virginity to their future husband's. They put on this whole ceremony and they essentially "marry" their fathers until they can be given away to their future husband. It's real creepy and sort of incestuous.
It is so weird indeed. Can I just say that I really don't so understand why so many guys seem to want a virgin? They act like it's some great thing to have sex with a girl who is a virgin, and it really isn't lol.
You have to be extremely slow, it's painful for them (and not in the good pain way lol), it's bloody, and they are also likely young or in some way inexperienced--meaning they have no idea what to do to their partner, no idea what they even want done to them, and it just comes off as plain predatory to me when an older guy wants a virgin.
Leave the first times to the youngins, I want a real damn woman--an experienced, older woman who knows what she wants. Nothing better haha.
