7th century values created by warlords of that era and espoused by warlords of this era, are considered perfect god's words, they will stop at nothing.
How can we dilute the utterly horrible behavior of Taliban by deflecting attention to someone else?
I'm blocking you because I have zero patience zero time and zero sympathy for Taliban apologists. If you like the Taliban so much move to Afghanistan and join them. If your family makes an attempt to hire me for your rescue mission I will turn them down no matter how much money they throw at me.
P.s. the Taliban were giving Safe Haven to the man who organized, planned and funded the 9/11 Terror attacks. The fact that you can't answer that question tells me everything I need to know about you.
I knew that you weren't going to answer the question which is exactly why I asked it. If you can't follow directions and answer a simple question with a yes or a no then you aren't worthy of a conversation with me and you're certainly not worthy of my time.
