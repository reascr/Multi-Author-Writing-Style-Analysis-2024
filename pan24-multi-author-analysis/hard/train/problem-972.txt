Goldwater is what conservatives used to be. His institute up until Trump decided what was and wasn't conservative.
Ducey backed Taylor Robinson who would've completely clobbered Hobbs. So did Jan Brewer, KTAR, and basically everyone but the insane arm of the GOP in AZ.
Strong fiscal values, strong economic outlooks, BUT ALWAYS willing to compromise if it valued its constituency.
Kari Lake literally only has newscaster/anchor on her list that's IT. Further it was pretty clear she flipped sides to try and find a pension post her anchoring days. Now she's unemployed! .
Yep. I could never agree with a conservative, but I can respect the principled ones who are willing to compromise. Despite being solidly on the left side of the political spectrum for life, I firmly believe we need other points of view, and corrupt/maga conservatives are denying actual conservative viewpoints to our entire country.
I lived in AZ for years and I still have friends and family there. Goldwater's influence is still strong there, and he fucking hated these sleazy, maga-style types (yeah it wasn't called maga back then but these people have been around forever). I was not surprised that Arizona went blue in this era- they're not less conservative than other flyover states, but they're differently conservative. Much more integrity than the conservatives I've lived with and worked with in the south.
