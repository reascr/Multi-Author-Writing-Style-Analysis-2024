In the US, we deal with this in part by funding things like special visas, workforce housing, expanded medical care, and school programs for migrant families. It would be much better if we had a more sustained and consistent social safety net, but this way do make sure families are being cared for even as workers move around. We’ve also passed some pretty intensive legislation on hazard pay and workplace safety for things like extreme heatwaves and wildfire smoke.
Honestly, it’s not even just attracting British workers. Crop harvesting is serious skilled labor. The speed, strenh, muscle memory, and attention to detail you need is nuts, and the conditions are hazardous at best. Many folks would love to pretend otherwise, but you want skilled, seasoned workers for the gig.
A lot of these guys are highly skilled, see it as a trade and are perfectly happy with the work. The U.K. is just another location before they work some places on mainland Europe.
There is an EU-wide payment scheme called CAP. It was controversial in the way it worked but ironically, the U.K. post-Brexit scheme is now under threat despite farmers being convinced they would be better out of the EU. It’s not enough though in any case.
Yeah also that. But also fleeing for a warzone, famine or disease. Some kids didnt have their parents, so it was hard for them to know when they were born.
