Trump's sphere of influence after the midterms is only now seen with far right people and I feel even with them he is split with DeSantis.
The insane seesaw with Trump has always been that he motivates a lot of angry, poor, stupid people- but alienates pretty much all the medium- and high-information independent voters.
They definitely had written him off, but Republicans developed a seething hatred for the guy which was most definitely amplified by Trump. I've always had the impression of "Bush was so bad that he gave us Obama" fueling a lot of that.
Anyone here remember how George W. Bush went from the most patriotic, bright and shining example of modern Republican values until it became clear that his total incompetency lead to the election of a black President? And then suddenly he became a traitorous, shining example of a modern RINO when Trump got the nomination?
Anyone that would vote for Trump again, after all we know, saw, if he won the nomination in 2024, is however in a cult. You can't just say well, he's on the Republican ticket. Not if you truly put country over party. I'm not saying you're in a cult and automatically assuming you'd vote for him. Talking more in the general sense.
