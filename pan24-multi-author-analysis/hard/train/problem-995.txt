They all skipping that part and only reading the Abortion at 33wks and looking at it from the perspective of US and EU law.
"Justice Singh further noted that in Indian law, it is ultimately a mother's choice whether or not she wants to continue with her pregnancy.".
This is not true. The youngest preemies to ever survive have been 21 weeks. Beyond those special few, survival rates at 21 weeks are exceedingly low. Even 24 weeks is still dicey. The gestational age at which most infants will survive if born then is 26+ weeks.
Viability is more than "will the fetus survive birth". It includes consideration for quality of life. It sounds like the private details being kept from us suggest that the quality of life in this case won't be very good at all. It might even be downright cruel depending on circumstances. We just don't know.
I'm pleasantly surprised at the law being so favorable towards the born adult.....meanwhile in the States if you're a ten year old girl who was raped, you can't get an abortion in your state when the fetus is a blob...(the girl got it, but in a different state at her parents' cost.).
Yes. Too often people forget that not everyone CAN provide, and that no child should be born to suffering just because someone says "well, they COULD be ok" or because of "well, she had sex".
