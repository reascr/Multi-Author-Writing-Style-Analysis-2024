- Nobody in Britain watches John Oliver's show or gives a shit about who he is - he has practically no profile in the UK.
But us stupid Brits only watch trash reality and celebrity panel shows, meanwhile we apparently have huge demand for John Oliver which is neither last time I checked.
I'm not showing you anything, if you care that much go ask any British person outside of reddit who John Oliver is and you will quickly have your evidence - or just Google 'is John Oliver popular in England' and save yourself the time.
Sorry I feel like I have struck a nerve or something because you seem really upset right now. You are presuming far to much about a country you know nothing about. I never commented on his comedic abilities - I just said nobody in the UK watches him or cares about what he thinks - which is a fact. Its hilarious how you think you know my outlook on life based on a single reddit comment but it's even more hilarious that you think a comment about the queen being dead would bother me. You just proved you don't really know anything about brits with that comment lol.
Most people in the UK haven't a clue who he even is. Like how you probably haven't a clue who Nick Ferrari is.
I know Nick Ferrari. He's like a Rush Limbaugh, but probably more popular. If the UK populace can be judged by TV andradio viewership, then you're just a bunch of chavs watching reality TV and conservative news. No wonder conservatives win all the elections.
