I specifically remember having already gotten a raise to that much then being told there would be no raise for people already making that much since we "already earned it". Like, no. I worked at that god awful job for months to get a raise, just pretending like the new minimum wage is the same is bs. Of course we all had to "earn" our raise again out of minimum wage.
You can’t argue for $25/hr minimum without arguing that all wages increase at the same rate. Unskilled labor at 25$/hr doesn’t feel right when you get payed that for skilled labor in many parts of the country.
Even in the most labor-intensive industries, labor doesn’t account for more than 50% of the product cost. Even if wages increase by double, the price is only going to rise somewhat because wages are only a fraction of the cost. As long as we don’t allow the companies to collude for a record profits like we do currently, then wage increases can never out run product costs. There is no product whose cost is more than 100% based on wages.
You're right, that would require a wage of at least 100k/year. All I want is at least 2-3k/mo to live relatively comfortably. Is that so hard???
