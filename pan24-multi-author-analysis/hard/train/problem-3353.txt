You're just straight up incorrect. It was clear in this case: He worked at the company for two years, then was fired, and immediately filed a lawsuit. The reasons for his firing haven't been made public, but the timing and subsequent lawsuit sure would make it seem like it was related to him wanting overtime pay.
It is against the law for companies to waive employees' rights to overtime pay via contracts (day rate pay does have a possible exception if it meets the requirements to be considered a salary). It doesn't matter what a contract says regarding overtime: An employee is legally entitled to it.
Because if you're non-exempt, you get overtime pay. It doesn't matter what you're told. That doesn't trump law.
I don't understand the ruling here. Can someone Explain it like I am 5 years old? So if someone is paid salary, but works more than 40 hours a week. Then they get overtime?
Hell yeah give him overtime pay. Yeah they make a lot, but it's a job where any day you could literally die. One of the most dangerous and isolating jobs out there.
