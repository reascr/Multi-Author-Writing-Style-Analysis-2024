I’m 100 percent sure its there. Its so blatantly obvious to everyone. Pretty much every allegation against this man can be proven but no one wants to hold him accountable. WHY??
No it isn’t. It happened he incited it he did nothing to stop it snd he has told multiple lies about it since. It was his god damned name on the flags.
Um, treason? Isn’t just what he said that day, its what he did and didn’t do. Even if it wasnt his plan he still did absolutely nothing to stop it. So um, yeah, treason.
I hope they have the evidence to charge him with Treason, that would be fucking great. Unfortunately I don't think the evidence we have seen is enough to convict him with Treason in a legal sense.
On what charges? Listen, I despise the guy and want to see him prosecuted for his crimes, but if there's evidence he did more than hold a shitty political rally on Jan 6, we haven't seen it. I'm not defending him, but I am defending the committee and the DOJ from armchair prosecutors who think they have an open-and-shut case because of a clip of Trump saying "fight like hell.".
Cmon. You can't seriously think this isn't all just political dinner theatre. Someone leaks something, the media chases that carrot, the public is spoonfed what they're supposed to believe. Rinse and repeat.
