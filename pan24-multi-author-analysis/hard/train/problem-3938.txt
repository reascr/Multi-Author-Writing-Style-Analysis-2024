I can give good guarantee that discussions are at least occurring to put them in a second pass pile if for no other reason than the removal of programs teaching kids to work together.
There’s been a noticeable increase in problems on this in recent years that the programs were designed to counteract… removing them results in kids that are belligerent, conflict seeking, convinced they’re gods gift… in short HR nightmares.
Honestly there is substantial merit to parents forming banned book groups. Tell a kid there’s laws preventing them from reading something in school and it gets an air of intrigue.
Not to mention that when parents are able to threaten teachers with reviews in ways that make grades suspect, good grades from Florida schools or elsewhere with these policies become unreliable indicators of capabilities.
Bullying is going to escalate for anyone who doesn't meet this governor's idea of who is valuable for students, for teachers, for children of folks who aren't the ideal citizen. Much as I would like to believe otherwise, I genuinely fear for people's lives. Hmmmm...I already fear for people's lives at this point. .
