Counterpoint: In 2018 Brian Kemp oversaw his own election as governor of Georgia, effectively counting his own votes. When ordered by a court to produce evidence, he deleted it. He has continued to serve as governor.
My question is this: How is it possible to cast more legitimate votes than an empowered election-rigger can discard?
I’m afraid that once a political party decides that cheating is justified, democracy is doomed. It’s a terminal cancer.
There is definitely an authoritarian streak among young leftists, but the problem is a much less urgent one. The extreme left is less violent, less organized, less funded, and much farther away from the levers of power. (For a historical parallel, Germans were absolutely right not to trust the KPD, which was practically run out of Moscow, but they never were the threat the Nazis were.).
That's the thing. If we were to just give up, the very next election likely would be the end of democracy. But we don't give up. The question is just whether we put up enough of a fight.
Who says this it the first midterm pushing the US closer to fascism? Last round saw Marjorie Taylor Grene and Lauren Boebert gain popularity and who is to say that the warning in previous rounds aren't the reason why Democracy still has a chance.
