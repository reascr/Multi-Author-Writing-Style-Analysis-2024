No, there was always something up with this jagoff. You can find his cv in the faculty report UF released on his politically motivated hiring and tenure without process. Which is in an of itself a stunning example of “we investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong”. That pos had always been just another grifter.
. A lot of papers on non-crazy topics like "Mutations Associated with Base Excision Repair Deficiency and Methylation-Induced Genotoxic Stress" and "Acute Safety Outcomes in Younger and Older Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Treated with Catheter Ablation".

No, there was not. This report is only relative to his hiring at UF, since the Surgeon General of Florida is automatically given a position as a professor there. If you look at his publications pre-2019, he was a pretty normal researcher at UCLA. The report you linked even has testimony saying that when reviewers looked at his CV pre-Covid, they thought he was a fine hire, and it was only until they scrutinized his more recent op-eds and other work related to Covid that they questioned his fitness.
