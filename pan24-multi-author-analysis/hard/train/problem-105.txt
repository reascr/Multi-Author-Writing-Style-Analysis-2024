It didn’t start with Trump (I’d say Rush Limbaugh had a running start) but Trump sure normalized the fuck out of hate speech against every minority group. He’s nothing but a misogynistic, racist bigot.
Desantis is not “anti-woke”— he’s racist. And the idea of accepting anything but his own narrow views offends his white nationalism. Florida is trying to outdo Texas in its stupidity and hate mongering.
How long until the people of Florida reject this massive policy failure by DuhSantis and his gang of partisan extremists?
Florida is racing to the bottom when it comes to public education. This feels like the Nancy DeVos model which will devolve public education to a voucher system where kids will attend private schools and charter schools regardless of the evidence that they don’t help the students who are most in need.
Nah, the plan is to take away money from public schools, give it to Christian charter schools, and force poor people to send their children to those schools in the hopes they will become indoctrinated into good gay/abortion hating Christian nationalists.
