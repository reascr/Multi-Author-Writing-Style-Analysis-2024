Plus, if the USA weakens Russia now, then Russia won't be able to come to China's help when the big fight comes.
It's really shitty that Ukraine has to suffer but with or without the US help, russia attacked. US couldn't have change anything and if the US/Nato step in at all then expect nuclear war so NATO hands are tied in how they can help. Sending equipment without losing troops is the best route for all these other countries not Ukraine, but there's nothing else anyone can do so this is the best anyone can do.
Oh certainly, it will be a painful one for the Russians, but the Ukrainians are gonna need ever munition they can get to sustain that defense. If US cuts military supply to Ukraine in February, that won't help their cause.
The way I see it the US ain’t letting go of supplying Ukraine any time soon, even if public opinion sours over time.
A good analysis. American public opinion unfortunately doesn’t even matter all that much when talking about US involvement in international conflicts. The war in Afghanistan had years of negative polls with Americans saying we should leave, and yet the US was still spending money and being involved until very recently.
