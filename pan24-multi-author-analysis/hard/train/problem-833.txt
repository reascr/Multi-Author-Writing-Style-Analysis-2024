Here, some random parent complained and the school’s guidance from the state trainers caused them to pull the book. It’s probably exactly what they wanted - the law, on its face, doesn’t prohibit any mention of the struggles black people or other marginalized people face/have faced. As applied, however, it’s going to start doing that.
This is so fucked. The FL statute sets out very specific kinds of content that is prohibited. But, apparently, FL approved training and sent out government agents to tell people that what they really need to be removing material that is “harmful to children”. A subjective standard that inevitably leads to public schools removing and not teaching subjects that are not prohibited by FL law. Schools now err on the side of not teaching students and hiding books from them.
Wonder how effective a kid starting a book club with banned books as the reading list would be. If a chode like DeSantis wants it banned that should tell a kid there’s at least something interesting about it.
