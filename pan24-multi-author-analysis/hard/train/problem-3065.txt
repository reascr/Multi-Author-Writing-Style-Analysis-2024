Stopping coal was planned for 2038?, i think. And has now been reduced to 2030. That "it isn't enough" might be true, but it's not like we stopped using coal and a re suddenly starting to again.
The last winter not being that cold isn't the direct result of coalburning. The next winter might be much colder again, and climate change would still be real.
Climate change is real, and it is serious. But it doesn't necessarily result in "mild winters" instead of cold ones.
Whilst a shifting polar vortex can cause temporary extreme cold events, the overall trend for Northern European winters is rapid warming.
“Northern Europe has warmed more strongly in winter than in summer, while in the south the warming trend is more apparent in summer.”.
“While the warming trend in Europe is on average stronger in the warmer seasons, winters are also becoming warmer as a result of global temperatures.”.
"During 2021, winter, summer and autumn for the whole of Europe were all warmer than the respective seasonal averages for the 1991–2020 reference period.".
So two things, 1. How do you think Germany meet those energy needs? The Tooth Fairy? 2. This town likely solely exists to service the coal mine, the mine closes, the town dies.
