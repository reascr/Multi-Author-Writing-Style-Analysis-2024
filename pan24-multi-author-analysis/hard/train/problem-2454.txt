Rheinmetall is building a new factory in Germany and has also bought a big munitions production factory in Spain.
When this offensive is repulsed Ukraine has the perfect opportunity for a large scale counter-attack because Russia will be spent for a while afterwards.
I remember when Ukrainians had successful counter attacks in Severodonetsk- but Russians just pulled back and shelled the area again. Counters on the flanks seem more promising. But let's hope Ukrainians don't have losses while doing these. Attacking is generally more dangerous.
I don't know if they were really offering such a thing. I remember Arestovich was making claims that they could squish Transdnistria if Moldova asked them, but I don't recall anyone making any such offers in official capacity. In general Ukraine is playing the good guy - i.e. not someone that drags more nations into a war. Offering to start a war in a neighboring country does not fit with that role.
As I understand it - their army is tiny, supposedly even weaker than their splinter "state" of Transdnistria. Though that might have changed a little in the last half of a year. The only thing saving them is that Russia has no land access.
