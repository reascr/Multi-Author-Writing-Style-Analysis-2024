The majority of Latin American authorities must be aware of this, and if they support a single currency despite this, it is not because they need a substitute for the US dollar but rather because they lack confidence in their ability to handle their own currencies.
I'm not sure how to evaluate this. A unified currency in a territory that is far from an ideal currency zone can lead to enormous adjustment challenges that, among other things, typically aggravate income inequality, as we have seen with the euro and the CFA.

Again, not an expert but sounds like they’re introducing more complexity into the system and I’m not convinced that just those two countries have enough demand to justify all the work required to maintain a currency effectively.
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they've done some very extensive research on the exact cost to implement a dual currency system. But it sounds like a nightmare to me. Best of luck to 'em though, hope it goes better than the way of Argentina's own currency.
If Brazil is trying to take advantage of Argentina why would they value their currency as high? They would do the opposite because they have more leverage.
