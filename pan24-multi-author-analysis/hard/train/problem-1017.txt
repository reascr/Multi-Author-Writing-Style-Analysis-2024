I'm an old US MLRS/HIMARS soldier/officer. If the report is correct that 6 rockets were fired and 4 hit, 200-400 KIA/WIA would be very possible in a building. From the initial information, it sounds like the place was a staging area or barracks. If it was also true ammo was stored nearby well then lord knows how many could have been KIA/WIA.
This sounds like a precision strike that just hit a perfect target. Frankly the only defense against MLRS is.
4. Spread out your troops and ammo as much as possible to prevent mass cassualties and secondary explosions.
They're getting taken out by drones that spot them, artillery, drop grenades on them, and drop anti tank grenades that destroy their limited supply tanks.
There's one great one where a Ukrainian drone operator counts like 15 Russians entering a small farmhouse, waits until they're all in, then calls in a precision artillery strike that levels the house.
Russians also should have learned not to quarter 600 men within artillery range of the line of contact in a civilian building that's extremely vulnerable to artillery fire... But here we are. I wouldn't give the Russians any benefit of the doubt at this point.
