WV Congressional members filed a bill today to make it illegal to exist in public as a trans person. If a minor sees a trans person, the trans person can be jailed for 'Obscenity.'.
"For the purposes of any prohibition, protection or requirement under any and all articles and sections of the Code of West Virginia protecting children from exposure to indecent displays of a sexually explicit nature, such prohibited displays shall include, but not be limited to, any transvestite and/or transgender exposure, performances or display to any minor.
No one is going to care, though. As long as it is 'icky' trans people, it's okay in the minds of most.
Makes me think this would apply to intersex people a well. So that means they would be going after people who were literally born with both sets of genitals.
Edit: I'm dumb for not knowing that transvestite and intersex aren't similar. It's still a fucked decision though. As long as it's not hurting someone, who the fuck should really care? No one.
