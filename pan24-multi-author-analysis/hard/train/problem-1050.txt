Whenever there's a cold/windy day, trace your hands around the window to feel for cold air. You can also visually check for condensation lines around areas where your window moves/tracks for proof of steep temperature gradients and need for something to stop the draft.
Having a single pane glass isn't great, but it's a million times better than double/triple pane with 0 insulation around the frame and allowing draft to enter the home.
If you're still on single pane windows it's worth upgrading, but the improvement from double to triple pane is not big enough to justify the cost usually. At least not compared to other insulation measures.
Replacing your old windows without also improving your home's insulation is a recipe for mold problems. The windows should be the coldest point in the room, otherwise the moisture will cling to the walls.
You can counteract this somewhat with decentralized ventilation systems, but moisture in a renovated old building is always difficult.
i actually looked into getting one but as it turns out, they are not suitable for old, badly insulated buildings with little radiator surface.(which is the vast majority of German buildings).
