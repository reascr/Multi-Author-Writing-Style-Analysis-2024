It won't be an easy decision for them going forward if forgiveness gets blocked, but I'd think at least one extension will happen.
So presumably as long as they want, as long as a President keeps it in effect. But this could be more problematic as time goes on, economically and in regards to the pandemic justification.
The argument you're going to hear from Republicans is that the HEROES act is limited only to temporary relief, and that permanent actions such as forgiveness don't qualify past the timing of the emergency. (I'm not agreeing with this, just saying what's to come).
Yes they understand that. They attended college. In a country with stagnant wage growth since the 70s, without universal healthcare. Should we go into who wrote the laws for student loans and how they were designed and who profits from them?
It turns out that student loans, which were supposed to enable young folks to attend college, are a parasitic bank scam to saddle them with crushing, lifelong, debt instead. The juristocracy works for the banks, obviously.
