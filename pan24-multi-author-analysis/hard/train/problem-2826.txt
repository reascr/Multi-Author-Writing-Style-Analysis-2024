3. The vast majority of current Yandex will stay in Russia and will keep the name Yandex. Only 4 products (international cloud, self driving, toloka and education) are leaving and becoming separate "startups", owned by Yandex N.V. (soon to be renamed). Some current international brands and subsidiaries (Yango for instance) will still be owned by the Russian Yandex, they will still have offices outside of Russia, etc. Part of the new Russian Yandex will still be owned by Yandex N.V. for the near future.
There are hurdles to Yandex’s plan. It would need to find a local buyer willing to purchase its Russian businesses. It would also need Moscow’s permission to transfer technology licenses outside of the country, and Yandex shareholders would need to agree to the plan.
Moscow-headquartered Yandex, the country’s dominant search engine founded by two Russian entrepreneurs, is hoping to transfer its most promising new technologies overseas and ditch most of its Russian business to avoid the effects of Western sanctions imposed after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia to Ukraine.
The EU sanctioned Yandex founder and then-CEO Arkady Volozh in June, accusing him of “materially or financially” supporting Russia’s invasion. Volozh resigned as CEO the same day. Yandex sold its news division to fellow Russian tech company VK in August.
Under the plan, which the Financial Times reported on Thursday, Yandex N.V.—Yandex’s holding company registered in the Netherlands—would sell most of its Russian businesses, like search, e-commerce and ride-hailing, to a local buyer. The New York Times later reported that Yandex N.V. would then shift its most promising technologies to non-Russian markets.
