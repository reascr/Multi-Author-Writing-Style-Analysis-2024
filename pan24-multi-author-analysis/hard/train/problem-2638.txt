Keep in mind there are many other analogous vectors that liberals can attack the Texas precedent on (e.g., suing churches for harmful religious practices, suing corporations for political speech, etc.). It is going to be a lot of work to generate legal arguments to carve all of those out while keeping the Texas law in place, and then they have to supervise implementation of all those carve outs by the (increasingly liberal) Circuit Courts. I'm guessing that the 6 demons would prefer to utilize their limited docket space on other right-wing priorities that have higher impact.
That stuff does matter - even obvious partisan hack Aileen Cannon tried to defend her ridiculous orders in Mar-a-Lago with some legal argument.
Further, Bush v. Gore did empirically undermine the credibility of the court in the eyes of the public. With our slow ass government, there hasn't been any legislative impact yet, but those small things are starting to add up. If the Rehnquist Court had say "Fuck Democrats" in their opinion, judicial reform very well might have happened already or at minimum we would be a lot closer.
Do you think, for one second, that the current conservative majority on the Supreme Court has concerns for judicial consistency? They will rule against the CA law, while upholding the TX one, specifically because they don't give a shit what you think ... Why should they, there is virtually no way to remove them from office other than them passing away (thanks rbg...).
