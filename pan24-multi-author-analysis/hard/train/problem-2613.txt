And for what it's worth, I'm sick of being lumped in with all the racists because I look and have an accent like them.
No, and fuck em, from a white, male, middled-aged leftist, who votes as far left as the ballot allows.
You can't think of any white women in the GOP who have doubted the 2020 election results parroted what the men in their lives say?
Do you honestly think that everyone who is white and also votes Republican is a white supremacist? Because that isn't at all how things really are. Do white supremacists find a home in the Republican party? Absolutely they do. Are they the majority of Republican supporters? No, they are not.
No. Because those identifying with one party, or tribe, can never see it as bad as the opposing party, or tribe. It's not how human psychology works.
From the neutral place I try to maintain, Conservatives are often insufferable through their Fundamental Christianity and belief in moral superiority through that religion. Liberals are often insufferable due to their faux-intellectualism and the conviction that they're smarter than others; their smugness.
