Indeed. It is still an aggression against a NATO member, "accident" or deliberate, and it's unacceptable.
Goodness, even if it was russian's 1345th "miscalculation" in this war, i am in shock they had the audacity to strike a NATO member.
I didn’t think you meant genocide, but the idea that we can just go blow up Russia’s entire military without a nuclear level response is just odd to me.
Tbh, i don't know what Russia's intentions are anymore (but its turning into a "nation self destruction speedrun" due to their repeated mistakes during 10 months of war :v).
(1) Deliberate attack by Russia, (2) an accident by Russia , (3) or a false flag by Ukraine to get NATO involved? The most likely is (2), I don't see this bringing NATO into the mix though.
Russia could say it was a false flag by Ukraine. Sacrifice a few Polish lives to bring NATO into the mix and help destroy Russia. I personally don't think this is the case, most likely a f\\\ up by Russia. But the conspiracy theory that Ukraine is behind it - it's not completely inconceivable.
