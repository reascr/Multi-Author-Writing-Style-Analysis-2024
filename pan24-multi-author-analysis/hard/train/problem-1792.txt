For instance, at Colossal Academy, tuition costs between $13,900 - $14,500 a year, and each student could get a voucher worth up to more than $7,000 annually under the measure.
The idea that these vouchers are going to give poor kids in failing institutions "school choice" to go across town to a private school is ridiculous.
School vouchers literally transfer money from the poor kids to the rich kids. They are almost never enough to fully cover the tuition of a private school, so they only go to people who have excess funds to pay for private school in the first place.
We functionally have the same exact system in the US. Most of us fear the cost of healthcare so we don't go to the doctor/hospital until it becomes life threatening.
When you’re rich and the cost of health care won’t affect you, and the introduction of for profit health care will likely make you richer… well… easy choice.
That's what happens when you design a healthcare system around insurance lawyers, executives, and doctors who became doctors because they wanted to get rich.
Ok, sure, but our doctors, hospital administrators, and healthcare shareholders and executives have a lot more money.
