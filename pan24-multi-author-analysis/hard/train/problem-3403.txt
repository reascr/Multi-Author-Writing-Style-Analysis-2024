I never realized how connected Russian and Ukrainian lives were, if you got rid of the Ukrainian and Russian words from your sentence you could think it's a civil war.
Unfortunately the same can probably be said for Ukraine, the only difference is that Russia brought it on themselves, Ukraine just got attacked for no reason.
It's unfortunate that basically any offensive that Russia makes will result in Ukrainians dying, but a Russian attack on Kyiv would result in far more Russians dying. Even in this war that is entirely based on idiotic Russian decisions it would stand as the pinnacle of idiotic Russian strategy so far.
Now the roles are reversed, Ukraine has that approach well fortified and the Russians are trying to organize an additional army of untrained conscripts while they can't supply their current army.
Instead, the next invasion from Belarus would be a bunch of poorly trained Russian conscripts that Russia can't properly equip going against a Ukrainian military far more prepared than last time that has fortified the approach from the Belarusian border.
Russia already tried one invasion from Belarus, when they spent months massing troops and equipment in advance and Ukraine wasn't even mobilizing for fear of provoking Russia. It literally is not possible for Russia to be more prepared for a second invasion from Belarus than they were the first time given the amount of time they had to build up, and it's not possible for Ukraine to be less prepared.
If they can keep the bulk of Ukrainian forces occupied in the east - in south around Herson and in north around Bakhmut; they can punch through to Kyiv from the north from Bryansk and Belarus in a two-prong attack. Provided the ground freezes and they coerce Lukashenko to join.
