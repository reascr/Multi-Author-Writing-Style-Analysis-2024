If SCOTUS overturns _Obergefell_, states with marriage bans in their state constitutions can outlaw marriage equality despite the Respect for Marriage Act. The bill makes it so those states with revived bans still would have to recognize same-sex marriages performed legally in other states.
Well this bill actually covers gay marriage, unlike the 1st amendment. So if you were interested in protecting gay marriage, you would be supportive of this bill instead of trying to make an unrelated and irrelevant 1st amendment argument.
Considering the precedent establishing gay marriage was the 14th amendment and not the 1st, the argument does not hold any weight.
My personal outrage asideâ€¦ The restriction of marriage (as a legal process) based on a religious ideals makes the 1st amendment relevant here.
There are non, which makes laws outlawing if because your religion says "man woman" violates my 1st amendment to not be forced to live under your religious laws.
What religious belief is the state prohibiting, or what official state religion are they establishing? None, which is why the 1st amendment doesn't apply here.
What part of the 1st amendment allows for gay marriage? The original ruling in favor of gay marriage didn't even include the 1st amendment in their justification.
