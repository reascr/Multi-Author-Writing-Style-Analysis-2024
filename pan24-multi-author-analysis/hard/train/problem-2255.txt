I'm not concerned with those people. Just the optics of a politician up there saying we should make young people, who are being destroyed by inflation, to pay more money, when there is a fairly simple way to fix that situation.
Would that be challenged? Certainly. Congress works in student loan repayment into future budgets to help fund the government, and the president can't threaten tax revenues without congressional approval. However, until overruled in court, Biden can keep everything on hold. Courts take well over a year to make decisions, so Biden could keep it on hold until the general election, easily.
Biden should extend it indefinitely so they make restarting loan repayment part of the presidential platforms. I want to see how a republican fairs saying they want to restart student loans on people who are hurting financially.
That said, if a republican retakes the WH student loans will be the least of our worries, whether it be Trump or DeSantis, so we just need to make sure to vote dem.
