There is no preventing it at this point, their only options are to kill him now and save as much as they can or let it play out and go down in total flames. Russia best bet would be to taking out putin themslevs and salvaging what they can then begging the Ukraine and NATO for forgiveness.
I agree that was a sham vote, which is why I said Russia needs to give everything else back. But I bet if a legitimate vote was held, Donbas and Crimea would vote to join Russia.
Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong, but why not offer annexation of Crimea and Donbas, the area that has voted pro-Russia for the last decade?
Even if ukraine gave up those territories russia would not stop, their goal is to keep nato out of ukraine, just because they got a few cities they still want no nato at the borders.
The vote in Crimea was a farce, same with Donetsk and Luhansk republics, Russia came in and occupied those areas. Conceding them now would indicate Russia can take what it wants by force and Russia is saying here Mariupol and Kherson are theirs as well and so they won't negotiate on them, so why would Ukraine give up its sovereign territory? Russia would come back in the future and try again.
I'm talking about the annexation referendum, which was clearly not free and fair. Also pro-Russia or Russian-speaking do not equal wanting to join Russia, as places like Kharkiv and Odesa have shown.
I agree Russia needs to leave all other areas - from Mariupol to Kherson and everything in between. But I feel like negotiations could happen if solely annexing Donbas and Crimea was the idea.
