She didn't bar them from committee assignments. She barred them from the Jan 6 select committee. There is a difference.
The former are standing committees like the Judiciary, Oversight and Reform, Ways and Means, and so on. These are permanent committees, established by House rules. These exist for government operations, like spending.
The latter are temporary, created by resolutions, and generally exist to serve a specific function that's goes beyond any of the standing committees. They tend to be investigative rather than legislative.
McCarthy is going to kick Dems off standing committees. Pelosi barred GOP from being on a temporary investigative committee. That said, the Chairs of standing committees are usually members of the majority party. The GOP changing the people chairing the committees isn't unusual.
Itâ€™s important to note she did not bar GOP congress people from committees because of their politics like McCarthy is proposing.
She barred some from the Jan 6 committee - specific ones that were being investigated for their involvements in Jan 6.
