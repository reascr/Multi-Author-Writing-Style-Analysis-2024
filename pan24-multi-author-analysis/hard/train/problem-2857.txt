There is a lane between Trump and DeSantis? In a lot of ways they are the same politically. If Republicans want a lane that can win with they need to go to the left of both of them. Like a Romney granted i still would not vote for him but thats the best chance they have.
Romney has a better chance of solidifying the GOP base back to the norms pre-trump. He's still a pro-corporate dipshit, but he has morals. Unfortunately, the GOP has gone into the direction of embracing nazis and authoritarian-lite ideology to win elections.
I like this response. Especially bc in 2016, everyone believed clinton would win the presidency bc the polls showed that. Instead, we got trump creating a massive upset. So, true. 2024 is still a long way from now.
Ironically, suppose they were capable of dropping the faux woke culture war bullshit and overhauled their policies on social issues and embraced popular legislature like free college for all, but instead propose free community college. In that case, they'd see far more support. Instead of $15 minimum wage, they'd fight for $12 or $13.
