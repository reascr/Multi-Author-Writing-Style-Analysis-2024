A Bradley/AMX-10 Armored division could punch hard and punch fast through a gap. Defensivly they could stop any russian offensive cold. Highly mobile and capable of killing modern russian tanks in bunches.
75-ton abrams tanks are going to have a lot of mobility problems in Ukraine. Ukraine has a lot of rivers, the tank is too heavy for normal bridges. They would need their own bridges built for them which would be an easy target for russian artillery. It would probably get stuck in the mud often as well. Those problems, plus introducing an entirely new platform which would require an insane amount of spare parts, ammo, clogging up the logistics networks (need to be transported by rail or flatbed if moving within theater), and training new tank crews (takes 6-ish months to train one crew) might make it more of a pain in the ass than its worth. Bradleys are capable as hell. Theyve got TOW missiles, a 25mm auto cannon, room to move a squad of dudes across a field, and theyre half the weight of an abrams.
Now toss FAV’s at them… stripped down dune buggies with 30mm chain gun, or missile launcher, or 50 cal… serious scoot and shoot. Put snow tires on ‘‘em and turn them loose.
