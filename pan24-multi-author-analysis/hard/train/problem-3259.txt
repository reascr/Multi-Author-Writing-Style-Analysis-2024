But some of them are just so ridiculous. I'm sorry but if "Microsoft" calls you via some guy who can barely speak English, "accidentally" refunds you $1000 instead of $100 for something you don't even remember buying, and then tells you to go to Walmart and buy $900 worth of gift cards to compensate them or you'll go to jail...
How can you be that gullible? I feel like it's only the most tech-illiterate elderly folks that would possibly fall for it. There's more red flags in these scams than the Soviet army.
I know people say stuff like "it's easier than you think to fall for these scams, don't assume you would know better".
Actually that's an extremely common tactic by many scammers, they make themselves intentionally easy to spot, so they don't waste time scamming someone who may wise up. If anyone falls for them then, they know this person is 100% certified gullible as shit, and can scam to their heart's content.
I’m shocked how people can fall for these scams. What’s more baffling is how much money people are willing to throw at a problem to get rid of it. If someone calls me and asks for hundreds of dollars, I’ll laugh at him even if it’s not a scam. Other than food and essentials, I never buy anything without first doing an in-depth research into the topic.
