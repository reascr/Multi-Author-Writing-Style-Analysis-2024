I invite them to try alllll they want. It will be funny to see iran begging for mercy when Israel starts shredding their entire nation, town by town, extremist by extremist.
Fada also urged the destruction of the Jewish state, calling it "the child-murdering regime [of] Israel.".
um. thats what you chose to comment in this thread about an insane threat from iran? geeee. do you have a biased take on the conflict in israel maybe?
you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims. the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa. the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%). it IS mostly anti semitism. to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above. furthermore. it is an offensive. stupid. strawman. trope. that i cant tell the difference. as a jew. when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.
