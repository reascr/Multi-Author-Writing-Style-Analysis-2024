Please go look at any 2A community and you'll see they want everyone to exercise their right to keep and bear arms.
There has literally not been one example since Reagan of a modern day Republican politician wanting gun control because of back or brown people.
Also people like to bring up Reagan because he's the origin of the road map for where the current GOP still stands - it's slightly less applicable when you're talking about the southern dems in the days of old lmao.
I mean, yeah it seems like now you talk about adding any additional regulation at all and people kick and scream, and yet are simultaneously ok with existing regulation to bar people like felons from owning guns. Do you believe that adding any common sense regulation with empiric evidence of reduction in violence is a slight on the 2a? And if so why should felons who have served their time not be able to lawfully purchase?
Cept felons - and medical mj patients. Funny how that's not a slight against the 2a, but making guns like ARs even slightly tougher to get by implementing something like a waiting period is.
At the same time, a process not too dissimilar to a drivers license for operating firearms is reasonable to most people. There are some purists and absolutists who see that as an infringement on rights, and that will always be debated, but if it were any other deadly substance, or machinery, there would be standardized tests of competence, there would be some form of safety regulation.
