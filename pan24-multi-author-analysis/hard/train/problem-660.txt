What's funny to me is that this thing is either the chunkiest weather balloon or the trashiest reconnaissance aircraft of all time. I'm sure there's some impressive technology on that instrument payload, but for surveying military installations it's still a hilarious contrast with the likes of the Lockheed U-2 half a century ago.
Compared to the over 60 years ago, a balloon carrying a box of instruments is a trashy renaissance vehicle to catch over enemy territory. And the US definitely didn't just find out about this as soon as you did, when they went public about it and shot one down.
More importantly, so did China. China was aware of its own surveillance network when the US started loudly announcing to the world that they were aware of, and investigating, the presence of UAPs in American airspace. They have no reason to assume they were going to get away with it for much longer and they have no excuse being so flat footed the moment when (not if) the US reveals they know about the balloons and what they do.
Apparently, they've been doing it for years and might have gotten away with it for much longer if the most famous of the balloons hadn't flown low enough to be spotted by, well, everybody.
