Just to clear up a common misconception I keep seeing on threads like this: This bill that was signed today will not transfer any debt to Orange/Osceola county and it does not put them on the line to pay for Disney's emergency/infrastructure services.

So this new bill that was just signed does not offload any debts onto Florida taxpayers, nor does it force the two counties to pay for Disney's services.

Disney will not be the only one who pays off their debt, by Florida intervening with Disney's autotomy, they are potentially risking Florida and nearby districts to pay for their inference. No amount of bill drafting will overcome the legal jeopardy the state put themselves in by reneging the deal without cause.
