PS. It wasn't long after our custom game was made that Argentina literally just cancelled the currency, and started a new one. If you hadn't traded in your "Australes" for the new "Pesos," they were literally garbage. Of course, trading them in was pennies on the thousands, or worse. Hence our new game was born.
We left Argentina in 1994, plenty of extended family left behind. All these years later, same old shit. My father (visiting family) just got a haircut down there for like $1.75ish US. People are desperate. Failed state, no jobs, no money, barely enough food.
In 1992 we made a full Spanish-version monopoly game with real cash. It was worthless. I remember we ran it through the washing machine, then ironed out the bills. We still have that board "game.".
There it is. This is one of the major problems with Argentina, everyone focuses too much on Peron, either using him as a scapegoat or a role model, and not enough on getting shit done. Blaming him solves nothing, doing stuff does.
Definitely not general advice. Here in Uruguay the leftists were the ones that got our economy out of a shit crisis and into a pretty respectable position.
Argentina has a bit of a problem where their democracy sucks quite a bit because you can't get a truly good candidate, and even if you did there's enough corruption around that it's all fucked anyway.
For the moment we are not a full blown venezuela/russia we still have a shitty democracy with corrupt politicians, but the bases to rebuild if the institutions hold on.
