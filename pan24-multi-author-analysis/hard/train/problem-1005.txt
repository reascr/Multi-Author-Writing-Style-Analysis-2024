Let's be honest, the main reason Russia leaves them is because it puts a burden on Ukraine and the West. Due to the nobility and empathy, I don't think we would just let anyone die if they could be treated.
If Russia wasn't using these soldiers trying to get Ukraine to spend money/time/energy on POWs, I shudder to think of what they might otherwise be used for.
Looking back over Russia from the last century, I don't think any of the Russian officers have the resources, time, or empathy for their wounded soldiers.
Ukrainian soldiers aren't incapable of being cruel fucks in war, on the less the Russians armies systemic maltreatment of their own soldiers probably favours such an outcome in soldier's. The reason why you are fighting is defently also a big part of it. (Why i think that wounded russian soldiers aren't killed or worse, instead treated) well hopefully.
Russian army probably abandoning their wounded because they know the Ukrainians will give them medical attention. This is about adding strain to already busy medics and doctors. Goes hand in hand with destroying civilization infrastructure.
