Tbh I think the whole join together or not thing was mostly to ensure Finland anyway, you are bordering the bitch so it’s more important for you .
Finland joining is about as good as them joining with Sweden, as it provides the protection to Sweden and the rest of Europe, can easily blockade St.Petersburg and it makes it so that the Baltic is now a Lake NATO.
Finland joining NATO and with several NATO members surrounding it; Norway to the West and the North, Denmark, Germany and Poland to the South and the Baltic states to the East, Sweden would find itself protected inside a "NATO cocoon", with only the Baltic Sea as the only way for Russia to invade.
The foreign policy committee in Finland’s parliament on Friday voted in favour of the country joining Nato, saying that Finland should join as soon as possible, preferably together with Sweden.
According to a report in Finland’s Iltalehti tabloid, Sauli Niinistö told Finnish journalists that if Turkey and Hungary ratify Finland’s membership of Nato before that of Sweden, then Finland will automatically become a member.
According to Finland’s national broadcaster Yle, the parliament as a whole will begin to debate the bill on Finland’s Nato membership next week, with a vote on the new law expected on February 28th.
“We do not want to and cannot withdraw our application,” Niinistö said at a security conference in Munich, arguing that Finland can not stop the process once it is approved by all Nato members states.
