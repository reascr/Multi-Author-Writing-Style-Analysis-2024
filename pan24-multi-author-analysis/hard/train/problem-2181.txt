oh don’t worry it won’t affect them, it’ll just grandfather in old people so that the young people who don’t vote are the main ones getting fucked over.
The Republicans won't do it in a way that will affect current SS beneficiaries, so the oldies can still stick their heads in the sand.
The GOP isn't that dumb, from the previous plans of theirs I've seen, they aren't going to end it for any current recipients. The younger generations would still have to pay into the system so the boomers could continue their benefits, but no one else would be admitted into it going forward.
The real answer: you'll still have to pay the tax, because contrary to popular misconception, social security is not a savings account you put money into during your working life and withdraw when you retire. The money you pay in gets redistributed to the current recipients, with the expectation that in the future, the next generation will pay for your benefits, etc. The Republicans aren't trying to end it immediately, they want to cut it for future recipients, so current recipients (aka, boomers, aka, their voting base) won't lose their benefits. It's a classic ladder pull.
Right, on an individual level, it can be better to keep it for yourself rather than pay into a system that won't necessarily benefit you if you're already independently wealthy.
