Unfortunately the US doesn't really have any airframes that would be suitable for the rough conditions Ukraine has to operate in right now.
Ukraine needs jets that can operate on very rough ground, can be maintained without massive facilities, and are built with the expectation that they will have to operate low and relatively slow.
It's a good aircraft in those roles as far as multirole aircraft go... but there are more suitable aircraft available in greater numbers for the exact capabilities that Ukraine wants. Bit more rugged, bit more payload, bit harder hitting as a result.
So, to claim it's "at least as useful" I think does a disservice to the Frogfoot. The A-10 isn't a bad plane (I mean, some disagree) but this isn't the environment in which it is designed to thrive. It works best in tandem with suppressed air defences, i.e. SEAD dealing with SAMs and fighter cover to deal with interceptors and other would be dogfighters.
If I recall, it has a larger radar cross section and is slower and less agile. Also, since its primary weapon is the, y'know, gigantic cannon the entire plane is built around, it has to get up close and personal rather than volley firing unguided rockets or just being a flying pylon for a guided missile. All of those things make it less survivable.
