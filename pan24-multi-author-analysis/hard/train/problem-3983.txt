You have your mandatory Lithuanian classes, followed with mandatory English classes. At (I believe, been a while) 6th grade (12-13 y.o.) you are supposed to pick up a 3rd language. It is mostly a toss-up between Russian and German or if your school is posh enough, French followed up with really rarely Spanish.
By the way, during the Russian occupation of baltics, for many years our own native languages were suppressed and removed from school curriculum.
Removing Russian as a foreign language from schools does not get rid of the native Russian speakers (not that anyone would wish to) - they will know the language either way, so the minority is still there.
Removing russian language from class is just natural progression of what has been happening for more than a decade, especially as english really would be more useful for modern youth.
These days russian is practically useless due to ongoing Russian bullshit and Lithuania moving away from using russian language as secondary, the later began happening more than a decade ago.
Lithuania began phasing out russian as a second language in final years of the first decade of 21st century.
When I was younger, my grandfather believed they still do it in Lithuania post independence and wanted me to put Russian in it.
Prior to that, Lithuania tried to keep Russia happy and was looking for a chance to find friends elsewhere who would help.
