That being said, anything other than revolvers, pump/break-action shotguns, and bolt-action rifles should be outlawed.
If you hit every shot and 1 bullet kills each person you hit. The killing potential is significantly less than an AR-15, semi-auto shotgun, or magazine-fed semi-auto pistol.
While I'm a proponent of gun control legislation, state-by-state or city-by-city gun legislation is like a designated pee area in a pool. Gun control is most effective when it is universal.
There are ways to achieve similar results without guns. Like the mothers during BLM protests/rallies, where they'd come and stand a line against police or other instigators.
Can't remember where it was, or what it was for, but there was a liberal(called antifa) group that did decide to defend a rally by showing up with guns to stand around and keep them safe. Same thing the conservatives do with the same stated purpose, although in those cases, it's usually the protestors who show up armed.
There things tend to ebb and flow, but I can't really recall a time in my 46 years where LGBT+ people weren't persecuted in some way. There was a slight decline as gay rights were passed, but I feel it helped support the future rhetoric. I do feel in the past 10 years, there has been escalating vitriol directed at the communities though, which is sad given that almost everyone I know from that community are pretty decent people overall.
