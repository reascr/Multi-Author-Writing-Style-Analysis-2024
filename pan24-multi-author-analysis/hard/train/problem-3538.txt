Traitors and bigots don’t deserve commemoration. Their only memory should be in history books about the hell and depravity they caused so that subsequent generations can learn from their hideousness.
The fact that RepubliKKKans have been trying to save these statues is an insult to those who suffered and died while enslaved and to all those since who shed blood, sweat, and tears to promote equality and equal protection under the law.
And yet there are undoubtedly a ton of people upset by this and who think they are personally being attacked because they're not allowed to worship a public statue of a literal traitor and slave owner.
Lee fought a war against his own country over the right to own slaves, and I didn't want anyone to claim he was just fighting because he was protecting Virginia or other nonsense that has been trotted out about him since he was _also_ a slave owner.
Maybe we should remove the 1st and third president from the dollar bill they both were slave owners and are probably the most popular ones not defending them but saying they were slave owners aren’t a valid excuse seceding and betraying your country yeah for sure.
It is weird that we would honor someone who waged war against the US, killing thousands, all so they could continue owning and abusing people and demanding that other states respect that and help them out if their slaves escaped.
The right of northern states to pass their own laws and allow freed slaves to live without threat of kidnapping and return to slavery in the south? Even the “state’s rights” argument falls apart if you think about it for a minute. The slave states wanted to dictate terms to northern states and newly admitted states because they knew they wouldn’t maintain enough support in Congress either the states or the people had rights.
And it also mentions abolition and “the two races” and several other similar phrases in every paragraph. But I don’t see the phrase “states rights” even once. Hmmm.
