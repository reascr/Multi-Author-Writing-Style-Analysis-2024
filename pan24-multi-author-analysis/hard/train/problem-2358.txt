My theory is that it’s the same part of the brain that makes trump say nobody’s done anything more for LGBTQ rights than him.
Like if they just openly hated gay people that comment wouldn’t make sense. But they seem to want to be seen as helping gay people as long as they vote Republican and don’t seem too gay?
Probably because republican don’t just hate LGBT people, and it’s not a deal breaker for everybody. You can vote for republican for a lot of other reason, and when you have to vote specifically for LGBT rights a lot of them would be for it. It might be hard for some people but you can be for LGBT rights but still vote for republicans, for economics reason, for immigration reasons, for gun rights reason, ect… People just see blue and red, but their is a lot more than that. You can also have people hating LGBT peoples still vote democrats.
That feels like the worst thing you can do to attract more Democrat or independent votes. Real foolish move.
But what always gets me is, this amendment is passing by a much wider margin than the Democrat for Senate is winning.
