Republicans want history to read that the Biden administration was so corrupt everyone was getting impeached again and again....oh and that Trump guy got impeached but it was nothing compared to the Biden administration.
Instead it's going to read Trump got impeached for bribing another nation by trying to withhold weapons from them and then impeached again for trying to overturn his loss by inciting a insurrection against the US. These actions are the cause for a similar event in Brazil and republicans retaliated by acting like little kids and impeaching any person they could.
Impeaching without a good reason isn't going to go anywhere but make your party look ridiculous. You'd think they would have learned their lesson from the Clinton impeachment.
So no investigation like they said they would do, just straight to an impeachment that will never convict in the Senate. I'm pretty sure this is what the next 2 years is going to look like. And for no other reason than they were politically embarrassed the Orange Hitler was impeached (not convicted) twice, and somehow impeaching everyone else will make them feel better (feels over reals again).
