But this probably wasn't the Ukrainians because the Russians aren't blaming them for it; in the assassination that was carried out by Ukraine earlier this year they didn't try to pretend it was a suicide.
Who actually thinks Putin then would not take this opportunity to blame Ukranian insurgents for this after locals killed his thug?
Lastly, the same story played over and over with bungled "suicide" overkill involving multiple weapons/matrix-like physics, abstract definitions of gravity on Planet Russia, and surprisingly fast final verdicts officially confirmed to the media is amazing.
Who actually thinks someone or a group of people could get in close enough to one of Putin's goons, assassinate him and not have Putin know? Judging by the reluctance of the Russian general population to even move a finger against Putin, would they even try?
There's no doubt there's some unrest right now in the upper strata of Putin's government. This Putin confidant may have just gotten too friendly with one of the potential replacements' camps and got caught. One thing that has become clear in the last few years. It doesn't take much for Putin to identify someone as a threat to his power and respond lethally.
Yeah rereading the article it looks like he's probably not. Although I would argue that someone could be in Putin's circle and be stationed anywhere, but anyway... it seems most likely on closer examination, with his involvement with mobilization, it might have been an angry local that took him out. It's simply being reported as a suicide because it sounds better for the war effort. Putin's war is starting to become decidedly unpopular in the outlying republics. Who thanks to modern technology are becoming acutely aware that this has largely been a war of poor kids from the provincial areas dying for rich men in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Which kind of describes a lot of Russia's wars, really.
