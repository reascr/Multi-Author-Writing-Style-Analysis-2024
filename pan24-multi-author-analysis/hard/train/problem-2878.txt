It isn't really Nazi stuff. Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim country, and while not as radical as many Muslim countries in the middle-east, is still staunchly conservative.
With Indonesia now moving further towards repression and conservatism, is there any majority muslim country left for liberal muslims to live in? Is the west now their only option?
Things would be very different if arabic cultural export of Wahabism would have been less successful, for example.
All religions are just collections of tales open to Interpretation. We are only one popular movement away from a liberal Islamic revolution.there have been times in history when Islamic countries have been the relatively liberal and open-minded ones, in more recent history they failed to keep up in development.
Liberal Christians have multiple countries to choose (eg the Scandinavian nations). Liberal Buddhists and Chinese folk religion believers have Taiwan. Liberal Jews have large communities in the US and can live in liberal Israeli cities like Tel Aviv with relatively little influence of orthodox Jews in their daily life. Where would a liberal muslim go if he wants to live freely among fellow muslims?
And so dies the illusion of the "liberal" Muslim country. To be clear, this isn't about Islam, it's about failing to separate religion and the state. It's simply too tempting for governments to utilise religion to cement their power. All states should be secular to be accepted into the global community and global partnerships.
