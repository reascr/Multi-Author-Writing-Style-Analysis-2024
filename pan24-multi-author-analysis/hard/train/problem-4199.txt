Once upon a time, I would have defended Ohio - they seemed to be on the right path towards progress but the last 10 years have shown that it's really becoming a shithole.
Toledo is truly he hidden gem of the midwest. Top 10 zoo and art museum in the country, HUGE metroparks with a focus on conservation and ease of access, an interactive science museum downtown, Tony Packos... the list really goes on and on.
Quick question: Do you know if Jenny's ice cream is still in Columbus? Might be able to get back to Ohio in the next year or so, and would like to take family down to try it out as it's a good memory of mine.
Anecdotally as an Ohioan, we have been planning a move to Michigan for about a year now, even prior to the 2022 elections. We encourage any friends who are looking at getting out of Ohio to check it out. Politics aside, the general vibe of the population just seems to be much more positive and chill in general compared to its southern neighbors.
As long as you're looking at some larger metropolitan areas/cities they're mostly pretty progressive and chill. It's when you get out to those podunk small towns or rural MI where it feels like you've stepped into Alabama. I love MI and the west coast is the best.
Now live on the west coast of MI. Short on the high end arts scene (but still there), generally less crowded, enough commercial areas, better quality of life and less expensive.
