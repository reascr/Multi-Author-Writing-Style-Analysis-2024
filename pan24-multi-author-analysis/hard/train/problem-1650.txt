Too accurate lol and the conservatives are only now realizing this guy has only a surface level understanding of anything he has ever spoken about, with no commitment to any position that doesn't further his own goals or electability.
Or the other top post with tons of support saying how conservatives are tired of being tied to anti-election sentiment/big lie/scorched earth politics just because of who their last president is. Uh, fucking hello? Almost 80% of republicans believe in those things. The stereotype is real because that is what conservatives actually believe. They’ve made sure to let everyone know over the last 2 years.
The amount of cope there is unbelievable right now. A top post is “conservatives just want to be left alone, and not have our tax money go toward things we morally disagree with.”.
There’s a thread on there right now where the comments are talking about how conservatives have divorced themselves from reality. They’re almost to the full realization. It’s fun to watch.
