It's one of the richest countries in the world, surrounded by neighbours who are poorer but many times it's size. It is a global finance hub.
Geopolitically, it is one of the busiest ports in the world. Almost everything shipped out of China to Europe goes through Singapore ports and vice versa.
If you're very rich and the land you sit on is very valuable, and you're surrounded by poorer but larger countries, and have no army, you're asking for trouble. Remember Kuwait?
Singapore also has a very robust oil refining industry. Almost 1/3 of the oil China uses passes through Singapore and Singapore is one of the top oil refining centers despite having no crude oil (it is the 5th largest in Asia Pacific).
Singapore has also been an important trading hub even before the industrial revolution and still continues to be one of the worlds largest exporter of goods with the worlds second busiest port by volume. Today, Singapore exports more goods than India and exports the same amount of goods from the US as France. While it is definitely tiny in terms of its geography, its importance in the global economy should not be underestimated.
