In all seriousness. Drug testing is BS. I remember an old GM I worked for said if she had to drug test, she'd have to fire half her staff. Give us a break. Drug testing is only meant for the poor underpaid workers. You know who never gets drug tested? Management, CEO's, etc...
Personally I like pre-employment drug testing. It's a good way to weed out (pun possibly intended) employers I'd never work for.
Most places I've worked I've had managers that stated pretty openly that they know if they did drug testing for weed that they would have to fire too many good employees.
Iâ€™ve only ever been drug tested once I moved into higher paying jobs, I was never tested as an hourly worker.
When I was hired in a new job last year, I had to take a drug test for the first time in like 20 years. No problem, but took me aback in my position. Marijuana was excluded from the test.
There is obviously a need in healthcare to test for opioids etc so I get it. It was nice to see that exception already built for that in WA.
