Just because you are too stupid to see the possible outcomes of your actions, doesn't mean that you shouldn't be hold accountable for them. If you glue yourself to the road without thinking about the fact that this could hinder an ambulance doing it's work or a doctor reaching a hospital or a police force trying to help someone in danger and many other possible emergencies that could happen that need road access, then that's your fault.
But it's wasn't even the ambulance that was stuck, an ambulance was at the place of the crash (cyclist run over by a truck) the car that was blocked by the trafficjam was only there to bring special equipment to free the victim from the truck, as stated above it wouldn't even have helped the victim survive, if it had been there in time.
Not that anyone cares, but the report of the treating emergency doctor was just published I which is stated that the traffic jam due to the demonstration did not effect the rescue of the victim. The fire truck that was stuck in traffic was basically a crane that could have lifted the truck off the biker's leg. However when the doctor, who was not blocked by the traffic jam, arrived at the scene she immediately discarded that option and instead had the truck drive off the leg.
