It’s sad the words “carbon tax” sends everyone into a seething rage because it would actually make a huge difference lol.
Make carbon and oil more expensive so it makes every megacorp switch the renewables to preserve their bottom line. At the same time, carbon being so pricey would drive investment in carbon capture tech.
Ad to that a carbon tax can impact behavior. But there's not actually a place for all that carbon tax money to go to change things. We can do all the financial accounting we won't. Doesn't change the immediate fact that billions of lives entirely depend on fossil fuel emissions to survive.
What we need to do is dump huge resources into reversing greenhouse gas emissions, which is our only option for long term survival.
Even if we somehow got all our travel and energy needs met by green or zero emissions methods the greenhouse gas emissions wouldn't completely stop either. Construction materials like concrete emit carbon and many industrial processes to make the materials and technology we need produce greenhouse gasses.
