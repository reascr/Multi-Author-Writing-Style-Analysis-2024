Both Israel and Palestine recognized each other's right to exist in the Oslo Accords what are you talking about?
Edit - And I do support an independent state for Palestine. I’m just not so sure it would work out real well at this point.
While what you are saying is at least partially true Hamas did win in what were considered to be free and fair elections. There have been no elections since then because reasons. What Palestinians that I’ve had dialogue with have described as the most reliable polling source does show is broad support for Hamas. The lead flips between Hamas and Fatah from time to time but there is a reason Abbas is sixteen years into his four year term.
At the time that agreement on the Palestinian side was led by Yasser Arafat, who was part of Fatah. Since that agreement, most Palestinians do not support Fatah and definitely not Mahmood Abbas since he took over. As much as I wold like to think that Hamas can't speak for the Palestinian people, in reality they do, they were democratically elected by the Palestinian people and still have wide support from them. The Palestinian government goes back and forth on recognition, clearly does not stop the Oslo accords given the way the WB looks right now, Hamas very specifically does not recognize Israel and at points has called for the eradication of not only Israelis but Jews world wide.
According to me a charter like this with harsh wording that this charter of 1968 can never be changed, then you need to nullify the entire charter and write a complete new one to be accepted in a public referendum, which is not easy as the general palestinian opinion to accept Israel's right to exsist is hovering around 30 % only and has been this way since Oslo.
