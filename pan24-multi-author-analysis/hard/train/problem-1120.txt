In 1968, the Soviets began the invasion of Czechoslovakia by seizing the international airport in Prague and then using it to land airborne forces. Last year, the Russians tried similar moves outside of Kyiv, and now we hear rumors that maybe theyâ€™ve got plans along the same lines for Moldova.
Look at a map of Moldova and tell me how Russia is going to get there. How Russia would get any supplies or ammo there.
Exactly. I don't understand how people don't get this. Russia can't get to Moldova. They can't send supplies. I mean, at least the 7000 Moldovan troops can be resupplied with ammo. Russian forces there are effectively already encircled. Russia can't even fly fighter jets over Ukraine, let alone cargo planes.
Russia can't get to Moldova. There is no access to them. They can't get supplies, ammo, troops, or anything to the country. They'd either have to go through Ukraine or try to use ships. The problem is that any ships would also be within range of Ukrainian attack.
The whole thing is a distraction to try and draw some Ukrainian forces that way with the threat of another front. Russia could absolutely take Moldova if they took Ukraine. The problem with the whole thing is that Russia didn't take Ukraine and all paths to Moldova either go through unoccupied Ukraine or Romania, who is a member of NATO.
Moldova should be proactive in denying Russian access, but there's no real threat unless Russia can make gains into central and western Ukraine, which is (partially) why Ukraine retaking Kherson was vital.
At the time, Ukraine had been positioning some military units along the boarder with Moldova to defend against any possible act of Russian aggression. Russia had for a number of weeks been denying any military ambitions relating to Moldova.
