They will be reported world wide. Some war info will leak into Russia, which otherwise tightly controls the media.
The mere act of Russia negotiating with Ukraine is an acknowledgement that Ukraine is a sovereign country.
No: what should Ukraine offer to Russia in negotiations? In other words, "In exchange for you pulling out all your forces and stopping your attacks against us, we will give you X". What should "X" be, in your view?
Ukraine and the OSCE (led by France and Germany) didn't think it was worthless before it was signed. It only turned out to be worthless when Russia decided it wouldn't abide by the terms it signed. Russia's duplicity permanently weakened the possibility of a negotiated settlement to the conflict, but Ukraine and President Zelensky still were willing to negotiate in late February when it seemed like Russia could win its invasion.
This is what makes negotiations so unworkable at this point: Putin thinks he can reverse his losses with just a few million more troops, and thus doesn't want a negotiated end to the war that permanently freezes the frontlines where they are right now (and especially doesn't want any possibility of Ukraine joining NATO). The people of Ukraine do not want to give up post-invasion territory just after they liberated Kherson and only a few months after the Kharkiv counteroffensive, since they see that they have the momentum.
