However, I suspect a lot of western countries supporting Ukraine just want to see Russia keep on bleeding until their country is desperate enough to agree to all kinds of reform and potentially even nuclear disarmament.
If Russia left tomorrow, I've no doubt Zelenskyy would be all over their asses politically: wanting reparations for the damage they've caused and for their war crimes to be punished, but my key point is Ukraine doesn't want to be fighting for a second longer than they have to.
I am concerned however, that if Ukraine goes on the offensive by attacking targets inside of Russia instead of being strictly defensive, that it backfires and causes the Russian people to feel like they need to rally their support for the war instead of feeling bad for Ukraine and not supporting the war.
I think they speculate on exhausting the ukrainian general public over the winter with power outages, cold and high casualties at the front lines to a point where public pressure forces the ukrainian government to react on russia's coincidentally increasing efforts on negotiations, where russia then hopes to secure those territorial gains in exchange for peace, giving Putin a land bridge to crimea and allowing him to pretend everything went according to plan.
