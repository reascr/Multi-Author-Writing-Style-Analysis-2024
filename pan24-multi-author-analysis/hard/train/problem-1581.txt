He stole data and took it to China and Russia, that’s treason. Further, half of his claims- at least- are absurd. There’s a way domestic intelligence collection works, and it’s not what Snowden said it was.
You’re a random stranger claiming you know more about domestic surveillance then Snowden. Doubtful you even sniffed a security clearance because you’d know it’s not classified info to disclose your clearance level. So, either put up or shut up.
You obviously haven’t researched or looked into snowdens upbringing and decision to release the info. You’re mad at an individual who exposed our countries lies? Why? Because you rather be lied to? Think our government is on your side? Weird.
You would know, by your claims, NSA/CIA (mostly NSA) used 9/11 as a prop to invade citizens privacy. You would also know that there are “secret” programs in these agencies that do not get put on the record so the “red tape” associated with checks and balances is not applicable.
Ok, but Snowden’s point stands. US government wasn’t being truthful to the American public about the level of domestic surveillance being undertaken and exposed this. US government then did a hit job on his morality and social standing by claiming “national security.” Do you have the level of clearance in CIA/NSA snowden had?
