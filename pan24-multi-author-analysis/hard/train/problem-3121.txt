He can be stopped without starting a nuclear war. It's a strategy called containment and is what the US used against the USSR. Starting a nuclear war will result in a destroyed world. It's a dumb strategy.
The Iron Dome currently protects a tiny country against primitive rockets. Creating a system that can protect a country as big as Ukraine from modern, sophisticated missiles and drones is a much more difficult and expensive task.
They can continue the civilian targeting with drones and cruise missiles as long as they can maintain the stock, but that's not going to win them the war and its not going to bring down Ukraine.
Ukraine isn’t a static entity either as seen in how quickly they’ve progressed technologically with their long range and drone weapons. Don’t confuse justice and mercy for inability.
AA guns like the Gepard can and have helped thin those barrage down since they have to travel low and slow over a large territory. Ukraine just needs more.
There’s no prohibition against Ukraine developing its own weapons (like Neptune). With under the table assistance from its allies Ukraine can surpass Russias’s junk in capability and volume.
Once Russia is pushed out of Ukraine's borders, Ukraine will join NATO or an ad-hoc mutual defense treaty (for example, with the UK, Poland, and the Baltics).
Ultimately, “made in Ukraine” is whatever Ukraine and its allies declare it to be and Russia can’t do anything about it.
