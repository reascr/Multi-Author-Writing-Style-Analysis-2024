It's not alright for you to do that. That said - ruling party is heavily favoured by the elderly and a lot of them died during covid in Poland so they no longer have 40 percent of votes. It's more like 30 now and all the polls show that they have no chances of having a 3rd term. They only got to power due to elderly people and we hate it.
Oh piss off. It's alright for us to shit all over our government because they suck ballz deeply and are sabotaging our allegiance with the EU.
Your argument is "the EU is corrupt (does whatever the US commands) and won't help it's members". I'm not sure I want to debate you on this. It's something you seem very passionate about and you'd likely never change this opinion.
Another possible solution to this would be "Oh, nation x doesn't recognise human rights? Ok you don't have to, but the EU does. And if nation x is sued by people who's rights are trampled, the EU sanctions nation x.".
Umm. Iâ€™m not sure which one of us is misunderstanding something, but if the voter turnout is 50%, the percent of PiS supporters who voted drops to 15%, because proportions.
According to practically all polls, PiS may technically "win" elections, but they won't get a supermajority like they used to. That'll be a huge problem for them, because ZP/PiS had effectively made all other major options their enemies.
