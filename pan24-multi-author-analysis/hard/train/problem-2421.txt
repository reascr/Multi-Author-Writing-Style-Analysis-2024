Needless aggression, unscrupulous greed, unchecked hate. To have the images, the headlines, incessantly thrust at you, hour after hour, years at a time, you normalize to it. They want you to go numb, become indifferent, or lose your self in distractions, for it to feel like the evil in this world and all its machinations are too big to challenge. That loss of control leads to despair. To re-engage, to claw back even the tiniest sense of control... you don't have to save the world, you just have to make a difference where you can, with the opportunities you are given. That's all I'm asking.
It’s not about that. It’s about not needing to be uncircumcised because our dicks aren’t hanging out anymore. Also most men can’t even wipe their own ass your going to give them something else to keep clean. Finally women prefer uncircumcised and it prevents utis and some stds. But hey there are some people out there who consider it mutalation.. mostly because they themselves are uncircumcised.
I’ve never heard anyone with a circumcision articulate how it has ruined his life. I have heard people articulate how here one therapy has. Kinda hard to compare the two.
