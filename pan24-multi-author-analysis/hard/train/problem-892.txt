Interestingly enough my husband pretty much never gets sick, not even a head cold, and all through the "dark days of covid" he was the one that went out and did all our shopping and such. Yet this hit him REALLY hard, to the point that I was actually worried about him for the first time in nearly 30 years together.
Pretty sure husband and I had it just before christmas, and it was absolutely horrible. We are both vaccinated with all available boosters and I have a flu shot.
But, Iâ€™m vaccinated and booster in November. It was about 4 total days of feeling like crap with the feelings of a terrible head cold.
The second time was like the mildest flu I've ever had, but the worst part is that ever since August I have a weird ringing in my ears every few days. While I had Covid, my ears got plugged and they would hurt like a stabbing pain every few hours (along with ringing). I don't know if it will ever go away. People don't realize sometimes long Covid can be worse than death.
I don't wanna die, but even the threat of dying from covid doesn't hit as hard as the threat of long covid.
