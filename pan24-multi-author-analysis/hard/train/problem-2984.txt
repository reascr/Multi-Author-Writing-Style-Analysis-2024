Most people aren’t objecting to trans rights. They’re objecting to people forcing them to hear about it.
If we’re to progress on the trans rights issue there has to be an acceptance that most people simply don’t care. The messaging needs to be adjusted.
That’s the issue though, isn’t it? Trans people are such a small part of the population that few know what ‘they’ look like.
Funny how such news always show drag queens (not necessarily trans) or footage from pride events, and not trans people how they look in their everyday lives. God beware, people could think trans people were people just like them.
Trans rights are human rights. We aren't hurting anyone. Unless you are a medical professional, you don't need to know the highly advanced science behind why we exist and why the medical community treats us.
Many of us they wouldn't know it if they saw us. We are just normal people who sent through some suffering and found relief. They focus on drag queens because the show that drag queens put on. They think that's our existence.
Dignity should not be so hard, like legit. What's the goal? You get rid of all trans people, force some of us into the closet, others die and many young people just never get to com out and suffer in silence.
