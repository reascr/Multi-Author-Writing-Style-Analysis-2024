Not entirely accurate. The Obama administration capitulated to industry pressure and that regulation was only applied to trains carrying crude oil. Not other flammable materials (like the Ohio train was carrying).
So, the Ohio train would have been exempt from that regulation even if it was never repealed under Trump.
The derailment of the train in Ohio was likely more severe because the Trump administration repealed a key safety rule. A rule was passed under Obama that made it a requirement for trains carrying hazardous flammable materials to have ECP brakes, but this was rescinded in 2017 by the Trump administration.
If you're referring to the statements about this being due to Trump's cancelling an Obama era regulation, that regulation applied to Class 3 flammable liquids, this train was carrying class 2. Buttegeig misled the public with his statement.
The regulation he rolled back applied to class 3 flammable liquids, this train was carrying class 2. The regulation would have made no difference for this train had Trump kept it.
