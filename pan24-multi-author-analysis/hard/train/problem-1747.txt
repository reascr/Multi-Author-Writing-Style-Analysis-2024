My understanding is that immediately after he took power, impeachment proceedings were launched against him by the opposition. That attempt failed, so they tried again. That attempt failed, so today would have been the vote on the third attempt to impeach him a year into his first term. He's a former schoolteacher.
As much as I dislike that he attempted to dissolve congress, I suspect that maybe all involved parties in Peruvian politics are being shady and that their entire congress might be a bit of a shitshow.
Not that I know much about Peru's government, but isn't there a "permanent assembly" that acts as an interim congress?
The (English version) text in Peru's Constitution is: "The President of the Republic has the power to dissolve Congress if it has censured or denied its confidence to two Cabinets.".
The President can't just dissolve Congress on a whim. Have the conditions stated in Peru's Constitution happened? Sounds like the conditions are a divided Congress that's unable to function, which obviously isn't true if they're all agreeing to impeach the President.
From what I'm reading, and correct me if I'm wrong, this hasn't happened and so the President doesn't have the power to dissolve Congress.
The President has the right to dissolve congress, under the constitution. That's what snap-elections are.
President calls snap election, then gets arrested. Western media immediately support new un-elected government...
