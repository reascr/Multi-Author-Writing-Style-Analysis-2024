Let's be fair... oil companies are basically already doing bad geoengineering as a side effect of their businesses. If we're going to clamp down on atmospheric geoengineering, lets start with the most obvious problems first.
I agree that atmospheric engineering is going to save the planet but we need some regulations and consensus before we start blasting shit up there using the guess and check method.
Edit: IMO, it’s always been sophomoric proposal by engineers who are ignorant of environmental science and think they know more than they really do. This isn’t a serious alternative to carbon reduction because the effects of CO2 emissions isn’t limited to heating, it’s also about ocean acidification, which this does nothing to help with.
Not unless it’s a research site where they deliberately emit CO2 to study the effects on the environment.
The last time I checked this kind of geoengineering is generally considered a bad idea by most scientists and is usually promoted by business interests.
No we aren’t. Geo-engineering implies a direct and deliberate attempt to modify the climate. CO2 induced climate change was never deliberately done for the sake of climate change, it was an unintended side-effect of useful technology.
It has been private enterprises that released chemicals into the atmosphere and changed the climate accidentally for over a century. Kinda refreshing for a private enterprise to be doing on purpose for a change.
