Bro as Israeli this isn't a step thwords fasicm, the public broadcastinng network sucks ass , the private ones are way better ( and they also oppose the government more than the public channel) the public channel network is getting to much funds and doesn't make enough profit or entertaining stuff to see.
Now regardless of that, basically all of Israel's news channels (except one) are against the government policies, the difference is that most of them are private-owned and the latter is funded with tax money, which in my opinion shouldn't be a thing because government owned channels can lead to bad stuff.
But the point here is not to shut it down completely but cut its humongous and unjustifiable budget to something more reasonable. Just for context, this channel has so much spare money that it has been producing its own series in a rapid phase (some are good and some are awful), but this just shows that even with a good cut it would still be able to deliver news regardless.
I'm in favor of fair competition, if the channel is good enough it can run on its own without taking hundreds of millions of taxpayer money. Historically this was the first (and for a long time the only) news channel Israel had, before other commercial channels started to air as well. In today's Israel this is something that is not needed and it's a huge waste of money (its budget is unnecessarily huge), I'm in favor of cutting it's funding and let it compete with the other private channels. If it's a good channel it would still be successful on its own.
So if they were in favor of the current government's policies it would have made it okay? Last time I checked journalists were suppose to be objective.
