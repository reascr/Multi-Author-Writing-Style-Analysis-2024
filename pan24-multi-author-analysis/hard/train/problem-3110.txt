Finland can then push for Sweden's membership from within NATO. The more the merrier. Assuming Lithuania means let a free and fully liberated Ukraine into NATO after the war, that seems like an easy yes also. Not sure if it's realistic or not, but if they're fully liberated then absolutely.
Edit: Looks like the above poster can't handle every NATO member's veto. They sent a long, aggressive PM about it. Yes, it sucks, but complaining here about the veto mechanism in a military pact helps no one when we can at least get one country past the finish line. From a practical standpoint, even just Finland in NATO would still be a net gain. Hopefully Sweden is permitted entry down the road as well, but if Turkey won't block Finland there's really no need for Finland to wait. Simply wipe the Cheeto dust off your fingers and look at a map. I love Sweden, Ukraine and Finland, and if we can get any of the three in then that's a positive.
I know Finland is trying to be a good neighbour as always, but if Turkey and Hungary say they'll approve Finland they should join first to get the ball rolling, and it does seem like Turkey might approve Finland on its own right now. Finland has plenty of Swedes anyways that Stockholm would want protected.
To quote the Finnish government: NATO membership is not so important that Finland needs to join before Sweden.
NATO approval needs unanimous consent, two countries are dicking around, and Finland has no major political power over them.
