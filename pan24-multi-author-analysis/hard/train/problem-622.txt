The problem with writing off the red states like that is that most of the farmland - and therefore where the country gets most of it's food - is in those red states. So sure, they get a lot of blue state money, but blue states get a lot of red state food.
But a union made up of blue + purple states is going to produce mostly blue results. And a red + purple union is going to mostly produce red results. the "mechanism" you speak of is merely voting. it would be super unlikely for a union of, say, blue + purple states to elect someone like trump. A red + purple union is unlikely to elect someone like obama. E.g. a Cali, Oregon, WA, + Nevada union isn't going to produce the same results as a texas, lousiana, florida, + georgia union. it is extremely likely that the two would look very different bc:
That seems unlikely. Blue and red states don't typically switch parties each election bc they're upset at current leadership. That's more of a purple state thing - and only then, bc of fraction of voters who identify as independents and people without strong party affiliation. In other words, most people don't swing ideologies broadly.
I don't think they'll attack us bc they are us. Almost all of us have friends and relatives in other states. Also, they'd draw massive global condemnation. Lastly, again, they need the funds for the army and red states are poor. Just imagine they institute a 10% flat tax, for instance. They'd be struggling to get anything done, let alone maintain a powerful army. At the same time, as much as I have serious qualms with it, robotic warfare is gaining ground and blue states tend to have the tech people. but again, I don't even think it'll come down to warfare.
