The most important thing to avoid was creating the reality or the impression that Russia came out better off, in any way, for its behavior. This would incentive both Russia and other thuggish regimes to act in similar ways in the future.
I don't think anyone now thinks the war has made Russia better off in any sense. Thanks mostly to the great courage and resolve of the Ukrainians, it is severely weakened and will continue to grow weaker the longer the thing continues.
So I think that's why talk may be turning to trying to give it some kind of "off ramp" again, even without everything Ukraine wants and, frankly, deserves. Under any deal with any chance of happening, Russia will end up looking like giant loser and its invasion a massive mistake in the eyes of the rest of the world.
And while it might seem to us like Russia would be unwilling to agree to such terms, their negotiating position is being degraded with every passing day. Consider that they have thousands of dead and wounded returning home every week, people who were once allies of Putin criticizing the invasion, and even external allies distancing themselves from Russia.
Russia surrendering occupied territories, restoring pre-2014 borders, and paying reparations to Ukraine for the damage caused would still be a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
The only diplomatic solution is Russia returning all occupied territory, commit to unilateral nuclear disarmament, remove Putin, and pay massive reparations to Ukraine and its allies.
Negotiations would cede Ukranian territory to Russia, which is exactly what they wanted in the first place, thus rewarding the aggressor.
What I've been reading is that Putin needs an out where he saves face. Giving up territory etc will destroy him with his own people because of the people lost in the effort to erase Ukraine from the face of the earth.
If we push Ukraine to negotiate, where will Russia strike next? What territory of another country will we allow Russia to seize?
