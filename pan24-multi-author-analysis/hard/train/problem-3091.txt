Biden has been amazing in comparison to any president in recent history. Saying he's not perfect really says nothing. Washinon, Lincoln and Jefferson weren't perfect either because there's no such thing as a perfect president.
Overall I don’t really care to debate it though because it’s not like I think Obama was terrible. I just think Biden has been great by virtually any standard you can hold the position to.
Biden has really won me over so far. I think the media's hyper-focus on Obama, followed by the insanity of Trump, had me used to breaking news happening every single day. Biden has been a great return to normalcy plus he's been surprisingly left of where I thought he'd be.
It's not enough to stop me from voting Biden - it looks like he's going to run and stability is important. But I wish he could nominate Kamala for another post and free up the VP slot for someone else without obliterating Kamala's career/life.
She was my personal choice for Biden's VP (was hoping for Kamala as AG), and I think she needs a lot more recognition.
