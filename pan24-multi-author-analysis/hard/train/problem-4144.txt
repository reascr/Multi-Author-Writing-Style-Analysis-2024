No. Zelenskyy knows that the public will never support anything Putin says. If Putin said “return to February border lines” the public would go “no, Ukraine deserves part of Russia!”.
Obviously this is something advantageous for Ukraine to which Putin will never agree. The issue regarding open negotiations like this between the invader and invaded would require the public discussion/admission of responsibility regarding things like troop numbers, civilian casualties, etc. that Putin really doesn’t want to discuss.
I suppose from my perspective, the 2 things I think would be bare minimum in this case would be to hold out until: relinquishment of all historically Ukrainian territory and membership in NATO to deter invasion in the future.
But to counterpoint your actual argument, if Ukraine secedes those land it gives Russia a base to claim even more territory based on its original argument. Meaning that even if Ukraine joins NATO that if enough Russians move into other Ukraine territories that Russia would again claim that they have rights over the land and they are allowed to go to war over that right. And because NATO/Ukraine let them get away with it before they would have to give into Russia's demands again.
If ukraine cedes land like Crimea, they can join NATO and avoid further conflict right there. NATO has a requirement for joining that you have no territorial disputes, hence why they couldn't join earlier.
Besides, if he doesn't want to look weak he needs a win. Anything is better then the nothing he gets by waiting.
