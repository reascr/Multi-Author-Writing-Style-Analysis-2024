Im guessing those numbers are either specifically for Utah or are complete bullshit, but when gender-affirming care happens the suicide rate drops to average.
I'm guessing the suicide-rate number is either an aggregate of the whole population, or just for people without gender-affirming care. That number is more important when discussing how to help people not currently receiving said care.
Meet the Press had an episode a while back where they analyzed a poll about general political beliefs. Without mentioning parties, people mostly fell into four categories: strong right/conservative, center-right, center-left, and left/progressive. It turns out that they split pretty evenly with about 17% each (not sure about the other 32%). So in theory, there's a bunch of people who are center-right/left who may be amenable to a party that more directly caters to them, since people at the ends of the spectrum are likely locked into their party already. The trick is figuring out what percentage of each of those groups is actually voting, then finding ways to get the non-voters into polling booths.
This gets brought up in a lot of different contexts--that the vote would be more Democratic if we just had more of the voting-eligible population participating in elections. However.
