It can. Israel claims it has been tested against guided missiles as well. However, this would not be the preferred Israeli system anyway. David’s Sling has much more range, carries more speed, and has a more modern targeting system and would be used.
Not necessarily. Ballistic can fly within the atmosphere, but at longer distances they probably won’t because it’s not practical. Arrow 3 would intercept like above Iraq, whereas Arrow 2 would intercept at much closer distances to Israel.
Israel has other systems against this kind of missiles, like Arrow 2 and 3. But I'm pretty sure there's no official known number of this missiles, especially since Israel hasn't used them (thankfully) in real combat, yet. So technically, it is a possibility that Iran will have more missiles here than Israel.
Iran and Syria, can easily shoot this missile into eastern Europe. Just looking on Google earth shows it can reach most of Ukraine, and all of Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and all the countries that reside in their area.
The best defence is offence - so I'm pretty sure Israel would prefer just bombing the shit out of all their known bases, as simultaneously as possible, to prevent any missile from launching into Israel.
The name of the game when it comes to Israeli (and American) missile defenses is to just have many different systems with different targets they are focused on.
The problem is more related to the fact that Arrow 2 is designed to intercept in the upper atmosphere, whereas cruise missiles fly much lower. David’s Sling and Patriot have targeting systems and maneuvering that are more suitable for that.
