You write that as if Turkey hasn't supplied Ukraine with drones that were critical for Ukrainian operations, or prevented the Russian fleet from entering the Black Sea in support.
This is also a country that turned down 15B USD to open their southern border for the US to have a second front in the Iraq War.
Russia and Turkey have good relations, but they are far from allies - it wasn't long ago that Turkey shot down a Russian fighter, and Russia called Turkey a bunch of terrorists and slapped sanctions on them.
Turkey literally fought Russia in both Libya and Syria while some of our allies in NATO helped the Russians in Libya.
And for the last, this is not a domestic ambitions issue, Erdoğan does not advertise this much and opposition is also not in favor of approval. There are actual problems between Sweden and Turkey, some of which i will link below:
In the mean time, is there anyway that Sweden / Finland are attacked and EU + US doesn’t back them up without Turkey and Hungary? As long as it’s just Turkey and Hungary holding it up… it is basically ratified. Someone could theoretically be dumb or bold enough to say… haha technically it isn’t completely signed so I will attack them now.
