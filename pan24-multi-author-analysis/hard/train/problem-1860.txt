The US has submarines with dozens of nukes each sitting under the North Pole ice sheet if Russia tries anything funny. In strategic nuclear limiting treaties, the US prioritized sub launched ballistic missiles and Russia prioritized heavy ICBM launchers. The whole point is there's no winning nuclear war so effectively the use of them is the death of you and your country.
Nuclear weapons have been far more powerful than Hiroshima for decades, and Russia is neither prepping nor priming one. The video in question shows a missile being loaded into a silo (which is where most ICBMs are stored), and includes some specifications about it.
In fact, at the very end of the article, the author states that "as an ICBM, the Yars is not a tactical nuclear weapon, and analysts doubt that resorting to unconventional warfare would deliver Russia any military advantage...however, Russian media have been pushing claims about its atomic capabilities.".
As if that matters. Launch one big one or twenty small ones, the end result is the same. Nuclear apocalypse unless the aliens I hope are watching step in.
