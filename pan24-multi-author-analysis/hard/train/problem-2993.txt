Food City usually has good deals on name brand soda, I think it's to draw people in to buy all their other over priced crap. I usually just go in and buy up the buy x number of sodas for a cheap price and leave.
Start buying more generic brands, I know generics are still high but not near as high as name brands anymore. It's the only way prices will ever come down, they won't drop them unless it's to compete with someone else due to sales dropping.
This may be a way of influencing price negotiations - if Tesco can get cheaper suppliers, they can cut prices and still make a profit.
People will go to the cheaper shop where there are multiple options and there frequently are in most British communities, especially with home delivery.
My point is that a substantial amount of people will pay for a cheaper product even if it's not necessary for them to make ends meet. Grocery stores usually sell more than groceries and if you take a peak at what's locked behind the glass doors, you'll have a better understanding of what's being stolen and sold.
I'm not missing the point. There's a black market commodity for just about anything on the basis that people want to save money.
