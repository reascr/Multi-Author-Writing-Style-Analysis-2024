That includes civilians too, so I wouldn't say that's an entirely accurate number. The "zerg rush" is often disputed as a theory because of the sheer size of the Eastern front of WWII: it's hard to imagine just how fucking huge the Kursk bulge was, or the size of the initial Barbarossa front. The Italian and French fronts that the Americans fought in were much smaller in comparison, though nonetheless as deadly.
Ironically enough if France didn't surrender so fast the drugs would have bitten Germany in the ass. Almost IMMEDEATLY after France's surrender the amphetamines were phased out... because the troops came down from their high and the following low was LOW.
If France would have kept going, EVENTUALLY they would have caught the German army during such a low period.
Addiction gripped the troops, constant theft of what was there, violence, some units completely unresponsive because of how knocked out they were because they were all high...
Doesn't matter, they're all cannon fodder - just get the next bunch of criminals and recruits / conscripts, pump them full of drugs and send them out to die.
Send masses of bodies at the enemy and make sure it is primarily prisoners and other individuals you don't care about anyways.
Seems Russian war doctrine hasn't changed in the past 80 years. Just like their attitude towards the West and a civilized way of life hasn't change in the past 80 years.
