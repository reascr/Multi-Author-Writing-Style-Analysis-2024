Xi Meeting Blinken would be very much out of the norm and there has to be a purpose to showing "sincerity" and "good will". I can't imagine anything coming out of a hypothetical Xi-Blinken meeting that would tempt the Chinese. Nothing of substance came out of any of the Biden-Xi meetings then nothing is going to come out of a Xi-Blinken meeting. Has any of the proposed US-China committees from the 1st (or was it the 2nd) Biden-Xi meeting done anything yet?
Your argument is that the Chinese wanted this meeting because this meeting was scheduled. Your argument is that the Chinese wanted this meeting so bad that Xi was going to meet with Blinken outside of diplomatic norm.
That’s why they both wanted to talk, and this whole incident is just a complete fuck up on the Chinese’s side imo.
1.	They are sticking with the story that this was a civilian balloon, thus no need for defense ministry to get involved.
Their defense is that it was a civilian balloon that somehow got lost, but as you acknowledged it is clearly military, also not the only one. Clearly their defense is bogus.
