Translation would be that Russia is planning to blow up a lot of (more) Ukrainian buildings killing a lot of civilians, and when Ukraine reports it Russia will claim that it is the "Ukrainian false flag operation" they warned about.
Translation: ruzzia is planning to blow up buildings in a false flag operation and blame it on Ukraine to justify the new ruzzian offensive Ukraine has been talking about.
“Buildings about to be bombed are not a Ukrainian false flag operation, but rather an attack by Russia.”.
What building can Ukraine blow up that would be more outrageous than what Russia has already bombed the hell out of? Hospitals? Russia did it. Schools? Russia did it. Apartments? Russia did it. Power plants? Russia did it. Movie theaters known to be full of civilians? Russia did it.
I am having a hard time to think of a target that Russia hasn’t already attacked in the past that would put rage the world anymore than what they have already attacked… my an embassy, but that wouldn’t matter much unless it was housing known staffers.
