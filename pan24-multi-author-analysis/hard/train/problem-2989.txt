I agree with you in the facts of the situation the comment is more of a joke as to the stark differences in actually maintaining your military equipment.
I fully support a non private healthcare system. It’s sad and disgusting that most people are one medical emergency away from bankruptcy or are going without necessary medication due to cost. Our system is a god damn joke designed to line to the pockets of even more elite.
The things we are giving them are older. As much as people complain there is a savings to not having to maintain all that equipment that’s sent over. It’s a complex system but you see on the Russian side what lack of maintenance and upgrading has done to harm their army. To quote one of my favorite Reddit comments of this was “they’re about to find out why America doesn’t have free healthcare” I.e. a well maintained arsenal of weapons.
In military weaponry and supplies sure. But if a no fly zone was granted that would involve NATO forces actually entering the war and using force against Russia which would be a huge escalation that everyone wants to avoid at all costs.
