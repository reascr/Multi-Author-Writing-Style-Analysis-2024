If you're an island nation such as Australia, defense against an amphibious landing force is paramount.
What is the amphibious landing force going to do? Where would they land? How would they support themselves? Logistically it would be insane, no way would it be militarily viable for anyone to even bother.
Australia must be thinking about deploying them offensively with forces overseas, which Australia has a long history of doing.
The intent of this purchase has to be offensive, with the idea of deploying them overseas in what conflict Australia may end up in.
It would take an enormous amount of resources, manpower and commitment to sustain an attack on Australia long enough to degrade its defences, secure a staging ground out of their reach and then mount a successful invasion.
In the event of a ground invasion of Australia, himars would wreck any landing expeditionary forces bases and landing areas while being practically invulnerable until the attacker gets uncontested air superiority. Itâ€™s the same reason Taiwan wants it.
