In theory, yes, but in practice I think IOC will fold here and exclude Russia and Belarus. And if France would join the protest they would almost certainly fold. FIFA folded and they are if anything even more corrupt than IOC. No matter how much Russia bribes a wide European boycott is likely to hurt IOC more than the missing Russian bribes.
I wish I was able to boycott this, but I've already been boycotting the Olympics since it became clear Russia would never face real consequences for systemic doping.
Not defending Russia but Norway has a lot of doping scandals aswell, which is sad because i thought our brothers and sisters in the west were better than that. Anyone doping should be banned.
Yes individuals should be banned for doping. But we are saying that all Russian athletes should be banned just due to the fact the Russian government forces their athletes to dope. Until Russia as a country can prove it won’t force their athletes to cheat, then no Russian should be allowed to compete.
The point is flying over your head. Russia as a country sponsored doping for all their athletes even forcing children to do it. Norway does not do that and can’t control their athletes doing illegal stuff.
