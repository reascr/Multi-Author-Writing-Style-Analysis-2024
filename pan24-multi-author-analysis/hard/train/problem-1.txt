I'm not gonna watch the video. I gotta keep my sanity. With that being said, what could we call for that they haven't done? The cops have been fired and charged with murder. That happened before the video came out, before the news of anything came out. The police department has been responsible about this.
Maybe police agencies should be not federalized but under one agency. No more sherriffs no more local police. Just state police. 50 states, 50 police agencies. Keep it simple.
Actual combat soldiers have much more discipline and a very narrow set of ROE. We are not allowed to go around and detain civilians and beat them up if the answers they gave us weren’t satisfactory. You would WANT a former combat soldier to be a police officer, but there’s always one or two assholes.
Police departments attract brutes, do nothing to screen them out, train them to be brutal, then protect them when they are brutal. Conservatives then overpay and over provision them, letting them LARP around with military gear. It’s America’s biggest gang.
