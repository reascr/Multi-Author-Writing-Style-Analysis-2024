Doesn’t that kind of set a precedent for them to stop a lot of things that are going on around the world though? Seems like it could turn into a grey area.
Well extraordinary rendition and torture would be considered terrorism, which would make our countries (USA and UK) terrorist states too. So by that precedent, anyone can blockade any US or UK cargo ship and this judge would rule that it’s ok?
Edit: instead of downvoting, would anyone care to explain what I’ve got wrong here? Isn’t the legal system based on precedent?
But the crimes as defined by the court aren’t different in severity. The court is suggesting that as long as you are committing crime against a ship that is flagged from a nation that commits terrorist acts, then it is ok. Dozens of countries would qualify for that. Whether it’s full on invasions, torture, etc etc they would all now qualify for their ships being blockaded?
Why was the ship allowed in the first place and not stopped by UK's law enforcement if the terrorism stance is valid? Doesn't the government lack of action make it an enabler of the said terrorism too?
