With the right candidate, he should pass the torch, without a good one, he should just keep going. Personally I do not believe Harris is electable. That said they’re some folks in the bullpen that could do it. Either way it’s too early to tell and if he’s going to punt he will keep it quiet for as long as possible.
Certainly possible, but I think that’s just him. If you are to build a national politician, you probably don’t start with a gay dude. Obama was super polished, but no fing way curated.
Ha I remember the “butterball hotline” that was actually informative too. People always rave about that show, but I don’t watch much tv, so never got in it. Thanks.
Thank you. The efficacy of the previous President's disposition is currently being discussed and deliberated in Congress. Any actions the President took, that were not explicitly forbidden by Congress are legal acts, due to the unorthodox nature of the job of President.
There shouldn't be a limitation on age after the minimum age requirement is met. There is a clear chain of succession as to who gets to be President if the President dies in office. The President should receive frequent checkups by military physicians in regards to competency, and health. That should be enough to trust the President is sound enough to do their job.
