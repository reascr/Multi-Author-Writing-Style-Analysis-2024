•	⁠Title X funds family planning clinics that offer the public voluntary family planning services and explicitly does not require parental notification or consent to participate.
•	⁠Deanda’s lawyers are requesting Kacsmaryk to prohibit the federal government from “funding any family-planning project in the United States that fails to obtain parental consent before distributing prescription contraception or other family-planning services to minors.”.
Or, loosely paraphrased, US District Pedoapologist Matthew Kacsmaryk found that a federal program that gives teens access to birth control denies a parent “a fundamental right to force his children to have children.”.
•	⁠the legal arguments Kacsmaryk uses in his decision ignore the distinction of coercive vs voluntary government programs in prior rulings and further argues that minors do not historically have the right or ability to consent (which is demonstrably false).
•	⁠furthermore, the principle that parents have a constitutional right to shape their child’s upbringing has been argued before the court before, and the previous rulings have carved out a distinction with regards to “coercive” government programs (that require or prohibit an activity) and voluntary ones like Title X grants to healthcare providers- no one is required to seek out health care services funded by Title X.
•	⁠plaintiff Deanda argues that Title X funding access to comprehensive public family planning services violates his right to “[raise] each of [his] daughters in accordance with Christian teaching on matters of sexuality, which requires unmarried children to practice abstinence and refrain from sexual intercourse until marriage.".
