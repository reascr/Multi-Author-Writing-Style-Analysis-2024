Militaries are documented as some of the most egregious polluters in history. Add to that the fact that governments get a large chunk of their revenue from trade and taxing imports/goods/services and you have a situation where polititians are not interested in upsetting the apple cart.
Edit: Ultimately, though, we are all a part of this massive and unyielding consumer society, and we all feed into the demand and profits of these companies. Imagine if we all stopped flying, buying stuff online, and started biking and walking everywhere? The world would be a better place, but fat chance of that happening.
This should come as no surprise to anybody. Even though they really should, companies don’t give a hoot about the environment unless it’s the one directly outside their corporate headquarters or the homes of the biggest executives and investors. Companies are in it for money at all costs; even the triple bottom line approach only really does lipservice for environmental causes. Buying carbon offsets is also a total joke since you need to maintain the protected area in perpetuity to make any difference, which often does not happen.
To achieve something similar, we could only allow sale of carbon offsets by companies conducting atmospheric carbon capture and storage.
