In the late 1950s, Japanese cars were widely ridiculed. 30 years later, a Lexus was a dream machine.
When Putin rose to power, lots of people in the West saw him as a technocrat, the kind of person who could engineer a Japanese-style rise from the ashes of defeat to a peaceful economic superpower. And if he'd bothered to learn the lessons of how Japan did that, he could have engineered that. Instead, he decided that his ideal model for how to govern would be the USSR, and never was smart enough to realize that the USSR failed, and doing the same thing over again was just going to lead to another failure.
I have a coworker who moved here from a country in the Middle East, and he said last week that Russia sounded like his government back in his old country: "The problems you face aren't because we're incompetent and corrupt and couldn't care less about your suffering, the problems you face are all because of Israel NATO!".
This. Also, at some point they would try to occupy a baltic country in one or two days, counting on NATO to not go to war over a country that doesn't exist anymore.
