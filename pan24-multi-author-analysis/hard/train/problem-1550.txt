That seems pretty reasonable to me, but it is way down in the article. Also, this makes a lot of sense:
Good points. Given how poorly the US scores on all of those metrics, Iâ€™d be interested to see what happens when a country intentionally encourages its own economy to import all of its goods.
US companies already pay import tariffs on components and finished goods imported, so it would be nothing new, other than in scale and structure. So, it would influence the "build here" versus "contract manufacture" decision, as well as add a level of consideration to where and how that contract manufacturing gets done.
I was primarily suggesting it for goods imported to the US. Of course, a lot of this would be goods made for US companies by contract manufacturers. But, I suppose the federal government could use their power to regulate interstate commerce to charge taxes on domestically produced goods. If you want to, for example, build office furniture using prison labor in Alabama, you'd face the same low score and high rate charges when trying to ship that to New York distributors, no different than a clothing manufacturer in China using Uighar labor camps to assemble "fast fashion" clothes.
As with any big change, it would be best done with a soft start, getting the key elements of the scoring system in place, with minor changes to the base rate, and then start cranking up the base rate, giving countries with poor environmental, labor, or human rights time to consider what access to the US market is worth to their economy, and US companies time to shop for new CMs.
You know what I'd like to see? A tariff system tied to a composite score based on environmental protection/decarbonization, human rights, and labor rights.
