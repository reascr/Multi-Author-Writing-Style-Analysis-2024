A friend of mine is a pretty experienced software engineer and he got a call from a recruiter. He went through a couple minutes of the usual recruiter spiel and then asked what the salary was. $19 an hour. He then gave my favorite response I've ever heard to someone trying to underpay you:
"I wouldn't even come shit in your office toilet for less than $35 an hour. $40 if you want me to actually do anything.".
Yes. I had a lawyer friend draw up the contract and incorporated over a weekend. There were a few more caveats he threw in, but he earned his fees and then some.
Sadly this story or a very close version of it happens again and again across so many industries. A numbers person thinks that the numbers on a report are the only thing they need to understand running a business.
So this is, in reality, a short term contract position. You should treat it as such as you know damn well twitter will be.
Yeah not many 26 year olds making 350k base at Twitter, trust me. 350k TC sounds about right for upper band senior engineer (and 26 is generally very young for senior at FAANG) but that of course includes stock options.
