The Florida Secretary of State during the Bush-Gore election was at the same time Bush’s campaign manager for Florida. In her capacity as Secretary of State, she purged 173,000 voters from the voter rolls, under the premise that these people were ex felons. It was later determined that this was by and large untrue.
