As Russia is dishonest about anything and everything, my guess here is that the attacks are going to stop anyway as they depleted their stocks of long-range precision weapons.
If Russia couldn’t beat Ukraine with the US’ hand me down weapons, they stand no chance against US advanced weapons.
And, the US would start pumping advanced military equipment into Ukraine. Ukraine’s been getting the middle tier arms from the US but an NBC attack would open the floodgates to advanced weapons, longer range missiles, etc.
Even if the people don’t rise up from hardship, wait until Ukraine takes back the eastern part of the country and starts lobbing missiles inside of Russia.
and Russia doesn't have forever, its debatable that the country itself will even survive the decade. their "three day special military operation" has rocked the country to the core to the point that their regime has panicked so hard at the sight of their "invincible" army being routed on the battlefield, that they declared mass mobilization and are in full survival of the state mode now.
The more Russia makes statements like this, The more clear it is that they are tired of fighting, they want the bleeding to stop, but they seem to have forgotten that after they published articles in the media stating their intentions to commit mass genocide against the Ukrainian people, and after betraying every agreement they ever had in regards to not attacking them. Ukraine will absolutely never negotiate now.
