2) weapons are being sent and reported with cash values such that aid packages always show a cash value that could skew perspective of, again, actual debt taken by the US Gov.
What is the basis of the dollar value ascribed to any equipment sent, is it replacement cost, is it original procurement cost, is it a current cost relative to a sensible depreciation schedule.
I would also mention the clear big winner from a MIC perspective is actually South Korea. They moved to 3 exporter in the world this past year. Mostly via procurement contracts to modernize other nato countries arsenals while they ship aging / retired hardwear to Ukraine as write offs.
As far as I am aware very little is being given to ukraine right off a production line / active procurement program. Therefore any money going back to defense corps should be from orders placed by Ukraine using their own defense budget, to some extent bolstered by US loans/grants.
I'm not really sure Ukraine is getting actual money to spend, I think it's mostly supplies and weapons. I really would like to see a balance sheet from the United States with details about where the money is going but I think I already know... Raytheon, Boeing, Northrup, etc...
