"The odd American idea that giving money to political campaigns is free speech means that the very rich have far more speech, and so in effect far more voting power, than other citizens.".
This is a fact. DRPK was never a part of the ROK. However, it is a lie of omission. The DRPK was never a part of ROK because both were created after a civil war which fractured Korea into two separate countries. It is clear the intent is for ROK + DRPK to reunify into one Korea.
Since China was unified by the coalition, and then fractured again by the Chinese Civil War, there is of course something to "reunify".
Mao Zedong proclaimed establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 after the de facto conclusion of the Chinese Civil War.
Always good to point out that this is a term of propaganda, as Taiwan has never been a part of the People's Republic of China, not even for a single day since the PRC's founding in 1949.
For argument's sake, let's start by assuming that today's "China" is synonymous with "the PRC". After all, it is a fundamental claim of the PRC government that China = PRC.
But as we all know, since the PRC was founded in 1949, not a single day has elapsed where the PRC has controlled Taiwan.
China considers Taiwan a part of China, not that the government of Taiwan doesn't exist. Taiwan has been making independent international decisions for a long time now and this is no different than any of those.
