One guess who said this in 1928 (clue - the first treaty his party signed was with the Catholic church called the Reichskonkordat):
No, the problem is mainly religion. Stalin and Pol Pot get trotted out, but I am happy to play a game. You pick someone who was an athiest and committed genocide, and I will pick a religious figure who committed genocide. You will run out before me. Hours before me.
Ok, this might come as a surprise, but our understanding of faith pre and post glacial (up to the early bronze age with Egypt/other near eastern cultures) is based on... modern anthropological studies of what we think were equivalent cultures. We just don't have any evidence pre-Egypt really. The female figurines tell you nothing as it is missing all the other context - you are dealing with 10,000s of years and 1000s of miles of distance. Whenever anyone propounds about early faith pre-Bronze age (meaning neo and earlier lithics), they are... full of shit.
As to our bloodiest wars? Crusades, the mass enforced conversion of idigenous populations worldwide helping to spread disease, the catholic church giving half of the Americas to spain and portugal causing untold suffering and murder, the British bringing christianty at the end of a gun, the Thirty Years War, St Batholomews massacre, the sectarian violence in NI, the islamic groups in china, Partition along religious lines in India that killed millions, erm.....
Not trying to be the asshole here, the biggest, bloodiest wars in human history weren't caused by religious figures and you can get all the religious figure genocidal numbers combined and they wont come close to the genkis khans, the stalins and the mao zedong.....and thats not counting the endless bloodshed in the aftican countries.
