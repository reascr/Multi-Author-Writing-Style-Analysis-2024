You're however very much right and exposing them to actors outside the US would be serious shit, or so my old job insisted.
And to be honest I would assume they do in fact run it by the various militaries, but I'm not so sure they would actually be liable for it as export control is an expectation of contractors working for/with the government.
Everything about an aircraft, including things like inspection, metal treating and painting processes that are by no means secret are always going to be export controlled. This doesn't make them by any stretch top.secret.
Not top secret. They were just export restricted. The documents are legal for someone to have access to inside the US, but trying to take it outside the US is illegal.
There’s various levels of classification/restriction that the community and media know fuckall about, and so they blow the whole story out of proportion.
So why don’t the various branches encrypt/block foreign IP addresses on their publications pages? You can download a shitton of US Navy training manuals for various aircraft straight from the training command’s website.
