Palestinian isn’t a religion and they warning about it because Christian’s are about the only people left in the Middle East who aren’t anti Israel and that can easily change.
This is East Jerusalem which isn't considered settlements; it's been Israeli land for decades where all non-Israeli residents were offered Israeli citizenship, and those who refused became residents. Only decades later did the Palestinian Authority appear and has since tried to claim East Jerusalem as theirs.
And apparently the Orthodoxy has held this land for 500 years but Palestinians are still claiming it belongs to them? They even protest settlements being built by Israel with land that has been sold to Israel by the Orthodoxy.
The article in this post (middleeasteye) try to paint a very misleading picture in which Israel just steal land from the Palestinians as they please. This is the new propaganda approach since 2021, and there are a lot of people who believe it - but it's not exactly true.
The Church sold the land in 2004 to the "settlers", but after the public outrage decided to cancel the sale. Unfortunately for them, you can't cancel a sell that already happened, there is no return window.
Oh but even the Church didn't try to claim the sale was fake. They tried to argue in court the Patriarch didn't had the authority to make it, but the Patriarch absolutely had it.
