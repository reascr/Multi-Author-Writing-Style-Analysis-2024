A few decades ago, I went to the Holocaust Museum in DC. At one point, you can go through or around one of the train cars used to transport Jews to the death camps. I went through and paused inside. I tried to imagine fitting as many people inside as the sign noted that the Nazis put in the car. I couldn't. Then, I realized that I was trying to fit people. Even with imaginary people, I was giving them basic human dignity. If I tried to fit human shaped luggage, I could easily fit that many people.
Sadly, the current Supreme Court would likely rule that no Founding Father ever wrote anything about puberty blockers so trans people don't have a right to exist.
"And by 'treating transgender families with more love and respect' we really mean preventing transgender individuals from getting needed care while demonizing them and claiming that they are trying to groom kids. Only by making them fear for their lives will they know just how much we love them because we fear anything and anyone that's even slightly different.".
It is. Every single second, dysphoria is always in the back of my mind. The times where I feel wholly content are extremely rare bursts of when someone goes above and beyond to affirm my gender and even still they do not last for more than a moment. My body is like a prison to me that I cannot escape out of. I came out at 14 and started hormones at 16 and even still I face so much damage that I will need to work so hard to undo. And I am one of the extremely lucky ones. Every day I reflect and am thankful that I was given the opportunity to transition, because not everybody is. Every day, I count my lucky stars that people in my life have been accepting of me. But that has not fully solved the deep and internal wrong that has been placed within the deepest depths of my body. Only medically, and eventually surgically transitioning will reach the final step.
