Or are you confident enough in your conclusion (that is entirely informed by the vague speculation of some random Russian nationalist) to be an asshole about it to anyone who implies that might not be true? You realize that the Russians have basically not admitted to any Ukrainian victory so far in this war, right?
I did read the article. Where does it say that the anti-Ukrainian hated-by-Ukrainians Russian nationalist in an occupied Ukrainian city was definitely killed by Russians?
An extreme nationalist, Mangushev said Russia was not at war with people, but with an idea of Ukraine as an "anti-Russian state", and it did not matter how many Ukrainians died.
Another extreme Russian nationalist, Pavel Gubarev, said everyone knew who was behind the shooting and observed that Prigozhin had for the moment gone quiet.
