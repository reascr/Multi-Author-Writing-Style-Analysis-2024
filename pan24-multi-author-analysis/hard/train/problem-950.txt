I wouldn't laugh at anyone making this mistake. I see a city name in an airport name, I assume it is in that city or at least a suburb of it with relatively easy transportation options to that city.
People (like me, I have used this airport in the past) who rely on cheap flights will also be willing to suffer through the drive there.
if it wasn't Ryanair using the airport with 20â‚¬ flights to Spain, the UK, Egypt etc, it wouldn't have been close to 4 million passengers at all.
Since it's only used by Ryanair, you could gather how many Germans travel to the Balearic islands or to another airport which misleadingly claims to be near a European city.
The Airport is in Rhineland-Palatinate which is governed by an SPD led coalition but the CDU led coalition of Hesse sold their shares of this embarrassing airport.
Hesse owned the airport (together with Rhineland-Palatinate) because once it was owned by the main Frankfurt airport but was never profitable enough. Then RLP sold its shares to a Chinese company which went into bankruptcy in 2020. Afaik most shares were controlled by a court appointed bankruptcy manager.
You go to the owners and say you want to buy and name a price. In this case it's an airport in the middle of nowhere which never turned a profit even though it claims being near Frankfurt, so the price is low.
