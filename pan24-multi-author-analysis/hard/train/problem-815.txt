Privyet. American here. I lived with some Russians once, have a Ukrainian friend, even know a Belarusian girl. I know you're all normal humans. Some people perhaps haven't had interactions with that culture. I for one love your culture, very solid. I tried learning Russian, no class at my university, but oh well.
