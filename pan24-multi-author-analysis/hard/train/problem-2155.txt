Ya, a lot of U.S tech companies aren’t happy with these trade restrictions. I am just a worker and a retail investor, but these decisions have also f’d me as well.
Great… these sort of things hurt the workers of these companies. My bonus was hit hard last year, and that’s on top of inflation too. So let me get this straight, the market is supposed to reign Supreme, except when it doesn’t suit the interest of the national security apparatus. Hey, maybe if the state has a role, do something about the housing.
Nice strawman. My arguement is this " So it’s pretty clear this is economic warfare, nothing more. The ghouls in the national security state are most likely hoping they can destabilize China and get it to do something stupid.".
I mean it is. The US is ensuring as best it can, that China doesn't replace them on the geopolitical stage. The US is looking out for their own interests by taking out potential rivals. Give it another 20 years, India will be the next oppressive regime that needs to be blocked.
