If I remember correctly, I saw an infographic a while back that showed the majority of space debris that poses a threat is due to irresponsible Russian activity.
it's a phenomenon in which the amount of junk in orbit around Earth reaches a point where it just creates more and more space debris, causing big problems for satellites, astronauts and mission planners.
Yeah I just watched a short video on it yesterday, if this debris hits another satellite and breaks that one apart, a low-earth orbit domino effect could begin and could render us unable to launch anything for a few years. While our gps satellites and other geostationary satellites would be unaffected by the debris, we would be unable to launch any rockets for a few years, which has terrifying implications.
There are "junk" orbits specifically for spent stages or satellites, we obviously don't put functioning spacecraft there. Other space craft, specifically science and exploratory missions often dump their junk into a heliocentric orbit, and a lot are straight ejected out of Earths influence. It's rly a number and saturation game.
