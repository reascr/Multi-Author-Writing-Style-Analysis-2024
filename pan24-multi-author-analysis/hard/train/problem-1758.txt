Only reason Russia can strike at Ukraine's power grid indiscriminately is the fact Ukraine can't hit back, US doesn't really share that problem as it could easily retaliate and deter any such strike.
If Ukraine had enough long range ballistic missiles of their own I somehow doubt Russia would be so eager to shoot missiles at their power grid and civilian infrastructure.
If Ukraine bought missiles from a NATO country, we would probably still stipulate that they could use them for defending Ukrainian territory but not for attacking Russian territory.
Of course they're not going to get them from the west, because everyone is scared of escalation, but I really don't see this ending without Ukraine either destroying their army completely, getting long range missiles or making pretty painful concessions to Russia.
Either way it’s kind of weird for them to give long range weapons for defense purposes..so essentially they’re just there as deterrence to additional Russian escalation.
More weapons to evict the Russian invaders so that this terrorism is pointless (which it mostly is already) is the only way to encourage them to stop it. And until that happens more air defence.
