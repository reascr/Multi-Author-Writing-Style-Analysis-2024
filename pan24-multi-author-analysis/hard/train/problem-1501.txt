The first would seem to require the occupation of Russia without too many nukes going off, at which point the Russian government’s objections to ICC jurisdiction stop mattering because the Russian government no longer exists. In which case a separate tribunal is not necessary.
In the second case (and assuming the new government ignores Article 61.1 of the Russian Constitution or lawyers around it, perhaps using Article 56?) then either the ICC can probably extend its ongoing investigation into the 2014 conflict (see or the UNSC will suddenly discover that the Russian Government is not going to veto a referral. In which case a separate tribunal is not necessary.
A lovely soundbite that doesn’t address the actual problem: How do you get Putin et al into the courtroom? Two possibilities exist: Either an outside force goes and gets them or there is a change of government in Russia and the new regime hands them over.
There should be no way this war ends and Russia isn’t completely isolated from normal world society until change occurs, or the current leadership is prosecuted. Meaning for me anyway, that cannot leave Russian territory without the threat of being arrested in nearly every country.
Unfortunately the Russian people don’t care enough now to remove Putin and his subordinates from power.
Such measures are probably counterproductive because it will just make it less likely than Putin will give up and instead will fight to the bitter end.
