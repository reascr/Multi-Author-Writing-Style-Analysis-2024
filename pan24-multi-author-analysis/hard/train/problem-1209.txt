Yup. Every administration has been telling them to up their defense spending and invest in their defense infrastructure. They didn’t and are now seeing the consequences. What annoys me most are EU politician complaining about the US profiteering from the war, when most equipment given to Ukraine has been donated, and of course were going to be able to supply Ukraine in a larger quantity, we’ve never stop investing in our defense. There was this article on politico, that mentioned that Europe wants alternatives to US arms (F35 in the articles) but none exist in Europe.
The US does want Europe to increase their defense capabilities, but it’s not going to lead to the US reducing their budget which is what redditors often imply. The US spends 3.5ish percent of its GDP on defense. It’s a lot, but it’s not exactly extreme when compared to the 2% goal for NATO.
What really isn’t ever talked about is since the US produces nearly all weapons in house, most of that money is filtered back into the country. Most small nations purchasing military equipment can’t say the same, so that money sort of is ‘lost’.
Having small meaningless go-it-alone items like that are just vanity project and lack the economies of scale needed for complex modern military equipment. You need the scale that China, the US, or the whole of Europe signed up before even starting a program. Going it alone and then trying to sell a system like a jet, is just pure program management incompetence in the name of vanity; ie perfectly French.
The "independence" needed is for France to spend 2% of its GDP on readiness in an efficient manner of its own choosing. Not for its makes 100% of its own shit.
What the allies need is actually a smaller variety (this is part is debatable) of coordinated equipment (this is not debatable) that ALL participants actively buy and maintain in a more evenly burdensome nature (this part is not debatable).
