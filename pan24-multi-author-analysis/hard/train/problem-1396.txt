> Honestly, I am skeptical there would be any way to end this 'gender war' without abolishing conscription system. Of course, most 'feminist' group support abolishing it - but many of them also support 'tweaking' compensation as well, so it's hard for young men to see them in a good light, given that almost everyone expects that 'conscription system' will persist for at least decades.
And I guess that this is why many guys don’t support them: they’re not fighting to end a custom that penalizes males, don’t want to share the struggle of mandatory military service BUT want to reap the same benefits without having to do it.
So it seems like women don't have an issue when men are conscripted but once the men get benefits for something like that they see the benefits as a problem.
In fact, they should be happy; women are entitled to the same benefits if they serve, and service is optional. It's the best of both worlds.
Are the same benefits given to women who voluntarily serve? If so, there should be no reason to abolish said benefits and no reason for the feminists to be upset...
