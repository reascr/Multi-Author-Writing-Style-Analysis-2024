"The Wyoming Republican Party is seeking to kill a bill working its way through the state Legislature proposing to raise the state's legal marriage age to 16, arguing that putting "arbitrary" limits on child marriage interferes with parental rights and religious liberty.".
Nope never. I just saw possibly the dumbest internet comment ever, saying a 10 year study proves all vaccines don't work. And then he left a ðŸ¤¡ emoji.
"Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.".
Yep. Children are not people, they are property, lumps of clay to be molded. They must never be allowed to have their own agency or will, any showing of either will result in a punishment that dehumanizes and traumatizes into obedience. They need to be indoctrinated that might makes right, that they will always need to listen to someone stronger, with more authority than they will ever be granted. They even treat their adult children like they are still young enough to be hit. They pressure for your career and childbearing, they withhold based on what decisions youâ€™ve made they donâ€™t like.
Yup, they donâ€™t want children to have agency and education on sex gives them agency. They want girls pregnant as early as possible to keep then imprisoned in a cycle of male dependency and obedience. Thatâ€™s (one reason) why they hate the LGBTQ+ so much - itâ€™s harder to get them in this cycle.
