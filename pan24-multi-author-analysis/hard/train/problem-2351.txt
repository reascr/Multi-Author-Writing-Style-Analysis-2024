AOC would have been a great choice but Pelosi and similar legacy power people in the Democratic party were too eager to let the right make her a boogeyman and intentionally handicapped her political progress despite the fact that she 1.) Appealed to a lot of young voters early on through her social media presence, 2.) Has a lot of policy positions young voters like and 3.) Has a great backstory.
DeSantis seems to be poised for a purely two-sided, party-line driven fight which is a bold choice given that Republicans haven't won the popular vote for President since 2004.
Maybe more than any recent candidate I've seen, it looks like DeSantis doesn't give one iota of a fuck what anyone who isn't a Republican thinks.
He doesn't give two shits about what actually happens, he got the message out to his voters that he is willing to do it, and that's all they care about.
I know heâ€™s not a likable candidate but even overestimating him is than him winning the presidency imo.
He's doing the same culture war bullshit his big orange clone did and if we're not careful it's going to put him right in office. Bad press is good press.
