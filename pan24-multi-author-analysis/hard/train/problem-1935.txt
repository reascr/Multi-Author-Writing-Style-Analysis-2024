Absolutely they do. Well, Kushner not so much (barring bribery charges), but Trump's value is heavily tied to his brand and his ongoing ability to do business. If the NY lawsuit goes through, he cannot do business there. That'd be a major blow to his empire. As I said, that's one court case of many, most of which are moving forward fairly rapidly.
Ivanka and Jared's lawyers are currently in a courtroom about Trump's richness, where they're not doing well. Among other things, the judge has the option to decide himself on the case, a bench trial--and Habba has given absolutely no reason for him not to.
So I would guess that those two, at least, are probably not the judges Trump would have liked reviewing the case. I'm not sure the en banc hearing would be significantly more favorable to him, either, if they even agree to rehear it.
Something his lawyer said just now: "I cannot tell you how unfair it is while they search, subpoena, and we don't put out any discovery ourselves.".
Thatâ€™s not how it was said. They announced they will not pay them if he announced period. According to the RNC, they would not pay the legal fees anyone who announced a run.
