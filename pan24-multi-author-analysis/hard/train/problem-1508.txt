I mean there is a way to look at it morally and to look at it pragmatically given that the current world is more divided geopolitically than past few years is it wise to sour relations with other countries. There ability to bring negotiate with people you fundamentally disagree with on some issues is important in our world.
Yes negotiating with people you disagree with is important. Yes if I'm negotiating with them I have a line in the sand that domestic freedom in my own country is non-negotiable. If I'm a diplomat and another country threatens to cease trade relations over our government allowing freedom of speech, then sorry guess we're not trading. And in this example if they actually follow through it will hurt them a hell of a lot more than it will hurt western countries, especially as renewables become more and more viable and their oil is worthless.
In a world where their upset ended at upset, I'd agree with you and everyone would think the people burning it were the bad guys and bullies. But the upset doesn't end at upset, it leads to terrorism and the murder of innocent people, not to mention that the very book is used as an excuse as an excuse for these same countries who are super pissed by a burning book to execute homosexuals and women who are raped if they didn't cry out loud enough because they might have actually enjoyed it and wanted it and now they're damaged goods who aren't virgins before marriage. At this point burning a Qur'an is also standing in solidarity with those who have been oppressed by Islamic theocracies and also standing with those who have been murdered and terrorized for the sin of insulting Islam whether it was drawing their prophet, criticizing the faith, or burning their holy book.
