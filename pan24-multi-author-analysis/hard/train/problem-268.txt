The question is whether those actions count as engaging in insurrection and who gets to make that decision. In practice, if the Democrats intended to make such a motion, they likely would have done so by now.
The point is before politicians at least did the right things not because they wanted to, but because they at least felt they had to. Now though. Not only is there no pressure to do the right thing, there is pressure to do the wrong things. Simply counting votes now gets you death threats if the results don't match the desire of certain parties.
Turns out being pieces of shit doesn't exactly correlate to winning over voters. And being pieces of shit obviously the only choice is to say fuck the voters fuck democracy and just seize control instead.
Yeah when you're gonna go full authoritarianism and stop supporting election results and openly try to overthrow democracy.... you MIGHT just split your party when you fail.
What's disgusting and distressing is that we're even here at this point and even have HALF of the republican party (not just A party but one of TWO parties) literally openly supporting authoritarianism at this point (while turning around and saying 'no democrats are the real authoritarians').
