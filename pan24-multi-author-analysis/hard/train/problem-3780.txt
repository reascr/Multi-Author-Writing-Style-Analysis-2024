If milquetoast liberals don’t want to protect vulnerable minorities, they should at the very least let us protect ourselves without tying our hands behind our backs.
When the Gestapo drags me and all of my trans sisters to the gulag, I’ll be sure to mention that one time my opinion was close to an NRA talking point. I’m sure that’ll get me off the hook.
I'll go with that. So to say 'you used to be able to own a large one of those, but now you can only own a small one', that to me is definitely limiting. And if the smaller one is overall less effective, then yes it's starting to undermine. And I think encroach applies also- when something used to be broadly permitted and is now restricted, that seems like encroachment to me.
Since at the time of the Framers there was a weapon called the Girardoni Air Rifle (a weapon that could fire 22 lethal shots in fairly rapid succession), and Thomas Jefferson owned two (he thought they were super cool, and he sent them west with Lewis and Clark), and NOBODY had any suggestion of banning them (especially as at the time civilians owned cannons, mortar launchers, even warships), it's very unlikely that this law would pass a text history and tradition test.
Imagine a state passed a law that prohibited criticizing the state online. A free speech proponent might sue and argue that this law is a violation of the 1st Amendment. If the law is allowed to stand while the case is argued, then numerous peoples 1st Amendment rights may be severely curtailed or infringed during the months it takes for the case to go through the court system. Thus, the judge will stay the law pending the outcome of the trial, basically say that the law is on the books but it cannot be enforced until/unless the court determines that it is acceptable.
It is, unless a court puts an injunction in place halting its enforcement pending the resolution of the court case, which in this case happened before the law was due to take affect. This is fairly common practice.
