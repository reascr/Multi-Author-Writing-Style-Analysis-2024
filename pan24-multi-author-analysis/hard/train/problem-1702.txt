12X more destructive as what was dropped on Japan is typical @ 180ktn. The W87 warheads used on the Minuteman III missile yield 300ktn each. This isn't that shocking. Russians have had vastly more powerful warheads at their disposal for a long time.
Russia's R-36M for example carries 10, 550kt warheads, for 5.55mt total. US' largest is the Trident II with 8, 475kt warheads, for 3.8mt total.
Largest single warhead the US has is the B83 bomb, which is just 1.2mt, and that's rapidly falling out of favor. Russia has more higher yield weapons than the US does, and more low yield weapons as well. High yields are their strategic arsenal, and their low yields are their tactical arsenal designed for their nuclear escalation to descalation policy (basically drop low yield nukes because no one has as many as them, so you're forced to escalate to full on nuclear war, or try and make peace). US' arsenal is almost entirely mid yield weapons today, as it has been for several decades now...
To break this down simply yield is not just a warhead anymore and hasn't been for a long time. Yield is the amount of coordinated destruction that can be leveled at a target... and all US nuclear weapons can apply more kilotons to an area more accurately and faster than anything Russian. For example.. the actual practical deployment strenh of the entire Russian SLBM fleet is only comparable to 2 Ohios.
The amount of "big" warheads outside of the unitary 1mt GLBM warheads is actually quite small for the Russian stockpile.
On a per missile basis in the real world a Russian MIRV is barely better than a unitary missile and a unitary warhead is about a third to a half the kilotons of an American version.
So while individually we do not employ single unitary warheads(pretty much at all outside of cruise) our missiles actually have more megatons per launch. Both the LGM-30 and the Trident 2 can carry more live warheads over decoys compared to Russian SLBMs or even their newer GLBM prototype.
