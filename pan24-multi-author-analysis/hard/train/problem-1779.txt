Probably really going to upset people by pointing out that Mexicans are also American (as are all Central and South Americans).
No thats stupid it's the name of the continent they're on not the fucking country they're in no Mexican or Canadian(barring dual citizens)will say they're American if you mention it to them.
I have never heard of any Canadian or Mexican identifying as "American". We do not call ourselves "American". The Term "American" is used exclusively to describe people from the United States of America here in Canada, and is treated as the USA equivalent of "Canadian" or "Mexican".
I'm Canadian and live in North America, but I do not live in the United States of America and so am not American in the traditional sense.
Well then it's settled. I'm North American, as I reside in North America. But I'm not American in the colloquial sense, since America isn't a continent. Glad we can agree.
Semantics. “American” is a colloquial shorthand for a citizen of the USA, used worldwide. Therefore a distinction is made and I am North American, but not American.
