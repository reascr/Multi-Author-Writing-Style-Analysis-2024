It all sounds very uplifting but those units are under Ukrainian Army’s command and no one will ever let them go to Belarus unfortunately. Because the West is gonna have a very strong say in it. And the west will never let Ukraine let it happen. Sorry for being a downer.
I do hope it happens but again, anticipating how putin and lukashenko’s propaganda are going to present this to the global community, I really doubt that Ukrainians who are going to be re-building their country at that point and aiming to get in EU and NATO will allow this to happen. They’ll probably find vaarious way to stop this unit’s members from even approaching the north borders let alone fighting anywhere except Ukraine.
The Belarusians who are fighting for Ukraine, and the ones organizing against Luka and Putin in their country, are doing what they've been preparing for all their lives.
Ukraine and Poland have trained several hundred Belarusians to fight Russia in Ukraine. The Belarusians in question have volunteered to fight for Ukraine. Since Lukashenko is a Russian puppet, I'd expect that opponents of him will pretty much all be opponents of Russia too. Of note, Belarusians have also been conducting sabotage in their own country to stop the Russian military from using the infrastructure.
If Belarusians are not Russians countless many will pour into geurilla warfare and partisan activity. Not that they can defeat Russia but i feel you are over selling Russia's ability to open a new partisan front.
