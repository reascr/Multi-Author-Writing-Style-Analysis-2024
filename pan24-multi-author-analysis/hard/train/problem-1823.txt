No it says itâ€™s their greatest achievement. And posting a pseudo-intellectual love note about how victimized communism is on a post about how dumb communist governments are is suggestive to say the least.
Parenti is a Marxist for sure, but his writing is not a "love note" to communism and rather a critique on how much anti-commie propaganda Americans ate up without realizing it.
The whole book is about Americans being so afraid of communism taking over that they didn't notice anti-communism had already taken over.
He wasn't writing a scientific paper. It's a collection of his opinions on topics that he put a lot of thought into. I don't agree with his way of thinking, but I can still acknowledge that he's got a style of writing that's engaging and quotable; aka "he's a good writer.".
At least they had a response so that's something. At first (months after they like had it mass infecting people) they called it a "mysterious disease" (It's obviously covid, like the rest of the world...just like how the anti-vacc people always say they "caught a cold" until they are dying in hospital) but sure, if they mitigated it, great. I know people are going to make jokes they just shot the infected, but they actually did do lock downs, something they have going for them is the people pretty much have to do what the gov says.
