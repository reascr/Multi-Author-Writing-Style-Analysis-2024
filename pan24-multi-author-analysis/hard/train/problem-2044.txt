FiveThirtyEight just did a podcast about this. Because they're FiveThirtyEight they tried to argue both sides, but it's inevitable that the Boomer chokehold on our politics will diminish in the coming years.
I think the political world is in for a major sea change as the Boomer generation begins to “exit” and more Gen Z, and by 2028, gen Alpha comes of age to vote. Younger people are incredibly, progressive, and they’re voting in unprecedented numbers.
Also, despite the hippies, today's youth are documented to be far more progressive than any previous generation. And if you click the link in my previous comment, you'll see that unlike Boomers, millennials are not getting more conservative over time.
I realize. Because they grew up in a time when college could be paid for with a fart and a candy bar, good paying jobs were much easier to get, and the general cost of living and something like a home was affordable. When entering the the workforce they didn't face the worst recession since the Great Depression. Throughout their careers-- they didn't experience the slowest economic growth of any generation in history. They never had a looming climate crisis posing a massive threat to their and their kids' future. No wonder Boomers don't care for radical change!
Not until the Boomers die off enough to become electorally irrelevant. Once that happens the Republican party as currently construed will be truly dead and politics will become much more progressive based on Millennials and Gen Z.
