That can be true and it can still also be true that they've already lost. If they do escalate to extremes like nuclear attacks, that all but seals a loss for Russia by guaranteeing they get nuked off the map in return. Russia's gonna lose, the question is whether there's any winners or we just all lose.
What I would add as a clarification though is that because Russia has lost does not mean Ukraine as one. Its well possible to have a result that means that while Russia has lost completely, so has Ukraine.
I would rather say that Russia has lost the Ukraine war however, as even if they end up being able to declare victory the cost of that victory is already far higher than the potential gains.
They may have lost the war but they stubbornly fight on hoping to overwhelm Ukrainian resistance with sheer numbers of canon fodders so it isn't over until the last Russian soldiers left Ukrainian border.
So if I get this right Russia sacrifices hundred thousands soldiersz thousands of tanks, IFVs, artillery pieces, hundreds of jets and helicopters just so they can deplete NATO's reserve ammunition?
