It DependsÂ©. It's possible that Russian oil was always the better short term option despite being the worse long term option, and this will kick short term profit focused corporations into actually making the better long term move.
Plus it doesn't matter for the purposes of sanctions whether India buys and resells Russian oil, all that matters is that Russian oil is having to be sold at a price much lower than the market price. You wouldn't want to drive Russian oil out of the market entirely because that would push the price of all oil up and hurt developing countries. This mechanism of a price cap that only affects the price of Russian oil is very clever.
The whole measure with the price cap was to prevent Russia from selling its oil at a profit, but still keep Russian oil on the market to prevent a price shock.
If it costs Russia, say, $40, to pump and export oil then a price cap that reduces their selling price from $100 to $50 doesn't cut their profit by 50%, it reduces it by five sixths, all without creating an oil price shock that would hurt poor countries.
If Europe imports Russian oil from India, then it means that Russia has enormous losses, because it cannot sell it at the same price directly, but must hand over its profit to India (not to mention the cost of the detour that the oil must make, once to India and then back again). India can sell the oil only for the price of the world market, for India's profit and the extra cost Russia has to compensate with discounts.
The volumes of oil products bought from India are a small fraction of what was being bought from Russia.
Banning Russian oil products lowers the prices, which India and China buy cheaply. Russia also loses a ton of oil revenue.
