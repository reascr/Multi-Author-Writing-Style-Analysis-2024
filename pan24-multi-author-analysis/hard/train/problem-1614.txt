Qualified Immunity is not even an official law, it’s just something the SCOTUS decided for themselves exists. It’s one of the worst examples of the excesses of the Supreme Court.
Enforcement of these rules? Ha yes isn’t that a sticking point, right? Considering police constantly find themselves not guilty of any wrongdoing, take the process out of local PD’s hands. Civilian municipal and city officials handle these. They’re not allowed to use police-sourced or ex-police consultants for these. Military is ok, FBI is ok. If they need them.
Finally, police found to be unresponsive or refusing to respond to calls will be suspended until a federal review and investigation. No more Uvalde, no more police choosing not to enforce the law as punishment or protest of policies they don’t like. For reasons why this is necessary, again, see Uvalde, and also Seattle PD, for the past few decades. I’m sure there are other examples of cops refusing to do their job to purposely fuck over people because they’re mad about policy changes or being held accountable for their mistakes.
Which in turn is decided by the unions, all the evil shit we see from police, like protecting and reassignment of abusers, is usually done by the police union, it's the quintessential example of how unions can end up going wrong.
Yeah, the Policeman's union is a terrible thing, but not because of it being a union, but because of the laws and regulations (or rather lack of) that allows people to challenge police officers (in court) or file complaints/suits that actually matter.
Or just end qualified immunity already and let the problem work itself out once police departments can effectively be sued for unnecessary use of force.
That way individual police departments can’t give special permission to use dangerous methods. And they suddenly can’t use any force at all without clear steps and requirements to be cleared.
