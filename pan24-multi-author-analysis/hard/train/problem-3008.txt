I work with children and families. Last night I was in a session with a parent and I mentioned that her son could use some additional practice on rhyming words... which is a very basic skill preschool-aged kids sometimes struggle with. She immediately went on a tirade about our response to COVID and how it has impacted our kids developmentally.
Don't get me wrong... of COURSE the pandemic has made an impact on kids in a myriad of ways. It impacted all of us. But I was caught off guard at how quickly we went from "Here are some ideas for your son" to "The Dems destroyed our country with COVID!".
Idk. I guess its working for DeSantis in Florida. I just don't really understand who this was supposed to convince that's not already living in their media bubble.
Yeah, this is a speech that was vetted by a lot of people. It was an opportunity to make their case in front of a much larger and more diverse crowd than they get during an appearance on Fox News...and the higher ups in the party all decided that the best way to do that was an angry 15-minute stream of vague culture war buzzwords.
