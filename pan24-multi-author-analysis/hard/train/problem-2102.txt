It's ludicrous to tell people they need to pay into a system for decades with the promise that when they hit a certain age they get to retire and they'll be taken care of and then turn around a few years before they try and collect and go "sorry, we mismanaged it. You need to work a few more years before now ".
It's even more insane to also put the burden on new workers to have to continue paying into a system the same as everyone previous but be told you won't get as much and it'll be later in life because the very people enjoying those benefits now didn't budget right.
In the US. Labor productivity has increased 300% between 1950 and 2018. Why should none of that go towards longer retirements? Labor generates 3 times more wealth today than it would have in 1950, yet most of that money is not translating into the hands of the actual laborers. Obviously, France is a different country but they face similar issues even if the numbers end up being different.
Wealthy inequality has only gotten worse across the World. It does not always have to and should not always fall on those doing the actual labor to sacrifice while the rich just continue to make more and more money.
They've been very generous giving the better part of the value of their labor to blood sucking parasites who do nothing of value for anyone (the wealthy class.) It's time they pay it back.
