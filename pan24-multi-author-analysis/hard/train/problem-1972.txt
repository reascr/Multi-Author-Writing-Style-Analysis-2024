Once Russia descends into inevitable civil war, NATO will move in and remove their nukes like they did to Ukraine.
We’re not talking about russia losing in Ukraine, we’re talking about escalating the conflict by annexing a country into NATO. Also, there are a few ways shapes and forms Russia losing in Ukraine could result in nuclear war, they might not be likely, but impossible?
And honestly, it's pretty obvious that if NATO has something pointing towards Russia, it's a good chance that this is nuclear; if NATO goes hand to hand with Russia, is going to be on a nuclear scale.
I'ts important because its not the same "nuke us, we will nuke you back and we will have a good chance of surviving" than "well, everything's fucked up now." Specially because during the first weeks of the Ukrainian war I read a lot of people talking shit about the nuclear stockpiles of Russia being defective or whatnot, as if this would make a difference.
The fact of the matter is the West is giving material support to Ukraine and Russia has threatened nuclear war over it numerous times. Clearly the West isn't worried about it.
