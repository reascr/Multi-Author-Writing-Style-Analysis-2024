A blockade, SEAD, and missile campaign for months huh? So what's China going to do after month 3 and their economy has fallen apart because it's completely dependent on trade and the world shuts their doors to them, and much of their manufacturing base relies on TSMC.
China's only effective way to counter would be to try and sink the US Navy, and to destroy the airfields in Japan they would make use of, which would just cause world war 3, so they dont get Taiwan in that scenario because we're all dead.
The conflict I foresee would be China blockading Taiwan, forcing a Berlin airlift type operation for 23 million people, and forcing the US to have to be the aggressor in order to defend the island.
If you're American, imagine the UK trying to pull off a stunt like this. Millions of plainclothed British soldiers sneaking in, trying their best to be American. Wearing cowboy hats and having shitty southern accents, all while occasionally calling dinner tea and driving on the wrong side of the road.
It would take a lot more than 3 ships and a couple dozen planes to invade Taiwan. If it ever happens, the world will be watching the build up for weeks.
