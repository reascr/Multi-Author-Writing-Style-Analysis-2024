I suspected as much though it wasn’t hard to figure out. Anyway as someone who’s not too in tune with Israeli and Iranian relations other than surface level stuff, can someone explain how Israel is able to do this without repercussions. I would imaging drone striking another country is a pretty brazen violation of sovereignty. Is it the case that everyone knows it’s Israel but it’s not official that gives Israel enough plausible deniability to not have any consequences,idk. Maybe someone more informed on the matter can explain.
Out of curiosity to what extent think Israel would intervene militarily of they felt Iran was very close to attaining nuclear weapons. From what I’m seeing it seems like they are more than will to do targeted drone strikes as it is, but do you think Israel would ever escalate further than that if they felt Iran was very close.
That sums it up pretty well - there is also Iran's nuclear program, which Israel has attacked before ( with the help of the USA - ).
Israel has attacked Iran before in response to this activity, and Iran isn't really in a place to declare war on Israel and all of its Allies, so the cycle continues.
Iran funds Hamas and other terrorist organizations which regularly attack Israel from Palestine and Syria, as do many other surrounding Arab nations.
Well considering Iran provides Hamas and other militant groups weapons to attack Israel it makes them a legitimate target. Not to mention all their threats to wipe Israel off the planet.
