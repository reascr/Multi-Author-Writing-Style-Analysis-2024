Compared to other countries, Norway extracts this resources with the most care for the environment.
Even more is that Norway sees their oil and gas reserves as property of the state and uses the funds from these resource to fund their citizens pensions and their sovereign wealth fund.
Norway themselves consider the windfall profits from the fossil fuels crisis to be unfair profiteering and want to return there ill gotten gains to a needy country.
So in Norway, hydrocarbon revenues were extracted by a nationalised corporation and the profits from this were invested into the Sovereign Wealth Fund to provide for all Norwegians.
Now Im not interested enough in what is potentially a bad faith argument from you to go do more research as to how many board members of Shell over the years have had links or were politicians in the VVD. But I will bet its going to be a reasonable number.
Im gonna bet the friends of the VVD have enjoyed their increased wealth from syphoning revenues from the Groeningen fields.
