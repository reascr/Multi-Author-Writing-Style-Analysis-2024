⚡️ Russia is already launching fewer missiles at a time and increasing the intervals between attacks, — Andrii Yusov, the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine says.
He noted that the Russian Federation used "everything that can move" against Ukraine - launched "shaheds" and fired from S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems.
I just saw the recent videos of Ukrainian soldiers intercepting Russian cruise missiles with portable anti-air weapons. The missiles are moving so slowly. Are cruise missiles suppose to be that slow (hence "cruise") or is it just with those particular Russian missiles?
Most aircraft attacks are done by using jets and bombers as cruise missile launch platforms within russian borders.
Theres been a lot less direct incursions by jets since Ukrainian anti air has stepped up over the last 4 or 5 months.
The side benefit of the UAF drone strikes is that the Russian military has to go on high alert and hits their own munitions and vehicles. UAF does not have this problem.
