Realistically no one's going to have a baby because the child benefits rise by a couple of Euro a month. This is a measure to keep up with inflation. Even with out goversafety nets and subsidized child care having a kid is still a net drain on your income and can be a hiccup in your career.
Also, rich Households have to pay less Taxes per Child, making them gain more Money through having Children than poorer Households, which is IMO quite unfair.
There is certainly a relationship between affluence and fertility rates though I am not sure if job loss in a wealthier country would lead to more children. People might choose the opposite, since kids cost money and earn little or no income. In a poorer rural economy it could be kids become more valuable from an economic perspective.
If the intent of these changes is to ensure that lower income families can raise healthy children then that is great. If the intent is to stimulate birth rates then this needs some rethinking.
But you're right: it has proven to be true that government incentives for having kids tend to have little effect on birth rate.
