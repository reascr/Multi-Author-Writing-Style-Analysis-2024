Interestingly, Stonehenge has nothing to do with the original Druids. Stonehenge predates them, by quite a bit. Moreover, from what we know of actual ancient Druidic ceremonies, they were generally conducted in woodlands, not in stone ceremonial spaces.
So why the association of Druids with Stonehenge? Apparently, this dates back to the late 18th early 19th century, when antiquarian interest in Stonehenge really got going in England, at the same time as antiquarian interest in pre-Christian religions, and Druidism in particular. It was simply assumed that the Druids must have built Stonehenge.
Funny thing is the druids didn’t have anything to do with Stonehenge’s original purpose. Druids were Celtic, a people who arrived in Britain around 600BC. Stonehenge was built something like 2000BC.
The last known construction at Stonehenge has been dated to 1600BC, and the large famous stones are dated to 2500BC. The celts didn’t migrate to England until around 800BC at the earliest. It’s a stretch to say they contributed to Stonehenge’s construction and goes against evidence.
What I find fascinating about this is that there is absolutely no cultural memory left from the people who built Stonehenge. Not a shred.
Whatever practices and beliefs those celebrating yesterday have, they are completely disconnected from the builders of Stonehenge. At best they might be somewhat connected to people who found Stonehenge built and used it for their own purposes, much like they are doing these days.
Yeah, people tend to mistakenly think the builders of Stonehenge were Celts, who’s religion we at least know a little about. The builders of Stonehenge were much, much older. Their beliefs have been washed away by successive migrations of people.
