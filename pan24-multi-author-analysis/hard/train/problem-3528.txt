Classification can be something like a sensitive piece of information (sources, methods), or a specific combination of unclassified pieces of information (names + location + dates) can actually make the document classified. Documents have what's called a Security Classification Guide that outlines all this.
Apparently documents can get classified for all sorts of reasons beyond national security. Reasons can include "better safe than sorry" to "now it's someone else's problem" to "I have a stamper and like feeling important".
Since nobody was actively looking for any of these documents; they’re probably going to turn out to be irrelevant or out of date paperwork that just got misplaced during the move from office to office.
Apparently documents get misplaced all the time. It’s only the important stuff that anyone goes looking for. People think labeling something “classified” or “top secret” is the same as “important” or “vital to national security.” More than likely these are going to turn to be either relatively unimportant, or just out of date.
