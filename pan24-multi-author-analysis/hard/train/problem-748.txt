These aren't soldiers though, these are mercenaries, mostly convicts, used as expendable fodder. Don't think they pretend to be on the good side, a lot of them just want quick money and an amnesty for their crimes. I suppose the only way to keep a bunch of armed murderers and rapists in check is with these sorts of punishments.
There’s a reason they’re resorting to such brutal punishments for the convicts. They’re rebellious because they’re being sent into certain death.
They probably don't care if they can fire a weapon, their main purpose on the battlefield is just to draw Ukrainian artillery fire so their commanders can see where it is.
They send the convicts in to get fired on by the Ukrainian artillery, so that their real soldiers can spot the artillery’s location.
Those convicts are being used as absolutely nothing but cannon fodder to tell where the Ukrainian artillery is.
Right. There's two different types of Wagner soldiers, the convicts who are used as cannon fodder, and the real Wagner mercenaries, who are trained veterans.
Actually I think some units of the regular army is worse, as they have a tradition of hazing and physical/mental abuse where as Wagner appears to be cruel but at least somewhat disciplined.
