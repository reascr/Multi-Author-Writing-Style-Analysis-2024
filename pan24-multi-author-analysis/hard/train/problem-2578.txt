I just hope that if you are having mental health issues (like so many of us do), you turn to a professional rather than self medication.
I guess I think reducing overdoses is a successful effect of a policy change and something worth fighting for.
I see a couple problems with only affordable testing. Tho, again, it is better than what we have now. .
Well. I would say decriminalized. People shouldn’t be lockup for self medicating. I will never agree with speed or heroin dealers making that cash on lives they helped destroy.
There are a couple ways “street heroin” is dangerous. One is the addictive nature which you mention. The other is fentanyl contamination. My nonexpert understanding is if you look at overdose death numbers you will there is a massive spike in deaths in recent years due to unintentional ingestion of fatal doses of fentanyl. Regulating recreational opioids will not eliminate addiction or overdoses, but perhaps has the potential for eliminating that spike in fentanyl overdoses. This goes for some other recreational drug use because I’ve read stories about people dying the fentanyl when taking something they though wasn’t an opioid at all.
Sure, but even after reducing overdoses and other impurities there's still the dramatic health effects and addiction that will ultimately lead to death anyway.
What makes street heroin dangerous is the chances of it being impure, other than that it's just as dangerous as any form or legal heroin. Still just as addictive.
