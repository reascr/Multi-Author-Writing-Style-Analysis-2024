I think it’s time we realize that India will never be a solid western partner. Strategically it has long and strong bonds with Russia since the Soviet Union. They won’t break from them.
Regarding the west they are only interested in the potential economic value and acquiring Western weapons, but beyond that that’s it. India doesn’t want to become part of the west so much as to become a competitor to the west. And they have proven that by still dealing with the Russians and indirectly aiding the Russian war effort by allowing Russia to skirt the sanctions via the Indian market.
The only reason why Europe even cares as much as they do is because Russia is a threat to them, if India invaded Bangladesh the sanctions placed on them would be a joke compared to what Russia got hit with.
Yeah this tells me you don't understand geopolitics if most countries don't care about india why is there a g20 in India why are redditors then complaining about india russia.
Do you think Ukraine gives a flying fuck about all the warring issues in the subcontinent between Pakistan, India or China etc? Why would India have to give a shit about what's going on in Europe. As soon as the conflict started, Indian students in Ukraine were being attacked and abused whilst trying to get to safety. And yet apparently India needs to take Ukraine's position on this situation instead of her historical ally. For some reason.
Anyway, Russia stood firm and protected India from US meddling and indirect aggression. An absolutely wild situation where the US and India, both major democracies, ended up allied to Pakistan and the Soviets respectively. And that's down to US behaviour at that period.
