Yes, exactly. And they are also in power. People in power seek to further enrich themselves and use money to reinforce their rule. Therefore, the Taliban has a vested interest in letting this deal continue because it would disproportionately benefit them.
No, read the comment again lmao. That's literally what I said in the comment you're replying to. The Taliban are the people in Afghanistan who have the most reason to strictly adhere to this deal because it seeks to greatly enrich them personally.
The Taliban isn't doing any of the extraction, that's the point lmao. The actual work will be carried out by the Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Company (CAPEIC). If the Taliban were to try and kick them out, they'd be left with a bunch of highly advanced extraction infrastructure they have no idea how to operate.
Ok, so what is to keep the Taliban from accepting the money, having China build the extraction/refinement facility, then kicking them and keeping the money and infrastructure for themselves?
