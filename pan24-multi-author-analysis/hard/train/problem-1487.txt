The motor boats were sunk in the island chains at the delta of the Dnieper river, where it flows into the Black Sea. In November, Russian forces retreated to the east bank of the strategic river, which bisects Ukraine and flows through several major cities.
A Russian warship was sunk in the same area on January 10 by Ukrainian artillery. While it was unclear what class the vessel was at the time of the sinking, an infrared photo accompanying the announcement showed what appeared to be a patrol boat on fire.
Following the reports of the sinking of the five motor boats, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry did not update its tally of Russian ships destroyed by its forces, perhaps indicating that they were too minor to count or unconfirmed.
A total of 18 Russian warships and other vessels have been destroyed by the Ukrainian military since the war began on February 23.
According to the Ukrainian navy, on Tuesday there were 12 Russian ships were in the Black Sea on standby for combat operations. Three of the ships were armed with Kalibr sea-to-land missiles, which the Black Sea Fleet has sporadically used to bombard Ukrainian positions.
They targeted the Russian Black Sea flagship the Admiral Makarov. They were not targeting “nothing of military significance”, I’m not sure what’s confusing about that?
Fairly insulting, and doesn't square with the capable defense we've seen from them throughout this whole war.
Using what is happening to the Russians to comment on the state of modern warfare is a poor argument. Since the sinking of the Moskva, it has come out that the ship was barely functional, it's engines were well overdue for replacement and locked to a max of half throttle, only 1 or 2 of the CWIS guns (of 6) were functional, they couldn't use the radar for the SAMs without loosing communications, and the rest of the weapons were non-functional.
