Say McCarthy was getting the 212 instead of the 203, the reps voting against him still want a Republican in the position, but they just didn't want their names attached to him specifically being elected. You get them to pass the rules amendment, they can still vote against McCarthy, but McCarthy would still win.
But since the Dem is the one in the lead, the only way that happens in this scenario is if the people voting against McCarthy are so dead set on him not getting the spot that they're willing to let the Democrat take it instead.
If nothing else, Democrats throwing around their power to get someone other than McCarthy elected makes them appear powerful and gives them symbolic control of Congress (“even without a majority, we get shit done”).
Does expelling one Republican congressman really benefit the Democrats enough for them to support McCarthy? Santos certainly deserves it but I think the Democrats would need something more before they'd support McCarthy.
I kind of wonder if McCarthy would consider a deal to get a few Dem votes in exchange for Santos getting expelled. That feels like something everyone could rationalize to their respective parties.
If a deal like this is made, it does happen. If he becomes Speaker he is going to have to cut deals at some point or he will be forever be beholden to fringe groups within his party. This signals to the Dems he can be trusted in situations where he does need some bipartisan support. It signals to Repubs fuck around and find out. I'll find some other way and then punish you for not falling in line.
