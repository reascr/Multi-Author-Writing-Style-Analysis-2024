(Just to clarify im not hoping this happens just stating what the likely response would be. Id prefer that Belarus becomes a democracy but there is no way Putin would allow such a thing to happen while he already has a military presence in the nation.).
Oh. Does Google Earth use regular aerial photography to supplement the satellite photos? I didn't know that.
But, of course, if Google Earth offered that kind of detailed aerial photography to me for free 10 years ago, then the United States may well offer the results of better aerial photography to Ukraine now. Chances are the main obstacle to the mole screening program would be that Ukrainian military strategists have no interest at all in seeing pictures of Belarusian soldeiers' moles.
Maybe a good way for NATO to communicate its interest in Belarus would be to send text messages to soldiers in Belarus who seem to have moles that a dermatologist should check out.
Perhaps NATO should do some more military exercises on Russia's and Belarussia's other borders to even things up. Maybe they could blockade some of Russia's ports & shipping while they're at it.
