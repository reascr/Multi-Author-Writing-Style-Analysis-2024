The Racist and anti racist skinheads referenced in your link are not the creators of the phrase or the sentiment, as I said it started many decades earlier at the very least, but they are on the long and varied list of groups who believe ACAB. Police corruption and lack of accountability is a major contributor to violent gangs in a number of different ways.
As I understand it, the meaning of ACAB isn't that every individual cop is as blisteringly corrupt and violent as the next. It's more that the bad apples do spoil the barrel, and that every 'good cop' is guilty of enabling the real bastards, if not actively aiding and abbeting thier corruption.
There are some truely upstanding cops out there, but even the most pure of heart has to choose some level of complicity, or rejection and abuse from their peers.
There is only so much a good cop can do on their own if they're going to continue to be disadvantaged/ostracized for reporting misconduct.
If you don't think it's alright for anyone to be a police officer in our current system, who would be responsible for ensuring our laws are enforced? Who are battered spouses supposed to call to get out of the situation safely? Who are people supposed to call during a home invasion? Everyone just left to their own devices?
