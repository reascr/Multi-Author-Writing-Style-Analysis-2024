Maybe convert it into a Ukrainian university or museum after it is de-mined, swept for electronic spying/warfare equipment, and assessed for health and safety.
Because you look to the fringe, literal Nazis and white supremacists in this case, you have no rational outlook. You should feel shame, but I suspect you have no issues because they are your kind of people.
You can have sympathy for them. I certainly do. The story of them being ordered to dig trenches in the Red Forest has stuck with me for the better part of this year. But if they're not killed, and they do not leave, they will kill innocent people, take their homes, and contribute to genocide, whether it was their idea or not.
Rooting for Ukrainian victory and not rooting for the death of Russian soldiers are, unfortunately, mutually exclusive at the moment.
So are you telling me you think thousands of dead Russians for a patch of field in a strategically unimportant area is of equal or greater relevance to Ukraine retaking Kherson and forcing Russia to retreat across the Dnieper that they had previously used as their major defensive zone? And they have now announced a planned withdrawal from the Zaporizhzhya region as well?????
Oh, come on now. You’re acting like this is the same country that tried to take Kyiv by repeatedly dropping paratroopers into a Ukrainian encirclement of Antonov airport… over and over… wave after wave… while telegraphing their moves over open communication channels through Ukrainian towers.
