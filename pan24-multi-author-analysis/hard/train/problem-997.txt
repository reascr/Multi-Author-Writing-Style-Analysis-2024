That disease isolation thing's big though, if you think this is fucked up, you'll be in a real bad state after looking up how livestock disease outbreaks are handled, especially in china.
disease isolation, the livestock are on different floors, not crowded in one big ass barn. That's actually brilliant. it can even be classified as environmentally friendly vertical farming, if they're not already given the enclosed space they can probably sequester methane too.
Vertical farming is highly efficient, reduces the spread of chemicals in the environment, can be conducted year round and provides food products within a local area, reducing transport costs.
The nice part about this is much like hydroponics and vertical veggie farming is that its a controlled environment. People are saying oh the poor pigs, but depending on how this is done they may have a better life than at a standard factory farm. The controlled environment is also far more efficient and is going to be much more ecologically friendly in the long run. The whole thing is going to hang on if they can keep disease outbreaks from happening and spreading.
