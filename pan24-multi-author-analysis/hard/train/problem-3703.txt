The independent state legislature theory presents an interesting problem though. Constitutionally, the congress alone has the power to reject slates of questionable electors (in which case the state legislature would vote.) This ISL scheme is simply intended to eliminate this congressional over site and as such, would be unconstitutional. However, the current SCOTUS isn't really bound by the Constitution or precedent and they might still rule in favor. If they do,there is nothing to be enforced by the executive. However, the Congress could still address it directly, ignoring this ISL claptrap by making it illegal. Constitutionally, the states can prescribe how they handle elections, however "the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations" (Article 1, Section 4).
But there's checks and balances on the Supreme Court as well - both from the legislative and executive branch.
But they want to maintain the precedent that the Supreme Court matters and people shouldn't go around them.
Third, the Supreme Court has no power to enforce its rulings. It must rely on the executive for enforcement.
First, the Congress can control their jurisdiction. Anything not specifically enumerated within the Constitution (e.g., trying cases between states) can be removed so that the court cannot accept cases or rule on it.
It'd be really nice if the current Congress were to prophylactic pass a law to stop this ISL thing before it becomes a problem.
If not, seems like maybe the irs knows something is there that congress really should see. Because this feels very out of the blue and extraordinary.
