trans children, even if they also have precocious puberty, would not be allowed to have hormone blockers.
And puberty blockers should be included because puberty needs to happen while a person is growing for proper development of the body and its systems.
If thats the issue why are puberty blockers included, which are largely reversible and considered a fairly noninvasive intervention. Even then, life saving surgery is done all the time for various reasons in extreme situation when less invasive interventions fail, what makes this different?
Life saving surgery in extreme situations isn't the same as amputating genitals to make a gender dysphoric child feel better about themselves.
This has nothing to do with "gender affirming surgeries", this is about purposefully obfuscating the steps trans minors need to take to receive even puberty blockers for their healthcare. Studies conclusively show that gender affirming care such as puberty blockers, cross sex hormones, and gender affirmation reduce the suicidality of transgender minors.
