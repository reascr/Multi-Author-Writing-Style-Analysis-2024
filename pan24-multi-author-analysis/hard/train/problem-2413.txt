I have dysautonomia in the form of POTS. Dysautonomia is dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and it impacts anything the ANS controls, so basically all the automatic bodily processes we don’t have conscious control over.
He was right. It’s in the top 5 funniest things I’ve ever experienced in my life and now my abs are actually sore from cracking up so thoroughly 😂.
Those resources are for anyone who is genuinely struggling. Your use of the phrase “I just don’t know how much longer I can take” tells me you’re genuinely struggling. And you’re still healthy enough to work right now, but you have to take care of yourself too, otherwise you may find yourself not so healthy enough to work anymore. Living on an occasional half an egg and super processed ramen noodles isn’t going to keep you healthy for very long! You can’t pour from an empty cup, as the saying goes, so definitely look into a food pantry to get yourself some variety in your diet so you can keep yourself healthy.
I’m so sorry you’re going through the shit (and I’m sure “shit” is probably an understatement). What state are you in? Have you looked into any of the local resources for struggling families? I can try to help you find info on local food pantries and other services if you want.
Have you gone to the local food shelves? A) food. B) they might be able to point you in the direction of other resources. There are many overlapping state, city, and federal programs that can help struggling families. Lots of them go under used because they aren't well publicized. There are org and programs to help with heating bills, repairs, food, etc. I know time is probably one of things you have the absolute least of but a trip to the shelves might be very helpful.
