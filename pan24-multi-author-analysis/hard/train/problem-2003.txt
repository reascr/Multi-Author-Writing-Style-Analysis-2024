The first time I had that thought was when I heard some particular opinions about WW2. I'm sure you can guess the general gist of it.
Pretty much. Racists believe that every person with a particular skin color is exactly the same, so them being racist = all white people are racist, in their minds.
Yeah I think racist white people think all white people are racist. I can’t count the times a white person has just flippantly said something ridiculously offensive about another race in conversation. Family members or strangers, it doesn’t seem to make a difference. Any time I’ve called someone out on it there’s always a deflection. Oh I didn’t mean it like that, or no no they’re all like that it’s just a fact, or I’m not saying that just because they’re x. Like I’m the naive one. Ugh.
Oof. I'm not a violent person either, especially toward anyone who says they like having firearms. But he had already been crass to the female bartender, and I had to speak up. Luckily, the owner of the business heard most of it, I walked away, and he kicked the dude out.
