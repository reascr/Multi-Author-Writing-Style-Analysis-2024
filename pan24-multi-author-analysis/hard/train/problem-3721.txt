Incredibly fucked up. If you're interested in learning more there's a really good documentary called 13th. It was on Netflix but I dont know if it still is. Its obviously sad but I'd highly recommend it.
Long term solitary is no different than torture based on its effects (many even consider it torture including the UN) and pretty much everyone is going to start working after a bit of that.
Yeah. Its perfectly legal to force prisoners to work in most states (and in 5 states they do this and pay them nothing). 13th amendment has a part that says something along the line of slavery is illegal except as punishment for a crime.
Slavery is legal in America as long as there is due process, according to the 14th amendment. That's why the 13th and 14th were put in at the same time. The 13th abolished chattel slavery and the 14th provided a mechanism to put black people back into bondage, just with more steps.
I remember reading a story about proposed legalization of pot in Louisiana and the reporter interviewed a prison warden who said something to the effect of "I'm against legalization because drug offenders are the best workers. Violent criminals are hard to control but drug offenders will do a good job and not give me any trouble".
