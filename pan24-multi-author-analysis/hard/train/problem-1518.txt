Some of my PhD research was on the effects of sea level rise on groundwater resources in those nations. They're not just going to lose their land. They're going to lose their water before that. And it's going to be a big fucking problem. The world's wealthy countries need to decide whether it's going to be a "spend some money now" type of big fucking problem or a "sudden massive waves of people who literally don't have anywhere to go" type of big fucking problem.
This isn't a problem we can engineer our way out of. The only just and practicable solution is to cut emissions before entire nations disappear.
Europe and US basically got rid of all its most polluting manufacturing by outsourcing it to China.
US and European countries export their waste to developing countries because it's cheaper than recycling themselves. China banned plastic imports a few years ago while India hasn't, single use plastic is banned everywhere in India.
Also this ignores china's and India's internal consumption of their own plastic products. Look at the huge towering cities in china they gloat about, look at the all the big expensive light shows shown every night . All that requires power for their vanity , and that power comes from coal.
