That's just not true at all. NATO is a defensive alliance between NATO countries. How can NATO be useless when its doing exactly what its supposed to do.
So although I roll my eyes when Russia says "but NATO!", I roll my eyes because they have nukes, not because they're making a false assertion about NATO being dangerous to their security.
Individual members, hell every single member, forming their own new coalition for the purpose? Yes, hell yes. But NATO only showed that it will offensively engage nations when it wills.
It's dipshit moves like Yugoslavia that remove NATO's credibility as a defensive alliance that is otherwise harmless to anyone who is not trying to attack you.
Yes, Libya too. NATO did not need to lead the charge to impose the UN Security resolution, and should not have lead that charge.
As much as I support military intervention within Ukraine, NATO as an organization needs to stay out of it.
NATO support is the only reason a free Ukraine still exists. They haven't closed the skies because that would be an act of war, but the training provided to Ukraine over the last 8 years and the insane amount of materiel and intelligence support they've given over the last 9 months has turned Russia from the 2nd strongest military in the world to the 2nd strongest military in Ukraine.
