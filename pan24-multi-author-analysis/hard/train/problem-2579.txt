And while these fringe conservatives are free live their lives as they see fit, it stops at themselves. They have no authority to push their ideology on others. That is left to the individual to decide for themselves. Were they originalists as they claim to be they would understand the very limited powers that government has. It is up to the people to remind and insist their employees remain within those limitations.
He is not banning gender affirming care at all. He is restricting it to those who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria which is a rational way of approaching healthcare.
Is the person who is questioning them, a doctor that specializes in gender dysphoria and has done their due diligence with evaluating the individual?
If a minor person is questioned on their gender dysphoria, the person questioning them is labeled as transphobic and any further discussion is shut down.
I would like to have an open discussion about how claiming you have gender dysphoria does not necessarily mean you are trans, especially if you are experiencing the dysphoria during puberty.
That being said, anyone who questions their gender or feels dysphoria, especially around the time of puberty should not be given puberty blockers or hormonal treatments.
How is it determined that the questioning is actually because of trans-ness or because of normal dysphoria that occurs with puberty? Or perhaps due to some other undiagnosed trauma or process (e.g. autism spectrum, severe depression, etc.).
I mean, he is. Banning gender affirming care prevents people from treating dysphoria and will likely lead to minors committing suicide or ruining their mental health. I don’t see how proven, effective treatment is “toxic”.
