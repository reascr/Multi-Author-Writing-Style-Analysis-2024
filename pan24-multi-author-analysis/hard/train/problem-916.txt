I'm still confused as to how Trump was convinced to sign the 2018 farm bill, considering it effectively legalized hemp-derived THC for about 48 states.
Why did I think hemp production started earlier? I wonder if it was just government controlled back then and the 2014 farm bill opened it up more for private business...
Emphasis mine. This is pretty clear that language includes the ability to concentrate that D9 into a level that could get a person high.
Anyhow, I don't know how they would have missed the THC portion, the bill literally called out D9 THC as being descheduled. As such, it wasn't just D8 that was legalized, it was also D9, D10, HHC and any other cannabinoid as long as it was derived from hemp and did not exceed that .3% by dry weight.
It’s not that they didn’t foresee legalizing delta 8; they didn’t foresee people being able to use the D8 in hemp to actually get high. None of those cannabinoids exist in high enough quantities naturally to really get a high. It’s not like you can just smoke hemp and get a D8 high or even make an oil for vape carts. To get quantities usable for actually getting high, you have to highly concentrate it by converting other cannabinoids into D8 in a lab. They didn’t expect people to use complex chemistry to turn CBD and other cannabinoids into highly concentrated D8 that can get you high.
