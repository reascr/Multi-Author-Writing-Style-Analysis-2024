My theory is that the people are trying to move to the left. It’s a generational shift, with Gen z and millennials being largely aligned on a lot of left-ish political issues (at least by American standards; moderate issues to the developed world).
I think the answer is somewhat like this: the trend in leftward political identity for young women mostly comes from political issues connected to being a woman. There isn’t similarly a trend in rightward political identity for young men, mostly because the political issues men care about are not issues connected to being a man, even if such issues exist. And this fosters an increasing political divide which is happening simultaneously (and even perhaps causing in part) with a struggling dating/relationship scene amongst younger Americans.
When there’s increasing political and economic divide between young men and young women in America, they’re very possibly going to find even less in common with each other and have even less sex/committed relationships, which eventually does present serious issues for the global position of the United States and its ability to address problems at home.
There’s still a lot of issues in society that make me and other younger men cautious about the future of America, many of which I think are more tangential to politics, and I hope that we see some better resolution and unity on those and the issues above in the future, rather than increasing division!
