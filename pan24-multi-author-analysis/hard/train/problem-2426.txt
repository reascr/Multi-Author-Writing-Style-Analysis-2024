Speaking as a person who has marched, petitioned, and donated to causes to raise awareness of climate change, nobody cares until a painting they've never cared about in their lives gets its frame a little saucy.
Is it more important than air? There can be no art and no culture without a stable society. Do you think these sculptures and paintings will survive societal collapse?
I care a lot about art. I'm about to go to Europe for two weeks and art museums are a major part of the reason I'm going. I'm not rooting for anything to get destroyed, but the art is fine. I wish there were a better way of getting people's attention, but these activists seem to have hit on something that really riles people up.
Stunts like this is only going to anger average people turning them against the cause. If the climate protest orgs get any new applications its going to be attention seeking extremists that want to do similar vandalism, not people that will spend days chaining themselves to trees or blocking roads.
