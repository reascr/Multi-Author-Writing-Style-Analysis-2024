Prosecuting someone for, among other things, a speech they made, doesn't have First Amendment implications??
If prosecuted over his remarks on 1/6, his lawyers are sure to argue (1) he didn't intend to incite imminent lawless action, (2) the lawless action wasn't imminent, (3) he had no way of knowing the action was likely to occur, and more.
You actually can say words that would do just that, until those words become an "incitement to imminent lawless action," where such action is likely.
His inciting speech is protected speech until it becomes "an incitement to imminent lawless action," where such action is likely.
What I find interesting is that "likely to incite or produce such action" should probably be viewed in the context of the amplification of that speech. In other words, if you tell 10 people "someone should break so-and-so's damn neck", the odds are not likely that one of those ten will do it. But if you tell a million people? It becomes a lot more likely, statistically speaking.
