What blows me away this cycle is how well Democratic policies actually poll unilaterally. Holding the elite accountable, penalizing corruption, ensuring individual liberties, helping the middle class, improving infrastructure... Amazing how the republican party has convinced their voters to vote against these policies, but a potential messaging opportunity to continue to persuade those voters over to sanity.
It worked when you could take a proven, loyal Republican politician, have them (almost certainly him) act like the biggest piece of shit in the room to galvanize the worst of their electorate and then play the standard republican playbook in a general election.
That no longer works -- because now those Loyalist operators are losing their primaries to genuinely crazy scumbags who are genuinely the worst people in the room. These people then refuse to read off the Republican script in the general - and while they delight the scummiest portions of the Republican electorate, they fail to perform in a general election.
The exact problem the Republicans are having is that their reliance on the system you describe has cultivated a situation where it is no longer working and they don't have a clear and obvious answer.
