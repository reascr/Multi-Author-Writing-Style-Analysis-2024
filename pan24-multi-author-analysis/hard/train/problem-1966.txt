To be more clear, I'm trying to make the case for Single Winner-Plurality like all their neighboring states to replace their Single Winner-Majority. I question what value Georgia gets out of a Majority vote requirement vs what they have to spend (time & money) and what their citizens are put through.
Also, given that this race could give Democrats an edge in the Senate, GOP Georgia voters may be more energized about making sure that doesn’t happen and that’s a big driver too.
On one hand, some Georgia GOP voters have said they like Walker because they know him from his football days, they think he’d be a fresh face in the Senate. People often like political outsiders who don't have conventional experience. But - there is indication that republicans in Georgia don’t want to see another seat go to dems and that is likely a significant part of his support base too.
Nice question, the quick answer is you go into the interview with your facts ready as much as possible! This has always been an issue for most reporters covering all sorts of topics. The best way I’ve learned to combat it is to re-ask questions, point out the facts and sometimes ask them to share where the info that doesn’t seem quite right is coming from. I think most political reporters (especially those of us on-air) are aware that spin almost always happens, so be ready.
The bottom line for me as a journalist has always been that polls can be a tool to keep in the back of your mind, but go talk to voters and listen to what they are telling you.
Yes, but you've told us that what you hear directly from voters is far more informative than "current polling"!
