These are wants, not necessities. Profits aren't what's important here, we can't afford to just hand this technology over to the government of a geopolitical adversary just for the sake of corporate profits. It isn't worth it.
Just because we're wrong about supporting Saudi Arabia doesn't mean that preventing China from getting this technology isn't the right move. You know what the Chinese government would use the chips for, right? Military technology. I really hope we can both agree that the Chinese military having access to our chips is not a good thing in any way, shape, or form. If you don't agree, then I'm glad that you aren't the one dictating our foreign policy towards China.
But hopefully it won't ever get to that point, and we can live to see Chinese democracy blossom in our lifetimes.
You seem to think that the US would be OK with a free and democratic China. They are more free now than they were 30 years ago. What jas changed is they are becoming a near-peer competitor to the USA, and that the US won't tolerate, regardless of how democratic they were.
