With that being said, I'm glad Hobbs as Sec of State is suing this county because this sets such an awful precedent. If election deniers somehow are able to run Maricopa, then they could theoretically try to void results where Dems are winning.
I can't speak to other states, but if say in the future a dem wins with Maricopa votes but whoever is in charge decides not to certify, then it could throw the election another way.
I doubt they'd go to jail/prison but there are two provisions in AZ election law that state it's a crime if an "election official" willfully refuses to do their job.
>For misconduct on the part of election boards or any members thereof in any of the counties of the state, or on the part of any officer making or participating in a canvass for a state election.
Finally, if the votes from this county are excluded (for whatever reason), I wonder if the residents of the county would have standing to bring suit against these commissioners.
This is even more nutty considering that they are refusing to certify their countyâ€™s results because of perceived irregularities in another county.
