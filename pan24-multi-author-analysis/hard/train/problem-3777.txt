To what end? They don’t care about these cases because in their eyes millions of babies are being saved. If you truly believe abortion is murder then these cases don’t change your view.
You completely missed the point. It does not matter to them if you show them one mangled fetus that ends up killing the mother because they truly believe they are saving millions of lives with their anti abortion stance.
1.5) to legally deny a pregnant person an abortion is to deny them their bodily autonomy, which is inhumane in and of itself.
inhumane abortion laws are just scratching the surface of republican monstrosity. i urge you to reconsider your stance as a “one issue voter.” disagreeing with the republicans on this one specific issue but not anything else is not going to help anyone.
i’m sorry you and your wife had to go through this, no one should. but i hope you understand where the anger in my original comment is coming from. a vote for any american conservative or republican, at any time, ever, is a vote for this shit. it always has been and it always will be. these abortion laws have been decades in the making and they’ve never been subtle about it.
this is a golden example of typical conservative hypocrisy. “feelings don’t matter until i’m the one experiencing them.” i bet when this guy gets cancer he’ll start advocating for universal healthcare, but not a second before.
