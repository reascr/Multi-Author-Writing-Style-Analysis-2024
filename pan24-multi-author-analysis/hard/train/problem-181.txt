Yeah reddit loves to say that the Ukrainians can somehow master any piece of equipment dropped off very quickly but the reality is that most of the rapid training that happens in tbe west is essentially accelerated basic training thst still takes multiple months and getting someone reliably good with a vehicle full of technical equipment is going to take time.
You can only rush some things so much. Its why any sort of transfer of aircraft is probably a long ways off even though there have probably been Ukrainians training on western fighters since last year.
The UK is already training Ukrainian infantry in Javelins, first aid, and identifying Russian vehicle types as well as the usual gunnery stuff.
>Ukrainian forces will be trained by both countries on how to use their respective systems, which are capable of carrying troops into battle and also providing fire support.
While the Ukrainians appear to have plenty of tanks already, those vehicles are not really suitable for moving troops around.
Thats probably a bigger number than the official number of Ukrainians training abroad, and thats just for basic infantry training from scratch, or at least on par. I doubt its that many simply because that would be a heavy number commitment for Ukraine to hold in reserve while also already having manpower issues on their side as well.
As attractive as the idea is, I doubt there are ten thousand Ukrainian tank operators waiting to jump into a fleet of Abrams and finish this whole thing off.
