I mean if he is actually indicted and convicted. There was the República rep from California Duncan Hunter was pushed to resign although Trump did pardon him.
1. Claimed income from from a family corporation on his financial disclosure but didn’t claim any clients. It’s not clear any of that is true.
That's pretty much not true. He can't be arrested for anything said or done while physically in Congress and can't be arrested at Congress or while traveling to or from Congress. But if anything he did to get elected is actually illegal, he can most certainly be arrested for that. Just not while physically in Congress or on his way to or from.
Nope, you can be in jail and be in Congress. Once elected, they have to seat you. Once sworn in, they can do an ethics investigation and try to have him expelled. But it takes a 2/3 majority to expel. Just being in jail won't force you out of Congress. Unless it's because you don't actually qualify for Congress in the first place (like if he were underage or not a US Citizen).
