Republicans control the House. The only way to pass anything is bipartisanship. So Biden might as well try to encourage bipartisanship since it's the only way to get anything done.
Everyone wants to act all shocked that Biden would want to be bipartisan or work with Republicans. Regardless of McConnell's crimes and faults, he still holds office and power. To ignore that or work against it would be counterproductive from the President's perspective. Add to that McConnell was one of the Republicans that did vote for the infrastructure bill. Meet on the things you agree on makes meeting on the things you don't easier.
The number of people that think of politics like a football game is troubling. It can be a cooperative endeavor, not zero-sum.
McConnell voted for the infrastructure bill. The infrastructure bill includes money for a Cincinnati-Kentucky bridge. McConnell gets a bridge he can tout as an accomplishment for his constituents, Biden gets bipartisan support for his bill (which McConnell makes a capital "B" Bipartisan).
From Canada looking in, so every Republican votes against everything that Biden and the Democrats tried to pass and yet Biden is still seeking bipartisanship . Days after Republicans take the house. I'm just going to notch it up as me not understanding how the American politics works.
