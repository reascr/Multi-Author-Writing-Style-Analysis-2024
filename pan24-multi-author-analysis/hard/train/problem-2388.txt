They believe it means throwing your weight around, projecting "strenh", and just being a school yard bully. That's Putin, and every other dictator. (side note is this also describes Trump, perhaps that's why he looked up to Putin and other dictators).
Yeah I don’t get everyone’s enthusiasm about Putin being out of the picture. He never was a real threat and was fairly predictable and level headed. I’m more worried about who replaces Putin than I am of Putin.
What's dangerous about Putin is that he knows that his regime and reign is over if he loses in Ukraine.
He doesn’t realize that even if he conquers Ukraine, he’s already lost. Probably even worse than if he quits right now since the world will never forgive this invasion and all the atrocities that have been committed. Zelensky is the hero. His heroic legacy will live. No one will forget him and the brave and heroic fight that the Ukrainians have waged with the invaders.
I’m glad you pointed this out...I came here to do the same. Plus, Germany accepted defeat and participated in the restructuring. Putin will die soon from his illness or a “mysterious” accident and a new Putinesque dictator will be installed. Russia will be encumbered with Putin’s catastrophic failure for a long, long time....the Russian people will suffer from his folly.
