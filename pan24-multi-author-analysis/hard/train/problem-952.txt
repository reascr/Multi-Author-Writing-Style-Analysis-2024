When the first batch of documents were reported, I almost wondered if this was the intent. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I though that maybe this whole thing could have been intentional (like they were planted).
I wouldn’t put it past them but I’m also not going to let myself get sucked into conspiratorial thinking without more evidence. With the thousands of documents that are removed during the transition of administrations I wouldn’t be surprised if there are classified documents sprinkled in others (Obama, Bush, etc…) because I can imagine it’s easy to happen. In fact if we lived in a society where “petty revenge” wasn’t the goal, this would seem to be a good opportunity to update oversight to make sure this isn’t happening in the future. Maybe review past presidents/vice presidents documents and be sure they also don’t have documents that they shouldn’t have.
Certainly the difference with Trump still remains his refusal to cooperate and return the documents, whereas as far as we know, Biden’s team has been pretty upfront in finding me returning these documents.
