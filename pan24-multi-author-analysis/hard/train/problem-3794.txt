The idea to confiscate cars from drunken drivers has been around for a while, and there was a lot of hand-whringing about the storage and utilisation of the confiscated vehicles. Meanwhile, the public has been donating lots of vehicles to the Ukrainian army already, organised by the "twitter convoy" movement. Some politician just put two and two together, and somehow the stars aligned to push this through the debates without the usual four months of ummming and aaaaahing.
There are strict limits - 0.15% BAC. That's a level where you have trouble walking, let alone driving.
Hmmmm, every time the rule has been discussed, it has been mentioned that non-owners would instead get fined equivalent to the value of the car.
You have to pay a fine totaling the value of the car driven. There was a case not long ago where a drunk driver crashed a rented tesla and had to pay over 100k.
There used to be a problem when drunk driver would get his license taken away and would just keep on driving their vehicle. That's why we got a law in place to take away the car as well.
