Aren't there laws that make it where criminals can't remain in office? They can run while in jail and things I know, but there are some laws that restrict activity of those in office.
So, tradition and morals are the only things stopping it from being abused how it currently is then. Got it. I really do keep forgetting that the "norms" are the only thing keeping people like him from exploiting this country for every penny and for power. Trump has shown us that our safeguards don't mean anything if people don't adhere to tradition and simply break laws and run for office or remain in office to avoid actually paying for the crimes.
Eh. It's probably an ethics thing. I know several either resigned or were "politely" asked to step down. I keep forgetting that the government is about 99% tradition and ethics/morals, keeping it from falling to corruption or self-destruction. Say what you will about the founding fathers, but they did have some lines they wouldn't cross, even if they had crap views or laws they stuck to them and held the politicians to them.
(1) Even if they get arrested by state or federal officials for some kind of election law, they'd still remain a rep. If they were arrested (edit: and not let out on bail, or actually sentenced to prison) and didn't resign, there isn't exact clarity on what would happen for them conducting their work, if the chamber still didn't have 2/3 to expel by that point.
