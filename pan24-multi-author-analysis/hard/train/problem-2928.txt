Unpopular opinion but Fahrenheit is superior for most applications when used for temperature related to humans. It is more precise without having to use decimals and more closely aligns with every day applications. Arguing for the use of Celsius in everyday life is like arguing that using Kelvin makes sense for weather, home comfort and body temperature. The water freezes at zero and boils at 100 Celsius argument…. When was the last time you needed to set something to 100 to boil water?
When’s the last time you had to set something to 212 degrees Fahrenheit just to boil water? Or 32 degrees Fahrenheit to freeze it? That’s a 180 degrees difference? Like why can’t it just be a nice round number like 100 degrees of difference?
Yet strangely enough 32 degrees Celsius is a hot temperature, only gets below freezing after it goes past 0 degrees Celsius.
Got to wonder when those last 2 countries that use Fahrenheit to read temperature will finally leave the dark ages and join the rest of the world.
