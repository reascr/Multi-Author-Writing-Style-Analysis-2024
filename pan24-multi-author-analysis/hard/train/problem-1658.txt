It's not that I think that they should be expelled, there are many awful dictatorships in the world right now and all of them have their representation and narratives, but in the case of them it's not only that but also the fact that they are very outlandish and isolated that I (yes, just the ignorant or naive me) thought they would just relinquish any seat/voice there and would have no will to participate with the rest of the world not even for propaganda reasons. But thanks a lot!
Thank you for saying this. I completely support Ukraine, a lot of my friends do too. But I also understand my country's position. My dad fought in that war. What for many people on Reddit is just discourse on a website, was a horrifying reality for our people at the time. I want to point something out though. The US didn't "tacitly" help Pakistan, they straight up sent the 7th Fleet to aid them. Only thing that stopped them from steamrolling the Bangladeshi resistance was a Soviet submarine fleet that blocked their way to the Bay of Bengal. There are many reasons for our people to have some level of distrust of the US.
