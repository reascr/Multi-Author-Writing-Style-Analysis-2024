To add to this, their small world shields them from feeling any responsibility for what happens outside their bubble. If it didn’t happen to someone they know, or in their community, there’s no attachment to it. That’s THOSE people’s problem, not theirs. They feel unaffected by it, like it’s not even real.
“My goodness that’s terrible But I have guns and so does everyone else I know and all of our kids are fine so everything is actually fine We’re not doing anything wrong. How could you take guns away when we didn’t do anything wrong??”.
So? They don't have to vote for her. It's not an excuse nothing is written in law that a Republican can't vote Democrat or vice versa to get a toxic person out. Nothing stops people in her district from backing a moderate Republican. The problem isn't dark money its that most people don't care about local elections until it's too late, I'd bet 50% of her votes were "she was the republican on the ballot". People are just lazy.
Yes, people can be lazy and low effort. Very few research before they vote, even less research what they hear (or even know how to). There is no integrity with politicians who campaign with unethical means like making voters believe they are above "insert label". Unfortunately, many end up voting against their own interests. It's somewhat painful to watch, if you ask me.
