You actually bring up genuine debate between different Jewish denominations. According to Orthodox Judaism you are Jewish, to Reform Judaism not jewish. According to Orthodox Judaism, not only would you have the the right to claim to be Jewish, you couldn’t ‘stop’ being Jewish, and if you are a woman, your children would still be considered Jewish, all despite your being Catholic. Basically, it wouldn’t be disrespectful to the Jewish community for you to claim yourself Jewish, given that you have a Jewish mother.
It would be really disrespectful for me to claim to be Jewish, so I don't, even with my family history. I don't practice the religion, I know very little about my heritage beyond what I listed here. What I know about my grandma's ordeal was horrible, but it's still not my right to claim to have a religion I don't practice. It's incredibly disrespectful.
"I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was ‘Jew-ish'.".
So like, my birth mom was Jewish, and my paternal grandmother was a survivor of Buchenwald. I still don't claim I'm Jewish. Why?
Because I was raised Catholic. My grandmother was raised Lutheran, she was imprisoned because of Jewish ancestry, not because she was a practicing Jew. My biological mom was a practicing Jew, but the last time I celebrated a Jewish holiday was when I was a toddler. I don't even know how to spell the special food we ate (some apple thing for Passover?).
