So modern humans kill all the lions and finally have convinced a tribe that we’ve actually killed most lions already of because of our mistakes and greed they can no longer practice rituals which may be thousands of years old and rob them of their culture while making it profitable sounds good.
Literally like basic Christopher Colombia Spanish conquistador level colonialism South Americans were enslaved killed off by carried sickness and displaced skip a few 100 years to modern medicine population regrow the and you have deforestation rising wildlife extinction levels and a near mirror society to everyone else.
Edit: I’m just a cynic not rare on Reddit the bigger problem is older than a decline in lion population, Fuck all media outlets that drive a narrative that few people make a bigger difference then stopping mega corporations poachers and hunters from hitting the original land of all people this is inconsequential when all life will be dead on earth with no end in site for pollution.
All I’m trying to say is why would we be even looking at news like this if Africa wasn’t colonized in the first place that’s what first comment was referring to.
xD this comment has too much cringe "badasses", "knuckle dragging redditors" like seriously I'm just voicing the concern that we have been fucking with Africa long enough to change the culture of a relatively small tribe. I had no intention of dragging my knuckles to go see a tribesmen kill a lion xD.
It's also less dangerous to take part in a sporting event instead of trying to hunt a lion. Modern warfare is never going to involve fighting a lion with traditional weapons so it doesn't really make sense as a right of passage anymore anyway.
