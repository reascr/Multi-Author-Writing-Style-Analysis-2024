1) This type of geoengineering isn't a solution to global warming but rather a time extension at best. The idea of blocking sunlight to "cool" the earth by releasing chemicals along the equator has been around for some time. But the vast majority of academies agree that it won't fix anything. It can in theory buy us some time by possibly slowing down the effects of global warming. So the reduction or eradication of fossil fuels is still the key. Selling it as the solution is blatantly false but since this is being done by a start up it makes sense. It is cheap and easily marketed as such. People can buy into just paying some "smart guy" to pump "chemicals" ( Sulfur dioxide or a combination) ontonthe atmosphere than actually changing the current industrial world.
The vast majority of climatologists all agree that ( as I pointed out in my first response) it will potentially be even worse that just letting climate change occur.
I imagine a scenario in which conservatives finally decide we should do something about climate change... And this will be the answer they reach for.
I think that we will be able to stop climate change, this just isn't the way of doing it. the gov't does have incentive to do it (read: inflation reduction act).
