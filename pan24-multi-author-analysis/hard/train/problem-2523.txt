This is just a safe comment from a few to make them look good, it’s just rich people virtue signaling.
Nothing is quite as cringy as a billionaire virtue signaling. The entire corporate apparatus that created their amassed fortunes relied specifically on lobbying both sides of the legislature to perpetuate the tax loopholes that sustained their wealth in the first place. How stupid do they think people are?
This is so disingenuous that it’s insulting how stupid they think we are. If they wanted to pay more tax, they could stop hiring armies of accountants and tax attorneys. They could DONATE any amount of money they want to the national treasury. But the don’t. Why is that?
Meanwhile, some forty something doctor who has just finally paid most of his student loans off is stuck paying nearly half his money income because he’s a sucker and took a job healing people and helping them instead of getting a job in venture capital or private equity where he can make more even more money by ruining people’s lives and playing his role in the corrupt financial system.
If you want to tax the rich, tax their ASSETS. Every year. Don’t tax income. Don’t tax hard work and earning lots of money. Tax HIGH LIVING.
Why would anyone pay more taxes than they have to? They are obviously saying "tax us more" to appease the people, not because they actually want (or even should) pay more.
They want higher tax rates because only the nearly rich will get stuck paying them. That’s the up and coming small businessman, the doctor married to the lawyer, etc. These are people who are likely going to retire with a few million dollars or maybe 10-20 million dollars.
