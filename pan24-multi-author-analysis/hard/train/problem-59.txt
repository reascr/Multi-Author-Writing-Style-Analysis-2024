The headline of this article, of course, doesn’t actually reflect the more nuanced quote from Kelly.
>Of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Kelly has said, “Dreamers are as American as anyone”, and has expressed support for it.

that's not what he's saying, the full wapo interview linked in the article goes more into it. he wants comprehensive reform and supports things like daca.
>But when I talk to my Republican colleagues who are not anywhere near a border — let’s say they’re in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee — they have the same problem. So there are solutions and we’re continuing to work on this. Our country would really benefit from stronger border security and comprehensive immigration reform.
its a pretty shit article, it leaves out a lot of context. especially how he also calls out the repubs for their bullshit rhetoric. they dont actually want to do anything about the border/immigration but constantly use it as a boogeyman to scare their voters.
