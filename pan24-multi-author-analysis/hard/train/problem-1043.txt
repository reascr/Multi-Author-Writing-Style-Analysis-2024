Well, no disrespect to him, but since he jacked off on a Bible because he was captured by his own country, I imagine he would act in a similar way or worse if he was captured by a foreign country lol.
The soldier who claims he has PTSD from the training and is suing the government claims that he was forced to simulate sex acts with a toy doll and forced to renounce his Christian faith and masturbate over a Bible. Australia, are you cunts alright?
"Australia, are you cunts alright?" sounds like a poorly translated Chinese tshirt or wristband you would see in a Vietnamese market. and yes we are apparently.
What he is saying is definitly plausible. Though as I said, they spend a few days with you explaining what you can expect and a way to tap out if you feel like things go too far.
Having said all this. Maybe there was some assholes running this course that ignored all the rules and just wanted to see some guy jerk it onto a book. I dont know, I wasn't there .
They tailor the experience to the individual. If he was a God botherer, then getting him to simulate a wank over a bible seems par for the course. Remember, the difference between a simulated sex act and an actual sex act is crucial.
