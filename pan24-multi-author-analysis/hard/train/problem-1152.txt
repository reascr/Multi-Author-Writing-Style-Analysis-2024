Jordan doesn't want the palestinians. These are the same palestinians that tried staging a coup in Jordan in the 1970's. Supposedly, when the idea came up before the Oslo agreement, of a confederation of some sort between the west bank and Jordan, Jordan's King Hussein was horrified at the idea, and couldn't understand how anyone would think he would agree to it., and made very clear why he totally rejects that as a solution).
Is this what Israeli residency/citizenship for palestinian looks like? Why would Israel ever consider giving citizenship to people that aspire to kill them?
Israel annexed East Jerusalem and offered citizenship to those who wanted it, and permanent residency to those who did not. Israel wouldn't -and shouldn't- renege on this. the citizens would be left under no government, and what are the others to do? Those with residence largely hold Jordanian passports, IIRC, but I don't see Jordan welcoming the influx of people.
So to really answer your question: because these are Israelis or Israeli residents, a majority born there, and some being horrible does not take that away from them.
