You said it yourself when you said China didn't let North Korea get conquered. The US wanted to conquer all of Korea, and the "first punch" was when the US arbitrarily divided the country, and conquered the south.
The US already threw the first punch with the Korean War. They were also the first ones to bring nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula, and they have been openly calling for the destruction of North Korea for years while ignoring any attempt for peace.
Given that context I don't think it was that North Korea was trying to force anything on the south, but that they were trying to drive an occupying force out of their country, like they had done with the Japanese.
I'm not talking about living in North Korea today, I'm talking about the Korean War and the history of US aggression and the influences that has.
So, let me get this straight, you think the United States, all on its own, decided that the commies could have the northern part of the Korean Peninsula? Is that what you think?
