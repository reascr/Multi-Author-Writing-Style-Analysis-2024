US/Canadian universities are generally better and more prestigious than anything in China. So why would they want to get their degrees in China?
It's not all bad. Having Chinese students in the US/Canada helps westernize them and expose them to democratic values, so even if they go back to China after graduating, they're still taking those ideals back with them to the mainland.
I get that, but when China is being blatantly adversarial and openly spying on us, I wonder when we decide to stop educating their elite wealthy students who it seems are going back to just help China continue being more aggressive.
On the other hand, given the Chinese Governments history of utilising students and/or Chinese orientated campuses as a way to influence and/or spy in the foreign nations. Including the spread of the illegal-police in foreign nations ensuring compliance of Chinese citizens with their law. The policy that forces students to be abroad without the possibility of online classes, can be seen as one which aims to strenhen and solidify this influence.
One can take it as a sensible and fair step by the Chinese Government given that the online teaching isn't ideal. I can say that as someone who had done their degree thought COVID pandemic too.
Perhaps more so if the students would have to be abroad... But for whatever reason would be using the online classes from the place they reside. The new students whom will yet enroll will also not have any options for hybrid or sandwich like courses where they could perhaps spend more time at home in China than usually (be it wanting to be with family, urgent matters like death in the family, sudden natural events or even pandemics- ). It would make them inclined to stay in these countries rather than come back when they want to. This is then enhanced by the fact they they are culturally heavily inclined on completing their education as a matter of honour.
