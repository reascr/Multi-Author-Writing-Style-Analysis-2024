You can tell Americans have learned absolutely nothing from the disaster of the Trump Presidency. America is NOT the only country in the world and many many countries, NOT just the US is holding Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine.
and as a non American I just LOOOVE hearing about how the US is single handedly changing the tide of the ukraine/Russia war, or how "america" is NATO.
This sounds like you believe countries are only friendly towards you because of your military strenh, and this is actually part of the mindset I've been trying to discuss. For what it's worth I'm in the UK, a small nation, and one I assume is on your friendly list. But let's look at other countries....take, say....Spain for example. They are a friendly nation to us here in the UK, and vice versa, yet I do not believe we are friendly nations due to military force. cooperation and trade routes benefit both nations, without any need for force, or intimidation. Now I'm not saying history was always plain sailing, far from it, but in this current world, it is fully possible for nations to be friendly toward each other without the need for scare tactics or shows of military might.
As the other guy said, it's a collective of countries holding Russia responsible for their actions, a collection of countries have sanctioned them (in fact I believe the UK was the leader in pushing sanctions at the start of the war, but I guess you guys don't like to discuss that?) and a collection of countries who make up NATO. Its not just the good ol USA.
