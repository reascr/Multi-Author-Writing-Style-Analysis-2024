The despots abroad and the petty wannabe tyrants at home are hoping beyond hope that they can keep the people of the world split between poles of power, turned against one another into perpetuity. They know once we stop struggling against eachother horizontally, we'll turn our talents in war along a vertical axis, and struggle to pull apart the thrones and towers they imagine they lord over us from.
However the manner of our arrogance and defiance truly is contagious and deadly to them, and the proof is in our friends an allies. The weakest of whom like Ukraine roar like lions, and gnash their teeth keeping the nights of tyrants sleepless and long.
History has already been won. The end game is figuring our how to reduce the misery of global warming, and buy the Chinese time to iterate and reform their system without drawing them through the horrors of a direct confrontation with us.
They call it global American hegemony because they fear what it really is: Hegemony of the People. Hegemony by the People. Hegemony for the People.
Calling it a hegemony just gives their criticism validity. Since when is democracy and equality a uniquely American concept? Just because the US has the largest army doesn’t mean that the rest of the democratic world is somehow dominated, if we don’t like what the US is selling we can always opt out and often do. Usually it’s the US that we need to pull in with us when it comes to societal progress like e.g. climate change, does that make the EU a climate hegemony?
