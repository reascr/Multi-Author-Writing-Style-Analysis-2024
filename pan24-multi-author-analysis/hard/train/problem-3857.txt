I am flabbergasted that they didnâ€™t measured the radiation before putting it inside the secured storage facility. This is a basic and simple procedure for dealing with radioactive source to make sure that the source is still inside the shielded container after transportation.
The tiny radioactive thing was inside the other thing (the gadget that uses it), and that thing was in a shipping crate of some kind. The crate was appropriately labelled and had tamper-proof tape on it etc.
The shipping crate or whatever it was that held the device had tamper-proof security tape around it as per the regulations, that's what was reported in the media early on in the incident. So nobody got into the crate while it was in transit. Police categorically ruled out theft etc.
Yep, the search was definitely measured and calm. Not an ounce of "frantic" anywhere other than the inevitable over-excitement of the media outlets in reporting it.
They're really reaching for some alarming headlines, I doubt the search was overly frantic. It's the Australian outback, there aren't a whole lot of people out there who would happen upon it.
