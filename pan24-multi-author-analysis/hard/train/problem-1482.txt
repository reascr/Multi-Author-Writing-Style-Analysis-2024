Ok. You’re assuming that there is no difference between varying degrees and types of attention. You’re not considering how international relations with China could be leveraged. You’re also assuming that the current sanctions (attention we are paying to them) are not hurting their country and slowing down their production of nuclear arms. You’re assuming they wouldn’t just ratchet up their attention seeking behavior until we HAVE to pay attention to them based on probability of accidental mass casualty incidents. You’re assuming he wouldn’t exploit his people even more if we didn’t condemn and take actions against them.
How am I assuming he wouldn't exploit his people more? How does us paying attention to him help stop that? Are you advocating for some kind of military intervention to prevent that?
So, one last time, how does us talking, amongst ourselves online and in the media, about NK missile threats result in any positive benefit?
I am still waiting for some kind of concrete example of how us talking about NK missile threats helps us, South Korea or Japan in any way.
edit: To clarify, I'm talking only about us, as in people in the west, discussing North Korean missile threats. That is the only thing I am discussing. I am not talking about removing sanctions, moving troops or any of that.
