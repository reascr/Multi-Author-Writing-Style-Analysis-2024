Iâ€™m NAL but my understanding from reading this and other articles is that the Texas Homestead exemption, which he claimed in his taxes, are explicitly for people currently claiming that address as their primary residence. At the same time registering to vote in GA, which he did, is explicitly for people claiming Georgia as their primary residence.
Who the fuck in Georgia failed to vet a candidate upon filing to run to make sure they are a legal resident of the state, as required by their state constitution?
If Georgia rules do say that suspicion of fraud in another jurisdiction were enough to disqualify a candidate, I would assume news would be all over that.
If you punch me in the face in Georgia three times a day, 365 days of the year - taking tax breaks in Texas doesn't remove you from Georgia and what has happened there over the past year.
Texas tax breaks that depend on being a legal resident there are not an alibi in the example. So it's not really a matter of either one being correct; as pointed out before, if he is qualified to run for office in Georgia the Texas tax claims aren't really going to change that fact.
