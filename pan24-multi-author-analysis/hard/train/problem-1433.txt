Minors are prohibited from doing a whole multitude of things in our society. How is this any different considering the permanent nature of these treatments?
To be clear, I'm 100% for adults accessing any care they need and they should have access to it. Simply looking to be informed on what protections are there for children.
What kind of safeguards do you think should exist for minors who perhaps wrongfully identify as trans, when perhaps they may identify as something else in the future? Or perhaps a better rephrasing, what are the medical channels that exist to ensure the minor is 100% trans before they have the ability to access appropriate care?
The goal should \never\ be that no minor gets care before doctors are 100% sure they're trans (because part of what "trans healthcare" looks like for minors is to allow them to properly explore their feelings before proceeding with more permanent treatment. That's another thing that makes these bills so menacing- they're sold as preventing things that generally don't happen anyway but they're usually written so that they also criminalize things like therapy to help a kid understand their sense of self.
