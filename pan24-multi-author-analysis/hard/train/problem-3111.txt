The worst part is that we were literally warned that this would be the GOPs gameplan in the last year or so in Trump's presidency. Nobody prepared for it or devised strategies to fend it off.
I'm sorry you feel terrified and unsafe because you are simply living your life and alt right zealots can't seem to understand that and let you live in peace and safety. That really, really sucks.
This sucks. Drag shows are nothing but love, courage, and self acceptance. And then you have these hateful bigots who, for some reason, canâ€™t stand that.
Their refusal to accept the fact that years of rhetoric declaring that LGBTQ+ people, Mexicans, Muslims, etc. are threatening to take their country away has radicalized a very dangerous segment of the population is terrifying. They have no real policy for the country so they invent enemies to unite their base against. It was Russia and the Cold War from the 60's until the fall of the Soviet Union, then Iraq, then the War On Terror, then Afghanistan. Now that we're not really involved in an international conflict they've targeted marginalized US citizens.
Despite years of ignoring warnings of increasing threats from "Homegrown" groups I'm sure the GOP will say this is just another "Lone Wolf" attack.
