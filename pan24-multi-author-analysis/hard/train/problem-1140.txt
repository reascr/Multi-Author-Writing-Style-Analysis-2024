Yet this isn’t a purely materialistic or class concern. I feel that this movement in behalf of the poor is the most moral thing — it is saying that every man is an heir to a legacy of dignity and worth.
In bible, the rich man was punished because he passed beggar Lazarus every day and did not see him … and I tell you if this country does not see its poor — if it lets them remain in their poverty and misery — it will surely go to hell!".
Yes. It also helps children be able to eat daily, and that helps their education levels. Other countries feed their kids freely (and much more nutritionally), and their higher education scores are reflected in that. Republicans most certainly seem to always clamor for better test scores, and yet they don't care about doing anything to help kids improve in school. They actually delight in seeing kids do worse, in reality.
The Republicans want to literally starve their own people and make them more susceptible to illness?
Next in the IA GOP plan… extermination chambers for those yucky Americans who are a drag on IA society. You may think that’s hyperbolic… but if you look at the republicans antivax message and boarder policies, which created near concentration camp like facilities, we should acknowledge… it’s happening here already and stuff like this is a step towards concentration camps.
