The situation in Ulkraine isn't getting better just because Puketin lost half his tank, and that doesn't change anything because he is happy to throw in the other half.
The real danger of reading these article is getting a false sense of progress in Ulkraine. There is no progress until Russia is stopped.
Russia has lost all that it has in less than a year. Every day the west keeps supplying Ukraine they knock out gear that Russia will take far longer to replace. Even if stocks are depleted the west is in a position where this is the best deal they'll ever get for that gear. The west will have their stocks depleted for a year or two. The east will have a military so broken it will be unusable for multiple decades. There is no comparison.
Ukraine needs a lot but there are still stocks of other weapons and production of new purpose built ammunition is beginning to happen.
A few hundred armored vehicles sounds like a lot, but Russia has days where they've lost about three dozen at once. Western armored vehicles are beginning to just arrive and there are still plenty of those in stock. There are still things that can be sent, that can be made to work.
