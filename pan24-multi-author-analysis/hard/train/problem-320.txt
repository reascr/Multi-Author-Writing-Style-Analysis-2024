I heard the former CEO on NPR pointing out that the artist decides whether or not to use Dynamic Pricing and honestly I don’t really see a problem with the artists choosing to do so. Theoretically the big fans can get cheaper ticket by buying sooner. The actual problem is that Ticketmaster actively enables scalpers to buy up a bunch of tickets first. They guy was making it sound like it was Taylor Swift’s choice to sell tickets for thousands of dollars, but no Swift capped the ticket price at $499 (although I don’t know how transparent they are that the actual price to fans will be higher after fees nor whether the fees are also dynamic). The problem I see is how many people had to buy scalped tickets for way more.
People are going to buy more expensive tickets from scalpers vs. the cheaper, price-capped tickets in app? Sure.
I don't know how it works with superstar acts like Taylor Swift, but new/emerging bands don't really have a say in what ticketing platform venues or labels use. Don't punish the artists who are already barely making ends meet by refusing to see them over something they can't control.
My last band dropped $15k total on our last EP and we were still very much a local project. We went with a trusted, local producer/recording engineer, but even they were still very cheap compared to the big name studios. Any nationally/internationally touring act is spending \much\ more than that on every release cycle. It's just not feasible.
No, there's another option. Did the government buy all of the telephones when AT&T grew too big? Of course not. When a company has a monopoly, that company needs to be broken up.
