But no, the upper classes won’t have it. You see if the working classes had more time (freedom) they would have time to pursue passions, hobbies, and education. They would learn that the system they toil so hard to uphold isn’t to their benefit, it’s to their demise.
It’s an oversimplification of the point. France is part of the EU, and the EU has worker rights and protections that outpace the U.S., and yet remains an economic titan within the world. My point wasn’t that France is perfect, it’s that you don’t need to squeeze the life out of workers to do well financially.
By any and every metric France should be a shining beacon that we DONT need 9-5, 5 days a week or any other bs system imported from the industrial era for most jobs. People can get their work done, produce profits as the company needs, and be home in some cases working 1-2 hours of a working day.
USA: long working hours, only 2 weeks holiday, maybe need 2nd job to survive. "Life is so depressing".
Yeah the US is on another level bad. And the culture is worse too. I know how it is in France and Italy at least (where I've been), even if people aren't happy about economic prospects and shit, the people including young still "enjoy" life and try to make the most out of it. Meanwhile American youngsters go into full depressive doom mode as we see on Reddit and other English language media.
I'm not making fun of our American youngsters - I find this actually so saddening for us. Our culture makes this so much worse than it should, we put up with this bs yet feel powerless. I wish we were more like Italians but alas it takes a generation for any cultural change to even happen.
France: decent hours, 4+ weeks holiday + full August holiday, good community social system. "Fuck this we demand more rights!" while casually eating a croissant.
