This is a real problem with operational jobs where you need them to be staffed around the clock. However, the problem only persists because scheduling is handled by a person and they don't want to be on the phone all day finding someone to swap schedules with you. You can solve this with software easily. I know because we did the same thing at my company (my team built the damn thing). I wouldn't doubt if there is a stipulation in the union contract for the people that handle scheduling to not allow any automation to protect their jobs. Damned if you do. Damned if you don't.
Yeah, someone else mentioned that, but I'll put to you what I put to him. "Does this mean that what is needed isn't extra sick leave, but in fact more FTE's?".
Yeah there is. Let them strike and congress could get out of the way. The billionaires have hundreds of billions in profits. They can afford to give sick leave.
Their employers have the money to give them sick leave. We could have paid sick leave AND have the trains run on time if the employers would just treat their workers better. If the rails fail, it won't be the striking workers fault, it'll be the greedy employer's fault.
More than that, it's not the workers fault that there is a possibility of strike. Billionaire owners are being greedy. Blame them if the prices go up. They could easily make them go down; it's all in their court. More than that, the democrats didn't even have to get involved.
