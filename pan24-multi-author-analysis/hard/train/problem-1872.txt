However, I think that what they're going to teach isn't really the law. The judges know the law already. It's the practical side of conducting war crime investigations and trials and the unique character of war crimes. It's something you don't cover in detail during a peacetime university course in criminal law or criminal science.
Public international law is the same for the UK and Ukraine. Relevant criminal law differs of course and British lawyers obviously cannot educate Ukrainians on how to apply Ukrainian laws to things that are happening in Ukraine.
No. The International Criminal Court was set up to try war criminals that states have failed to try. It's subsidiary to domestic judiciaries. If Ukraine (or Russia, for that matter) prosecutes and tries them, there's no reason for the ICC to do anything.
Hopefully Ukraine is able to find the perpetrators of these crimes and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law in fair trials.
I understand that war crimes have been committed and they warrant trials butâ€¦ are Ukrainian judges really the best people to handle this? A judge is supposed to be impartial.
