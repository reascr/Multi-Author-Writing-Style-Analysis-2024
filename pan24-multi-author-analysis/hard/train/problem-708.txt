It's nowhere near as bad. If they're from his time as vice president, the National Archives obviously didn't know they were even missing and he wasn't trying to prevent their return. Trump basically ignored the NA informing him they were missing documents and asked form then to be returned and Trump basically refused to cooperate to the point his home was raided. Biden has been fully cooperating and he/his staff had previously found documents and returned them on their own.
Likely human error as, from reports that I've read, it's a small number of rocuments like less than 30 from many different larger files. Trump had numerous files and hundreds of thousands of documents.
Big difference here is that Biden was likely entirely unaware, as was the National Archives, that any documents were missing. Both Trump and the NA knew Trump was in possession of documents.
Trump could easily have just handed his documents back and we would never have heard anything about it. For some reason he first denied he had them then ignored 2 subpoenas and finally the FBI had to retrieve the docs.
Biden handed his over the moment they were discovered, by his own lawyers who could easily have just destroyed the evidence.
