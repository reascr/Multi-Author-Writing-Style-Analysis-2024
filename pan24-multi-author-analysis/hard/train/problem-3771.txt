Hindutva is on rise in India, it was a ideology propagated by RSS during Indian Independence which talks on far right Hindu totalitarianism and proposed a model of Authoritarian governance similar to Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, it is inspired by Hitler's Nazism and Aryan supremacy, Vinayak Savarkar and MS Golwalker were Hilter fanboys.
Currently there are other far right extreme Hindu groups like Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal who unitedly operates under the Sangh Parivar, their demand is making India a Hindu Rashtra from Afghanistan to Indonesia where Hinduism will be the state religion.
