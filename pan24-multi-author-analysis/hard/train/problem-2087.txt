Many progressives, led ny Bernie Sanders, have been advocating and pushing for everyone to receive 'free' health care. It would save the government, corporations, the economy as you point out. And individuals would save thousands every year by eliminating the insurance industry which serves only as a middle-man to scoff up billions and billions...bleeding people to death.
So we should continue the "Healthcare for profit" system just because people in the past didn't have free healthcare and had to orient their lives around the inhumane for profit system?
Just to clarify, the healthcare shouldn't be classified as "free" but paid for by tax dollars instead of the current backwards system where private for profit companies have inserted themselves into the process along with employers.
It's also more efficient than a public option because a public option would inevitably lead to sicker people being shunted out of their private healthcare, thus making for two smaller, unbalanced risk pools. The larger the risk pool, the more efficient the insurance.
