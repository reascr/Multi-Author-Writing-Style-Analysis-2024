These types of comments do a great injustice to the horrors that the Nazis committed and you should be ashamed of yourself for belittling that fact.
By only equating the Nazis to the full account of their actions by the end of their reign you ignore what they were at the start, where they might have been stopped ahead of time. By jumping on comparisons in this manner you weaken our ability to spot those warning signs in advance. If there is to be horror and bloodshed awaiting us, then this approach serves its coming, not its prevention. There wqs a time when Nazis existed but their full horrors did not, and that is the most important side of them to study if "never again" is to be more pragmatism than hollow refrain.
This is fine when you’re dealing with an actual Nazi, less fine when you’re calling millions of Americans Nazis because they hold beliefs you can’t understand or disagree with so much that you can’t comprehend how they got there.
Look at the math. Don’t only use logic to try and prove other people wrong - use it to challenge and strenhen your beliefs appropriately.
