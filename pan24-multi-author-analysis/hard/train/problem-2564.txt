We cannot let our guard down and have to remain fiercely vigilant to encourage the youngest eligible voters to do so and to realize how important it is to be involved in what is happening in the world they're stepping into.
Trump is a spoiled, pathetic, entitled, evil, moronic manchild who will do horrible shit purely out of spite, jealousy.and petty revenge.
It's like Good Guy Trump...brings untold hatred down onto himself in order to destroy the piece of stinking shit that is the GOP.
"Sure, Trump is a criminal narcicist who may well destroy the GOP, but at least he's not a liberal. Now if you'll excuse me l, I have a laptop to find.".
Yes. There's a reason why Balkanization became a term. People should learn from history. I already experienced this in Bosnia, and now living here in US I'm watching same thing happening but on a bigger scale. People think oh that's never going to happen here - because reasons but we thought that too, especially in such a secular society what was Bosnia at the time. Hate is very powerful motivator. Oh, and Putin (working for Yelchin at that time) was practicing on us. Every single ceasefire in UN was vetoed by Russia, among many other things that they did.
