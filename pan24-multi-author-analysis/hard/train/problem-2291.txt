I saw a post earlier today, I think it basically called this making an "electoral box." Let them concentrate in Florida and run everything in the state. There are only so many reps and senators they can send to Congress, and only that many votes they get in the electoral college. Whether they win the state 51-49, or 90-10. Let them overvote in FL and let Dems have a better chance in the areas they left!
Not the candidates that Florida Democrats are looking for would be my guess. They went with a former Republican which would make sense in a moderate minded electorate in other states but they would have been better served by an energetic younger progressive. Voter enthusiasm amongst democrats had to be pretty low.
Not saying a younger Bernie from a policy stand point but you need a younger energetic candidate that turn out the fanfare. Democratic voters are the most frustrating group to try and organize. Itâ€™s like herding cats, too many differing view points in the spectrum where Republicans have only two models to deal with, the dumb and the wealthy.
