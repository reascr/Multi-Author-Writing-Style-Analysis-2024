The 12 is such dogshit it’s unlikely to catch on like the earlier models did. Can’t hold a zero, unreliable, you can break the fire selector switch because the stopper doesn’t work. Just a mess of a rifle.
AK pattern rifles yes. AK 47s although haven't been produced for awhile. Original milled rifles from the 50s and 60s can be quite rare depending on where you are in the world.
More likely the AK-12 or AK-74 pattern rifles (which are in 5.45×39 instead of 7.62×39 from the AK-47/AKM).
The rifles in the video clearly have the more curved magazine of the AK-47/AKM. Also, the two larger holes on the wooden heat shield is another dead giveaway, as that is the stock heat shield on AK-47. AKM is just the stamped version of the AK-47, so those two are very similar. The AK-74, which you nonchalantly compared to the AKM via /, is also a 47 variant but with a less curved magazine and no holes in the heat shield. That is, the ones I shot had no holes in their stock heat shields.
Also post Brady Bill, he ordered a case of 7.62 steel core ammo. Dude had loads of 7.62 ammo, so we continued blasting the hell out of the woods with AK-47's and SKS's. The 47 was particularly fun to wield with a 75 round drum magazine. We thought the ammo with steel casings was the cheap, corrosive stuff. Turns out my pal had been hooking us up with the armor piercing ammo for years. Didn't find out til that case was down to like 3 boxes. His dad was passed pissed.
A pal's dad had a federal gun dealer permit. Back in the 80's, he had a fucking arsenal that occasionally included a few fully automatic weapons. However, the ones we always took to the woods were semi auto ak-47's. Post Brady Bill, he got some 74's and SKS's. The AK-74 was chambered in 5.45 and was shorter than the AK-47. The SKS was chambered in 7.62.
