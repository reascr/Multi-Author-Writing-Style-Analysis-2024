My wife and I sit at the table together and fill out our ballots, they are not secret in the sense that we can choose to (or potentially be coerced to) show someone else our ballot prior to submitting it. That isnâ€™t an issue with in person voting since you are in a private space and immediately drop your ballot in the box. Some states even have rules around not taking a photo of your ballot to keep your vote secret.
It is not illegal for voters to choose to disclose, if they so wish, whom they intend to vote for or whom they voted for.
Right and similarly you can choose to tell someone at the polling station whom you are going to cast your ballot for.
If you were in a booth there would be no way for someone to be able to verify you voted the way you said you did.
Sure, and similarly there is no way to prove to someone else that you voted a specific way with mail-in voting. So it's not really clear what point you are trying to make. Everything you have mentioned so far applies to both in-person and mail-in voting.
In a state where well above the majority of ballots are mail-in ballots. Asking a judge to unilaterally decide by themselves to throw out most of the votes, yeah...that's not going to go well.
