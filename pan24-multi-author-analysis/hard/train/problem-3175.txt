Why on earth are you saying it's debatable when you have precisely no clue what you're talking about?
Let me help you as a person who lives in Taiwan. Taiwan manufactures virtually fucking everything. The idea that Taiwan couldn't produce a drone is, to understate it, completely laughable. Like, comes from Taiwanese manufacturers.
China wants Taiwan largely for its industries and infrastructure. It can't simply bomb it to hell as a method of seizing control, they'd be destroying all of what they're trying to take over.
China's invasion force would have to come by water and make landfall in only a few viable locations from what I've heard. Making it much easier for Taiwan to defend, and much harder for China to attack even with proper air and naval support.
Taiwan's manpower and weapons cannot hold off China, make no mistake. What can hold off China is Taiwan's economy and chip fabs.
Taiwan is of the upmost importance for Japan. If China took Taiwan, Japan has to fear for its trade routes. Without trade, Japan is fucked since they import next to every resource.
