They could force them to accept terms, just as easily as forcing workers to accept this shit deal. Congress can literally compel either side to accept terms but they, and main stream media, are making it sound like Congress has zero other options.
Anyone who voted in favor of these measures should have to work under the same set of terms and benefits as those they just forced on railroad employees.
First, eight of the twelve rail workers unions’ members voted in favor of accepting the existing deal, with four remaining as hold outs and leading to the current situation. Contracts are negotiated collectively, so all twelve receive the same agreement with the railroads.
Second, the rails were willing to consider including paid sick days, so long as the 24% raises over the next 5 years we’re negotiated downwards in a give-and-take. I am not expressing an opinion, merely putting the context forward. It seems eight of the twelve unions accepted that outcome.
12 out of 12 Union leaders agreed to this deal, recommended it to their Union members, and 8 voted it down.
Hates the railway workers so much he signed a deal that 8 of 12 Unions already agreed to and 12 of 12 union leaders negotiated. Must be pretty terrible.
Sure it sucks. Vote out republicans as I think it would be better in the long run. History has shown it.
