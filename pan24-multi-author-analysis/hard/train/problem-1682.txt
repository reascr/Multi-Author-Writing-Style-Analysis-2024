Russia has the one carrier, but they NEVER had the support ships required to protect what is in reality a helicopter carrier. Even back in 1985 when the ship was launched, it was a fools errand. A carrier requires a Carrier Strike Group to support it at sea, and Russia never had those ships.
In that specific area yes but Russia still has a "real" battlecruiser afloat elsewhere. For some reason the only Kirov-class that is still seaworthy wasn't sent into the Black Sea before Turkey closed it. Got a feeling if it had participated in the bombardment of Ukraine we'd have found out that it too is an oil caked nightmare with most of the fire fighting gear stolen or locked up. Just as well though since at this point if Piyotr Veliky had been in the Black Sea, Russia would have probably used some of its P-700s as cruise missiles and nobody needs that.
Yeah, the USA's / NATO's "escort ships" are more vastly more powerful than the flagships of the Black Sea.
Also we have 9 Amphibious Assault Ships that are as big or bigger than what most other countries call carriers and perform similar roles. We've got 20 ships capable of launching F-35s.
