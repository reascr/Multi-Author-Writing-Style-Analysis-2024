In the end, itâ€™s embarrassing for McCarthy, who will most likely need to pack his bags and move out of the speakers office. It is also a sign of how Republicans will govern in the House.
But from the majority of the house, aka a subset of democrats and and republicans, he could be a 218 vote getter.
If they follow the Hastert Rule (only bringing to the floor bills that have majority support within the majority party), they're not going to be able to legislate at all. It'll just be circus faux investigations and nothing else.
It's interesting to think about how this type of dynamic (freedom caucus vs the world) is going to be in play on every major vote that the House Speaker, when there is one, brings to the floor.
J6's anniversary is definitely going to play into this. If the GOP aren't able to work through this tonight or tomorrow, it's going to drip into the talking points for both GOP factions and it will heighten those divisions.
I hope they show these past couple of days on repeat the next time midterms elections come around, remind everyone that republicans can't get their shit together.
