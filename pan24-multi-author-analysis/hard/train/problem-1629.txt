Well it depends, doesn't it? If you are just making a fun youtube video where you deepfake Arnold Schwarzenegger into other movies, it should be fine, right. But when you try to frame somebody for something they didn't say or do, then you are probably already breaking a law.
If you do so with intent or recklessness as to it being used to result in arrest or trial of an innocent person?
See the case of Simon James who orchestrated a false accusation of drug dealing against his ex wife, having ensured that cocaine had been planted in her car. Convicted, along with his conspirators, Austin Warnes and Jonathan Rees.
Maybe not now (I'm definitely not an expert) but someday, maybe not soon, they'll be so convincing that people literally don't realise they're looking at deepfakes. And if there's still some that are low quality, then that's even worse. People will have a false sense that they can 'always spot those things', and that just makes them even more stubborn in their belief of the ones that they haven't identified.
