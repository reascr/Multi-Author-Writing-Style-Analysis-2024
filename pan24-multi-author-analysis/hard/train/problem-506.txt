I think people expect Brazil to be unruly and crooked and except USA to be the model democracy. Unfortunately they are very much the same. The working class in Brazil probably have it better than USA.
As bad as Brazil is they just showed they are better and more capable of the rule of law than the US. I agree that Brazil is not the ideal to uphold but it is somehow many factors better at maintaining democracy than the US. That is the sad, pathetic truth.
It is absolutely stunning that Brazil is the example of democracy and the rule of law now as the US keeps sliding further into authoritarianism and an illegitimate justice system. It’s not even close the comparison of the two democracies. One has wealth hoarded at the top by an unaccountable few and the other reacts swiftly when the rule of law is violated even by the powerful and well connected. First the Scandinavian countries copied the new deal and the capitalist-socialist policies from the 40s and 50s to become thriving democratic countries with social safety nets and happy people and then Brazil shows the world what the rule of law is suppose to look like. How utterly embarrassing and shameful to squander such things to benefit the 1%.
Democracy is one thing that if you do not defend and protect it you will have another system that will probably be much worse. You can slip a bit in other areas and be able to correct them but if you lose a democracy whoever or whatever comes next won’t honor or uphold anything you believe in. Everywhere has corruption but not everywhere has democracy and we know in stark terms what happens at the end of democracy by looking at Iran, Myanmar, Russia, Afghanistan and many other authoritarian nations around the world. I think it’s a bit different than talking about corruption or high crime rates.
