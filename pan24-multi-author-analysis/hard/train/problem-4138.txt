She assumes she would be a spoiler candidate. There's nothing showing that she'll pull enough votes from a (D) candidate. Given her Musky, enlightened centrist bullshit and her incredibly low polling she might, if she's lucky, pick up some libertarians and GOP voters who don't want a hard right candidate.
What people aren't considering is that a large percentage of those libertarian and moderate Republicans have already been voting Democratic in the last 3 election cycles. Biden for example won 10% of self-identified Republicans in Arizona which was essential for his victory in the state. It's those voters the Democrats may be losing to Sinema.
Well Sinema has played her hand, and frankly the 2024 Senate race is looking tough for Dems anyhow. If she can generate enough support to win on her own fine, Dems can continue to caucus with her where possible.
But it's now on Dems to hammer the everloving shit out of her in 2024, otherwise it sends a message that Independents can simply use the party as a Trojan horse for office and bail once they get that sweet corporate $$.
That's a piss-poor excuse since she's not an idiot and knows exactly how this type of legislation is passed. A clean bill wouldn't have gotten a vote and she knew that, any other statement is just a fig leaf to cover her ass.
