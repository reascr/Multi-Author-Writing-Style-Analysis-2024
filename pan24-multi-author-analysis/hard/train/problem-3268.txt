There are nearly 8 billion human beings inhabiting this world and you'll find nearly 8 billion political and social beliefs to go with them. Simply saying "there are terminally stupid lefty takes on Ukraine..." means nothing because there will be people on the left who support Russia just as there are people on the right who support Ukraine.
Thankfully this is the case (that most on the left support Ukraine) but as you go further left, to groups like Democratic Socialist Alliance, you'll see a ton of very pointed support for Putin and Russias actions. One of the speakers (Jackson Hinkle) runs a communist group, and also is paid as Russian State media operative.
The us arguably does benefit from the strenh which it projects. Europe and the US have undoubtedly benefitted from this alliance for years. The dollar itself, is largely stable because it's directly tied to the sale of oil. These are the big geopolitical factors nobody really wants to debate or discuss. It's easier to go to bumper stickers and be like "were giving Ukrainian nazis weapons why can't we house the homeless!" it's not a njanced conversation that actually gets into the weeds of what's happening.
It speaks directly to aid to Ukraine, and how that could also enable a situation where wwiii or nuclear war could erupt. Also playing right into Putins talking points.
But going back to the point of this discussion, by your own admission, there are very few far-left supporters of Putin and this war. In the meantime, there are millions of far-right lunatics out there pushing Russian propaganda.
So whether they're complicit or not, they are 100% shouting nativist bullshit through a Russian Megaphone.
Honestly, these people are some combination of naive idiots and Russian mouthpieces. Modern Neville Chamberlains and Ernest Lundeens.
