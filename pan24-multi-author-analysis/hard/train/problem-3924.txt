At the very least it's not unlikely Romania and Moldova would become more tied just on the basis on mutual cooperation besides on that EU countries do to one another.. bit like how the Baltics support one another more closely.
It diverged because I mentioned Romania and Moldova's relationship becoming as strong as the Baltics have.
Personal, as fi foarte de acord pentru unirea Romaniei cu Moldova dupa scaderea sentimentului pro-rus. stii? Atata tot.
Although i appreciate Moldova's path, there are a lot of pro-russian people over there. Morever, a large percentage of the young moldavians studying in the same city continue to speak russian and often blatantly do this. It s a major sign of disrespect, honestly, especially during this time, especially as people from Moldova are offered quite a lot of benefits here in Romania (while some of us don't have access to the same benefits).
Todays Republic of Moldova is an unfortunate out slice of this same continuum, which wouldnâ€™t even exist if not for the aftermath of the WWII as it was artificially separated from the Kingdom of Romania, where USSR wanted to revenge for Romania's alliance with the Third Reich.
Romania and Moldova are the same people with the same history, don't let the cultural suppression and russification that occured from 1940-1991 ever fool you into no supporting reunification and cultural resurgence. I wish Moldova to improve itself, rid itself of it's Russian influence and join Romania again.
