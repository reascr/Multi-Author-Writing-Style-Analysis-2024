Where do you think you're getting less rent now? Because rent amount is a function of what an average PITI payment would be in that area. Basically rent = maintenance + PITI + profit margin.
FL and TX are not low tax states. Their property tax is out of control. TX income tax is only low if you're actually really wealthy. Insurance on your home in FL is by far the most expensive in the country. Utility costs in TX are some of, if not the highest in the land. You are not saving money by living in either of those states. In fact, you're probably paying more to live in either than whatever "high tax" state you're fleeing.
That’s a significant difference, plus you’re going from having to pay state income tax to not having to pay state income taxes.
Keep in mind that Oklahoma still levies a state income tax...however the property tax rate is lower due to other taxation schemes.
Then look to the sales tax and other excise taxes. Here in Oklahoma, the sales tax varies from city to city. So in one place the tax can be 9.318%, yet be 9.445% the next town over...and that tax applies across just about all purchases with the exception of houses and cars, that's where excise comes into play.
And yet, even during the pandemic, construction of $300k-500k+ homes in developer planned subdivisions didn't slow down. Thank years of cheap money due to insanely low interest rates.
