Russia's allies aren't looking very powerful right now. China has been suffering from Covid related economic decline and a real estate market collapse. China is also preoccupied with Taiwan. Iran is dealing with economic problems and massive protests. Other Russian allies are struggling as well. Russia's prospects for forming an alliance that could challenge Western nations was better before they invaded Ukraine. This is another Russian fantasy of restoring their position as a world power.
And the funny thing is that most of Russia's allies were trying to use their relationships with Russia to bolster their own positions and further their own interests.
Putting this through the 'Lavrov to Reality' filter, seems that what he meant to say was: the West will never have to negotiate with Russia, whether Russia wants it or not? Got it.
Which is what gets me. If the Russian government weren’t such dicks about everything they probably would be a world power. Powerful as fuck too! They have the resources providing them with so much potential. Metals, REM’s, oil, people (well used too), beautiful vistas, continent spanning territory, and infrastructure. They’re just dicks to everyone and the rest of the world called them on their bullshit.
