Nobody is trying to convince anybody of anything. Their goal is to piss people off and generate conversation. It appears to be working _magnificently_.
Too bad. Don't like climate protesters? We'd probably have a whole lot less climate protesters if we weren't driving ourselves over a existential cliff. But please, go on about how these little protests are such an inconvenience to people.
Unfortunately “Support us or you’re all dead, your children are dead, and the future is dead” hasn’t been getting the point across. For better or worse, people listen when you interrupt their schedule. That’s how protesting works.
And the thing being _totally ignored_ is the fact that disruptive protesting works, has worked, and will continue to work.
The problem being pointed out here isn’t wrong: protesting that is disruptive only turns people off of a cause. At the same time, non-disruptive protests are promptly ignored. At what point does protesting become more than a placebo to prevent people from getting violent?
