I’m Canadian, our government didn’t bother to tell us there was a Chinese spy balloon in our airspace we are only finding out retroactively that it passed through Canadian airspace.
The Canadian government didn't publicly acknowledge it but since the news of the balloon over Montana came out, people have gone back though publicly available flight tracking data and it seem Canada deployed CF-18s to intercept the balloon when it was in their air space.
The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces issued a joint statement Thursday night that said the balloon’s movements were being actively tracked by the North American Aerospace Defence Command.
Canada's Department of National Defence said the balloon's movements were being actively tracked by the North American Aerospace Defence Command, which is responsible for monitoring airborne threats to the continent.
Yeah it doesn't look like the press noticed until the US press started the story. I'm sure they had other big stories like the death of Fred La Marmotte so something like a Chinese balloon seemed minor.
