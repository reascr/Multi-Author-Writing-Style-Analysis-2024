Playing their game in this scenario won’t work. Don’t lend credence to this behavior, let them pout and complain, but don’t stoop to their level, not in terms of complying with committees. State elections? Fuck with them and use their tricks but do not degrade the little checks and balances the federal government has left.
Playing their game is even worse, you might as well be asking for a revolution at that point seeing as the federal government will cease to have any power.
Do you really want our entire government to act to stifle progress for the foreseeable future due to political games, instead of just half of it?
I may sound a little harsh or condescending here because I see this thought process a lot, and I think it is half-considered. It ties in with the general view of "criminals" in our country.
Fascism is an idea. It is a thought process. It's a way of thinking. You are not immune to fascism due to your opposition to fascism, and fascists are not necessarily fascists for life. It is not a descriptor in the sense that hair color would be. One cannot use fascist ideas or ideals to defeat fascism any more than one can use water to defeat a shark. (Reasonable ideas like shooting them with a jet cutter notwithstanding).
