No, the Ethics Committee is evenly staffed, as always. It's the only committee that's evenly staffed, so it always acts in a bipartisan manner and has exceptional continuity from term to term. As explained in your article, this is about the Republicans putting term limits on members of the independent OCE and limits on when staff can be hired. And this article is old. The term limits affect two of the Democratic members, not three, and Hakeem Jeffries has said he plans on appointing new Democratic members within the deadline for hiring new staff.
And the change made was that Republicans put term limits on the members of the and instituted a rule that new staff can only be appointed in the first 30 days of a congressional term. This will have a significant impact on the membership of the OCE and probably limit their activity. Republicans also changed the rules to allow the public to submit complaints to the Ethics Committee.
But as far as George Santos goes, this will have a minimal effect because that's already been referred to the Ethics Committee, which is evenly staffed by Democrats and Republicans. So, we've already reached the end goal of an OCE investigation.
It's actually a broadening of the standard. McCarthy is suggesting expulsion and, since the Civil War, only two members have been expelled from the House, after being criminally convicted of crimes and refusing to resign. McCarthy is saying that Santos could be expelled based on the outcome of an Ethics Committee report. That's moving the goalposts from criminal conviction to a finding from the Ethics Committee, which is a much wider net.
Ethics committee comes back and says "as we are not the executive we cannot determine whether or not laws are broken. That is for the DOJ to decide. We have concluded that Santos is going to vote lock step from here on our now that we have gathered this kompro... I mean, now that he's family".
