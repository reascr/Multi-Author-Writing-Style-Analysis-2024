Eh, Twitter to me was never a good idea. Just because you can articulate and publicize your opinion, doesn't mean the whole world needs to see it and comment on it.
Furthermore, utilizing it as a value engine to determine how well thought your idea was was also never a good measure of worth.
I dont think Elon Musk is worth more than Twitter, but I don't think the world will be less without either of them either.
Not only is Elon Musk destroying Twitter, he's setting fire to Tesla. Conservative Republicans don't believe in climate change and won't buy EVs. Musk has pissed everyone else off. His car company is ramping up production but will find it increasingly difficult to make sales. He's toast.
Tesla was shitting all over legacy auto in the production game BEFORE he shat all over the market. Tesla's production is miles ahead of Ford, GM & VW. Huge fully robotic plants compared to Ford/GM assembly lines straight from the 1970s. Tesla has single plants that can do 500,000 of the same model each year. Legacy auto is a long way behind. However Musk destroying demand for Tesla cars will give legacy auto the time to catch up.
Musk was going for the by trying to introduce a high end electric car to the marketplace in quantity. It's a major topic of debate if the first mover advantage is actually a thing, and different people have different opinions. In most cases it's actually irrelevant, as most first movers are happy to sell the perception of advantage to a larger company, but Musk, as a giant money turducken, is in a unique situation.
