If you want an environment in which such tariffs can be charged, you're going to have to get countries to agree to a new trade treaty that allows for such tariffs; the outlook for other countries signing on to a treaty like that is exceptionally poor. There's probably not any way to square the circle between "China and India want to increase emissions because they have a ton of desperately poor people they'd like to industrialize" and "the US won't agree to emissions cuts if China and India can continue to increase their emissions". There's REALLY no chance that you're going to get China and India to agree to let the EU levy a climate tariff on their goods.
The major problem with this kind of approach is pretty simple: the WTO doesn't recognize "climate-related tariffs" as some kind of special category. Once the EU actually starts levying the tariff, other countries are going to go to the WTO with complaints, and those countries are going to win those complaints. The end result is going to be retaliatory tariffs against EU exports.
If you want to sell anything to the EU, these tariffs will produce huge pressure to decarbonise the entire industrial chain.
We can only ensure that our industrial chains decarbonise as much as possible, and anyone who wants to sell into the EU will need to adopt that too.
Anyone who does not adopt those measures will be priced out of the EU market entirely. As it's an extremely valuable market, this will drive companies to switch to lower carbon models if they wish to sell into the EU.
Countries willing to buy and sell carbon-produced items will be able to do so cheaper than their European counterparts.
