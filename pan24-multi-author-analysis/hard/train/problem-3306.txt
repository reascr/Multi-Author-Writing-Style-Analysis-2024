Oh you're wrong about one part the withdrawing from the World Police and World trade that's not going to happen. Because to give that up will be a major blow to US influence and would raise instability everywhere.
America is vastly less concerned about global trade instability in the era of Shale Oil. Only Rwanda and Botswana have economies less dependent on the rest of the world than the USA.
Already happened. America has less forces abroad today than any time since the post Civil War period 150 years ago. The globalist candidate for president lost every election since 1992 and in 2020 there was no globalist candidate for President. The Neocons abandoned the project for some military adventurism and that further decreased the American appetite for engagement overseas.
US hegemony isnâ€™t going away, it is just becoming more regional as America continues to withdraw from the role of world police and enforcer of world trade.
And anyway, even if you don't agree with that analysis, the US wouldn't abandon the protection and enforcement of free, open, global trade. That would simply be shooting themselves in the foot for no real reason.
