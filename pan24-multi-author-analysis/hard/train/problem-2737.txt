I think he's implying that why would Canada (or any other NATO country) even bother meeting their defense spending obligations when the U.S. would happily step in to pick up the slack.
Unless I am mistaken, Canada spends more on defence than Poland and Greece combined, but because Canada is so rich it is lower as a % of GDP.
I don't know if Canada is spending more on defence than Poland anymore. The figures I was looking at were for 2020, which showed Poland spent about $13 billion on defence, but looking at more news they've increased that amount and said this year that they will essentially be doubling their defence budget to nearly 5% of GDP. Canada spends about $25 billion on defence and Poland's looking to spend $30 billion moving forward.
Even at $25 billion a year in spending, that's still in the upper half of NATO countries (by just total $ spent) and more than what Spain spends on defence ($15B) or Greece (>$10B) and they have each much larger militaries than Canada's. I have no idea where all that money the Feds have been spending goes, but it doesn't seem to go very far. I don't think that's an issue with just the current government either, the previous one wasn't any better, nor were the ones before that going back to the start of post-Cold War cuts under Mulroney.
