Maybe because those Christians aren’t spending every waking moment fighting a fruitless culture war like you think they should. Instead, living humbly, serving others, and not being concerned about making everyone an enemy.
In essence, doing what they can to be the best representation of what they believe Christ is exemplifying and teaching. If you want that to mean gaining and exhibiting some kind of forceful power to put down anything that’s not that, you’re not going to find it in that kind of Christianity. Maybe that invalidates that kind of faith to you, and that would be understandable, but perhaps right wing Christian nationalism is going to be its own undoing eventually anyway.
You don’t have to be an expert in Christianity to know nationalism under a Christian umbrella is not fuckin heresy lol…and when you throw words around like that only idiots will take you serious.
Apparently these Crazies and Fundamentalists are not different enough for Real Christians^^TM to bother taking a stand against folks doing Evil in your name.
If these Christians exist, all they do is act as a beard to give these hateful radicals a better name.
I recall GW Bush calling terrorist people who have “hijacked Islam.” I feel that we are in a place where white extremism has done the same with Christianity.
