>Last month, Odessa pulled down its monument to Catherine the Great and Kyivâ€™s Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced that 30 more road names would be changed.
Lomonosov had no connection to Ukraine. And having the very personification of Russian culture as an in-your-face monument is obviously untenable at a time when the Russian Empire is warring on Ukraine to enslave it.
Understand that Russian nationalists do not believe Ukrainians exist and that, at best, Ukrainians are wayward and misguided Russians and, at worst, actively attempting to destroy Russian culture.
The Ukrainians/Ruthenians still existed as a people, and they were involved in extending Russian rule over them and providing the faulty intellectual framework for Russian imperialism.
Because the Soviet Union was a reincarnation of the Russian Empire, committed since at least the mid-1930s (and especially beginning in the 1970s) to a policy of russifying the national republics, especially Ukraine and Belarus. Pushkin was as good for this purpose as Mayakovsky.
