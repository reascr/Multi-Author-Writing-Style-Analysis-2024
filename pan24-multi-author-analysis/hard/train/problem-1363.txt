I once got so exasperated at my high school home ec teacher when he said in a lecture that "things that are on sale usually cost less" that I wrote "Mr. V: Font of Economic Wisdom" on my notebook and held it up for a friend to see. Someone the object of the burn saw it, and remained low-key pissed off at me forever after. I wonder if that's on my permanent record.
There is no permanent record. I'm the same age, and I've gone to grad school and taught at the university level and "permanent record" is on the same level as "if you're bad Santa will give you coal.".
Not to mention, if I'm on the panel looking at prospective college students and two identical kids come in but one of them got reprimanded for participating in a pro-lgbt walkout, that's absolutely the kind of fuck off energy I'm putting my weight behind.
This isn't to discourage people from participating in the system. It's to discourage this extremely common and extremely popular Reddit catharsis posting that either points out a glaring hypocrisy, or that posits that "well THIS time the Republican party is done for." Never going to happen. They don't care about losing a generation of youth voters. Their policy is to make sure those folks cannot vote at all.
