The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) verified a total of 6,702 civilian deaths during Russia's invasion of Ukraine as of December 4, 2022. Of them, 424 were children. (dated December 4, 2022).
Edit: Anyone want to explain the downvotes? Available data has it that there are around 100k Ukrainian military deaths and around 100k Russian deaths. Considering Russia has artillery that can bombard significant areas from miles away from the frontlines, the Ukrainian army is doing really well.
“It is estimated that 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far,” Head of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen.
I thought the numbers were more like 100k Russian military deaths and 100k Ukrainian military and civilian deaths because the Russians have bombed indiscriminately.
Except they are not winning this one, they are close to 100,000 troops dead and probably as many if not more injured, their trained troops are mainly dead and a significant proportion of their equipment is destroyed. They have lost this war already, they just haven't quite got to that realisation yet as Putin will do anything to maintain power.
