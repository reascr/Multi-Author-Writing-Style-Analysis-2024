Yeah, fair that, but it’s always the emotionally needy girls who go for the vampires. Which, y’know, we all got our issues to sort out, and I wish them luck with that somewhere else. I want a rugged mountain woman tending to me. Or a lesbian witch.
Is it, tho? You’re forced to subside on human blood, and can never see the sun again. At least with werewolf, you can just lock yourself up for a few days.
I was thinking about the werewolf shit thing. Do you think your human self has to process and shit out whatever half chewed raw bones/carcass your werewolf self eats? Or do you transition back only after the werewolf puts out what it took in? I feel like if it's the former, that human's digestive/intestinal system is a mess for the next couple of weeks.
Immortality means you’re in the clandestine club that secretly runs the world from the shadows, though. Plus, blood rave parties and ominous meetings in cool old castles Wearing ridiculous capes and shit and somehow making it work.
Werewolf: a few times a month you stand a good chance of waking up sleeping near or in your own shit (assuming you do the padlocked cage thing before you turn).
