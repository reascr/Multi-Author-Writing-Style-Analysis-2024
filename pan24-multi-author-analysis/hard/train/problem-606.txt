I get the sentiment, but there is a whole lot more to it than just sending a wire transfer and the moment something like that happens both Alpha and Gamma Hackers lose credibility with the companies and agencies that one must work with to pay a ransom possibly even to the point of a US company being denied permission to pay either in the future.
Believe it or not, professional hackers can have pretty good customer service. If they establish a reputation of taking the money but releasing the data or failing to provide a decryption key - its less likely the next victim will pay up.
I helped a few clients deal with ransomers when there was no other choice and I do have to say in call cases the decryption key was provided and so far the data has not been made public. These were companies that theoretically had backup systems but failed to manage them and they had not been working.
In my experience this actually is more likely to happen to large companies that handle their own backups. Most SMB just use some kind of immutable cloud backup these days. Still an expensive thing to actually restore and the down side of being in the cloud means there's a delay to get it either physically or over the internet. That also assumes backups were not broken or never working to begin with which certainly does happen.
