I sort of balk at the "helpless" act the rural areas give all the time. Why do Urban Dems have to make your plan for you? Do they even arguably understand the issues well enough?
And failing that, it's hard to judge people for creating tools that help the greatest numbers of people.
I am 100% on board that rural America needs a political enema and that starts with a lot of great tools and mobilization, but I think that change needs to come from within.

I'm out here in rural Eastern Oregon thinking, "I really hope this isn't another Democrat-led initiative that's focused on metro areas, or limited to women and minorities...".
Our state's Democrat office offers zero support for rural candidates because they see us as a lost cause, and it's true for just about every state that's purple or has a strong blue metro with strong red rural areas that aren't red enough to make the state be considered purple. Jamie McLeod-Skinner has been within 5-10% in every election she's run in for the last 10 years, but received very little support from Dems in the state and nationally because Jamie ousted their darling douchebag Kurt Schrader.
