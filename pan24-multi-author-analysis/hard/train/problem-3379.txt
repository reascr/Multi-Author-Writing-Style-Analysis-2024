A wide and complicated range of different aspects of society. The sort of thing that is complicated to deal with, and thus nobody wants to consider, since it's so much easier and more ideologically gratifying to instead go with a simple populist rhetoric of "big tech bad".
A lot of the populist discourse around this stuff makes it sound like it is basically the responsibility of tech companies offering social media platforms to protect us from our own speech and sight.
But that all sounds like a matter of free speech. Just because the app algorithm makes you feel bad doesn't mean we scapegoat the app makers as opposed to the folks who are actually saying bad shit online. Free speech is a thing and I'm confident the SCOTUS will smack down on any populist attempts to regulate big tech.
Uh ok, well as we all know, free speech has limits and every industry has been regulated. You cant threaten or harass people for example. Libel laws specifically police speech as another.
Uh yeah. That’s what people are saying when they “blame social media”. It’s like saying “the match lit the fire!” while ignoring the gallons and gallons of gasoline?
