I agree, but it's interesting that Zelensky is still requesting a meeting to present his evidence even after both Poland and NATO declared that it was still ultimately Russia that was responsible regardless of the missile's origin.
I just find it fishy how Poland seemed to heavily imply it was Russia's doing and then after convening with the united states military brass it ends up being a stray Ukrainian missile when zelensky has said it was a Russian missile and is 100% sure its not Ukrainian at all.
We all know NATO and US is trying to prevent the war from escalating into other parts of Europe even though this is total bs from our govts calling it a Ukrainian stray missile going into poland...
NATO and co are claming that they are mostly sure it was an ukranian missile, trying to shoot down a russian missile.
What Ukraine wants to gain is weapons and defensive aid that Russia has no answer for. More HIMARs, Patriot defense systems, western tanks or fighters.
I didnt say nato would respond with nukes so you saying it is objectively wrong is about as dense as you can be.
