Literally saving billions in tax dollars from not having to fight Russia in a decade. Or having to scale the US military complex to have to fight Russia (Along WITH china, at the same damn time).
I'd say these sanctions pretty much rule out regime change in Russia. Especially democratic regime change. Like, who exactly would knowingly do the bidding of the oligarchs worried about their assets in the West? . This approach automatically makes Putin the man of the people. And then there's the issue of the sanctions suppressing all the Western-aligned media figures, who were relying on Youtube, Facebook etc. to circumvent the official media channels.
And it's rather weird, actually. Like, back when the US invaded Iraq, was it OK for Russia to seize, for example, the local division of McDonalds, and spend the profits to arm Hussein?
I think it's because there were more significant things going on in that timeframe - from the use of nuclear weapons to internment camps for Japanese Americans.
I think the way you're presenting the situation is muddled. Like, no one here is arguing that it's the first time sanctions are being used. And what's interesting here is not that the sanctions are being used at all, but that they target a person, not the country, the money is being spent, not frozen, and the US isn't even at war with Russia (while it was at war with Japan).
Or the Japanese were hated by everyone, so acknowledging this would mean the Western sanctions on Russia by no means set some kind of precedent, and US can't be reliably told to be abusing their power. The only thing that's new is it's the first time they've been imposed en masse on such a (comparatively) large economy. Sanctions, however, have been used throughout history.
