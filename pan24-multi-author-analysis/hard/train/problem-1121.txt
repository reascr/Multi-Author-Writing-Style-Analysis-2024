it's just the price the rest of us have to pay for gun owners to keep up their hobby. Think about how frequent stories of these mass shootings are a shot in the arm to mom and pop gun stores.
Sadly it's not just guns. Other countries have a lot of guns per too and it doesn't correlate there.
Switzerland, I believe Serbia and Canada also have guns. Not to the level of the US of course, they're far ahead of everyone in that respect. However their gun deaths are through the roof proportionally, which means it's not just a gun issue.
I'll also add just so we're all on the same page, I'm not saying everyone should be armed with a gun. Some people don't like guns, or feel pepper spray, taser, etc is enough for them. I don't carry a firearm in public. But I do have legal means to defend myself when I leave the house.
I don't fantasize about being a victim. I fully understand not everyone is getting attacked everyday. But a lot of people ARE attacked. I have been attacked.
Statistics don't mean shit when you're the target and it's happening to you. What do you propose someone does to defend themselves when attacked if they're not allowed to be armed?
