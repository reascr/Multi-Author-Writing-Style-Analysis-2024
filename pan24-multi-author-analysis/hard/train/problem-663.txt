“There’s confusion and disarray in the lower courts because not only are they not reaching the same conclusions, they’re just applying different methods or applying Bruen’s method differently,” said Jacob Charles, a professor at Pepperdine University’s law school who focuses on firearms law.
Or it can be more accurately assumed that the decisions of Heller, McDonald, and Bruen were already prejudged before they arrived at the Supreme Court; and the historical evidence that undermines them reveal that the court is acting outside of its remit as it is creating new law instead of defining the law in the strictures of precedent.
So first you called me a liar. And then when I present you with footnotes backing up my statements you switch to, "the truth doesn't matter LOL"?!
At no point did you address the statements I made or the supporting documentation I presented. You simply called me a liar and declared that you were right.
I did, I said he was a liar and he is. None of what he linked was compelling enough in 2008 to alter Heller and it didn't make a lick of difference in Bruen either. It's garbage peddled by people who torture the historical record and they have failed. Bruen made the threshholds pretty clear and they're pretty easy to meet, yet so far gun control activists have come up short.
