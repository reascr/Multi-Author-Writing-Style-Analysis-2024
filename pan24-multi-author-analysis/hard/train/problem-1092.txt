Your right. It’s absolute crazy how they committed fraud and stole peoples funds by transferring it to their personal slush fund for their hedge fund to trade with.
There is hones crypto but there’s a massive amount of fraud commuted and enabled my the large funds. Btc has value as a scare, theft resistant, and inflation proof currency. Ethereum has a smart contract layer that functions as an effective way to have p2p coding. Arweave provides decentralized storage. There are real crypto currencies, it’s just 90-95% is either fraud or destined to fail because these large VC funds keep giving these well connected rich kids billions to monopolize the space, and it keeps failing.
Meanwhile of course you steal the real money to pay yourself an outrageous salary, bonuses, business trips, buy luxury propety, fund misleading advertising to lure more rubes in... the usual crypto business.
The only reason "number go up" is because a rigged casino takes in money from marks and pays it out to scammers. That is, when it is connected to some scammy centralized exchange or market.
Again, you’re mixing up centralized exchanges with etheriums on chain protocol and saying because a scam happened here in a CEX that the whole thing is a scam.
You either are mistakenly mixing up the crypto protocols with centralized exchanges which are more akin to a broker relationship.
Like yeah, Ofcourse there’s scams proliferating with crypto, it’s a new way to creat wealth so obviously there will be scammers. But wether you believe in the crypto technology or not you arguing in bad faith to say that crypto caused this. The scam tokens will fall just like pump and dump penny stocks when they don’t preform.
