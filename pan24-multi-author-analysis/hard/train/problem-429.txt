In Mexico, mestizos that date/marry/have children with white people are often heralded for "improving the race". Being of more indigenous descent than European descent is often viewed as being racially inferior.
Addendum: Most mestizos actually think of themselves as inferior to white people. It ends up resulting in some inferiority/superiority complex that makes race relations in Mexico really complicated. Mexico's president, AMLO, is really exploiting this at the moment, with the "unsaid part" basically being "mestizos need to do more to keep white people down and keep white people out of the country, because that's the only way mestizos can have their own country, because we don't believe we're able to compete with white people without protections." I can understand a lot of this as post-colonial inter-generational trauma, but it's still fucked and doesn't lead to racial healing.
The fucked up part is 6 generations later, poor Nahuatl still gets shitted on as an inferior race, furthering the agenda. You said the quiet part out loud dude.
