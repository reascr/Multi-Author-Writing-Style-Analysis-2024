I'm certain even the Russians didn't expect them to be good soldiers, they're expected to be fodder to be thrown against Ukrainian forces to maintain pressure and deplete Ukrainian supplies.
The Russian front seems to be made of two lines: a line of poorly equipped meatbags that presses forward, and a line of "real" soldiers that shoots the first line if they run away.
Apparently some new recruits have been assigned to the "second line" whose job is to shoot any retreating/deserting Russian solder coming towards them from the front lines.
In other news, apparently the Russians are drafting even 17-year-olds who live in these occupied territories. Also, while those doing their mandatory 2 years in the army cannot be sent to fight in a war zone, they can be used to defend the motherland. Fortunately, having annexed those Ukrainian provinces, they can now send draftees there to "defend the motherland".
At the start of the war and again during the mobilization, most of the soldiers were recruited from the eastern oblasts. The people over there are more asiatic and seen as subhumans by many.
