This isn't some old fashioned workers vs. robber barons cliche. The rail companies thought they were giving their workers generous terms, but the heads of those 4 unions failed to figure out what their members actually wanted. This is their screw up, which is why there is rare bipartisan agreement to stomp on their proposed strike. They can quickly renegotiate or they can accept the deal. No one is going to let them hostage the entire US economy over this.
It's like how the 50 states in the US combined to form the United States. All the countries in Europe formed the EU. Or maybe you want to be in ASEAN. You can also be in the United Nations. Lots of democracies form international organizations that create rules that individual voters in each country can't violate. The Paris Climate Accords are a good example. Lots of Americans (Republicans) don't like them, but they have to live with it.
Then going to the Republicans isn't going to help them. They want actual slaves. The only thing that will help is replacing the corporate Democrats with actual progressives.
