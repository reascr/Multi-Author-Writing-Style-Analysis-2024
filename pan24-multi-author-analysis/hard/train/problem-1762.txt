Well McConnell remembers the cold War and sees that Putin does too and wants a return to that kind of wife ranging Russian-centered power. He sees that NATO exists because Russia is still belligerent and is a threat on many different fronts.
Ipso facto Russia's interests are more aligned with MAGA enemies than with the USA's...but Putin is white, right wing, hates the gays, and is loved by Trump, so...
That would be so much more powerful if he hadn’t been a part of the biggest Russian apologist regime in American history .. he is part of the reason Putin had the nerve to do this..
Or like, the time Trump cow-towed to Putin’s (He had a very powerful denial!) over US intelligence community?
Not sure why you think Fiona Hill casts anything but a negative insight to Trump. In the interview you link she states he is easily manipulated and therefore a tremendous security risk to the country. In another interview she says American “democracy is done” if Trump is elected in 2024.
Or like, when he tried to bring Russia back into the G8 after a dozen or so Russian officials were indicted for interfering with the 2016 election in his favor?
You mean, “in league” like, when Trump Tower hosted the Russians after they said they wanted to help him win the 2016 election?
