What terrifies me at that point is the prospect for state government endorsed violence against communities that typically vote Democrat. When the state isn't accountable to a group, they tend to brutalize them with impunity.
And they'll have the legal mechanism to do it once Moore v. Harper is ruled on, and ISL theory becomes law of the land.
Wisconsin could possibly do it, depending on how broad support ISL gets in the Moore v Harper ruling? Maybe? But it's still kind of iffy and very situational. The states that are most likely to decide to overturn results in favor of a Republican are the ones that are going to go Republican anyway.
So we stand a very real chance of a 269-269 tie if Republicans choose to throw out the results in states where the control the legislature.
In some chambers, you would need every single Republican--or nearly every Republican--will vote to overturn the electors. However, that's very unlikely. Consider, for example, Arizona, where both chambers have a two member GOP majority. They can't afford a single defection. Meanwhile, fewer than half of the state's House Republicans were willing to cosponsor a bill that would allow a legislative special session to confirm election results--this is a much lower bar than actually rejecting the results and choosing a new custom slate of electors! North Carolina can afford three defections in their Senate but a number of their senators opposed Trump's efforts to overturn 2020. Georgia has a larger GOP majority, but there's a very open and bitter battle between the pro-democracy and pro-denialist factions, but the pro-democracy side largely won in the '22 primaries.
And don't forget the electoral college that favors the GOP so heavily that they've won 3 out of 6 presidential elections this century while only winning the popular vote once.
