People will get an urge to kill those who they blame problems on and see as weird, disgusting etc. That nature can be directed on specific groups but its inherent within human societies and needs to be actively checked so it dosent get out of control.
That depends on the person, one man could become more forgiving with it while another might decide they need to fight satans homosexual minions.
Edit: im aware of the negative aspects of religious people iam not claiming that religious people are somehow more morally righteous than atheists. Or inherently better in any way. Only claim im making is that atheism is a result of ignorance and those who are atheists should continue to look for more understanding and knowledge.
Atheism isn't a result of ignorance, we just tend to argue with you, which is normal with such contrary viewpoints.
And by let it i mean to approach it with a more philosophical mind because if you refuse to look at everything you perceive with a different pov your not gonna see anything new.
