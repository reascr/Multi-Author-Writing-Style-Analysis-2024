Ukraine was fucked either way and they knew it. As horrible for them as this war is, in my opinion it pales in comparison to the prospect of spending multiple generations under a neo-Soviet autocratic empire. I think most Ukrainians understand that, specially now. At least I hope so.
You're right, although I think you may have misunderstood the quote (or maybe I misunderstood you). What he was saying is that in order for Ukraine to join NATO they would first have to go though a full-scale war with Russia, because Russia would try to prevent them from joining. He goes into detail on Russia's reasoning behind this but it boils down to "the west/NATO will lose interest in Ukraine if they're involved in a war".
In a way Ukraine is cutting the fingers and toes off of Russia, making them much more ineffective against Ukraine.
What I'm most surprised about is that Ukraine is in a position to do so. The fact that they're not only resisting, but bombing Russia is pretty incredible.
Really must say the Ukrainians are showing the world a brilliant display of modern defensive warfare.
So it makes one wonder if these small target attacks by Ukraine are a classic case of “Rope a Dope” to wear down Russia’s offensive capabilities.
