- Cuba takes the money in return gives Beijing a bunch of empty promises like many African countries. Seriously, what’s China going to do? Invade a country that’s right next to the US? All China can really threaten is to stop providing money.
China is clearly trying to buy influence by giving them huge loans. But once the money changes hands they don’t really have to give a crap about China unless they want more money from them.
Yes you’re correct - China has no intention of getting their money back - they know they won’t. They just want the land / strategic ports. Once money changes hands never happens because it’s highly unlikely these countries can pay off these debts. There’s a reason they go to China for loans (China offers 4x interest rates compared to institutions like the world bank or IMF) - it’s because no one else will offer them money (world bank / imf).
China, which gets $Billions in ultra low interest loans by running a "Developing Nation" scam, turns around and loans the money to struggling nations, with nasty Gotcha terms hidden in the fine print.
Not to mention, there is no stopping another country from doing what China is doing, loan them money in hopes of influence ignoring the high risk of default.
But if the debtor countries refuse to give up the land and just declare bankruptcy, there is little China can do - and they suffer no real consequences because no one else was willing to lend them anyway.
