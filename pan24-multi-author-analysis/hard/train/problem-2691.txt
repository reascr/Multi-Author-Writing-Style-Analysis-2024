u/OnceAndFutureMayor makes a good point about sea level rise, most people today live near coasts, and coasts were rich sources of food. Sea levels have risen. But pottery is quite portable, and durable. What probably did exist is societies like the Chinook. They lived near rivers with tremendous salmon runs, and they had very developed, densely populated settlements. We have archaeological evidence of hunter- gatherers who converged at Gobekli Tepe every year, where there was abundant wild grain, and animals that came to eat the grain. People seem to have gathered in tremendous numbers, like a Stone Age Burning Man. It was a complex society, but not technological.
An advanced society like that would require a huge number of resources. Obtaining resources from the natural environment, regardless of which ones, leaves evidence. Turning those resources into whatever you need to support a society leaves evidences. And then at the end, everything that was created leaves trash as it breaks and is discarded. And yet, we’ve found none of these traces. That makes it incredibly unlikely that such a society has existed.
Because the evidence wouldn’t be gone. An advance civilization like that would leave so many traces on the surrounding environment that it is just not possible for them all to be gone.
But old civilisations as advanced as the Greeks or Mayans disappear without a single buried tool, cave painting depicting buildings or rock carving?
I find it highly likely that there were stone age complex civilizations that we have little or know evidence of long, long before 6000 years ago. I don't find that much of a stretch at all. There was a huge city somewhere near the Mississippi before European contact that likely was significantly larger and more economically complex than London at the same time. But they didn't work metal, so evidence of the city was difficult to find.
