This somehow makes it even more ridiculous that we don't have tanks ourselves (well, technically we lease 18 Leopards from Germany for knowledge retention). Even with the recent investments in the military to get us back to NATO's 2% requirement, there's still no plans to reintroduce tanks into the army.
The Netherlands shouldn't (and wouldn't) wait for Russia to get to the Dutch border before joining the fight. As part of NATO we have a responsibility to our allies to defend their borders if it comes to it. And an effective defense would require tanks.
That's fair. But during the cold war the Netherlands fielded around a thousand tanks. Of course cold war tanks and modern tanks are a different beast, but it still seems like we should have sufficient scale to field an efficient tank force.
Besides, Poland has still tanks of soviet design they could provide. Nobody is stopping them but themselves. Same shenanigans as with their MiGs they can't send, because the US won't do it for them.
We do know that nations ask for export permissions, even when they know they will be declined. What is stopping Poland or any other Nation to do exactly them same?
Isn't the whole fundamental idea that they can't be bothered with a bit of paperwork genuinely absurd?
