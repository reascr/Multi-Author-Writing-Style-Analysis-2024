In any case, even just plain logic is enough to see that there wasn't any fraud: assuming that PT frauded the elections when Bolsonaro and his minions were in power and very openly using the public machine in their own favor means that it was possible for PT to fraud the election when he won in 2018. If it was possible for PT to fraud the elections they(and any person or entity with their sanity intact) would never have allowed Bolsonaro to be president in the first place.
Make no mistake, many of these supported Bolsonaro during his government and deserve A LOT of criticism, but unlike the GOP a majority of the right-wing in Brazil is firmly against these terrorists and accepts the election results. This is also true for many of the right-wing (such as the speaker of the house) and center-right parties (such as the governor of Rio Grande do Sul) - even though they're formally opposition to Lula's government, they're all against the terrorists, in favour of the democratic process and ready to condemn Bolsonaro's cult.
If these people admit they were wrong, and that Bolsonaro just lost, they'll have to admit that they lost (because they've tied themselves emotionally to Bolsonaro), that their movement lost, and that, just maybe, all the borderline fascism they've been rationalizing for four years was just cheap fascism, and no different from its prior, discredited iterations.
It's not a coincidence, the Fascists have adopted the use of the Brazilian national symbols as their brand, they believe themselves to be the "only real patriots", so anyone who disagrees with their craziness now openly avoids using the flag, the yellow and green soccer t-shirt and any other national symbol that might make you look like a Bolsonaro follower.
To add to that, the people protesting in the article of this post are not wearing green and yellow simply because any time you see someone using the flag or soccer shirt, you imediatelly associate with Bolsonaro's supporters now. It will be a while for us to stop this unconcious association and get this symbols to represent the actual diversified country in our minds again.
