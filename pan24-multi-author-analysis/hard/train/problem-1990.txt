It would be worse for the red states, but it would likely benefit blue states, especially my home of California. Hell California could be its own country and survive. We are the fifth biggest economy in the world, we have the capacity of producing a lot of our own food, the only thing we would struggle with is water, which is something we already struggle with and will likely have to use desalination technology eventually.
Most other blue states would also benefit from no longer subsidizing the red states. Some things would likely become more expensive, food prices for example because they would need to import a lot more. But in reality, there is not a ton of economic downfall for blue states if the red states succeeded.
Wouldnâ€™t the red states benefit from exporting food to the blue states? And tourism if they have national parks? If a state became blue let say, does it join the rest of the blue states? Can a state change is political orientation and join the other side?
Or better yet, can we work together and work for an actual solution that benefits ordinary people? Can we end the red vs blue culture wars?
