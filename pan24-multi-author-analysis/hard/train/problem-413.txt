How exactly was this an "easily predictable" earthquake? Is the city like those in California, built on a fault line where its known to have quakes?
Building quality in a country that lies on several seismic fault lines has come into sharp focus in the aftermath of the quake.
With chances of finding more survivors growing more remote, the toll in both countries from Monday's earthquake and major aftershocks rose above 33,000 and looked set to keep growing. It was the deadliest quake in Turkey since 1939.
Türkiye has a lot of reckoning to do in the aftermath of the quakes. The most obvious is who’s for the shoddy construction, lack of oversight, absent Earthquake Tax Funds, lack of coordination in relief efforts, and other problems. Naturally Erdogan is saying “This is a time for unity, solidarity, In a period like this, I cannot stomach people conducting negative campaigns for political interest.” Sounds like the rhetoric we have after Mass gun shooting’s, when politicians are asked how can they be prevented.
