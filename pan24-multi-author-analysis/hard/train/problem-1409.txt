Well Trump said he might announce his candidacy as soon as next week so it has to be expected that people will want to know if Biden is running again too.
- If Trump runs then Biden will run because Biden believes that he is the only democrat who can beat Trump.
What happens while Biden is in office matters and will be used for or against our Party in 2024. Low-engaged voters will blame the WH more than the GOP chambers in 2024 too.
We have Harris leave office and install someone like Rep. Hakeem Jeffries as VP and then have Biden step down a few months later. POTUS Jeffries then picks the person who will be his 2024 running mate as VP, for this exercise lets say Whitmer if she is reelected.
If Progressives want to rise they need to target seats where they have the most votes and keep building where they see growing support. Encourage younger people to vote in groups either with friends or family and post their 'I voted' sticker/pics on social media.
First/foremost we cut deals with neocons because they don't want Trump or more maga-republicans coming to DC in 2025. Figure out warm and cozy bipartisan path to keep the Chambers Red and WH Blue.
