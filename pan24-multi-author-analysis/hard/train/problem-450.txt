"I was at that undisclosed location with a bunch of Republicans who were â€“ one in particular who was gleeful at what was transpiring outside.

Ty so much. I was raised in the deep south, so I did everything to "pray the gay away". I became very feminine to "pass" in society, because my family spoke openly about their hatred for gays. I lost all of them when they found out.
But I would like to give a very deep and heartfelt thanks to all the straight people who are wonderful and understanding. I tell my daughter not to lose faith in human beings, because the hateful ones can drown out the good. If it wasn't for straight people standing up and protecting us, we would be doomed. It's heartbreaking to see all the hate coming back with a vengeance. I really thought we were past that, but the propaganda from the right is growing and bringing back so much venom. I'm afraid for my daughter. I always remind her not to lose faith in people because some are hateful. I show her all the straight people who are on our side and who keep us safe. I think Thanksgiving is a great day to give a heartfelt thanks to all of you who stand up for us. I'm so grateful for all of you.
I appreciate that. I try to be pragmatic too. I generally strongly support the notion of meeting people where they're at and winning hearts and minds with civil, constructive dialogue.
