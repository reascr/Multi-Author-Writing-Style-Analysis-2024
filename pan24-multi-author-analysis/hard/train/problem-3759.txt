It might take some time to get more ammunition manufacturing facilities up to speed but we aren’t running out of anything.
The United States has been supplying Ukraine with a ton of weaponry all the time, not to mention the intelligence apparatus that’s been created for this.
"The West" has tons of stuff that is not given to Ukraine, say Abrams tanks, F-22s, F-35, F-16, nukes..
You would be making some sense if NATO was utilizing artillery doctrine like Russia or Ukraine. But unlike them NATO have capable air force and guided munition stocks to utilize different doctrine, and if lets say USA would see need in more dumb ammunition production, they would increase it in no time because those cost peanuts in comparison to guided munition.
So how did you come to conclusion they are running out of three primary factors to deter China. Because if you haven't study geography. Before China would be able to do anything on ground in Taiwan they have to get naval and air superiority and cross Taiwan Strait.
In no way does this war threaten our ability to defend ourselves or Taiwan from China. If anything, it’s getting us more ready.
