I'm guessing Biden/Pete don't want to implement any real regulations that could be used as an excuse by airlines to jack up prices. But that's the most charitable way of looking at it. And now the end result is probably higher prices anyway as Southwest will have to make the improvements they should have made 6 months ago and they will be out millions of revenue from this holiday season.
But even so have fines of $0 for cancelled flights that are the error of Southwest's refusal to properly staff or invest in IT isn't the answer.
If the fines are just on Southwest and they raise prices too severely, won’t people just fly with another carrier? I don’t know enough about the airline industry, but it seems like there is competition and people can choose just not to fly SW if their tickets cost too much.
Are you really saying that having to fly at all cost is comparable to just having to move the plane back to the terminal (and getting delayed more)? Really? Obviously airlines will try to avoid waiting on the tarmac in the first place. But if that doesn't work out there is an easy and completely safe solution. Avoiding a cancellation or major delay in case of a technical problem is a safety risk. So is having a sick or tired pilot if there's no substitute.
