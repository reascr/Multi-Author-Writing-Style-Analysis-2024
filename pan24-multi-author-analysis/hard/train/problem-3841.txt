It's so crazy being 41 voting for Gore in 2000 and seeing 20 somethings and even 50 somethings saying both parties are the same and there is no point voting for democrats.
Yeah you can complain and say "Democrats don't do enoguh" but that is on voters because too many people vote for republicans or don't vote at all, never giving democrats enough votes to do anything.
Yeah, but making the issue out to be a situation where the angelic Democrats are desperately trying to save us from the evil GOP is dishonest.
Democrats and Republicans alike love when the poor stay poor. Classism has nothing to do with the Republican party and has everything to do with the working class vs. the elites. Most Democrat politicians either opposed debt cancelation up until very recently, or at the very least have done nothing to attempt to move it forward. You should be mad not just at the AG of Arizona because they are not the only one who's kept Americans in debt. Even some progressives have blood on their hands.
.... A lawsuit getting thrown out means the cancelation is all clear to move forward you realize, right? Or at least it removes one more hurdle.
Would you have preferred the statement, "It gives us the all clear to move forward... Well, not quite yet, but it removes a hurdle?".
Yep. Putting more money in the hands of those who are more likely to spend rather than hoard creates demand in the market. A healthy economy is one where money flows through it, like blood through its veins.
