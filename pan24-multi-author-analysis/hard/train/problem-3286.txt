Why do they have to fight in the tunnels? Russia can just work to encircle the mine. And the tunnels probably aren't accessible to resupply easy. It makes no sense to post up in the tunnels here. This isn't Vietnam.
Yeah they went there because they had no other choice . It wasn't a part of any grander plan. It was in no way advantageous for the Ukrainians there in any way so I'm not sure what point you are trying to make .
At least Ukraine should have an advantage, a lot more soldiers have night vision, in the russian army you have to buy it yourself.
The big question is how safe are Russias ammo depots in Ukrainian territory? If Russia is completely unable to hide them then choosing a location like the mine would actually be a good idea since Ukraine would attack them anyways and a mine is much easier to defend and would give more room for mistakes.
In addition to this there are so many things that play a role, like how easy is it to collapse those tunnel? Would Russia be able to dig them up again? How many entrances are there? How safe are other Russian ammo depots? Is Russia able to deploy enough anti-air systems in the area? How extensive is the mine? How many entrances have good road access? Has Ukraine already booby trapped the mine?
Honestly, there are so many points that come into play here and all of this is so far out of my area of expertise that I can't say whether it's just bullshit that I heard about or whether it's actually reliable.
If it's the choice between attacking one location that goes boom and attacking several locations that only collapse, then I'd say that the latter is much more difficult to achieve. Especially if the collapse isn't big enough as it'd then be possible to dig up again in a timely manner.
