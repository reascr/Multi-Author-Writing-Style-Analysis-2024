Find out which documents are missing from Trump and why our intelligence sources were murdered "at an alarming number.".
Yes. I also didn't read that report until the end of the whole saga, and while there was no deliberate mishandling of classified material, classified material was mishandled and put at risk.
I cared an awful lot about this when it was Hillary. I cared much less about it when it was Trump, and even less now. Apparently, the people in charge of maintaining and securing classified documents don't give a shit, why should I?
What I learned through all of these sagas is that it shouldn't matter to me. I apologize for caring about it as much as I did when it was Hillary. It was an honest mistake. I didn't realize at the time how little importance properly securing government secrets was, that you're allowed to be reckless and irresponsible with them.
So, mishandling classified material doesn't matter unless it was deliberate. Irresponsible or reckless handling of classified material, like storing it on a private server in your basement, is completely fine.
