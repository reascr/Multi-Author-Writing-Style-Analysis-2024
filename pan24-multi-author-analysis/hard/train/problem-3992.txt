I really do not think this is an issue. Or why it is even getting any coverage at all. These documents are from when Biden was VP. What is any relevance here? And Who cares?
Point 1) this doesn't matter. Just because it's fewer doesn't mean they have less sensitive information. EVERYTHING ELSE you said was 100% true though. It is an entirely different scenario.
It’s pretty clearly a different situation. Biden found less than a dozen documents, which were immediately turned over to the national archives. Trump took boxes and boxes of classified documents to his resort, which is now famously swarming with foreign guests and not at all secure, and then refused to turn them over, claiming they were his property now. This situation should definitely be investigated so we know how it happened, but over-classification had long been understood to be a big problem, so it isn’t totally surprising that these documents are occasionally lost track of. That’s not the same thing as deliberately taking large numbers of them.
