I'm the only liberal in my immediate family; only one branch of them went full anti-COVID, which really showed me how extreme they are.
My parents, half-brother, his wife, and their kid all were immunized; they were furious when my half-sister, her husband, and their four kids all exposed them to COVID by showing up at a family gathering, refusing to wear masks, and then spreading COVID conspiracies. Exposed my niece, straight out of the NICU, as well as my mom and her immunocompromised friend (chemo) to COVID.

The trick is poison the cancer to death and not poison the person. So they punch the patient as far down as possible before damage, then give them a little break, then back into the ring (ding ding!).
Ok. Hundreds of thousands of Republicans died after they believed in lies. Fair point. On the other side of the conversation it is. “You mean fake died of the fake news fake kung flu??? Ha Those dead people are not dead Do not believe scientists or your eyes or your ears or your brain Trust Donald and Tucker”.
