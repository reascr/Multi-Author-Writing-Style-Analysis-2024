Off top of my head, the $1 billion package included 10 120 mm, 82mm, and 60mm mortar systems plus ammo, the patriot battery, more Excalibur 155mm howitzer rounds and HIMAR rockets, more MRAPs (mine resistant trucks) and HMMWVs, more HARM anti radar missiles, and JDAM guided missiles. Then the $800 million that's actually part of the US military budget is to purchase Soviet caliber artillery munitions (122mm artillery/rocket, 152mm artillery, and 125mm tank rounds). Then there is a whole assortment of small arms and munitions.
100+ M249 squad automatic weapons. M249’s love to eat ammo, which is why they’re sending 17.5 million 5.56 NATO rounds.
50+ M240 machine guns along with 2 million rounds of 7.62 NATO. (NOTE: other NATO members recently donated a couple dozen 240’s and millions of 7.62 rounds).
2,700+ AR platform rifles along with twelve and a half million 5.56 NATO rounds (plus an additional 5 million rounds to be delivered by February 2023).
45 refurbished M2 Browning 50 caliber machine guns, no mention of ammunition being shipped along with them but I’d assume they’re being taken care of.
