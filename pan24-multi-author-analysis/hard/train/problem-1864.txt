I wouldn’t be so sure about that. gop already been spreading bs about dems writing blank checks with no accountability and the trumper base doesn’t give a fuck about ukraine just read the comments on every fox news article about ukraine defense aid. likely new speaker of the house already harping about audits and cutting aid just to flex and keep people divide about shit.
i’ll continue paying attention to fox news because i want to stay informed about what’s up on the wrong side of the fence. gop took the house so they’re going to be cock clocking shit all day long. all that’s on their mind is making the current administration look bad, they don’t give a fuck about ukraine or what the voters want.
You have to be so naive to actually believe the US has the Ukrainians in their best interests... Plus, it's not like any of this has happened before in history....
They are imperialists for doing those things, and they do those things because they are imperialists. You could say, however, that the "ideology", or rather production system, that guides these decisions is capitalism. Imperialism is the highest form of capitalism.
What? Do you know what "imperialist" means?? It is in their best interests and they do this because they are imperialists, it is not besides the point.
Oh, I see where the confusion is coming from. Imperialism isn't an ideology, like "liberal". See, the united States doesn't label themselves as "imperialists", they are imperialists because of the actions of their government. Them "acting on their best interests" by inciting a war in a foreign country is one of the many things that make them imperialists. Russia invading Ukrainian territory and acting on their "best interests" is one of the things that make them imperialists. NATO taking part in this conflict by trying to expand their influences further east, acting on their "best interests" is what makes them imperialists.
