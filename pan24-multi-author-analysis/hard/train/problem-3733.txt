Can I get some clarification on something I’ve always had trouble understanding? Serious question not messing around, so I’m sorry if I seem like an idiot.
People say they’re “half Jewish”, so, one of your parents is Jewish and one parent is like, Catholic or something? Or is Jewish technically an ethnicity, like saying I’m half Korean because my mom is Korean and grew up in Seoul before coming to America? Or would it be more accurate to say half Asian? Is Judaism a religion and an ethnicity, like are the two mutually exclusive? What if then, one of my parents were hypothetically ethnically Jewish but for one reason or another grew up ethnically Jewish but practicing Christianity or Islam? Would it still be technically correct to say I’m half Jewish?
Yeah, and let's be real orthodox Jewish are the "hardcore" Jewish. Like you think catholicism is strict? Go talk to an orthodox Jewish person and they will make you see catholicism is like kindergarten in comparison.
Jewishness is an interesting topic in my family (my wife is Jewish). There are religious Jews - some of which started out following other religions, or no religions, and converted. There are cultural Jews which were raised by one or more Jewish families and almost never go to a synagogue - and also tend not to believe in god or have a problem mixing meat and dairy. Then there are racial Jews, people born to Jewish parents or to a Jewish mother, or were born in Israel, etc. that are considered Jewish but run the gammut from ultra orthadox Jews to Jews that just happen to identify as Semitic in a racial way. There are lots of people in Israel that don't really practice any religion but still consider themselves to be Jews.
Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and nation originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah. Jewish ethnicity .
