I understand that it’s not his voice, but it’s his melody and such that he’s had a lot of success with. I just feel like before it was released he heard it, if nothing more than to essentially approve it or be the first to hear Gravy’s version since he did use Rick’s song.
It looks like Gravy licensed the composition of the song and imitated Rick Astley without his involvement.
I listened to the song before I read the whole article, and I thought the singing at the start was Rick Astley.
Why would he have heard the song? Gravy paid the writers of the song, Stock Aitken Waterman, not Rick. You're not hearing his voice, that's an imitation.
As for someone else profiting by imitating his voice, again, that could spark further interest in his work. I don't see any reason why Yung Gravy's profit is necessarily Astley's loss, in this situation.
It's Astley's decision to make, and as I said, it sounds like he has a pretty chance of prevailing in court, but as a practical matter that course of action may not be without risk.
That's trademark. Part of the challenge in understanding how it all works is that in common vernacular it all gets lumped together as "IP" when there are different legal frameworks for copyright, trademark, patents, and (in some jurisdictions) right of publicity.
Looks like he's got a good shot at winning the lawsuit, since right of publicity (aka closely mimicking his voice) and the musical composition are covered separately under the law. But is it a good idea for him to be going after Yung Gravy like this? I mean, let's face it, Rick Astley's fame, and likely a huge chunk of his recurring revenue from Never Gonna Give You Up are due to the meme, which gives him far more visibility and streaming revenue than he'd otherwise have. If people stop using the meme because he's seen as an a-hole, he can kiss a lot of that recurring revenue goodbye.
