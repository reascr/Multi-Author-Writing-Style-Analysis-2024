However, it is behind a pay wall so I can only confirm the snippet of the article that Google found related to my search.
Either way, "also burn wood fuel" does not mean that they are entirely heated by wood but could be a mix of all and partial wood based home heaters.
Edit to clarify: practically all our wood-burning houses have central heating with hot-water radiators and a wood-burning oven that heats the water. In the house I'm in now, there's an automation that switches to electric heating at night if the water temperature drops to a certain point. These systems aren't generally built into new houses, since not many people are willing to make their own firewood nowadays.
Wood is perfectly good for colder climates, as well. Plenty of houses here in Finland are either wood-heated or running a wood/electricity hybrid system - I'm in a house like that right now.
The uk has the largest wood pellet power plant in the world… so in a round about way I’m sure lots of people are technically heating their homes with wood.
It's actually not great for air quality if lots of houses have wood burners. I lived in an old, fancier part of down during covid and during the winter I had to keep my window closed 24/7 because all the smoke went into my room.
Even walking to the shops, all I could smell was smoke. There was some research done in Australia that showed higher levels of respiratory problems in areas with lots of wood burners. I think including cancers. Need to find the link.
