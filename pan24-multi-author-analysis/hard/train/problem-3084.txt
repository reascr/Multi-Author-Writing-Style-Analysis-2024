It's pretty impressive how well Trump and Elon are continuously shitting their own beds, and how their supporters are paniking.
It's amazing watching people finally, sadly, and hilariously disown trump as their own. As well as all the conservative outlets that post it getting smeared, calling it a hoax. It's freaking amazing.
Amazing. I couldn't come up with a more ridiculous parody of this if I tried full time for a year. I love how piss poor and fake looking the "art" is. Half of these barely look like him at all.
Not even a vague attempt was made to make it appear as though he's capable of even looking like he's doing things that he thinks look cool. Let alone any attempt to actually showcase him actually doing something.
No wonder he's insecure. He full well knows that to get a series of images of him looking "cool" and "collectable" means making up the images whole cloth. Could you imagine an attempt to create this series with actual photographs of him? He knows how fucking stupid that would look.
