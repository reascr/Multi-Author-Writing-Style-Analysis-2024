Thats a very incomplete list. Brands like Lagunitas, Dos Equis, Red Stripe, Tecate, Strongbow, New Castle Brown Ale, etc... all are owned (or distributed) by Heineken.
It's pretty well known that Heineken sold in the US is different than the ones sold in Europe. So you should probably blame your local countrymen for having bad taste cause Heineken adjusted their beer to accommodate American taste.
As someone who drinks a lot of cheap beer and has traveled a lot all over Europe I would say no European country I have been to has had worse bad beers than the US. Your bad beers are in a league of their own and the reputation is well deserved. Even Malta's Cisk is better than the cheap American lagers.
Sadly, yes, and I have no clue why since there are plenty of cheaper and better plain lagers. But Heineken also has a lot of other beers, some of them actually good.
But there are better tasting beers out there. But like I said if I see this in my house I'm gonna drink it, just go get a buzz and be happy .
Oh, I always find Heineken beer here at my house. My dad says he doesnt care for taste and he will just drink it to get drunk. So sometimes he will have them laying around and wont drink em ever sometimes so I drink em and now I got used to the beer and whenever I see one I drink one. I'm not from Europe tho I'm from the U.S.
Pretty decent If you ask me. Guitar player from slayer drank alot of Heineken. Even has a guitar painted in Heineken. What makes you hate it so much tho?
