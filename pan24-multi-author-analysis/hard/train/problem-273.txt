It says top not "the top" implying it's one of the top US spy agencies. It's a stupid clickbait tactic to get you to click on the article to see what agency they're talking about because which agency is the "top" is subjective and depends on what type of operation you're talking about.
Edit: I also read the article (I know I gave into the clickbait) and it's not even an agency but the director of national intelligence who said this who oversees all of the intelligence agencies.
I think the greater issue here is calling the Director of National Intelligence the head of the top US spy agency. Sort of but they’re not the head of one, agency, but rather they agencies report to them. That’s like quoting Biden as the “Head of the Top US State.”.
Lol totally fair. As someone who has a degree in marketing and an at least average intellect they irritate me too. Normally I see right through them and think they’re incredibly dumb, but this time I appear to have been out-semanticsed.
Technically correct but not clear. Better phrasing would have been “Head of US Intelligence Community”.
