I’m not sure how Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Nepal, and Laos would view their Chinese neighbors, but I’m sure Myanmar, Vietnam, India, Bhutan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would all agree, yeah, China isn’t a “force of peace and stability”.
Publicly, they can’t be too antagonistic with China, but the South China Sea dispute and Vietnam’s growing ties to America seem to suggest a different view….
Again, China doesn't want to engage in war against the American navy where they've many carriers, submarines, plenty of missiles to destroy all Chinese main naval and shipping ports within a week. The US can comfortably impose a full blockade of all ships out of the south China sea with their airforce, carriers and submarines. Don't think China has a chance to go head to head with the F35s, submarines and aircraft carriers on top of sanctions.
And yes the US navy is free to travel through the waters but antiship missiles are increasingly large threats. Saturating a naval group with such missiles is far easier when your many airbase can sortie far more aircraft then the aircraft and airbases the US can muster in that region, especial with forces all over the world.
Next on military development agenda longer and longer range air defence systems including the radar component for both low flight patterns as well as high.
