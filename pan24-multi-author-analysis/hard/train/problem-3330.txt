It's not quite as stupid as that but then it becomes much more stupid than that. The reason they're asking for money now is because they're ending their free streaming which DirecTV says invalidates any claims that it's DirecTV that's reducing accessability to Newsmax content.
Right now, DirectTV pays $0 to Newsmax, but DirectTV also does not require any advertising time and lets Newsmax offer its streaming services as well.
Although the specific amounts are not public, Newsmax wants DirectTV to PAY newsmax, for the privledge of carrying the channel.
Now, Newsmax is demanding that DirectTV pay them. DirectTV says that Newsmax isn't worth it, and says they will honor the current deal.
Conversely, DirecTV MUST feel, based on the ratings, and they’d know, that Newsmax isn’t worth what they’re asking. Plus, I don’t believe they have anything else to offer. When MSNBC, CNN, & FoxNews come up for renegotiations, they bundle (or at least Fox did, they’re on their own now) the news with their other channels; ie DirecTV could get all the local NBC affiliates for free but they’ll pay $.08 for MSNBC, etc. (that’s a guess, it could be higher based on subscribers).
Now, I don’t know the particulars of the Newsmax deal, but my guess is that, since they’re relatively new, they went with a low or non-existent subscriber fee, living solely on broadcast advertising for a time. They probably also offered DirecTV (and the other top 9 cable distributors) a portion of ads per hour to sell on their own as well, sweetening the deal.
From what I understand a good section of the boomer market for television subscriptions, especially in rural areas play Dish against DiretTV all the time. When the rate increases they just switch to the competitors lower costing service. Special offers, introductory rates, and just trying to out do each other. Back, and forth, back and forth. It really helps if you're on a fixed income.
