Miners and gays united over their shared loathing of Thatcher. Maybe Scottish trans supporters and nationalists can unite over their shared loathing of English interference.
I'm pretty sure even the most severely transphobic Scottish folks will support this bill even harder because they hate the English dare telling them what to do.
Grats England you just helped forward the Scottish independence movement and also probably got conservative Scots more on the side of trans people just to spite you.
You won’t get a single response - some will tell you that it’s bigotry, while others will tell you that it’s just to make a point in overruling Scotland’s parliament.
However, the stated ‘formal’ reason is because it is deemed to conflict with laws where power is solely reserved for the UK parliament. In other words, implementing the law would affect UK-wide equality law - which is beyond the scope of powers devolved to the Scottish parliament.
A complex topic that cuts across both reserved matters in UK-wide constitutional law and gender equality? This isn’t going to be one of Reddit’s best discussions….
It might be, but it’s worth looking at the polling on this topic. Like the rest of the UK, the broad Scottish sentiment is in favour of more inclusivity, but polls that use specific wording for this bill (e.g. ‘do you support or oppose reducing the age at which a person can apply for a gender recognition certificate from 18 to 16?) show a large majority against (or at least the ones that are in the Times do!).
