I'd like everyone to take note of MTG's reply - it is as if she is responding to something else that a far less intelligent and far less competent person in Dre's position might have said. She is responding to an ethno-caricature she made up in her head for Dre.
"While I appreciate the creative chord progression, I would never play your words of violence against women and police officers, and your glorification of the thug life and drugs.".
So true. Conservatives are far too consumed enjoying the supposed irony of "whiny liberals who used to care about things and listen to Rage Against the Machine in the 90s" are now the ones wearing masks and getting vaccinated like over 99% of licensed physicians in the US, effectively transforming themselves into The Man whom they used to hate, according to the science-illiterate moron community.
EDIT: Tried to make it clearer I was mocking republicans and other anti-vaxxers thinking it makes any sense to dunk on people who like Rage Against the Machine but would also abide by reasonable advice from the medical and science communities.
