The candidate in question also called Biden senile & incoherent, and called for an investigation into Biden's alleged rape of Tara Reade:
I'd think he has plenty of baggage that precludes him from a role with the Biden admin, aside from his opinion re: the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
Perhaps this helps you understand why Jews (both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine) tend to be somewhat alarmed and offended by any insinuation that organizations rooted in the Jewish community manipulate politicians.
The problem is claiming any politician who supports Israel does so because they're being manipulated.
Lobbying barely explains it.. the core left wing is sympathetic with Palestine, and the core right wing is a roiling stew of antisemitism, so it boggles the mind how Israel is able to continually receive such positive treatment by our leaders.
The difference is that he's not saying this because they're Jewish Americans fighting for Jews around the world, he's saying this because they're lobbyists that are lobbying for an apartheid state.
Saying these remarks resemble antisemitism is not crazy but saying that antisemitism is the reason he's calling out a lobbying group and an apartheid state is crazy. It's a way for Israel & APAIC to shield itself from criticism without having to be accountable to their actions.
