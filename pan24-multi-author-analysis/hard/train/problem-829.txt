The topic of “abortion” and whether it is morally reprehensible is not specifically discussed in the Bible. In fact, the church did not adopt the “life begins at conception” ideology until the 1970s. Prior to that the teaching was that life begins at “first breath” ie birth. Also, the Bible did not “condemn homosexuality” until an Old Testament verse was intentionally mistranslated in the 1950s during the right wing nuclear family movement of the time. Even taking the verse at its modern face value, it’s Leviticus, which contains many teachings which are not congruent with Jesus’ New Testament teachings.
Other that abortion and being anti-LGBT, which are not truly Christian values, name A SINGLE Republican policy or stance which is pro-Christian or AT ALL reflects Jesus’ teachings? I’ll wait.
Not to mention the insane hatred and bigotry of the Republican Party which would and is OBVIOUSLY maligned with Jesus’ teachings.
Calling republicans the anti religious ones when democrats constantly promote antichristian ideology all the time. “Oh no it’s people we don’t like leading some committees We better blame racism and facism for this”.
