Yeah. Because Schengen is trying to get "Europe" as a concept on the same level as US is for interstate travel. Try immigrating from outside of Europe, especially unskilled immigration. The US has quotas for every country that just lets random people immigrate, rather than requiring a specific skill visa; that concept doesn't really exist for any country in Europe that I'm aware of. And disagreements even over Schengen and the "common market" was a commonly cited reason for Brexit.
People will also try to say workers in Europe have better protections than Americans, while conveniently ignoring that strikers and protesters in say .
