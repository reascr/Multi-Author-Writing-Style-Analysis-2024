Hmm … i see this from your CNN link: "Senior Justice Department officials have not made a final decision on whether to charge Gaetz, according to the source.".
And your WaPo article was better at explaining it too (thanks for that link): "Senior department officials have not made a final decision on whether to charge Gaetz, but it is rare for such advice to be rejected, these people told The Washinon Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations. They added that it is always possible additional evidence emerges that could alter prosecutors’ understanding of the case.".
So, not officially declined yet. But possibly leaning that way, unless something has happened in the last 2½ months. I see some reports from court filings that Greenberg is continuing to cooperate (with evidence under seal) in hopes of reducing this sentence. But maybe that’s nothing to do with Gaetz.
When did Gaetz become a 'former' associate? I mean, how does that work? How does one go about disassociating from his co-conspirator?
