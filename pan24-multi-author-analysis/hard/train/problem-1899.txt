For all you down voting me…. I’m not some conspiracy guy. This is just weird as it seems like the freak appended the door and that Paul had a glass of something in his hand. It just seems odd.
I’m not saying anything about anything I just think the whole thing is odd (no gay conspiracy) how they seem almost calm with drinks and then the guy freaks out and almost kills Paul.
I don't think it's odd that Paul had something in his hand, all kind of crazy shit happens during break ins.
If you find that's odd that a neckbeard broke into a home and fractured an 82 years old dude's skull with a hammer, you are probably not the only one.
If you think that there's something "fishy" and that this needs to be "researched", then you are probably not the only one either, there's a plethora of dumbasses out there that think that everything related to the democrats is staged.
Also, the dude seemed very calm when he opened the door. He might have been so delusional that he thought the police would have been on his side for all we know.
