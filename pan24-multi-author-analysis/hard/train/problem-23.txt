I boycotted and haven't watched a single game this year and people kept telling me it didn't matter and there's nothing we can do as they watched matches on 3 screens and subscribed to streaming services and logged onto streams.
And there it is. If this year had the lowest viewership for the last 4 or 5 world cups then maybe at the very least fifa would pote tially change a bit. Instead people throw their hands up and say "I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas". It's lazy and it's bullshit.
All I see every few years is how awful fifa is but then everyone stops caring because they want to watch the matches. If people truly wanted fifa to go away they wouldn't spend tens of thousands to go to these games and they wouldn't tune in by the billions to watch.
Well unless governments actually arrest or block these monsters what else do we have. It seems like ignoring or worse actively supporting modern day slavery is what most are doing.
Probably thought such a message would land poorly at a venue built on slave labor in a country that's basically in an endless war and doesn't respect human rights.
