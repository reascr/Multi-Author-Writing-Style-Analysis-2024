It was that ad that turned me away. I can not vote for some one that tucks a shirt in jeans w/ no belt. It’s a generational voting issue in my household….
I think people are generally voting for policies more so than for people. Lots of people believe that democrat policies have made things worse in the last two years. In a lot of respects this midterm election is a referendum on those policies. Walker, or whomever, as part of a republican majority, will be able to help push different policies. Maybe that's what you mean by "rooting for the team." But pretty simple... Republicans want fewer dems in position to push policies that Republicans disagree with and think are making things worse in so many ways. Dems do the same thing when they vote for Omar or Feinstein or others who are crazy or incompetent.
Looking past the bullshit ideology for a minute, Walker, Booberts, MTG, and so many more are just terrible candidates for the job.
Ignoring that republicans will vote for any warm corpse on the ticket next to the (R), are their candidates really the best they can do?
Is there a Democrat candidate running for office that’s as unhinged, delude, or hypocritical as Walker is? I feel like most Rs would say AOC or Bernie, but those are pretty baseless accusations. How are the Republicans defending Walker?
Warlock vs. Walker is just insane. It’s honestly embarrassing for our country that this is a neck and neck race.
I’ve seen the same ideas about Oz, too. Like “damn it primary voters, making me have to vote for Oz!”.
