People are expecting the legal system to work like it does on Law and Order where a criminal is investigated, arrested, and convicted in the same 44-minute episode.
If they had shared their info earlier there would be a much stronger claim of a political witch hunt as you say. Now they are in a position where the DOJ has to indict based on the criminal referral or ignore the congressional recommendation. At this point, it would be political not to indict.
If they choose not to at least indict, then it appears political not from party affiliation standpoint, but from a judicial standpoint. Not indicting Combover Caligula for the 6th (or the MaL docs, or the fake elector scheme) would send the concrete, irrefutable message that US politicians are indeed above the law. Not only to us but to the world, and if the US loses more of it's credibility due to refusing to hold criminal Presidents accountable, I doubt the DOJ wants that resting on it's shoulders as an organization as they themselves lose both crediblility and what's most important to them: funding.
☝️This is the intended purpose of both withholding information until now and the public recommendations. It keeps the investigation into J6 from being squashed by an opposing Congress and it puts the spotlight on the DOJ.
I also believe the DOJ has been running parallel investigations. January 6th, the fake electors, and the missing documents all have one common denominator: tRump himself.
