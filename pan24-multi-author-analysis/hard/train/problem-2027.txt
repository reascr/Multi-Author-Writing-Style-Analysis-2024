as an American that's absolutely astonishing to me. I've worked a lot of shit jobs where people don't even give one day's notice. They just don't show up one day and you get stuck having to do their job and yours at the same time. When I gave 3 weeks notice at my last shit job it was unheard of. I was the first person ever to do that.
That's not really true. When I worked for a German company, it was very hard for the Germans to get fired, but they were contractually required to give 3 months notice before leaving the company. That's basically unheard of in the US.
They also completely lost a number of industries. They've made up the difference since the price of oil has risen, but lots of manufacturing has left Russia and won't return. Almost every car factory in the country has closed or is operating at like 10% capacity since they can't import parts and foreign companies have left. New car sales in Russia have dropped something crazy like 80% since the war started. Once oil inevitably goes down in price there will be massive holes in the economy compared to before.
Yeah, it is a price to pay for job security. It's just a different way of doing things. They also have far more paid time off, but their pay is lower for similar white collar jobs. In the US, we get paid more, can quit whenever we want, but can also get fired whenever the company wants, and get less paid time off.
