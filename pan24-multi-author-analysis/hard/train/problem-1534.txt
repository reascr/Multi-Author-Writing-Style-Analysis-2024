Last time Russia had an attempted coup in 1993 the military was called in and decided to open fire, since Putin entered office the Russian government has built large amounts of paramilitary police forces excluding the standard police who we see break up riots and the Russian military is still happy to butcher “traitors”, so attempting a coup would just be a mass suicide attempt and the Russian people know it. They know it so well that there are many Russian jokes about doing as you are told and not criticising the state otherwise you disappear.
Now that is very true, they don’t care as it is their doctrine/military mentality they are proud that they threw men at machine guns in WW2 as it was patriotic it’s the same in Ukraine.
Forcing the enemy to spread out air defenses is def a tactic but I think this stems from the fact that they’ve made it clear that they want to exterminate the Ukrainian identity from the land if they won’t comply. It’s terroristic and genocidal because Putin’s facade will come crashing down along with the image that he can defend Russia if they don’t take Ukraine.
I do think there’s geopolitical reason as to why you’d not want Russia completely neutered. I’m not well versed enough on Macron to judge just how fascist he is haha.
Macron is a nationalist. There was a story where, during a parade Macron was participating in, he snatched a minors phone and broke it because said minor wasn't respecting him.
