The only similarity here is that documents are involved. The amount of documents, cooperation with DOJ & Archive, and return of the documents is all different.
Bingo! Having documents isn't the crime Trump is accused of. Refusing to return documents and obstructing efforts to retrieve documents is the crime Trump is accused of.
Trump's refusal to return the Documents and lying about not having them is in itself a crime. It wouldn't matter whether the documents were Secret or Top Secret.
If Trump had the documents, kept them safe, and gave them back when asked, I personally wouldn't care.
If trump would have just turned over the documents in the first place, we wouldn't even be discussing it anymore.
Let's also not forget to mention Trump personally sorted which documents he would and would not give back. The likelihood of Biden personally stashing confidential information is close to zero, this was something his team did. This is not to remove all responsibility Biden has in this mistake, which is what it is, but there is absolutely no sign of bad faith on his part. In the political points scoring arena that might not mean much to Trump supporters but as far as the law is concerned that key difference is very significant.
