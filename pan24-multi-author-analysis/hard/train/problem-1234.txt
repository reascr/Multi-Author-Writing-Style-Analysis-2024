Edit: To clarify here for all the people saying he would be fine, I'm not implying he wouldn't beat a Democrat he was running against. This is Utah, of course he would. I'm saying that I don't have the same confidence that he'd win a republican primary if he was challenged from the right. His net approval in Utah among Republican voters has been deep into negative numbers ever since Trump's impeachment, and if the right candidate ran against him, I think he would have a very difficult campaign ahead of him.
There hasn't been a lot of polling on it this year, but as of the last results he has a pretty ugly negative net approval in Utah. That might have just been backlash from him supporting Trump's impeachment and might have worn off by now, but I've yet to see him make it into positive since.
edit: I will say in the spirit of fairness, disapproving of him doesn't mean that these people disapprove enough to vote for a Democrat or stay home and not vote.
It's good people like yourself make the choice to change, but they need to stop pretending that somehow the Republican party of 2012 is any different from the Republican party of 2022. The only difference is how outwardly vocal the party is now. Still though you can't just say I voted Republican then and now I don't just to justify your poor thinking and decision making of the past by saying,"well back then the party wasn't like it is now". Frankly, yes it was, and if the Republican party wasn't universally hated now because of how outwardly disgusting they are, you would essentially vote for them.
Why are you voting for something that's not a moral pillar especially when there is always a better choice than a Republican? You see Bain capital as problematic but you vote Romney anyway?
