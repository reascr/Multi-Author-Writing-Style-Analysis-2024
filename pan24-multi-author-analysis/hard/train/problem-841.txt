Do you really think that Saudi Arabia cares about that? If anything, they're probably bitter and asking why they've been so nice to their mortal enemy and when they will stop cooperating with them. I'll bet you anything that as the amount of money Saudi Arabia invests in China increases, they will start to attempt to coerce the cutting of ties with Iran.
To China, whatever problems SA and Iran have is between them and China is not going to actively support/manipulate one against another. However, China does want them to resolve their problems peacefully, focus more energy on the development of their country and increase international trades; which will benefits China.
China has friendly relationship with Saudi Arabia (and Iran) for many decades now. And given the current geopolitical conditions: Russian-Ukraine war, Sanctions/Price-Cap on Russian oil , therefore China needs a more stable/back-up energy source. SA almost always a top 1 or 2 energy source for China, therefore China needs to maintain a good relationship with SA.
China tries its best to adhere to its Mutual Non-Interference policy and it kinda works. China have workable/good/friendly relationship with both North Korea and South Korea, Palestine and Israel, Ukraine and Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran...etc.
