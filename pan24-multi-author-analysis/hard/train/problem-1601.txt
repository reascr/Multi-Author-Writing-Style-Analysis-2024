According to Madeleine Albright in her book Fascism: A Warning, you couldn't find any Mussolini supporters after he got strung up at the gas station. Entire towns that had been flying fascist banners, holding parades, and wearing black shirts just the day before had been stripped of anything remotely fascist, and everyone who lived there just shrugged their shoulders when asked about it, as if it had never even happened. From post-war interviews, you'd get the idea that Mussolini never had any support and his rise to power was a complete mystery that nobody noticed until it was too late. "Mussolini? Never heard of her.".
Yeah. I'm not unhappy with the most recent election, at least overall, but to think that things couldn't turn around in a couple years is short sighted. All it would take is for people to become apathetic again, and not turn out to vote.
I think there's more chance for people to become more involved by 2024 because republicans seem to want to double down on their current tactics, but I wouldn't assume that they lose enough voters in the interim to really make them go away.
