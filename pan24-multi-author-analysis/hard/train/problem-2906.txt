During Trump's 2018 midterm elections, Democrats outspent Republicans by almost $500 Million - and the end result was Democrats gaining 41 House seats and 7 Governors. This was a very typical 'blue wave', even though Republicans still had Senate majority. At that time this was the most ever spent on a midterm election.
This midterms, Republicans outspent Democrats by over $1 Billion, and these Republican donors were expecting an even greater conversation rate in comparison to the 2018 midterms. The total spending on the Republican party is $4.8 Billion, the highest in history - eclipsing the amount spent on 2018 by nearly $2 Billion. They were expecting a 'red tsunami'. After all, last time in 2018 Democrats outspent Republicans by $500M and gained 41 seats, so this time Republicans outspending Democrats by more that double should easily flip the same number of seats, right?
Considering how close many of these races were I would hardly call it a rejection of Republicans more as a barely able to hold back fascists and Democrats had better not rest on their fucking laurels again.
Holy shit, it only took Trump massively flopping for r/conservative to actually be introspective for once, they have finally realized that their party doesn't appeal to anyone and only tries to make it harder to vote.
But now that they’ve seen all the maga candidates lose, the media outlets that control the opinions of the gop voters are going to feed those people anti trump sentiment for months and months, and so you’ll see a huge shift in opinion. They have to, they wasted so much money on those candidates and they lost, so they need to shift their zombies opinions to a more viable candidate.
