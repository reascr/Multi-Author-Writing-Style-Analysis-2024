Not entirely true in TX. Five years after your sentence is completed, you are good to go, although I suppose you are still potentially subjecting yourself to Federal charges, the State of TX doesn't care. Guns for everybody! /S.
The poster above claimed that felons were not allowed to have guns, which I pointed out is not the case in TX. But only in their car and house? Be careful who you cut off on those I-35 service roads.
I'm a little puzzled as to where you seem to be going with this, you seem to agree that felons are allowed to have guns in TX, correct?
Also the “there’s guns” ITS TEXAS, open carry is legal and without permit, of course there’s gonna be guns. Stop moving the goalposts because you don’t agree with the activity. That’s where my “me me me me me” comes from. Some drivers would say the same about lane splitting or bicyclists or whatever, but we still accommodate. We do the same for funeral precessions and school team marches.
Edit: we host parades, fairs, and markets in the street. I understand people’s concerns about safety, some of the other ones are a little overblown, but this is going to happen regardless and I’d rather it be monitored and conducted safer than it be done with no safety and people get hurt/killed (though i haven’t heard of any deaths).
My main thing was safety. Keep in mind this is going to happen regardless so would you rather it be done safer and legal or unsafe and illegal (encouraging more crime in general).
Perhaps those laws aren't being enforced and criminals aren't dissuaded, so a task force is necessary to halt that illegal activity.
