This war will almost assuredly come to a negotiated settlement after Putin or his successor realize that Western support isn't budging. The vast majority of wars end this way. People say that Putin staked a lot of political capital on this war and that he can't possibly concede or he'll be ousted. While that might be true, Putin's regime has a pretty solid grip on the media and could probably claim victory with just about any settlement, even if he lost Crimea. He could just say "We denazified Ukraine" and that would be it.
Russia can't win a war of attrition against Ukraine if the West backs Ukraine. We need to show Ukraine and Russia that the US, EU, and other are in for the long haul and will give whatever is necessary for however long it takes.
Unfortunately it's also hard to see Ukraine winning in any meaningful way. Russia will just drag this out for years until the west inevitably loses focus.
Russia is not making a loss , they are earning less. Not like they are buying oil from some other country, it is a natural resource on their territory.
