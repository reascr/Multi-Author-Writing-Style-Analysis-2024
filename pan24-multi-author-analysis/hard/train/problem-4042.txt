It's like if you owned a mansion, and live-in house staff. And after a while they start asking asking for contracts for room usage, so only the owner of a contract can live in a specific room. You still own the land, mansion and room, and the legal authority of the contract only goes as far as you, but they are more than free to exchange the contracts amongst each other.
When you buy a house, you buy the land from your town or city, who was given it by the county, who was given ownership by the state/province who was given ownership by the nation. The nation is the REAL landowner, not you or any of those. But with a king, they ARE the real landowner, the nation owns the land under them.
So do you just steal all land from every single old money family in the country? What's really to stop them from taking yours next so all land is owned by the government and everybody pays rent to them?
Because the government giving itself the power to arbitrarily decide "All your land are belong to us and we're not paying you at all" is pretty scary.
