Biden voted for Reagan trickle down , helped de-regulate the banks under Clinton and Bush, and helped start the Iraq War. He was REWARDED by corporate media and called a moderate. Not a radical corporatist or an economic extremist.
Doesn't help that Democrats who side with them get normalized by the supposed liberal media. Manchin is a called a "moderate" by NYTimes, msnbc, CNN, Washinon post, and every other "liberal" media. Why? He literally said the filibuster was more important than investigating a coup. And has sided with Republicans on blocking highly popular reforms like a public option, stronger drug pricing reforms, paid maternity leave, etc.
It's almost like spending your healthy working years paying for-profit insurance companies so they can make record profits year after year resulted in a weakened Medicare system.
Biden and the average Dems want to perpetuate the same shitty employer based private health insurance scam.
I mean he supports a public option for insurance in a for-profit nightmare of a health care system. At least that was his stance when he said he would veto Medicare For All if it passed during the pandemic. He's just another neoliberal asshole.
