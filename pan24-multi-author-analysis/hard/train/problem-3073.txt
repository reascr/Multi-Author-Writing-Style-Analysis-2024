Name a western country that outlaws being gay, that beats, rapes, and executes gay people. Your whataboutisim game is weak.
Now, let me try to really clarify what I'm saying. Let's say, hypothetically, the WC was being held in Qatar, and Qatar's only stance on lgbtq matters was they didn't recognize same sex marriages. And let's assume the western world condemned them for it, called it outrageous behavior. Ran all of the stories we are currently seeing about it. Then today, news comes out that Japan has taken the same legal stance on not recognizing same sex marriages, but the western world withholds it's opinion on the matter.
- Japan currently does not permit same-sex couples to marry or inherit each other’s assets, such as a house they may have shared, and gives them no parental rights to each other’s children.
- Though partnership certificates from municipalities now cover about 60% of the population in Japan, including Tokyo, they do not give same-sex couples the same rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples.
