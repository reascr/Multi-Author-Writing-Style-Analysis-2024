As of me writing this they're currently South West of Salt Lake City. Earlier today they were over Wyoming. So educated guess is they're the ones watching the balloon.
Okay so I also saw that balloon and initially thought the same thing. But then realized the Chinese would be the dumbest people on the planet if they hooked a transponder up to their spy balloon.
You're assuming that the balloon wasn't phoning home in real time... And considering it's not likely to be recoverable by the Chinese, how could it not be?
Balloons are probably cheaper and China doesn't have anywhere near as many satellites as the USA, so you're probably right about capabilities.
Also, the US is probably flying balloons over China, which the Chinesse don't want to publicize for internal and external political reasons. Shooting down the Chinesse ballon (which cruise conveniently along the aleutian chain) would give the Chinesse justification to shoot down American balloons in response. So naming and shaming them over the balloon is the choice, as the Chinesse don't want to name and shame in response.
