Russia wants to continue selling gas to Europe so they don’t touch it (which is why I don’t think they blew up the NS2 Pipeline). Europe wants to keep buying gas so they don’t touch it. Ukraine don’t wanna piss off Europe so they don’t touch it.
You are correct, india also doesn't want to buy from russia. We hate to be in this position, we would very much prefer middle eastern oil. But the prices have been pumped up so much that we can't afford oil from elsewhere. What would you have us do stop buying any oil, i can't afford prices going up anymore. The narrative is that india is prospering on the oil is so wrong we are just surviving and if this war continues any longer, i don't think india could even afford oil at these prices.
P.s. Germany, china, turkey and Netherlands have been the largest importers of energy from Russia from Feb to nov. India is 5th on this list.
According to your site India is the third largest importer in the last month and is above every other EU nation. Throw in the fact that EU just implemented a oil price cap and it becomes clear that India will soon make up a very larte part of the Russian export market.
No bro, if oil purchases from Russia are an issue, then EU with much smaller population should have stopped buying to nil. Fact of the matter is no one can do that, it is logistically impossible.
