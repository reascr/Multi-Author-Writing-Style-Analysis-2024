Actually Hitler and the Nazis fear mongered an impending Polish invasion to help justify invading Poland first. They were just ahead of their time! /s.
. Thankfully the younger and educated polish population knows that PiS is bullshit, but still too many people vote for them.
Nope, I have a shitload of respect for Poland and love the country and the people (I mean, thats why I lived there at some point). Same goes for most people in Europe.
Thatâ€™s hardly unique for Europe though. Still, most of the continent decided to move on from it. Also, the current Polish government keep alienating the first German state in existence to want genuinely good relations with Poland - for nothing but self-serving reasons.
Generally yes, but in case of Poland it has nothing to do with geo-politics - the PiS just tries to distract from domestic problems, even though they get a shitload of Money from Germany through the EU already. Their nationalistic voters love when they use Germany as a punching bag. But there is no substance to it and no one in Germany takes it seriously.
