Everyone was annoyed they wasted so much time on something so not-important. Hopefully it'll go the same way.
I think they will. Republicans ran on nothing but kitchen table issues like inflation and crime, and then the first thing they convene on is House committee investigations of Hunter Biden and… 42 cabinet officials and random alphabet agency subdirectors. This is the shit that voters explicitly rejected, that completely blunted a red wave and that saw them barely get the House. Nobody but the conspiranoid GOP base gives a fuck about this. But they don’t have ideas, they don’t want to get things done. They lied to swing voters, and it was obvious to most people who were paying attention that they weren’t acting in good faith, but it’s laughable how fast they dropped the charade.
The majority of us are fucking sick of Republicans antics but the GOP is unable to see that- they did horrible in the midterms by peddling there bullshit but they will keep at it, one trick elephant.
Democrats keep hoping that if they're the adults in the room, eventually the GOP acting like insane children will hurt them. It often seems the opposite is true.
The lack of a red wave doesn't mean it's working. I'm getting real tired of Dems just passively hoping the GOP destroys itself, and looking at marginal gains as evidence of this master plan working.
