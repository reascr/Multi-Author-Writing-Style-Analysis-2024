LGBTQIA+,and allies, are just people trying to find some non-hell on this earth. JUST LIKE YOU. We don’t deserve any of this. They don’t have any right to terrorize us and maim us and murder us. I am a good person. I do good. I am trying really hard to raise good humans (who are terrified now).
I deserve to keep living until cancer gets me, like everyone else in damn family. Like, THAT is already the future I have to worry about genetically (and soon-ish) for me and my children, too. Let us at least achieve THAT horrible way to die, without trying to murder us and when we’re dancing with our friends.
Joshua Thurman is brave, loving person - as I’d say of any who were at the Club that night (or anywhere, any day or hour) for a fun time surrounded by love and joy and filling a human need for companionship and camaraderie with like minded people.
He’s breaking down, saying it should have been him who died, instead of the people that did die. That is SO SAD and unfair. He does not deserve this broken life.
This dude is a hero, but his life is about to get miserable from the right. Guarantee he and his family are already receiving death threats. Popular right wing figures are already starting with “why would a veteran take his family to a drag show.”.
