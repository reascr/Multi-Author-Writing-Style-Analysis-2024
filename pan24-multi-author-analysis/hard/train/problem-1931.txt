This right-wing populist initiative comes from big business bosses from Switzerland who still own companies in Russia and Belarus.
Since WW2, Switzerland has taken a clear position: on the Cold War, apartheid, the Balkan conflict, taking in refugees, sanctions, etc.
Especially that everyone uses the term "direct democracy" differently. By the way, on the page of the Federal Council, democracy in Switzerland is also called "direct democracy"".
Switzerland is a so called semi-direct democracy because we aren't voting on all issues by default. We have to get signatures and start a referendum to trigger a vote by the public. In fact, switzerland is a representative democracy that has mechanism that allow for selective direct democracy (Referendum und Initiative). This is usually referred to as a semi-direct democracy.
It isn't by definition of direct democracy. You want direct democracy, then go to Appenzell Innerrhoden. Switzerland as a whole isn't a pure/direct democracy.b.
Switzerland as a country no, but the Swiss themselves yes. Our economy has been built on the best mercenaries in Europe who participated in almost every war and sometimes fought eachother. They were so good at it that we are still prospering from it.
