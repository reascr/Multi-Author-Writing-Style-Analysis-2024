They don’t place any value on women, particularly if they “dishonor” the family. I fear for her safety.
Edit: I learned lots of stuff from the replies to my comment. I have known the differences between Arabs and Persians but I thought the honor killings were a Muslim thing, didn’t realize it was mostly contained to Arabs, and I think I have have lots more to learn.
I'm sure a lot of Iranian and Arab traditions are very different, but what we want to hear more about is the attitude about religion, treatment of women and similar issues.
They mostly share the same religion now, though Iran and Saudi Arabia are ruled by very different sects - Twelver Shi'a in Iran, Whahhabism in Saudi Arabia. I don't know the full details on doctrinal differences, but there's some very, very strong differences in belief about the line of succession of imams after Muhammad's death. Also, the two nations have serious long-standing beef in general.
Prior to being conquered by the Arabians, Persians followed a very different religion - Zoroastrianism.
They had their own state religion: Zoroastrianism, again, for thousands of years before Christianity and Islam.
Iranians are the descendants of the Persian culture, a really old culture who were around for thousand of years before the Arabs(Not actually true, see below). Think the Achaemenids, Parthians, or the Sassanids, they fought with the Greeks, the romans and the byzantine empire for thousands of years.
Notably though, some Persians resent Islam as an Arab imposition, though they're probably in a very severe minority.
