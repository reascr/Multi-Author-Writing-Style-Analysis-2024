China's military budget as part of its GDP has been steadily decreasing over the last few decades, the budget is only becoming bigger because the GDP is growing. Meanwhile Japan is seeking to greatly increase its military budget as a percentage of its GDP.
Translation - Japan’s increasing defence budget means they have the capacity to stand up to the PRC and their increasing bullying of nations in the region. Which, of course, is unacceptable in Beijing’s view. A strong Japan is good for regional stability, whatever the Chinese claim.
And according to the treaty signed between China and Japan back in the 70s stated that relations were normalized between the two nations. It provided for trade relations and recognition of Beijing as the legitimate seat of the Chinese government. It also stated that Japan recognized Taiwan as a part of China and in exchange, China permanently gave up any claim of reparations for what Japan did in World War 2. The argument can be made that by defending Taiwan, Japan would be violating that part of the treaty, and China would be free to push for reparations. In which case, nuking Japan would be settling some old scores.
And Koreans probably have more of a score to settle with Japan than China does. I wonder how the South Koreans would feel about Japan if the US wasn't forcing them to get along.
I think a lot of those Americans are caught up in this weird idea that Japan can never, ever be trusted because WWII.
As an American, I am generally quite happy to see our reliable allies stepping up their military readiness. I think many of those allies were content to rely on the certainty of American intervention if they were attacked, which isn't a good strategy in my eyes. Not because I doubt America would make good on treaty obligations, but because America can't be everywhere at once.
I keep hoping that they will eventually realize what year it is, and that such hasn't been true for ages now.
