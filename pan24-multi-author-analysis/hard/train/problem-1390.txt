There won't be any off ramps or even negotiations. If Ukraine agreed to Russia's demand of recognizing the occupied terroritory there would be a bit of ceasefire until all the war elements are moved up to the new border and the war machine would start rolling again until it has consumed all of Ukraine or at least Kiev.
Russian media has been talking about NATO invading Russia for years before Russia invaded Ukraine, so it's easy to sell it to the population as a defensive war.
And, despite the fact that NATO forces are not actively in the war, the mere fact of supplying arms, support, and sanctions to support a Nazi regime is further proof of how its Russia against the evil of the world and is in a war with NATO.
so you can bet that despite how ridiculous it sounds, there are lots and lots of Russians that believe that there is a Jewish man who is head of state in Ukrane that is also simultaneously a Nazi, and that they are in fact in a war with NATO.
Step 9) Due to Step 6 and 8, Boris Yeltsin has an opportunity to seek revenge on Gorbachov, and being in control of the Capital and at least being charismatic is able to actually seize power from the incompetent coup attempt and also able to humiliate Gorbachov.
Step 11) Because Yeltsin is an idiot alcholic who really only cares at this point about sticking it to Gorbachov be sure to give away an Russian speaking areas in Ukraine as you secretely negotiate support for your government with several break away republics and define their borders.
Step 12) also due to Step 6, and the fact that despite his charisma, Yeltsin is also an idiot who doesn't know how to run a country (see Step 3), but also inheriting a fucking mess from Steps 4, 5, and 7 attempt to fast track the country into Capitalism.
Step 5) Gorbachov is a policy person, but not a nuts and bolts economist and doesn't know what he's doing or how to properly unfuck the machine. See Step2 and 3. He blunders forwards anyway.
