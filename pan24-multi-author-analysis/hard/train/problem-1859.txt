What originally lead to it was Prodigy getting sued because they were trying to filter content and someone sued them over something they missed.
Their solution was to just throw their hands up and not moderate ANYTHING at all. Given how much porn we all know that would lead to, 230 was a bipartisan amendment to allow them to try in good faith.
It depends on how SCOTUS rules. On paper, if Section 230 was removed corporations would either remove \all\ user generated content or just stop moderation entirely. Section 230 only exists so that companies can try to remove objectional content and not be held liable if they miss something.
If you read S230 you will see that they are only covered from liability for content that comes from third party providers (that includes users). However , as with copyright law, a compilation can also be its own unique content , which is what is at issue when it comes to recommendation algorithms. For that even under current S230 it looks like the information systems provider is not covered under S230 as they are the originator of said compilation and not a third party.
