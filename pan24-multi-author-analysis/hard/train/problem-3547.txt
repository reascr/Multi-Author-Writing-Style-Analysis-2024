Actually, empirical processes like the scientific method have revealed a great bit about what is accurate vs inaccurate.
Also, no one is more critical and dismissive of my beliefs than the crystal rubbing magical thinkers that I know.
What you're describing is regular charlatans, who are present in all sorts of belief systems and religions. And seeing someone who likes this stuff being bombarded like they're the antichrist of society is just ridiculous. People like to have their little placebo rituals. Let them be happy. Be angry at those who actually encourage turning down real medical care. Those are the baddies.
Alright, I don't have data for this to react properly, but I've seen plenty of examples of christians denying modern medicine and relying on God. There have been news of orthodox churches having hundreds of covid positive believers because the priest told them they should rely on their faith. Also how could one forget about the infamous televangelist Kenneth Copeland and his covid speeches. Just commanding covid to go away in the name of Jesus is all it takes, apparently.
