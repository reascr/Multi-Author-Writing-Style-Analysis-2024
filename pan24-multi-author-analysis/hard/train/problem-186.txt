i mean, 40% of americans are too. probably around that number + or - some for all the other western countries as well. not even mentioning china... or other east and SE asian countries...
Yup, just China. They definitely didn't see any separation of families and concentration camps under Trump. We totally didn't adopt out stolen kids through his donor's programs either. No women were forcibly sterilized by us though, at least. Oh wait, they were.
At all similar? You should have opened with how they are different, rather than a stupid question. Of course they are similar in many ways. Scope? Sure they are way different. Motivation? Zero difference.
Ironic. Why do right-wing bots spend their time spamming sports stuff that nobody gives a shit about? I mean look at all your worthless submissions nobody cared about. I feel like you are the guy to ask.
No, that guy's right. Look at how dumb the average person has become where they can only acknowledge propaganda of one side as actual propaganda. Not like the crimes you mentioned aren't sad, they're just overshadowed by the manipulation people accept and rejoice in because it fits what they think they should believe.
