Ballot access mostly. Though I could probably go on for days about ballot access laws let's just say that in many states reaching a certain threshold makes it easier to get candidates on the ballot in the next election.
Often times states have rules that so long as one candidate gets 2% of the vote (or sometimes 5% for further down races) that they get ballot access automatically for the next election.
The hoops that 3rd parties have to jump through just to exist are insane. Then the hoops they have to jump through just to appear on a ballot seem impossible. There are 50 states. That means 3rd parties have to satisfy 50 sets of rules to appear on each ballot. Thatâ€™s how it is.
That's not what happens. They don't look at the candidate who came in third place and say, "I should be more like the even bigger loser." Instead, what they do is look at the policies of the winning candidate (in this scenario, the Republican), and say, "I should be more like the one who won.".
Sure. But then you generally just end up helping the worst candidate win, and how does that help anything?
Make a statement with your words and efforts every day, but vote for someone that has a chance of not being the worst piece of shit.
