Right now churches in America represent pools of unaccounted for money. The more it has to be accounted for, the less free and easy it is for grifters to use.
Then there are the tiniest fraction of churches that actually care about what Jesus says rather than enforcing their ideology on you.
Try putting the Christ back in your Christianity, we're tired of selfish greedy bigoted mofos hiding behind a cross while waving a flag and espousing hate.
Stopping the clear lying, greed, hatred, bigotry and intolerance, both in the open and hidden, might be an important first step for Christian leaders and their followers to take if they want to see a change. Those characteristics define Christianity in the United States today. Evangelical leaders grifting on the weak and vulnerable has nothing to do with the indoctrination of the teachings of Christ in my childhood. Hatred of other whether race, creed or sexual orientation is the basis that dominates the current political merging with Christianity. Domination, control of the masses and money-worship are the primary drivers of Christian leadership so these ads are disingenuous in pretending that organized Christianity has anything to do with Jesus’ purported teaching. The numbers are certain to continue to decline with the status quo. People are not blind to the hypocrisy, at least those willing to see through it.
“Instead of rebranding Jesus, these critics say, Christianity should improve its own image by emulating him.”.
