It's incredible how many people in this thread are taking a borderline misogynistic/racist view on this by trying to reduce Amy Comey Barrett and Clarence Thomas down to simply being proxies for white men. Are they not both capable of making their own decisions? Why should the terrible things they do be excused as simply them doing the behest of their white male overlords?
But I guess we can simple excuse the terrible things they do as they are only capable of following their orders from old white men, right?
The comment I replied to has no bearing on anything whatsoever, but apparently I'm the asshole for not wanting to excuse her terrible behavior as simply being at the behest of old white men.
It's honestly gross how many people in this thread seem deadset on the idea that somehow old white men are the source of all evil and any women or minorities who go along with it are simply doing so because that's what old white men want.
Are we really pretending like women and black people can't simply be bad people on their own without input from old white men?
No one has said that she or Thomas are doing what old men want BECAUSE that is what old white men want. That's your misinterpretation. So stop repeating it.
