Also a lot of people aren't aware that Fosun invested 135 million dollars into Biontech one day before pfizer and ran clinical trials on their vaccine in China back in March 2020.
>Fosun Pharma will pay BioNTech up to USD 135M (EUR 120M) in upfront and potential future investment and milestone payments; the two companies will share future gross profits from the sale of the vaccine in China.
That's because it isn't ineffective. Studies, run by countries that aren't china, and the billions of people vaccinated with it in poorer countries that can't afford -40c refrigeration supply chains, show it prevents death and hospitalization just as well as mrna vaccines at 3 doses.
This is not the result of them "not locking down hard enough", it's the result of denying western vaccines and a majority of their population being unvaccinated.
They used a Chinese vaccine, which doesn't seem to be as good as some western vaccines, there are still many especially elderly who are hesitant to be vaccinated, there are many who only use traditional Chinese medicine.
