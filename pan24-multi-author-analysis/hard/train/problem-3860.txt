The problem with “claims” is the Repubs have a whole high rated propaganda machine masquerading as a news network to promote their BS while the Democrats can stand on policy without the same kind of platform to promote it.
It's true that the right wing has an effective propaganda machine, but if the Dems could "stand on policy" that would include winning elections that allow them to carry out their policy. The party needs to do more-- getting elected and enacting a platform is literally their entire purpose. Sitting on your hands and blaming FOX and conservatives for being devious isn't enough, we need leadership.
I personally don't buy that it's either Manchin or a Republican. WV was once a hotbed of militant labor-- clearly things can change. Ultimately what diminishes Dems is an unwillingness to change-- running the same candidates over and over again because they're out of ideas. The working class is tired of establishment politicians, and Dems are all too happy to allow Republicans to claim to be the anti establishment party.
But to me, the conditions you describe seem like conditions which are ripe for a political party to use to spread their programme and solutions. It feels like a candidate who wasn't so entrenched in the system that's presided over the worsening quality of life could make a persuasive case.
Thanks but I didn't forget a word. I actually wouldn't say this trend is exclusive to white working class voters.
