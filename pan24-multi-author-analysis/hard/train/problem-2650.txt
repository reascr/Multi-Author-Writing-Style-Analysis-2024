And Europe is way ahead of the US, as well. This private equity guy is just talking up his book. It would be amazing if the US was actually launching the world's most aggressive clean energy environment, but the truth is our power grids are totally falling down, most of our "clean" energy is nuclear, and there's hardly any wind or solar yet, and practically zero large battery storage.
The US is in a great position to do so, but it hasn't because it's politicians are so focused on fossil fuels and fossil fuel companies don't want renewable technology to exist at all. Allies should be alarmed because the US getting serious about this will diminish their chances of cornering the market significantly, even though as allied nations they would still benefit greatly from the technology.
It's the sort of geopolitical move that establishes global dominance. The US and its allies still compete, they just do so in ways that are generally friendly and nonviolent. You don't want to be dependent on someone, even an ally, because what if they turn out to no longer be an ally at some point? And even if they are, you might be able to better serve your citizens by doing things yourself.
The nation that establishes itself at the forefront of producing technology for renewable energy is going to be the new OPEC. Whoever does it will get massive economic boosts and extremely favorable trade agreements.
This is about energy, and energy is the one commodity that dominates global politics. It's why oil kingdoms in the middle east get to do whatever they want. It's a reason why Russia got away with their shit for so long. OPEC has more political strenh than most world governments because they control the supply of what everyone needs.
