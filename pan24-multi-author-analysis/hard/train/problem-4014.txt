Congratulations, now youre on the same topic as the rest of us. Theyre not certifying without a justified reason. Thats the problem. Thats why vbratcher is calling for prosecution.
And which is literally what they were doing. You just interjected a bunch of extra bullshit that wasnt said, and didnt need to be said, because literally no one suggested they should be prosecuted for suggesting dems cheated. Literally no one mentioned it. The article doesnt even cover it as their reasoning for refusing to certify. You just injected that bullshit into their comment.
Great, glad he was investigated, and charged after being found guilty. Got any other examples that would lead to an actual revelation here or just the one guy that literally no one is upset about him being sentenced.
Also, im sorry " Go creep elsewhere."? Youre on a public reddit thread. If you dont want people replying to you, sit on your hands next time you get the urge to say something.
Oh, by the way, when you tell people to "sit on your hands next time you get the urge to say something." Well buddy, I guess that advice is only for others, huh?
For what? I don't agree with these idiots, but claiming the other side "cheated" isn't criminal. If it were, children on the playground would be prosecuted everywhere. That's exactly what these clowns are... childish.
And can you not understand simple English? I've already explained this. Go creep elsewhere. I've now addressed this particular issue twice. If you can't understand the rudimentary difference between what I said about THIS issue and the other crybaby issues, there's really no way I'm going to spell it out for you on a more elementary level.
