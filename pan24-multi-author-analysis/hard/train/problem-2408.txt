You present the New Deal as some sort of popular uprising on the ground, when in reality it was just a result of politicians and economists doing what they thought was best for the country at the time, the exact thing you say will not solve any of our modern problems. The "revolution" you go on about happened at the ballot box to elect people who worked on detailed policies that would benefit those who voted for them. FDR had massive majorities in both chambers of Congress, something no Democratic president has had since LBJ for a sustained amount of time. If you want New Deal types of policies, then vote, just like the people in the 30s did.
Voting is of course necessary, but not sufficient on its own, to produce an analogue to the New Deal in modern times, for a variety of reasons.
Without essentially an uprising from the public and working classes, as happened for the New Deal, no politician can or will actually fix the system, because they are also subject to the same system.
No, I said, that no politician can or will actually fix the system, without a popular uprising analogous to the enormous, and diverse public power backing the New Deal.
The actual work to be done is building up the public's power and understanding to force change, irrespective of what the ruling capitalists/kleptocrats or politicians want.
But the system itself never changes unless and until a critical mass of people gain enough power and understanding to force the system to change.
What matters, ultimately, is the power to effect change in the physical world; to implement your ideas.
