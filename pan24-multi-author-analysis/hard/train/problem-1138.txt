That's because the only GOP policy is "do whatever is the opposite of the democrats and damn the consequences." It has been for a long time. Republicans would be all for single payer healthcare in a heartbeat if the Democratic parts suddenly was against it. If Democrats were smart, they would just set their policy to the opposite of whatever they actually wanted to do.
Eh, the XM5 and XM250 aren't deployed yet. They won't start getting their shipments until Q4 of next year. Even when they do, it will take time for it to become standard across all units. JSOC and active duty infantry will get them first, then combat arms, armor, and MPs will get them, then they will go out to the rest of active units, then the national guard will get them, then training units will get them, then the Marines will finally get them once there are gently used ones available for purchase. There are training battalions still training on the M16 even though the M4 has been standard issue for years. I guess we could send the thousands upon thousands of rifles sitting in warehouses to Ukraine, but the military still needs a lot of them while they wait for the new ones.
Sending 20 year old equipment for Ukrainians who then decimate Russian army, sounds like a great return on investment.
Not to mention, when people say that America is sending Ukraine 10 billion dollars' worth of equipment, in most cases (i.e. not Himars or Patriot) what they mean is America is sending equipment that cost 10 billion dollars back in the early 90s and was just gradually going obsolete in some supply base anyway.
A bunch of countries that were maintaining Soviet-era equipment that was simply too expensive to replace in peace time offloaded all that stuff and got a great deal on modern American kit. Poland and Czechia and Romania all got great deals on far better gear, AND it's for a good cause!
