While most of Putins ambitions are more resembling the old Empire, Russia is also still using a lot of Soviet symbolism and celebrating its traditions. They want to appeal to the memories of the "good old glorious times" older Russians are still remembering with nostalgia.
What Putin and his buddies are dreaming of seems to be a mix of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union.
This sounds like Putin wanting to reform the former Soviet empire, and is looking for excuses to do it by force.
It really feels to me that Putin has become delusional in his grandiose thinking about re-attaching ex-Soviet states from 30+ years ago.
All this Nationalism and desire for Eurasian supremacy just looks to be an inferiority complex and brain disorder gone wild. Lavrov is looking like he is losing it too, something that is cyclical with him. Are any of the Generals willing to stand up to the crazy leaders? Any oligarchs? Any strong men?
Putin has spent a great deal of his gold stockpile trying to reclaim Ukraine and now is going into debt on account of Ukraine. His troops are poorly equipped as it is; how are Russians going to retake surrounding lands in other areas?
