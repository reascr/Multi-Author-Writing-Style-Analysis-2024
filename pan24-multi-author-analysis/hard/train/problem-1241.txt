"Johnny said he was trans? I thought he was talking about trains, that he was just really into locomotives. I told him to go to the library and check out Terry Pratchett's Raising Steam, and that if he liked it that author had some very good books featuring dwarves if he was thinking about joining the police, and another about a regiment of soldiers if he was thinking of enlisting.".
Yes. I won't be surprised when they propose revoking the matthew Shepard/James Byrd act, because Republicans have made it clear how much they want LGBTQIA+ people in the morgue.
But that’s what republicans want; they think being gay/trans is something that you can physically beat out of a child. All it does is make the child ghost them when they’re older and supporting themselves, just like I did.
I grew up here in NC (25 now) in a very strictly evangelical die-hard republican household. Had I been outed or outed myself as trans to my family, I’m not sure if they’d have let me see the light of day ever again, the physical and emotional abuse would have been too much.
That’d probably just mean that the entire set of homophobic parents willing to abuse their kid on the inkling of gay allegations would start in as opposed to one or two.
They're basically saying that teachers have to report a kid even if a parent could be hostile and perhaps hurt a kid for coming out as LGBTQIA+ (which most certainly happen).
One democrat points out how outing every LGBT kid to their parents absolutely will lead to some kids being abused. The author of this bill's response?
