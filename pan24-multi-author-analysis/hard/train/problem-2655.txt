Holding out hope that they would choose peace? That's a warped view for keeping people captive and submissive on their own land. You said it yourself; Israel controls the water and power.. and beyond that they also control the Palestinian people's ability to move and conduct in everyday life.
Explain the part where it's acceptable for Israel to have taken their land and formed as a state in the first place, without resorting to biblical nonsense, and perhaps you'll sway me.
To anyone reading this thread: take one look at Israeli settlers and their actions now and you guys will realize this guy and others providing a biased retelling of history in favor of Israel are full of shit.
Most Israelis hold this opinion, but the current political climate both in Israel and in the PA doesn’t allow it, unfortunately.
Simply put, the government in Israel is not nearly as strong and stable, and doesn’t have enough support to truly descend into totalitarianism.
So the Israeli government has the possibility to reduce extremism in both sides. Only they choose not to do that.
