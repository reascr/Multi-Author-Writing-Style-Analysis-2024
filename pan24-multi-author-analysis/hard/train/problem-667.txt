"Lower your flags and march straight back to [Russia], stopping at every home you pass by to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft, rape, and murder. Do that and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you will die today.".
Yup. Or rather continues the same kind of horrible precedent Russia that the world set with Chechnya, Georgia, and Transistria that directly lead to this invasion...in 2014.
Russia has been whining about being "forced" to invade because of some reason or another, but it is all just lies and propaganda for their facist imperialism.
The Russian leadership could have focused on building up their nation, but instead they chose to waste it all on a war of aggression.
Any agreements made then are not worth anything now. In the 90's Russia guaranteed the independence of Ukraine "forever", and in return Ukraine gave Russia all their nukes and a lot of aircraft etc. But that didn't stop Russia from meddling in Ukrainian politics, nor invading in 2014 and 2022.
But yeah imagine a new Russian attack a few years from now but this time Ukraine is waiting with high tech combined arms forces.
I'm pretty sure even with a pause Russia will not be successful a second time. Ukraine will buy so much good tech and be prepared. Also there is the possibility to join Nato in the meantime (well Ukraine not joining will probably a demand from russia in a possible treaty).
