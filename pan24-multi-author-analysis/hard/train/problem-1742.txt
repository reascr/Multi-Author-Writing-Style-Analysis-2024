I see it this way. Religion was useful in getting out of the dark ages…but it has outlived it’s usefulness. It is one of the greatest threats and greatest hurdles for our progress as a species.
If people could keep their faith to themselves, there would be no issue with me. But they can’t, it’s impossible for them.
Faith is a belief in which there is no verifiable evidence whatsoever. That’s why it’s called faith. So there is no arguing with that sort of mindset. They don’t have evidence and they still believe in something. There is no critical thinking.
We have to teach critical thinking. There are so so so many "jobs" out there whose whole schtick is scamming someone. Insurance, sales, "iNvEsTmEnT aDvIsOr", so many positions of just "talk quickly and smile like you're selling used cars" and collect a huge paycheck at someone else's expense.
The youngest generations are more clever than mine was, but if we don't arm them with the tools to figure out when they're going to be exploited or how to deal with that, we're just repeating our problems.
