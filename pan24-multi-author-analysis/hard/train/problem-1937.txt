The Supreme Court will overturn this along with all the future weird gun control legislation Illinois passes that violates the constitution...
Local police and sheriffs generally swear an oath to the constitution. The legislation violates the constitution.
Municipalities and States are using gun control to make political statements knowing that the legislation will not survive in the courts. It is a waste of tax payer resources. The people of Illinois may not care right now, the danger for them is that continuously ignoring Supreme Court rulings could result in the Supreme Court removing authority from the ATF or declaring the NFA is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court could also create new precedent in response to States refusal to obey their rulings.
Then you will see further weakening of gun control legislation nationally. Blue states passing gun control legislation would be completely undone by neighboring red states ridiculously non existent gun control. Then there is the political consideration that in 2024 Democrats need rural Democratic voters to maintain control of the Senate and the White House.
Like Your House Bill 5471 where people over 18 but under 21 would need parental permission to own a firearm. ...These are legal adults. It also bans AR-15s by name which is a semi-automatic firearm in common use. It has already been established that such a firearm would not be subject to a ban. The legislation due to how it defines a 'shroud' would ban all semiautomatic rifles.
I'll also note most of these "Assault Weapon Bans" tend to target certain grips, stocks, barrels, etc. which have little to do with lethality of a firearm.
Pistols are much easier to surprise victims with. And no credible proposal is getting rid of glocks.
‘Assault weapons’ are rarely used in crimes. These bills are feel good but ignore the actual problem.
Fuck the NRA, but don’t let your well deserved hate for them make you fall for false promises that only infringe on legal gun owners.
