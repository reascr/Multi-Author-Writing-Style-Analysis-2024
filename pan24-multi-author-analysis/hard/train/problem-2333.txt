"gear up to" makes it sound like there is not a priority to appoint judges currently. Biden has appointed more judges at this point in his first term than both Trump and Obama. Maybe a more accurate headline would be: "Biden, Senate Democrats say judges will remain a top priority in the Congress to come". Most of that headline is a direct quote from Schumer, and is more accurate. The senate mid-term results do make it easier for Biden and Senate Dems to appoint judges, so we may see an accelerated pace. However, if we see an accelerated pace, it is not because of 'prioritization', it is due to the senate majority. So, I guess maybe an even better headline would be, "Senate mid-term results will allow Biden and Senate Dems to expedite judge appointments". Or something like that. Also, for those fearing this will lead to a judicial landscape that is too far to the left, it is important to note that Durbin is leaving the blue-slip process in place. Hell, you could make a headline like, "despite increase ability to push judicial appointments thru, Senate Dems commit to bipartisanship by keeping blue slip rule in place".
The Senate can conduct its own investigations as well, the reason why the Senate hasn’t and only the House has been doing all the congressional investigations was because it was 50/50 which meant committees are deadlocked. That’s why having 51 Democrats is important, with 51 committee chairmen can now use their subpoena powers without a deadlocked vote.
Because the House is switching hands, the vast majority of Democrats' legislative priorities are likely dead for the next two years. Since that stuff is deprioritized (because it's not feasible to pass), a function that the Senate can perform on its own alongside the President -- appointing judges -- becomes higher priority.
