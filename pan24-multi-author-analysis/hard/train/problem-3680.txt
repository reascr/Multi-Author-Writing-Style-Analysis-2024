You're dead right. This is scarily similar to what happened in Germany right before the Nazis took over. Despite only getting 20% of the vote in 1930, the Nazis effectively held the government to ransom, causing parliament to be dissolved and more elections held. They got about 30% of the vote in the 1932 elections, but even though they were well short of any majority they managed to Hitler chosen as Chancellor by making back-room deals and promising to support the government. Obviously as soon as Hitler took power he staged the Reichstag fire, declared emergency powers, and took full dictatorial control. All with less then 35% of the vote.
Don't underestimate the ability of small groups of radical politicians to abuse the rules of a government to take power with nowhere near majority support.
It's the reason Trump got elected in the first place, people being mad at the shadowy entity they imagine is the government and, in their minds, sticking it to the evil government by voting in an outsider. They don't actually understand the consequences of anything enough to care about it.
Those voters don't understand the government at all and don't try to, nearly all of their knowledge is based on the fact that a lot of politicians lie and therefore they believe all government is bad.
Many republicans that “starving the beast” aka not funding the government or just having it be so distunctional people defund it is the answer. Also there are a lot of narcissists and idiots involved. So it’s kinda hard to predict where it will go because if everyone is acting in self interest hard to track who wants what.
This is pretty similar to the end of the Whig party. Party had no platform. They were too far apart to agree on anything. And then a civil war kicked in. Hopefully only first two happen. But I always figured trump would either rule us all or destroy the Republican Party as we knew it.
