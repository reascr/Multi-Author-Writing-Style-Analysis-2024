There could be worse speakers. I just don't think the Dems are going to go for it. At the very least, you'll lose the most liberal/left-wing members of the party in speaker vote.
He's an old-school Republican with some sanity left, who voted to impeach Trump after Jan. 6. He's a moderate on abortion and LGBT+ issues, going by his recent voting record.
The coalition idea, while unlikely, isn't unprecedented. The Alaska state House and Senate both have coalitions. It also happened in the Oregon House after the 2010 election returned a 30-30 split.
That assumes that all Democrats are willing to go along with this. If you lose the left wing of the party, you're going to need more Republican votes to make this happen.
We don’t need them to back a democrat, we need them to be petty and decide they’ll take their ball and go home and/or get back at their enemy by voting present.
Obviously, the times have been a changin', but the point stands, a non-elected citizen running the House is wild idea, especially to the the 430 some odd people who are elected to the House. I don't see this garnering enough support from either side of the aisle, much less both.
Meh, in like 1855 they had 133 failed votes for Speaker, keeping the House unsat for like, two months.
I mean, if they can't find someone who is acceptable to a majority in the current House, they don't have much choice. This is uncharted territory in a lot of ways.
