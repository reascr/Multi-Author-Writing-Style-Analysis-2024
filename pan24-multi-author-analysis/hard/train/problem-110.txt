It does but you’re fooling yourself if you think that’s meaningful or that anyone trying to save the children from the current slander should have to care. Sodomy laws weren’t used against straight couples and these wouldn’t be used against grandma stepping in as Santa at the church play either.
It will not come back to bite them. Get that through your head and do it fast. Laws are not like magical rules binding prosecutors to the exact wording and nothing else. They are tools of the state and will be used as the state desires to use them. Nobody is going to come after the cis woman in the Shakespeare play. They will come after the trans woman reading her poem about sunsets.
Read a poem about sunsets at a local coffee shop open mic? Well now that's a "sexually oriented business".
The definition of "drag" in that bill is so broad it includes trans people, and makes "performance" include basically just existing with people around.
Based on this wording however, I believe this transcends just trans people but anybody who would perform a role that is different to their own gender correct?
Also, doesn't this break people's right to privacy? Now whenever a performance is performed anywhere, to prove someone isn't breaking the law, they would have to provide birth records to confirm what they were assigned at birth coincides with the characters gender that they are performing.
" Brought forward by Republican Rep. Jared Patterson, whose district includes the Dallas area, House Bill 643 seeks to include drag as sexually oriented material by redefining drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances or otherwise performs before an audience for entertainment.”.
Such as stage plays? If women ever perform a role that has a character who is a man and vice versa, that would be included too, yea?
