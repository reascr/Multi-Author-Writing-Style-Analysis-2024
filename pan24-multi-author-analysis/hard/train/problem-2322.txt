Fuck yeah This is something scientists have been trying to achieve for over half a century I know its still just a small step towards a limitless energy future, but its an important one. It proves it can be done.
If the laser is 1 watt power output for a 100 watt input, that makes the laser 1% efficient yes, but how you get 0.02% doesnt make any sense, since the reaction output is greater than the laser input.
If the laser took 100x the energy to charge, that would be a 1% efficiency... 0.02% would be 50,000 times more.
Divide 100 by 1.2, and you get 83.3, so to charge the laser took 83.3 time more energy than the reaction output, making it 1.2% efficient in total, not 0.02%. Otherwise by your metric, making the laser 1 to 1 would be 2%, and that doesnt add up.
Say they used 1 watt from the laser to make 1.2 watts. Cool. It takes 100 watts to charge the laser.
The "energy in the lasers" is not the energy used to create the laser pulses. In the case of the NIF only about 1% of the energy used to create the pulse actually makes it to the target.
