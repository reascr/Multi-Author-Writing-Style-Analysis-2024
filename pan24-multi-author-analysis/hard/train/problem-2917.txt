We’re in a progressive college town and surrounded by red. Our area has become much more hostile and it’s hard for me to recognize the Wisconsin my husband and I actively chose to move to. We’re thinking about moving because I’m scared for my children here, especially since they don’t fit the typical “mold”. This election is definitely going to help us decide.
One election not going your way is definitely not a reason to give up on America or our system. Our leaders may be going down a dark path, but the people do not have to follow them. Engagement becomes even more important after a lost election.
But even if they win the election, voting is the minimum of your civic and political activities. There is always resistance, through protests, strikes, and countless other forms. If you look at every right we have, down to stuff like basic labor laws, it was paid for by brave souls willing to face danger and death.
There's about 1mil deaths from covid, and while what I've read seems to say it skews towards having harmed Republicans at greater numbers, that's a very small percentage of the country, and it still harmed and killed many people who did take it seriously.
They want everyone who feels it's rigged or pointless to stay home, because the vast majority of people's values align with the general Democratic platform, so the higher the turnout, the worse it is for them.
Yeah I’m sure it’s just a result of people feeling like they’re in safe-blue areas, but it’s still frustrating to see “good governance” rewarded with apathy.
