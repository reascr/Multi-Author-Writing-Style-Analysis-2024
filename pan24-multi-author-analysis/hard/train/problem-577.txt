If we do that we will sink into a bottomless hole. Why are you phrasing it as if it's some sort of conclusion? It's completely the other way around: there is a very good understanding of right and wrong, and which countries are on that spectrum on various issues. The ones that are on the wrong side, ideally, would not have a say. Of course, the UN is not built this way.
Oh, sorry for misunderstanding. Most of the UN bodies are crucial and operate without causing trouble, so it's just those that deal with social issues like the UNGA, UNHRC, UNRWA and UNESCO that are a joke.
The point, which you seem to have missed, is that because there are so many abusive countries in the various UN "rights" commissions, they use that majority to bash countries where there are much much less abuses, creating a false picture, which is best to ignore when evaluating reality.
So if we abandon the idea that there are "right" and "wrong" nations to be members of a commission or members on a council, then we no longer have to try and solve a fake problem that we invented that doesn't exist.
The UN is basically the assembly, a place to go on the record and say what's the real reason why such-and-such, with the aim of preventing unwanted wars of misunderstanding.
Not really, the UN is there to provide an outlet where all the countries can get together to discuss things peacefully. Arguably, the status quo is the entire point.
