A lot of it is starting to hit all at once. Boomers are dying of old age, and that's accelerated by their new found Covid and vaccine denialism. On top of that, Millennials and Gen Z who they have spent decades belittling and writing off are becoming a much larger voting block, millennials have actually become more liberal since their first elections and gen Z will likely follow suit as the GOP opposes all the stances under 40 Americans care about. Add Republicans not wanting to vote because they believe in the fake fraud republican politicians and media is peddling and you get a perfect storm for the more left leaning future that Republicans have been terrified of for the past 30 year.
If the Republican Party did not have voter suppression, gerrymandering, and various other means of electoral chicanery, they would never win another election of consequence in America.
The state districts matter a lot and Republicans use gerrymandering to make it hard for Democratic candidates to win even when they are the majority.
Anything that depressed Republican turn out is good until the lines can be drawn to reflect the population.
