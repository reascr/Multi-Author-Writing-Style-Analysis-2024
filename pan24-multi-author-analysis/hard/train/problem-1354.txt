This isn’t about ukraine. This is about strenhening China-Saudi ties, and ties with the Middle East. This is a play to keep Russia in their back pocket (for oil and natural G’s resources in the future) and driving division with us and the Middle East. It even says so in the article.
China couldn’t give a shit about the Ukrainian-Russian war, they’re just siding with where they can source resources from in the future.
There's no way China would just start arming Russia, because further war escalation is the last thing they want.
Of course they are, the west has been talking loudly about how aggressive China is (which they have been) for years and NATO declared China as their highest threat just a few months ago, so like no shit they’re deepening ties with Russia. We’re pushing them in that direction. And it’s particularly concerning when China has a choice to make between peace (aligning with the West) and >whatever their veiled ambitions are< aligning with Nazi Russia.

1) The core belief that spreading democracy, the western way of living, and unleashing the freedom of individuals (education, marriage, speech) is key to peace.
China's messaging on this war has always been quite consistent and it's clear as day what they want. They want Russia to go back to 2020 borders and be done with it. They want NATO to not interfere and go home. They want everyone to go home so China could focus on playing the silk road long game.
