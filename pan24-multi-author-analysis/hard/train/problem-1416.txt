more likely Russia is looking at a civil war between 4 players who ever is controlling the Military who ever is the 1 & 2 richest and what ever merc grope is left.
They never said it was a Missile Defense System more likely its a radar tower Putin probably scared out of his mind that CIA or some other group will come in the night.
I think its more likely Putin is observing the ever increasing sophistication of the weapons Ukraine is being given by its allies and fears its only a matter of time before they will get ahold of something that can hit Moscow.
Ukraine sends a drone or two to destroy legit military targets inside Russia and then (as I look into my crystal ball 2 weeks into the future) Russian anti-aircraft shoots down a Russian commercial jetliner over Moscow. It's barely even a false flag it's just a bad faith argument that both sides are the same. But Russia still gets innocent victims to trot out.
Russia sends hundreds of drones to destroy hospitals, power plants and day cares in Ukraine, a few air defense rockets miss and hit things they aren't supposed to = Everyone agrees this is still Russia's fault for attacking cities in the first place.
