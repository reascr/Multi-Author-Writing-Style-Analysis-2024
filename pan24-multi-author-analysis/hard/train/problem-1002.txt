For the sake of when the topic is conservation, captive tigers aren't considered "real" tigers in the field, they're irrelevant. The population number always relates to wild tigers, who breed, hunt, live and survive in the wild.
A growing wild tiger population is indicative of a healthy forest ecosystem. So this news is a big win for all wild animals in general.
India's conservation efforts have been great since 1973, with an average tiger population growth rate of 6% per annum. Give credit where it's due.
Meh, please be critical of us where we merit it. As long as it's objective criticism, and not just because India's priorities aren't the same as whatever country you're from (whether that be in the west, China, Russia or otherwise), criticism is useful.
Ah, I don't. Would be happy if we continue to have strong and stable relationships with most countries (ideally with a long-term solution to our issues with Pakistan, which is the only country with which i hope we have a significant shift in our foreign policy within my lifetime), without going into any bloc. India shouldn't be within the west's camp in the way that Asian countries like Japan or Korea are.
Eh, when you say shine light, it seems like we deny/keep these things a secret, when all three are major political issues, with work being done to tackle the same.
Which isn't unmerited - it's similar to how some people have been critical about the rise of nationalism in the US, Brazil, Poland, Turkey and Hungary (amongst others).
