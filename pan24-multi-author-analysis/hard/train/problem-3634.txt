you look only at deaths, I look at the overall scenario. We still had freedom of press, freedom to protest and freedom of speech during the pandemic. The emergency meant that we literally couldn't do anything.
Both are tragedies, and both cannot be compared. Both are terrible events which have happened, but calling the pandemic the worst thing that happened to India since partition is wrong.
Nothing that happened in India since Partition killed as many Indians, hence that makes it the biggest tragedy since Partition. It's not really that controversial.
India's vaccination drive was huge and mostly great, but it was only in the shadow of the biggest tragedy in the country's history since Partition.
If you want, I can start an argument about how India was critical of the westâ€™s hoarding of vaccines, yet when Delta hit, India stopped all shipments of its vaccine and used them completely on its own populous, letting China. EU and the US vastly overrun them in terms of both sold and donated vaccines.
