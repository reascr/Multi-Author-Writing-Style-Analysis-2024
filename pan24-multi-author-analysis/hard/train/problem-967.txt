Well, maybe so, but I don’t think NATO is gonna put up with this level of violence against civilians endlessly. The tanks are coming. The Bradleys are coming. All kinds of other stuff is coming. I would imagine that more patriots will come now.
Because here’s the deal. Based on the readiness they have displayed so far in this war, and the stories we were hearing in the 1990’s about their nukes being unsecured and not well tended, and the actual nukes we have found laying on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, I’m guessing that most of what nukes they have would explode inside Russia.
What Russia has are just slightly modified old ballistic missiles from the cold war, which go very high up, where there is very little atmosphere to slow you down, then come back down very fast on a ballistic trajectory with very little ability to maneuver except to make small guidance corrections. Ballistic missiles like this fly at high altitudes so they can be seen basically the entire process, and are therefore more vulnerable to interception.
Simply achieving a hypersonic speed does not make a hypersonic missile in modern context. We have had missiles capable of hypersonic speed since the 50's. The Russians call this a hypersonic but it's not the same thing.
That is classic Russia though. Back in Russo-Japanese War, the Baltic Fleet while on the way to the Pacific mistook fishing vessels for Japanese torpedo boats despite being in North Sea, many thousands of miles for Japan, and opened fire. One ship fired over 50 shots at the stationary targets while not hitting anything. Overall 2 fishermen died and along with 2 Russians from friendly fire.
