1. The scale of the catastrophe is horrific. Allies and multinational organizations responded to the earthquakes by deploying emergency response teams and obligating funds to capacitate NGOs on the ground. How are humanitarian operators currently functioning and what technical assistance is needed to help the aid workers scale up recovery, medical, and food assistance ?
2. Under all this chaos, what is your assessment on the political environment ? What is the sentiment of the Turkish people affected by the earthquakes toward their local AND federal governments ?
How is the population responding to the turkish government's efforts ? Do they blame Erdogan or think that the state is doing whatever it can to help ?
If so, have people turn on Erdogan? He's been shepherding Turkey for 20 years, IMO he should be responsible for all the new buildings collapsing, but what do Turks think?

He has in 10 affected areas, which would last until national elections, which are expected in May and could cement his position as Turkeyâ€™s most powerful ruler in nearly a century.
