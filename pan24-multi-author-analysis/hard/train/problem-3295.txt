It's like when the US complained about Iran interfering in Iraq or Pakistan with Afghanistan. This is stupid, Dr. Strangelove levels of pointlessness.
Oh, and just to solidify the point, Russians complaining about direct involvement from other actors IN A COUNTRY THEY INVADED is a fucking joke, and I wish they would understand why we all laugh at them about that.
EDIT: For you dumbasses messaging me who think I’m seriously insinuating that we would or should invade Russia, the largest country on the planet, that possesses the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, it’s just a joke. Calm down and enjoy the idea of the Ukrainian flag flying over Red Square.
If we were “directly participating” the way they say we are, the war would’ve been over months ago and Moscow would’ve been renamed New Kyiv.
If the US & NATO were directly involved in the Ukraine war, then Kaliningrad would be a crater, Moscow a burning parking lot, & Russoterrorists like him would be hanging from lamp posts by their ankles. And that's just after the first wave of Poles invade the country.
Bu the time the Americans arrive everything West & North of the Urals will be dead or reduced to ruins. No nukes needed.
Those nukes don't look too scary anymore. I wonder if they're even operational. Russian military corruption has been completely exposed to the whole world. Sorry...not sorry 😁.
