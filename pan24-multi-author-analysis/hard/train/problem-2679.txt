I have a friend who voted for trump twice (to his credit, admits the errors of his ways after what happened starting after election day 2020). I said to him, "He is constitutionally incapable of being president." He said that trump met the Constitutional requirements of age and citizenship. I said, "No, his personal constitution. He doesn't get government. The office and it's requirements and responsibilities. He didn't get it. Doesn't get it. Nor will he ever get it. His nature will not allow him to understand and step up to the role.".
Yes, they turned out to be. But Trump didn't know that when he took them, and it doesn't matter anyway. He took the ambassador's personal decorations away to place in the White House, the ambassador did not know until Trump had left. When pressed, the White House responded that they could have them back after Trump's second term would have been up in the 2024 election.
Scrolling through the long list of atrocious shit by this guy, during a 2018 visit to Paris, (same visit where he called veterans, “suckers and losers”) he transferred art from the home of the US Ambassador to France to the presidential residence of the White House, flummoxing many…How do you respond to a president who acts like an emperor visiting the house of a feudal lord?
