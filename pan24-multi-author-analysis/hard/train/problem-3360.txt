So your sister has that "defensive instinct" that all humans get: Something is afoot. But like a good republican she has had her defensive instinct trained to seek out a scapegoat. "Are you sure grass is green?" kind of conspiracy thinking. It's good to be suspicious when your educators say, "Grass is green," but conservatives tend to have a weak set of tools to interrogate the science behind "grass" or the definition of "green", let alone how we as a species have a collective, socialized definition of things, and so on....
