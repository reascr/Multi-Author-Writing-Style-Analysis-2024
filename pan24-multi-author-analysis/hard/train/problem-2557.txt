I get where you’re coming from. U want leadership to deliver but I realized GOP usually doesn’t work in good faith and use their position to muck up policies such as Obamacare to be seen as bad and twist the reality to fit their narrative to get more votes. That’s when I really want to ask who are u really for if all u do is to hinder your fellow person from trying to pass laws that can make positive changes. The fact that the politicians don’t want to see eye to eye should be the most obvious signal that our leadership fails in communicating tangible solutions. Which in turn makes u ask yourself are they even good leaders if u can’t even healthy communicate?
I’m not saying democratic policies are 100 percent perfect California would be a good example on that. We need both sides to find the solution together and they need to work together not attack politicians for trying to find common ground. If it’s not my way or the highway people start accusing the politicians on being too soft. Lol what is going on here lol.
Lol. I wasn’t sure if you were being sarcastic because it sounded like the documentary Cartel Land (spoiler: the vigilantes kind of become the cover of the gangs all over again).
