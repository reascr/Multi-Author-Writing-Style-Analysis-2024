While I agree, I don't think this is the best justification. The better one is: As long as russia is killing Ukrainian athletes, russian athletes should not be allowed to compete.
I sympathize with the Russian athletes, but 2014 Sochi taught us how involved the Russian state is in athletes lives. Russiaâ€™s doping apparatus was unbelievable. Check the Icarus documentary. While many Russian athletes are independent spirits, Sochi taught us that the Russian State frequently uses athletes to cheat at the Olympics.
Russian athletes are regularly used as propaganda tools for Putin's regime, so it makes sense to ban them. Also, you keep pasting the word "sanctimonious" around as some kind of one-size-fits-all universal incantation of moral affront, whereas your statement is actually the only accurate example of sanctimony here. Which is hilarious.
Yeah, there are a few amazing people among them. But the vast majority are paraded on Russian media to exalt the government and drum up support for Putin's atrocious war, and they do it. So what's your actual suggestion for addressing this? Hand them a questionnaire?
