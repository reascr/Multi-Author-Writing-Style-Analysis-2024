Hmmmm let's see. US likely keeps its global status as Super Power or the biggest world power and most powerful country for decades to come. Most countries around China are in fact US allies or countries that don't really like China. Countries bordering US aren't Chinese allies and as much as others may not acknowledge it, the US controls all of the Americas. US will continue to be the most dominant country the world has ever seen until the US makes itself self-destruct and even then, it will still always be a major global power in the world.
This will pretty much the future of American global economy domination, not by compete to win, but by trying to choke China and hope they lose more than us, so we "won". Step by step, we will corner China so they have to make everything by themselves, then we will run out of things for choking.
From business perspective, this is a great "win" for America, relatively speaking. Sure, Intel and AMD may lose some market shares, but in general America "won" by making China endures and Taiwan/Dutch lose a lot.
When we run out of things economically to choke them, that is when bad things start to fly. We will then "corner" them into a war so hopefully we come out on top, the best scenario could be a proxy war and I wonder who is the best proxy near China, hmmmm.
