In a decade or two we'll know what they were and what country sent them. It's incredibly unlikely we hear before that unless it's used to justify an attack.
People that have been saying aliens are real for years/decades think eveything proves aliens are real...
I want it to be aliens but I want hard evidence. I want facts more than I want one specific answer or another. Like Mulder I want to believe but I don't want to be duped into mistaking foreign tech, previously classified tech, or old tech that no civilians got a good look at for extraterrestrials.
I seriously doubt this was aliens. Just based on us having shot down 3 (at my last count) of them. I doubt we'd be able to go toe to toe with extraterrestrials capabile of flying halfway across the galaxy.
I thought that the UAP’s were possibly from another dimension and not Aliens? A lot of the in the know people say these beings have possibly been here before us. I think these “ Objects “ the government shot down are more than likely human made though. If it were the “ Beings” or Aliens and we were lucky enough to shoot one down. It would on our part be an act of War. Besides their technology is so far ahead of ours , I doubt we could even shoot one down!
