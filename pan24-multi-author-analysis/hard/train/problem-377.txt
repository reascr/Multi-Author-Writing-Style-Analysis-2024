Putin is whispering into Trumps ear how to dismantle US democracy: get rid of presidential terms, cancel elections, do fake electors, seize the voting machines, establish marshal law, lock up the other candidate, and now.. undo the constitution. This is EXACTLY what Putin did actually.
Putin is getting exactly what he wanted, just less. He wants to slowly build up reasons to close off the country and turn it into Iran, while menacing and bribing the rest of the world into expanding Russia's sphere of influence. He is copying the US, but in a KGB way. And.. it works.
He is good at psychopathy so he can say what people want to hear and really good at lying and manipulating people and has mild Asperger's.. and he got taught by the KGB and then surrounded by the KGB who made doing this into a teaching science. KGB wants to dismantle American domestic democracy by doing what I said above to discredit it.
Donald Trump is an enemy of American democracy. The worst enemy right now. The GOP must open its eyes to not let him back in power in 2024. The consequences would be dramatic for America!
