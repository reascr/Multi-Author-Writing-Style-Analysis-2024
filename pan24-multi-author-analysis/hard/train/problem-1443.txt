Law enforcement said to him he could save them if he just gave himself up willingly. He just told his son's he hopes they get good lawyers and let the police take them away. How true all of that story is is questionable to me, but after seeing the level of corruption these guys were a part of I wouldn't put it past him.
One anecdote about Jack Warner from the documentary I'll mention is that when they went to arrest Jack's two sons (they were laundering money for their dad) at their apartment, Jack was present.
Just watched the new Netflix documentary about FIFA and this dude was quite a huge part of the corruption and how FIFA leadership ended up getting busted by the US. I always knew FIFA was bad, but I had no idea how insane some of the bribes they received were and the shit they pulled.
He ate at FIFA's top-table in the corruption league. His name always came up every cycle, and yet FIFA did nothing about it.
