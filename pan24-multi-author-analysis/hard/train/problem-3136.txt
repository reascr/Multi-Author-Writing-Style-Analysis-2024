Absolutely false. Hitler's campaign of oppression and terror towards Jews as well as Slavs, Roma, and others began in 1933. The Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935. Kristallnacht, a government-sanctioned terrorist event in which hundreds of Jews were murdered and thousands of Jewish businesses were burned, looted, and destroyed simply because the owners were Jewish, took place in 1938, and is considered to be the homicidal beginning of the next-level Holocaust.
There is also the Yiddish saying: "Zog mir ver dein khaver is, vell ikh dir zogn ver du bist." = "Tell me who your friend is, I'll tell you who YOU are.".
I suppose. Not without precedent, though. We can’t forget Hoover’s hangout with Hitler and his subsequent dinner with Göring - at the latter’s personal hunting cabin, no less.
This is so confusing; I’ve seen so many different accounts of this dinner, half of them say it went appallingly, the other half say it went swimmingly. I suppose truth is somewhere in between, I guess. Must mean the appetizers were cold but the entree portions were huge.
I guess when you’re in the game (aka politics), the standard moralities of the common man no longer factor into your brain.
