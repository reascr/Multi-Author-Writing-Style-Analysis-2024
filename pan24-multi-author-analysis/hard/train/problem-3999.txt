This is by the quirk in definition that paratroopers are considered Elite, and NK has massed Paratrooper Divisions (but arguably lack the planes and equipment to deploy them).
Yeah, the whole "Special forces = Elite forces" causes people to forget the "special purpose" part and think of them as super soldiers that can do anything infantry can but just better.
The purpose of special forces is to do reconnaissance and infiltration behind enemy lines; they're not some elite infantry troops - like you said, regular infantry are actually better than elite units because being infantry is not the purpose of those elite units.
Most people think that Special Forces are some elite infantry that can do anything, but that's not the case at all and not the purpose of special forces.
There's nothing necessarily special about us troops as people. Their training is good but at the end of the day they're still humans.
The US military is the best equipped on the planet and that's because we don't have nearly the corruption of Russia.
