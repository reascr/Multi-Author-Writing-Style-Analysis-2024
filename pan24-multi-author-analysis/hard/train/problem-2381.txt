I don’t condone what Qatar is doing but to be frank there have been a lot of Islamophobic/racist comments on Reddit recently. Any comment thread about Qatar eventually derails into Redditors cursing the entire Middle East region and its Arab populace.
It is true that both Qatar and Israel are crying 'discrimination' when they should instead stop being monstrous abusers.
You could say that the Qatar government is evil and its people are negligent and should be ashamed for not caring about basic human rights. But you can’t say “All Arabs are bad, Islam should be extinguished from existence.”- that’s the tone many hold in these detailed comment sections.
Redditors quarreling about something as mundane as beer, or which football team is the best is perfectly fine. When the same quarrels derails into racism, homophobia, transphobia or whatever discrimination against a certain group of people passes the line in my book.
It does suck to have to disassociate and delete people that didn’t seem homophobic at first, some i’ve known socially for years.
