> On Wednesday, four senators — Sherrod Brown and J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Bob Casey and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania — wrote a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency requesting more information about the agency’s plans and ability to respond to the derailment, as well as any information about long-term effects on the environment and how the rail company would be held accountable.
Columbiana County , and East Palestine did vote overwhelmingly for DeWine (see , search "E Palestine").
That describes the Trump/GOP that the East Palestinians voted for. Elections have consequences. These people voted for uncontrolled toxic spills and they got what they voted for, are they not pleased?
Now that the Deep State East Palestinians get exactly the world they voted to get, they are complaining about not enough EPA protection, not enough toxic chemical transport regs, not enough FEMA help.
Which has nothing to do with East Palestinians voting to end EPA, end toxic chemical transportation regs, end FEMA and then crying about none of that being there for them.
As opposed to voting for Biden and O'Donnell and getting better EPA regs, better toxic chemical transport regs, better FEMA response...all the things the East Palestinians are complaining about NOT getting.
Which had nothing to do with the current wreck or the lack of regulation the East Palestinians voted for and got, much to their dismay.
Im filing this incident under “elections have consequences” and losing sympathy for the people of east palestine.
I am since they keep wanting to deny the help and the prevention to others, save the help for others who will need help from the GOP/East Palestinian decisions.
First off...of course we will help, because many of us, despite how the majority of people in East Palestine voted, realize that as a country, we are no stronger than our weakest link.
