I'm all for training and licensing for owning a gun just like driver's licenses. However, just like driver's licenses a state should develop an agency that handles the training and licensing not just expect the police to do it. As someone who supports defunding the police and stopping them from doing the jobs of social worker and mental health professionals, why on earth would I want them to have to do this job too?
Imagine if you will that they passed gun licensing laws like I suggest and then the nearest licensing center was 100 miles away. That's what states do with voter ID laws.
Why depend on State to issue ID for a Federal election? Fed election law should mandate accepting an array of alternative ID for Federal office election, including a RealID issued by Federal Govt, pictures taken etc at any Post Office (as well as whatever the State wants to accept for its own concurrent elections).
But those would be issues resolved with money or with changes to the process of using the Federal ID, not constitutional issues about whether the Fed govt can demand acceptance of a particular ID...
