I dislike Santos as much as the next Antifa vice president of the San Diego chapter local 403, but let's be honest, they may have been delusions at the time, but it does seem like he made the grandeur come true. Even if he lied his way to get there.
I think he's just a liar and a fraud. No need to give him an armchair diagnosis. There's something too studied about Santos's affect.
Most people with schizophrenia wouldn't be able to get as far as Santos has. It's a severe disability that affects people's cognition and planning skills, not just their grip on reality. From everything I've heard about him, Santos just looks like a con artist.
That's a possibility, though bipolar disorder is episodic, and if Santos's mania were severe enough to produce delusions and other symptoms of psychosis, it would be unlikely that he would get this far without crashing or ending up in a psych ward. I've interacted with people in the middle of psychotic episodes. They were all too erratic to pull off a successful congressional campaign.
