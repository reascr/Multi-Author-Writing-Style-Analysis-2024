Focusing on Pelosi when there are worse offenders is a surefire way to make sure nothing gets done and no constructive conversation can be had about “the larger issue”. It signals partisanship, especially when it stems from articles like this that are based on painfully transparent misinformation.
Mostly threads like this. Where someone who is uninformed connects dots incorrectly and writes an article about “odd timing” to generate hate-clicks because they know any article critical of Pelosi, even if it’s not based on facts, will get them views.
Its just weird to me that Pelosi is the poster child on the issue, despite not having been on top of the leaderboards for awhile, and these Pelosi-centric articles seem to pop up a lot more frequently recently.
Turn a blind eye to? You have me mistaken. Investigate, and hold accountable when the data shows impropriety. Including Pelosi.
Also, Nancy Pelosi is not the leader of the Democratic Party. What leadership position does she hold?
She is not currently in a leadership position. She is not a leader of the Democratic Party. What leadership position does she presently hold?
Are you somehow suggesting that is not a leadership position? Or that her influence over the Democratic party isnt that of a leader?
Speaker of the House (2007 - 2011, and again 2019 - 2023) Literally the top position for house democrats, but "not a leader" right?
She was the Speaker of the House, which meant she was chosen to represent and lead the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives.
Leader of the House Democratic Caucus (2003 - 2023) Nope, just an errandgirl position, just making coffee here.
Chair of the California Democratic Party (1981 - 1983) Probably literally a chair, not a person, right?
