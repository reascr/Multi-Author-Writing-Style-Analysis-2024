In actuality it’s much easier for a LEO to cross the entrapment line. In Ruby Ridge an ATF agent pointed to where we wanted the barrel of a shotgun cut down to. That was enough to blow that case and leave that agency with a black eye. He did not give permission he merely requested a crime be committed.
In the case of the Whitmer plot these 3 were the only ones that could be charged and not support this defense. The remaining suspects had been heavily influenced by the FBI and their informants.
The FBI did not want a case on the books where entrapment could apply to informants. The agency crossed the line in being too aggressive in proving a case where agents and informants were advocating for the commission of a crime in order to make a case. And potentially crossing a line into criminal behavior outside of the limits of undercover LE work.
What entrapment isn’t: A cop or agent undercover allowing crimes to be planned or suggesting crimes be committed. Like a vice cop offering to sell sex or a DEA agent coordinating a drug deal. That’s not entrapment.
