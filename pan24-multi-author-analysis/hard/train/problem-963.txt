Nothing about that is against the law. The laws are awful, the institution is garbage, but the laws have been totally conformed to.
What I'm trying to express is that the laws of the nation have been very intentionally constructed by the rich and powerful in order to allow this trash to happen in a totally legitimate manner. The institution, the laws, are rotten.
If we were to operate with the word "legitimacy" as though no law maker or enforcer were legitimate unless those they governed over gave consent, my local police, my city council and mayor, my state legislature, all the way up to Joe Biden himself are illegitimate because l do not consent to their governance over me. I actively do not want them to legislate or enforce what rights I do and do not have.
I completely and wholeheartedly agree with you that all leadership should derive all power from the consent of those led. 100%. But that is not, and was never, how America was intentionally set up. The government has been built from the beginning to disregard our consent, and the laws are constructed to continue to allow that.
The law doesn't make something legitimate - legitimacy comes from the consent of the governed. Theoretically the law reflects this, but we can see that this is not the case, and provably so.
