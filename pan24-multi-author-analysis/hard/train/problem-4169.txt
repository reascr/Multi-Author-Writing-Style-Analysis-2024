Same as the GOP you wouldn't have everyone under the same umbrella... but America is and will likely continue to remain for a long time a two-party system because it's become far too established and financially secure in that model.
This is what AOC meant when talking about how in other countries she wouldn't be in the 'same party' as many other Democrats. They'd have their smaller 'progressive party' and then they'd form a coalition with the "Moderate/Center Dem Party' and that would be a power structure.
Except in a coalition government, the bigger party tends to have give real concessions to create that coalition.
Where there is really only one party, the part leadership end up dictating the terms because of the whole "who else are you going to vote for?" issue. Like in the UK, their parties get proportional representation, so the smaller parties will get SOME members that may be needed for teh coalition.
Edit: apparently u don't know all the vagaries if the UK system from across the pond. But proportional representation is what minor parties need to get their voices heard.
