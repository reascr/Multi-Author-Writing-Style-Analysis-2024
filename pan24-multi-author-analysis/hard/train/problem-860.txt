"It was my understanding I had completed my course of study in Political Science and International Relations," Ogles said in a statement. "Last week, I requested an official copy of my transcript and learned that I was actually awarded a broader degree in Liberal Studies with minors in Political Science and English.".
In addition to mischaracterizing his major in college, Ogles has recently repeatedly referenced his time combating human trafficking and fighting international sex crimes, claims that are dubious.".
Ogles revealed the misstep in a statement to The Tennessee Star on Sunday, a day before NewsChannel5 published his complete college transcript.
But while it's true Ogles studied at Middle Tennessee State University, he did not major in international policy nor economics. Instead, he majored in "Liberal Studies," a general education degree.
Liberal studies degree means he never declared a major but had enough units to graduate. Basically the school kicked him out to make room for more serious or deserving students.
