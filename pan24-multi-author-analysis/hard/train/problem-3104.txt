I mean perhaps you are right, I haven't seen that 57% number anywhere. Was there polling on it? That's wildly incongruous with the talk of my conservative leaning area, online, and radio call-ins.
This is some straight Republican messaging bullshit. Let's be clear, Republicans and Manchin voted against the paid sick days. Blaming it on Democrats is just straight fucking lying.
Constructive criticism would be identifying that the bill that did pass had a 24% raise, provides for the ability to take time off for medical appointments without being penalized, and is supported by 8/12 unions representing 48% of rail workers (almost half, but, yes, not the "majority"), and then addressing the issue that maybe it was a strategic mistake to run the bills concurrently while identifying that that strategy runs some super high risks as well. If they went with an all-or-nothing bill only to start and a huge swath of holiday shopping shipping and supply ground to a halt, what do you think would be on the news 24/7 for this entire month?
