If the right wing is going to push that Biden is forgetful due to his age then they can't go about claiming him not remembering is "nonsense".
The irony of course is the fact that they've spent years portraying Biden as mentality deficient and incompetent yet here we are now supposed to believe that he is supposed to have a memory that most children and teenagers don't possess?
While that certainly doesn't excuse Biden per se... the idea that him not knowing is nonsense is just not based in reality. This is a political statement made by people who politically need Biden to be on the hook for their own ends to be justified. This has nothing to do with Biden and everything to do with the Republicans needing to justify a revenge tour and irrational hatred of a political rival.

Which is it Republicans? Is he a mentally unfit old man who isn't there... or is he a super genius mastermind wielding the deep state to terrifying effect? While also somehow managing to be thwarted by Trump at every turn?
