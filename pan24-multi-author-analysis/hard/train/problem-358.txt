In case you didn't notice, we just moved to within like 8 milliseconds to 12:00 on the doomsday clock, within the last 12 months, thanks to the US ramping up quadrillions of dollars in weapons sales to Nazis in Ukraine.
Yeah, imagine being angry at corporate shitheads blowing up the world and profiting off of sanctions, coups, drone strikes, police brutality and austerity policies.
...as opposed to a "reputable" news agency whose "opinion panels" are populated with CIA agents and State Department flunkies, and whose advertising revenue is funded by the people who manufacture the Javelins, tanks, drones and missiles that are being used to blow up huts and weddings.

I don’t think that Noam Chomsky and Seymour Hersh suddenly became Russian sleeper agents, I think it’s more likely American news companies are towing the line for the state department, like they did for Vietnam Iraq Afghanistan Syria Libya hati Yemen etc etc.
