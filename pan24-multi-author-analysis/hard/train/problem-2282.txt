Fucking deplorable. the other group is the ypg which many foreign fighters have aided over time. At one point they were a hot spot for foreign fighters.
Yes I am very aware. I’m specifically talking about the Kurdish faction they are targeting in Syria known as the ypg, which I’m sure based on your comment you know nothing about.
Just recently the US had to greenlight Turkeys invasion of Kurdish Syria in 2019 knowing full well what that would mean for Syrian Kurds-- and this was only the eighth great betrayal of the Kurds by America in 100 years.
And then before that, after WW2-- which was the second of three great opportunities to actually give the Kurds a state-- the US pretended to support Kurdish independence by arming them in Iraq against a ruler America didn't like. But then in 1963, we cut all aid to them to instead back a military coup that featured Saddam Hussein, and once they took power the US gave them napalm specifically to use on the Kurds.
And then before that in the conclusion of the Gulf War, the US stood down to allow the Iraqi military to massacre Kurds across Iraq because Bush Sr supported a strong military junta taking power to keep the nation under control (he just hoped it would be without Saddam).
Before that in the 2000s the US used Kurdish freedom as a reason to invade Iraq, but then never mentioned independence again and then allowed Turkey to assist Iin the invasion by heavily bombing Kurdish Iraq.
And then before that in the 1990s, the US gave Turkey huge amounts of weapons specifically to massacre Kurds in Turkey, which the US had full knowledge of.
