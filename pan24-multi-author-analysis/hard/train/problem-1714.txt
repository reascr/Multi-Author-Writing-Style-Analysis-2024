its just Russian war, literally most of their wars are like that, they just throw numbers at their enemies, the war probably wont stop before 500k deaths.
If 120k Russian's have been presumed killed in slightly less than a year's worth of fighting in Ukraine, I feel if this war continues until the same time next year, we'd be looking at 250k-300k dead Russians.
So even if we say 50 precent of Russian casualties are dead (which is a very high estimate) it's no where near the 120k ukraine put out.
120,000 young Russian men killed, but The ones who left are better educated and wealthier than the ones killed. Sexism is strong in Russia, and their economy is based on resource extraction and heavy industry; young men are the lifeblood of their economy.
So, Russia is fucked. This is good, because they need to lose Putin's stupid war. But it is bad, because the planet is far too small for anyone to be safe while half of Eurasia is a trailer park full of drunkards with nukes.
We tend to think of an economic slowdown in terms of shortages of consumer goods, but Russia has vast hinterlands where it takes great effort to keep roads and power lines functional. A huge segment of the workforce is dead, fled, or maimed.
But wait, there's more! TB is a perfect example of how the planet is too small for a place as big as Russia to be a shithole country. No one has good treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and it is on the verge of evolving enough resistance to become a global problem.
