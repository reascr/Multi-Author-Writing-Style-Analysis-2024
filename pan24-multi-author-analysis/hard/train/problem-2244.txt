That being said this is going to get bloody. Russia is full steam ahead with infantry waves. UKR needs to hold while they prep their tanks. Then we can see what happens when Battlefield 4 players get to play against battlefield 1 players….
Yesish, but it’s likely because Ukraine is allowing it to. It’s better for them to bleed and retreat then counter attack then lose an equal amount of troops for an area of questionable strategic importance.
Given how long the fighting there has gone on it’s a higher number but not insane. I mean they do Zerg rushes literally every day. If they loose 500 men a day, that only requires 100 days, or a little over 3 months, to hit 50k.
The attrition for Russia here is insane, it will weaken them on other fronts, which are also easier for UKR to attack, and with modern tanks arriving by March seem like nice targets.
It’s not just the tanks, the IFVs are an enormous step up on Russian equipment too making attacking but also defending easier too.
Thousands of armored vehicles, IFVs, tanks and missiles will eventually be given in the following packages if required.
Meanwhile russia will spend all their cash reserves and will eventually have to take money from russian citizens. How long do you think putin will remain in power after that?
