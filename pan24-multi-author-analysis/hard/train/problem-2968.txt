I would say the bolded section applies comfortably to Fox News. The Republican party at times both directly and pretty much all the time indirectly controls Fox News. Fox News is a revolving door for Republicans and if you can agree that when Trump was President it would qualify as "state-run media" then the only thing that has changed is their control of the federal government, but because America is a Democracy and has two major parties one of which still very much has a substantial amount of control over the government at a local level and hopes to soon go back to federal I'm not sure how you can say it doesn't fit that definition.
Simple. For the majority of people who watch Fox, Republicans are their government both in practice and in theory. E.g State/Local governments and the fact that a lot of these people truly believe that Trump is still "their President".
"state run" implies government run. When the media you consume is 100% all in on one party of government and that party represents a disturbing amount of states including the ones most affected by its propaganda, "state run media" is an applicable label.
But that's not what "state run" means, it just so happens that the corporations own our media and also our government (and in the case of FOX, it's owned by someone who was originally Australian.).
