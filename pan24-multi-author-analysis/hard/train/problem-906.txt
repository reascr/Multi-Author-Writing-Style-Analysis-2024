Now I'm scared that all trans people are going to lose their rights and that gay people will follow.
Like I said before we have more trans people than ever. They have more support than ever. That's not a start of a genocide.
Exactly my point, there's not a trans genocide happening in the US. There are more trans people and support for trans people than ever.
Support for trans people is higher than ever, but so is opposition and the opposition are the ones making the laws.
Maybe this is a hot take but I think we should probably stop genocidal action before the killings start.
Would you hold this same opinion in Germany in 1933, before the camps opened? The nazis didn't go from zero to gas chambers in one day, they started by fomenting a climate of hate toward Jewish people and depersoned them publicly. The fucking Texas governor asked for a list. We are not far off from pink triangles. If a Jewish person back then told you "hey things are getting spicy 'round here" would you tell them they're overreacting?
