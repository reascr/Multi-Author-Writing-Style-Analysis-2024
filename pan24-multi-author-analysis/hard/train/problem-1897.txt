It's more about if Putin will step down to a less powerful position in 2024 and appoint someone else to succeed him.
What this means is that Putin can run for president in 2024 and in 2030. By 2036 he would be 84 years old, if he's even still alive, effectively making him president for life.
If he’s still alive in 2024, Putin being an old Soviet, will hand pick his blessed successor. This man will assuredly be as corrupt and/or morally compromised as Putin. This is a survival tactic, a mutually assured destruction should they try to come after him when he’s no longer in power. It’s how we wound up with Putin in the first place.
The problem for Putin is that if he is not the Dear Leader, then he is Very Dead. Whomever replaces Putin will have almost no choice but to blame the former Dear Leader for the mess Russia is in. And this kind of blame is almost certain to be very unhealthy.. (This was not the case a year ago, but it is the case now due to the crazy war Putin started).
Also Putin has already demonstrated the level of paranoia that is highly incompatible with him giving up his power.
