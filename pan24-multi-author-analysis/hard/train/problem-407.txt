Isn't former Rep. Devin Nunes some big shot over at Truth Social? If so wonder if he'd try to angle for a role in Elon's world so he could find out about who was behind the Twitter accounts he couldn't get shut down, or if he' take the money and buy a Tesla or something...
And the end of the day, based on the amount of comments I’ve read, and people I know personally who own Teslas and will never buy another, is what will cost Elon the most. $44 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to turning 50% of your fan base against you and vow to never purchase a product from you again. I planned to buy a Tesla myself and now I’ll never buy one.
Max covered many things, but didn’t cover one of the main ones which is advertisers. We already know 50% of the biggest advertisers left. I imagine that numbers going to keep increasing with every crazy headline Musk has. Simple things like starting to ban accounts saying bad things about Musk, calling people Pedos, prosecute Faucci doesn’t sound like much, but all these added up is changing millions of peoples opinions about Musk, Twitter and Tesla. There’s a good possibility there’s company heads currently advertising on Twitter that have family members that died from Covid. Musk making fun of and going after Faucci could cost millions right there. What does he even have to gain from that?
Edit: can’t forget pressure from Tesla investors too. Read today that the top Tesla investors lost $100+ billion collectively, so that’ll cause even more problems.
