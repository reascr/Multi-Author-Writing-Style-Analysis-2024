The US will do whatever makes russia or China weaker, that’s the thing about rivals they don’t want the others to get ahead. It’s obvious that China if they do would try to get a fair deal in Russian eyes which if the US is brokering would do the same for Ukraine.
From a geopolitical standpoint, the US cannot allow China to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia.
If China brokers a peace in Ukraine that Ukraine can actually accept, they get their favorable reference. Then they go back to being the devil.
If we're referencing British WWII-Era politicians, how about Winston Churchill: "If Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a favourable reference of the devil in the House of Commons.".
??? Are you nuts? Russia will invade Taiwan?? With what army? They couldn't do that with their pathetic baby navy even before the Ukraine war.
While I'm highly skeptical of the Chinese government having benign intentions, I'm also strongly in favor of ending the war ASAP on ONE CONDITION That no one asks for stupid shit oike Ukraine giving away parts of the occupied Donbas or returning the 300 billions frozen Russian assets.. these are now Ukrainian assets and should be used to pay for rebuilding Ukraine.
If, and there a big if, they have genuine intentions of ending the war in Ukraine it's not because they care about global peace but simply bcuz they wanna boost their sphere of influence by appearing strong and influential enough to end a European war and because Russia being pathetically incompetent is embarrassing them and if Russia is no longer a concern for the west everyone will focus on them.
