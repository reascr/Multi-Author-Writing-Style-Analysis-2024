We had a similar demonstration in the last few years: a small piece of forest (Hambach), which had been steadily felled over two decades (I grew up there, so Pepperidge Farm remembers when it was still a real forest) was to be felled so the mine could expand to its planned limits. These guys showed up and suddenly everyone pretended that those few hundred meters of forest was mightily important and had to be protected - when in the preceding decades no one gave a shit and the little rest of a forest was barely enough to be considered a system.
And, btw, it's not "Germany" and they are not planning anything. That plan has been planned long ago, right now things are being set in motion by RWE, the company responsible. Maybe, just maybe, if the 1980s hadn't seen demonstrations against nuclear power on a mass scale, we wouldn't need those coal power stations to manage base supply, but now we are fucked without them.

If those dipshits hadn't sabotaged renewables, there wouldn't be that much of a "demand" for coal today. Demand of today for coal was "created" in the 2010s.
Now I am against energy production using coal. It's messing up our air, environment and has caused my generation to grow up with a multitude of respiratory problems. It should be stopped immediately and replaced by other sources. But I can't help feeling that these demonstrators are not targeting the right people/situations or that they just want to do "something", as they are nowhere to be seen when all these developments are put into motion but show up when it's already been decided and execution time is right around the corner.
