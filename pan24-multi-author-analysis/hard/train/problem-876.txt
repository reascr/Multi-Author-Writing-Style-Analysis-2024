That's part if it, but also MAGA is getting pretty unpopular. 6 years in and these people don't have anything promised to them. Some of them are in jail. You can tell by looking at his rallies. They're piss poor now. Toothless and anemic.
These people have been let down and they're starting to realize it. They're too brainwashed to vote for another party but they don't see a point in voting when yhe writings on the wall.
They’ve convinced people that republicans voted are legit and dem votes aren’t ON THE SAME BALLOTS so there is no limit to what bullshit people will believe.
True- but I'm thinking that a large part of Trump's base no longer truly considers themselves Republicans, but vote GOP because it aligns with most of their interests. I'm sure they could be be easily persuaded to follow Trump to the MAGA Party. It wouldn't have to be a very large number of defections, either, to ensure Democratic victories in what are currently GOP strongholds.
Even if Trump doesn't get the GOP nomination in 2024, and even if he doesn't run as independent, I can't see him staying quiet and letting DeSantis get all the attention. I'm sure he will still be holding rallies where he will spew his vitriol at the GOP. And there are probably a lot of new shows that would have him on to do it, as it would be good for ratings.
Given their performance last night though, and what seems to be the average American tiring of their act, impeachment could backfire. The populace saw through the Clinton impeachment sham in 1998- and Bill's favorability ratings rose.
