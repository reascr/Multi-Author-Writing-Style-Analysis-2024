The funny thing is it is happening on the state level. I’m in Florida and Republicans from the governor on up to members of Congress have acknowledged that climate change is real and have taken steps to address it here.
That’s obviously not good enough — we need to address it as a country and on the world stage. But all Republicans aren’t the climate deniers they want you to think they are.
Name and shame every Republican legislator that “doesn’t believe” in climate change. How fucking convenient is it that all their donors have a vested interest in ensuring they can pollute as much as possible? The Republican base hates money in politics. Trump ran on “draining the swamp”. They have the same ideas we have in many cases, they just have no fucking idea who the good or bad guys are.
Democrats suck at messaging and getting people riled up. I know we like to pride ourselves on taking the high road, but we are at a point where we truly need to punch even lower than they are going already.
I’m not saying we are going to convert every MAGA Republican into a Democrat, but we sure as shit would see a decline in the blatant cronyism and hypocrisy that exists in the Republican Party today at a minimum, unless they want to keep losing votes.
