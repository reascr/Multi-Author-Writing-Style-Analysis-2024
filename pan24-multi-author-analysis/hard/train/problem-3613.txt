Having said all this, the vaccine situation among the elderly is extremely poor, and this sudden reopening has obviously been the opposite of how a reopening should be done. Most under-60s will be vaccinated but will most likely be more symptomatic than people elsewhere who had the modern vaccines.
The rest of my family, who are all current on vaccinations, didn't even present symptoms or test positive at all. I didn't even social distance from them when I was infected.
Just about everyone else in the world has experienced one or more Covid-19 infections or has been exposed to the live virus with no infection. In addition we have a set of effective vaccines.
I think it's in part due to their vaccine not being as effective as Western MRNA vaccines. Part of the reason for the beyond dystopian lock downs was mass sickness has the ability to cripple their Healthcare system. I should add it did in the US. Thrre were some states whose hospitals had to call around looking for bed space in other states for seriously ill patients.
