Russia has been the aggressor and their excuses have been really a hard sell. Yes, propaganda is everywhere but the fact remains that it is Russia that crossed the border. All they needed to do to be safe is stay within their borders. Now all they need to do is retreat back to their country.
Let Putin keep killing his army in an illegal war to occupy Ukraine. Let him keep destroying military hardware. At the end Russia will be completely unarmed by their own doing. And the question is for what? To steal resources from Ukraine? What was the reason for this invasion?
The american industrial military complex may be interested in selling weaponry but they didnt put Putin s army in Ukraine. Ukraine is also a sovereign country and free to ally themselves with whoever they please. If Mexico or Canada made an alliance with China we wouldnt start an invasion on them.
Yes, America WOULD go into Mexico and overthrow the sitting Mexican Government before it could make that deal with China. I mean, how could you possibly deny that?
Now, please do not conflate that with me implying that the Russian media is portraying a more accurate account of the situation. Because they by no means are doing that. Their propaganda to their citizens is likely even more intense.
