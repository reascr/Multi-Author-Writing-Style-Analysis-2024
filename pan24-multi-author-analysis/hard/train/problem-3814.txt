Edit- “Ask not to track” means Apple isn’t gonna share data with other developers about other apps you use, etc. This cuts down on targeted ads and helps prevent a company from building a profile on you.
TDLR: Apple is collecting data exactly how it says it is, while Mysk is using clever wording to mislead and file a lawsuit.
This is also the difference in Google and Apple, Apple shares data in a way that’s usually useless outside of app development, and developers generally can’t track back.
And it won’t, Device Analytics shares ALL the data about the device with Apple and not just Apple use you, it also doesn’t prevent a 3rd party app that uses a log in from collecting data.
•	Apple is collecting this data regardless of a user’s settings where they are given the option to turn data collection off, possibly giving them a false sense of privacy.
Apple has been avoiding talking about its TOS publicly, specifically its privacy policy ever since the announcement of the "Do not track" feature. It's a taboo topic alongside encryption on the iCloud, considering the position and reasons of Apple on the encryption of their devices (again for privacy reasons).
