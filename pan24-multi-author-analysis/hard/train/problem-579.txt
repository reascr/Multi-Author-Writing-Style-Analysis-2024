So now the argument is both that Biden was intentionally signalling to Putin but also, despite his decades of media interaction, became flustered and gave away a covert operation that would drive Europe away from the US?

This article is published by the daily mail and written by an extremist conspiracy theorist who is consistently incorrect and has become increasingly more erratic as time goes on.
Also, I'm not saying you shouldn't be skeptical, but do you hold the same standard of "conspiracy theorist" to MSNBC/CNN for perpetuating stories that have been since proven to be false i.e. the Iraq War, Steele Dossier, and countless others? Or do you only hold that standard to something that challenges U.S. orthodoxy?
