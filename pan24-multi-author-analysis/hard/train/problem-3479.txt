Well this time they've built nukes and they've build ICBMs and so now they can't sabre rattle anymore... they're actually the very threat that we felt we were stopping by giving them food.
There's one major change that screwed over their strategy.... they actually build nuclear weapons. In the past North Korea would threaten to start up its nuclear weapons program if the US/South Korea didn't capitulate to them and provide them with food. This food is provided via the UN as the vehicle and then every so many years there's population growth and the annual allotment that was agreed upon a few years back doesn't work anymore... so back to nuclear sabre rattling.
Donald Trump was the last president to increase food aid to North Korea. The president got dicked around a lot and essentially North Korea got food for absolutely nothing. That event was so shameful it's reshaped US policy towards North Korea and it's unlikely that Biden will increase food aid to the country.
Doesn't North Korea regularly conduct missile tests and other destabilizing events in order to blackmail the world for food aid?
One can only hope that Russia doesn't have what they need and has been lying to them for military aid and there might be a fracturing afoot but it feels more likely that North Korea is about to do some crazy shit in order to get more food aid.
