Not defending the dirtbag, but the difference is the law and your ability to use it in your advantage.
Instead of fixing the carry forward loophole they changed if from 20 years to indefinite. So idiots like Trump can reach back to when he owned casinos and claim millions in extra losses.
A big loophole which Congress keeps open is your ability to carry losses from year to year. So the rich collect losses and then report them to off set their taxes. Congress needs to close this loophole, but the Dems often blame the rich rather than blaming he tax code.
Tax avoidance schemes are the fault of both Congress and the wealthy that benefit. You're welcome to imagine it's just a'ok, nobody is obligated to though. I can't square someone paying what amounts to virtually nothing in tax by percentage of income while everyday folks pay 20-30% routinely. I blame both Congress (who are impotent about making substantial tax law about this sort of thing, or have been) and the wealthy (who exploit the system and work to keep it going).
I fail to see how elected officials neglecting to close a loophole and making it even easier for the wealthiest among us to exploit it is not a problem.
