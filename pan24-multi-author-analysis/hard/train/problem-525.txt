Yeah I've started quietly doing this again as well. It's not really out of fear of catching the virus, more that I absolutely have not forgotten how my fellow citizens behaved at the beginning of covid with regards to panic buying. I'm planning on having maybe a month or two's worth of stuff to weather the initial storm. Had a very bad feeling twice in the past 5 years - one in December 2019 when I saw whisperings online about some sort of virus in China, and one in December 2021 when I saw videos of Russian APCs with parachutes attached being mobilised in Belgorod. I've got that same feeling again reading current developments around bird flu.
I'm not saying bird flu isn't an enormous concern. But the necessary mutations for a human pandemic haven't happened and hit the human population yet. We're not where COVID was when it spread out of China. Not even close.
I really hope not. COVID absolutely devastated us for 3 years and its not even close to Bird Flu. If this shit mutates and transcends to human mammals, we are fucked. Bird Flu has something of a 50% mortality rate...
I do know we have vaccines and strict pandemic plans but I am traumatised by the global disorganisation regarding these situations.
Plus, even outside of vaccines and effective treatments, much is learned relatively quickly about supportive care during a pandemic. Maybe now that 5% fatality rate becomes 1-3% or so.
Eg, if they know of 10 cases of it and 5 of them died, that’s a reported 50% fatality rate. In reality, perhaps 100 people were actually infected but most had mild or no symptoms, and were never tested for bird flu. Now it’s a 5% fatality rate, not 50%.
