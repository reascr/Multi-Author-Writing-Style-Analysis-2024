What fantasy world do you live in where Ukraine would attack Belarus and they wouldn't attack back? It is fantasy to say "that [a Ukranian attack] would make Belarus contemplate closing its territory to Russia".
I get that, but, under the rules of war, if russia invades from Belarus aren't the russian military installations in Belarus legitimate targets?
Does a few targeted strikes against the russian military installations there make putin pull them back from the border to a safer distance?
I get that. It's a shame Zelensky cant speak to Lukachenko direct and get an accord that Ukraine can attack russia military inside Belarus without making him join forces with putin to attack Ukraine. That is pure fantasy, i know.
You're asking for it to be black or white, that is fantasy. I refuse to engage in a fantasy based discussion, this is real life and dumb choices have consequences.
The Belarusian military doesn't support Russia's invasion, if Ukraine attacked Belarus then the (Belarusian) military would probably directly help Russia.
"Valid military target" doesn't mean shit in this instance. You're talking about attacking non-combatants.
