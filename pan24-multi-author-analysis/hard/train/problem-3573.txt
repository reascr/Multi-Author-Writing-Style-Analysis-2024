E: Sorry, had to brush up on my history again. The Watergate investigation took over 2 years, and Nixon likely would’ve been charged if not for Ford’s pardon.
Mueller never found collusion with Russia, (the main point of that special council,) he just found a willingness to collude. Willingness is not a crime. Mueller was also constrained by the DOJ policy that you can’t indict sitting presidents (which I think is BS, no one is above the law.).
This. Such a good point. Didn't read really occur to me at the time but the media completely misrepresented the situation (at least CNN). They did mention it here and there, but if there being honest they would make it clear that the 20 holdouts aren't the only extremists.
"Most press coverage portrayed the struggle as one between a more moderate faction supporting McCarthy and a far-right splinter group who opposed him.".
Well said. You honestly nailed it. I think it's also important to note that fascism is not a new movement in the US at all. Take the silver shirts, personally wouldn't be surprised if they made a comeback.
