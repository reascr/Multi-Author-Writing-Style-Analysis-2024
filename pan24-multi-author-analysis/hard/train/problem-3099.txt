It's completely disgusting how much plastic is used by restaurants in gig delivery. Literally every item by some of these restaurants are packaged in their own container never to be used again. I don't even buy bowls. I just use what I've gotten from these places. Often, they are objects durable enough to be used for years. Delivery before the gig company hijacking of the industry was largely pizza and Asian based because it can be delivered in a paper based container. Most of the items that are delivered in plastic could be delivered in more ecologically sound ways that could and should be cheaper. Many restaurants are victims of their own egotism. "Their food" is special and it's necessary for it to be delivered in packaging that more maximizes temperature like plastic.
But plastic has properties that few other materials have - the ability to hermetically seal and not to taint the food (pizza sticks to cardboard, etc.). That's why ready meals have far more plastic than takeaways - they can actually be air-tight, which you can only really achieve otherwise with glass or maybe with some specialist expensive films that are new on the market still.
Don't know where you've been ordering from, but almost all my takeaway come in cardboard boxes and paper wrappings.
And plastic is actually worse at retaining heat than cardboard. You can tell because have you ever picked up a hot plastic container and burned yourself? Now, have you ever done that with a cardboard container?
Most plastic or coated food containers. Itâ€™s kind of unavoidable at the moment, but a good way to limit exposure is to take your food out of them immediately and avoid microwaving them.
