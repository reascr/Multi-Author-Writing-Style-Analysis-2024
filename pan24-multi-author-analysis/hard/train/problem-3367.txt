You know what I’m just gonna say it. This smacks of the special counsel with Mueller. He came in touted as a real tough guy. Looking back it was all just a way to punt. Here we go again. A special counsel with a new tough guy who will say some stuff but ultimately nothing will happen. Just someone to pretend stuff is being done. And you know what? It sucks.
It's sad. The adage of "A ignorant vote is worth as much as much as a educated vote" is very real. People really unironically think tan suits and mustard on a democrat is equivalent or more severe than murder encouraged by a republican when they shout out "BOTH SIDES are the SAME!".
And went "IT'S ALL A HOAX, FAKE NEWS CHINA PLAGUE DON'T WEAR MASKS MY rule was ALL OBAMA's FAULT!" Then tried to rile a base to attack school shooting victims and called them crisis actors, to the tune of lawsuits and cheering. And then was never punished for any of his crimes while the fbi and defence department twiddled their thumbs and took out their teeth and used their gums on him while he wanted to cheer for another child shooting.
Can't you see both sides are the same? Why should someone who wants to give people access to a better education, worked their way up on the american dream, highly educated, cares about the poor and needy get a vote over the person who wanted to commit tax fraud and leave his own voters dead, dying in the cold and infected with the plague, and watching his own voters die.
She must have worn something revealing!" Like damn it's a child and they're trying to victim blame a raped 10 yr old. WTF???.
How so? Federal budgets are only funded in 1 year increments by law and funding has very strict limitations on when the money can be used and for what purpose. This allows Congress to control the purse strings every year. It’s statutory.
