I have a friend who began to lean conservative in the past couple of years - COVID restrictions (even though those were under Trump) and anti-Biden propaganda has made him believe that only conservative administrations are the way to make the country better...Anyways, long story short - he can't name any specific policy yet, but he's certain that DeSantis is the right choice for the country...Just like Trump but not mentally ill, is his take. So the media he consumed is already grooming him to think DeSantis is the guy.
The propaganda machine will be started once he gets the nomination "Oh you liked Trump's policies? Well DeSantis is just like him, but far smarter and more effective!".
Yep. It's not genuinely about her school grades; that's simply an estimate for her decision-making capacity, which is the cover story for the basic forced-birther position. They don't actually care about her academic potential.
Correct. The default / bias position for this asshole is that more children should be born, regardless of the details in any given case. He just needs to occasionally pretend that he'll consider ruling otherwise.
