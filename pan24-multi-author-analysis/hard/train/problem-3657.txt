Read the article, she was caught fraudulently billing clients and only had to pay back what she got for "wrongful termination." This isn't "some person was lazy at work and got sued for it.".
Yep. We had to stop producing 30K dozen a year of chicken eggs when the cost of both feed and labor increased beyond what we were willing to charge for eggs. Legally, minimum wage for egg washers ratchets up each year so we had to choose between better pay and feeding birds. I’m looking for food costs to double to permit a meaningful wage increase for ag workers in the future but then, of course, a living wage won’t be a living wage anymore.
There’s a lot of people who want to be paid more than the value of their contributions to a business or product. While the need for a solution is in no way diminished, many of the aspects of “I should be paid a liveable wage for whatever it is that I do” can be distilled right down to that.
If you're saying that workers should do the work themselves and demand the wages they need based on their own costs of living, well, I won't totally disagree. But if the worker really is educated enough to do that math, they will realize they need to demand more than minimum wage in most places in order to survive. In most places, it's way out of date and doesn't reflect what a worker needs to live.
No employer is keeping a position that doesn't create surplus value. That's how capitalism works at a fundamental level. If you have a job, your employer is making more money from your work than they pay you.
