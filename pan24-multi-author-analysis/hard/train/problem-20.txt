Considering how long we knew and how catastrophic the results will be, this is nothing in the timeline.
Again, this is great that we are FINALLY doing something that would be 120 years after finding out it could be a problem, and 50 years after DEFINITELY KNOWING this is going to be an existential threat.
It isn't a defeatist attitude, it is pissed off that these cocksuckers have done this much harm and will face little to no consequences. I vote for the right people, but my 1 vote vs their billions of dollars is a slow crawl toward progress.
Agreed. That unwavering optimism is the veil that these assholes operate in so that they DON'T have to change things.
That doesn't make up for the fact that this is so far behind where we could/should be at in order to not permanently damage things, assuming we can even fix the problem (we won't). We will probably not destroy the planet but millions of people will die so that a few oil execs could get a couple more dollars.
Billions sounds big, but the oil industry has earned literal trillions from fossil fuel extraction, and set us on a path to spend more trillions to attempt to fix the mess they created.
Seriously, this thread got me fantasizing about the big oil companies being forced to spend billions on renewable energy and renewable materials production.
These are companies that invested billions into climate denial, that actively delayed research in renewable energy, electric vehicles, etc.
