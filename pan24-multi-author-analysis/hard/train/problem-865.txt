Are you joking or are you this uninformed? Women can't vote in the Vatican, and the Catholic Church still supports religious Monarchy as a system of government. If they had it their way, Europe would have the clock turned back to the Middle Ages.
They are entitled to their views on monarchy and the Middle Ages. You may disagree with them and their stances, but they are free to have their own views. Let them have their views, they are free to live how they want.
Most of the middle east won't do anything to gay people if they're doing things behind closed doors. It's only when it's in public that they care and even then, you'd just get a warning. A lot of Westerns assume that all gay people are automatically shot in conservative countries.
We do not fit the "ultra conservative" description, unlike other countries who push gay people off of buildings and shit. We are a lot more tolerant and accepting than some south asian countries and i have not heard of gay people being punished because of doing gay stuff/just being gay.
