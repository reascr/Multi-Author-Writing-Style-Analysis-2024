So more specifically, he's basically saying that Taiwan could be the next Ukraine if the west abandons Ukraine. The logic goes that if China sees that Russia can break the west's resolve in the war with Ukraine, then it would embolden China.
And China is in a better position than Russia. The world is far more dependent on it than the world was depending on Russia, and they have significantly less corruption so their military is likely to be better equipped.
We learned in Russia that losing trade is not enough to stop authoritarian countries invading, but it does make it harder for other countries to respond. China is no different.
China is different. They aren't trying to sabre-rattle a nuclear war. If anyone tries to cut them off, China is diverse enough that they are self-sufficient.
China is fairly reliant on trade, but that cuts both ways. If the west tried to cut off China to the same extent they cut off Russia, then while China's economy would certainly suffer, the western economies would be hit far worse than they were in the fallout of the Russian sanctions.
