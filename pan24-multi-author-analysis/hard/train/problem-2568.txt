This is totally anecdotal but during my divorce my husband ignored his weapons subpoena multiple times and nothing happened as well as perjured himself. At first he lied and said we’d never bought one and the court was like oops we’ll he says there’s no gun so I guess we have to believe him. Then when he was subpoenaed again on his 2nd DVPO he admitted that he’d lied under oath (no consequences) and that we’d bought a gun but claimed to have lost it to which the courts said o well nothing we can do about that. The 3rd time he was subpoenaed after this he claimed he’d given it to his father out of state and the courts, again, did nothing. To get unsupervised visitation he was supposed to have to do classes, never did them. No enforcement. He was now recently subpoenaed over a new case against him and never complied. Still no consequences.
Just saying, I’m not sure it’s just trump. I don’t think our court system is enforcing subpoenas, protections orders, or really anything anymore.
They didn't subpoena him earlier because it would have distracted the public with his ridiculous shit show like he did the classified documents. The committee wanted thr publics undivided attention to present facts.
This is not TV or a movie. "The wheels of justice grind slowly yet exceedingly fine" is a saying for a reason. Federal investigations usually take years.
