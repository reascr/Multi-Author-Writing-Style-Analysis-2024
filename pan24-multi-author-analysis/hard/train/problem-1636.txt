Well in this case they are actively killing protesters so it's not that incorrect. Not to mention there is reasonable cause to think that they are torturing, raping, and murdering prisoners so there's that.
Imagine the amount of rape happening in Iranian prisons, then imagine the torture, then the murders. I would be surprised if this wasnâ€™t happening to women of all ages either. Disgusting.
Just wanted to let everyone know that murdering a virgin is illegal in Iran, so the female victim is raped by a prison guard the night before.
Fuck every piece of shit Iranian that is letting their government beat and kills these girls and women. Oh I fucking wish the nations of the world would send their best spec ops teams and surgically remove the heads of Iran's government.
Iran is one completely fucked up country, I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to be sent to that armpit of the world, it's truly hell on earth.
They also postpone executions right up to the moment before they are supposed to be killed, they do this multiple times and sometimes for months, just to torture them mentally.
Yet countries like Iran can openly do evil shit like this every day while the whole world watches and does nothing about it.
It's quite amazing to me how most of the world can come together and agree how utterly evil the nazis were during the holocaust.
