he's willing to work with DEMS to elect a moderate Speaker if 218 Republicans can't agree on a candidate.
People may wonder why any Dem would vote for any Republican, but the fact is that they won the House and deserve first crack at the Speakership. If we can get a moderate in there over a whack job, then at least the normal legislation like debt ceilings will get passed and performative impeachments won’t.
Agreed, but I'd love for that case to be seen through to the end where SCOTUS orders Trump to testify. With McCarthy in charge, that definitely won't happen.
EDIT: May have misinterpreted what Bacon is doing here. He's threatening to work with Dems to coerce the whack jobs in his party to fall in line behind McCarthy. In this scenario, the Dems are hoping the whack jobs hold firm and cost McCarthy the Speakership, but my gut feeling is they'll buckle.
Didn’t anticipate Bacon. I think Valadao and Newhouse could be convinced to vote for someone like Cheney. (Speaker doesn’t have to be a House member.) Or, maybe Valadao or Newhouse themselves want the spot.
