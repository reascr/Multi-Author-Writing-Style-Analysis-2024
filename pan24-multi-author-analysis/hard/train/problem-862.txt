The Constitution is holy to them. Not what it actually says. They probably haven’t read it and definitely don’t care what it says. Just the idea of the constitution as unquestionable authority is what they like.
Conservatives speak of the Constitution like it's a holy document. But in the past week Trump said we should just cancel the US Constitution, and this lawsuit is literally Republicans suing to make all state constitutions null and void.
In the same argument a conservative will tell you that the Constitution is sacred and the highest law of the land, but then say that it is outdated and either needs to be changed, rewritten, or scrapped entirely. It all depends on whatever argument they're trying to make right now.
Unfortunately the only real response from the Dems has been the right response, taking the high road and saying that the maps should be nonpartisan.
So you have red states rigging their maps to make the house even more gerrymandered in their favor, and you have blue states trying to make their districts as neutral as they can.
