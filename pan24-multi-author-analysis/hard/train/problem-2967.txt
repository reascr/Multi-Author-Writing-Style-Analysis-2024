Having such an unsophisticated spying program being shot down makes them look foolish and behind the times. I think that's a large part of the reason they're trying to fake the US having spy balloons over their territory as well, so they can look "on par".
Isn't it more the government knows the public knows they're spy balloons but they themselves can't outright call them spy balloons because of diplomatic whatnots and implications and logistics?
You can spy on other countries with balloons, you can't do so in such an overt way to the population of that country. You can use balloons to spy, but you can't send fucking 50 floating around at the same time.
None of which is to say that I believe that it's a weather balloon. Just that you should always assume the party leadership of the PRC is always lying, no matter what they say.
This is not some far-fetched idea or strange hyperbole. It's a well-established principle of certain kinds of authoritarian political modes. As seen in many parts of the world, not just China.
