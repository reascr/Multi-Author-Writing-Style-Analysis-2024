I find this very fascinating. Im from the Baltics, and as you may have heard ''we allegedly hate Russians here''.
On the other hand there are the rest of Russians and Belorussians and ‘stans etc folks who have hated commies and Putin for a loooong time, with some folks in between. It’s hard to put exact percentages on this. But I’d say it’s 30/30/40 where 30 are for, 30 unsure and 40 against. When everyone is quiet, it looks like a majority supports it with 60% all singing propaganda out loud and rest quiet but it can flip in a flick of a dime once the 30% “unsure” swing their opinion.
So that means that a majority of Russian conscripted people who are going to die in Ukraine are people who either agree with Putin, and/or are going for their “love of motherland” and/or because “they don’t bother with politics, that’s for smarter people so they are just following orders”. And truth is, perhaps they aren’t wrong. But that’s not well suited for 21st century.
On one hand, this war is terrible for Ukrainians because they now have to deal with the Russian army and the significant part of the Russian “ruling” population (basically any person who gets paid by the government, their family and friends, they’re all required to drink the propaganda cool aid as a condition of employment so there’s lots of natural selection happening right now). That segment of population has “historical anger and frustration” of Soviet breaking up and not having a “moral high ground” anymore (“enduring for THE idea of communism which is basically what is understood under “love for motherland”” vs “mindless consumerism west”) - that’s who’s backing Putin up for real in there. They were in power before Soviet broke up and they and their families and friends stayed in power after. That’s where “NATO is an enemy” narrative comes from.
