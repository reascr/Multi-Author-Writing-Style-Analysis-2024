It might be true actually. I mean, it's very plausible he did help teach the Trump's stuff. Look at junior, dumb as a bunch of rocks. So, 50/50 chance he's telling the truth.
Thanks for the very thorough explanation. So if I read all this correctly, it's not so much they take on a new identity, but dissociate from their regular personality and take on different traits.
Well people have said dissociative personality disorder isn't a real condition, even though he's been diagnosed with it.
Multiple degrees in psych and behavior science here - Dissociative Identity Disorder is definitely a real condition. But it’s also a popular condition that liars and grifters like to use to manipulate people. They usually use a concept of DID present in popular culture/Hollywood that’s not correct, rather than the actual manifestation(s) of the condition. (This isn’t a commentary on Walker. I’ve never read his book and don’t know much about him at all - I’m just giving more info.).
Someone with only DID isn’t going to dissociate and get violent and hurt people unless they also have a comorbidity like psychopathy or sociopathy, etc., even though they’re often depicted as “going crazy” in movies and such. They’re much more likely to hurt themselves and have higher rates of self-injurious behavior and suicide. They can’t “switch” on demand like it’s a party trick. They don’t enjoy what they experience, as it’s usually incredibly distressing (imagine suddenly realizing a huge chunk of time has passed and you remember nothing about what happened). People with DID don’t “hear” voices either - they have normal internal thought dialog that can include thoughts they might perceive as coming from others, but they don’t have auditory hallucinations, which is what “hearing voices” is usually describing.
