I am all for reducing poverty. I am also in favor of publicly funded birth control, legal & available abortion options, fighting the stigmatization of childless women as useless, the promotion & simplification of adoptions and helping migrants so that young people can go where they are needed most and supported in their transition.
You know what would fix all of these problems? A reduced birth rate. But instead of going for the most straight forward and simple solution, people either think that some massive change of human nature and all our global societies can happen (it will not), or that somebody will just invent some scifi shit that will save us all (will also not happen).
It boggles my mind that it is seen as "EVIL" to just promote conditions that lead to people having fewer kids so the ecosystems of this planet do not collapse for the sake of the consumerism of an ever growing human population.
The main point is that the debate over how to stabilise the world population to sustainable levels often strays wildly away from the statistical evidence and when it does, it inevitably wanders into evil territory.
We likely still face many decades of worsening conditions as the population continues to grow and the old paradigm slowly sputters along toward its end. But beyond that, there is a positive future for humans and the rest of our family on this planet.
