It isn't the number of chambers, it is proportional representation rather than first-past-the-post. First-past-the-post enocourages two-party systems.

Yes. That’s the plan. Allow the wealthy to “cheat” on their taxes while punishing regular people who are already scared of an audit and probably did nothing wrong.
Their voters hear that he is defunding the IRS, so they think they won't have to pay taxes (for some reason). Whereas what he really is doing is just making it so the wealthy can cheat ok their taxes, so revenue goes down, and tax rates need to go up (for the voters) to cover thoae loses.
I'm sure they'll have an interesting justification for letting the rich cheat on their taxes...and during tax season as everyone else pays up.
