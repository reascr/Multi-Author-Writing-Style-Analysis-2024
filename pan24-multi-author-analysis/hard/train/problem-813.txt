So, 30 tanks is a small price to pay, particularly when funding from Congress likely to slow, and we can say we at least sent tanks lol.
Well, for one, it's only 30 tanks lol. It's not the two armored divisions Zelensky wanted. And my personal feeling (only an opinion), is that we realize Ukraine may not pull out this spring offensive, and nobody wants to be to blame when the curtain drops.
By the way, in response to your bit that you don't think that Ukraine will survive the upcoming spring offensive by the Russians, rather than agreeing or disagreeing I'd like to point out that a loss in Ukraine could throw America's, and much of Europe's, political situation into chaos.
The aid provided has been predicated on helping Ukraine achieve an overall victory in the war, so if that doesn't happen, all hell might break loose politically, particularly for the Biden administration as they'd have to justify the spending on a losing proxy war, and you can bet that that'll come up in the 2024 election.
