The people of Hungary, Poland, Belarus endured horrific suffering under the fascist and then the communist dictatorships.
You would think Hungarys experience under foreign leadership (Nazi then Soviet) and the potential loss of life possibly in the millions, that they would sympathize with another country that was having its sovereignty destroyed.
Obviously Hungary can’t annex other nations (although they should be allowed to confederate if both nations desired such), so what other solution would help restore Hungary’s dignity?
the upside of Hungary doing this again and again and again might be that Hungary sets a great example to other possible wannabe about the likely unappealing consequences resulting from becoming "Hungary no 2" right now in Europe.
of course it would be better if Hungary played ball but anyone in Europe wanting to switch to "the Hungary way" right now has front-row seats to watching the impressive spectacle of possible negative consequences that such a choice probably brings...
