Not to defend Oz (I voted Fetterman) - but at one point oz actually was a doctor. I don’t think he was just like twiddling his mustache and torturing dogs, but worked in the medical profession where there was/is animal experimentation.
Welcome to politics in America. It suuuucks. Make people get emotional about the other party. I voted fetterman because I didn’t want Oz to win. My candidate of choice was Richard Weiss.
Fetterman could be clinically braindead and I’d still vote for him. I’m never supporting someone who’s actively going to undermine women’s rights to control their own body. I’m sorry that Fetterman’s inability to speak clearly is more important to you than the rights of every woman in the United States, it shows how utterly screwed up your priorities are.
When presented with two imperfect options, I’m going to choose the one that isn’t from a party of homophobes, seditionists, and insane religious zealots. Plus Fetterman has actual ideas for policy that might help improve things, Oz is literally just a TV charlatan running on the platform of stripping women of their bodily autonomy. I’m glad he beat Oz and I hope he can deliver on his promises.
