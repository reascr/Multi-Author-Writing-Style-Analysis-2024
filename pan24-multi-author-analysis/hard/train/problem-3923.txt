Remaking coal and burying it is hard, energy intensive and mostly impractical. You need a bunch of carbon capture technology to filter the CO2 out of the air, and it has to run on something that doesn't make more CO2.
Because if you burn a bunch of fuel, creating CO2, then remake the fuel and put it back where you found it, you didn't increase the amount of carbon in the air.
But to offset the CO2 from coal, we have to have additional forest growth or other CO2 sequestering to make up the difference.
There's a huge difference between releasing CO2 from the currently active carbon cycle and reintroducing CO2 that has been long sequestered.
It may do, but it's carbon dioxide that was extracted from the atmosphere decades ago whereas the coal's CO2 was extracted millions of years ago. The wood CO2 doesn't contribute to increasing the atmospheric CO2 in even close to the same way as burning millions of tonnes of fossil fuels.
The former doesn't change the total amount of greenhouse gases in the system. The latter does, which overwhelms the systems ability to capture those gases.
