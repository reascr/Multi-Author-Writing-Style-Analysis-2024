The graph on p.1 summarizes the comparison over 3 quarters, from Sept 2021 to Jun 2022. Effectively, their new methodology produced higher growth estimates for the first quarter (7% vs 5%), slightly lower estimates for the second quarter (3.7% vs 4.4%), and substantially lower estimates for the 3rd quarter (0% vs 3%). Their methodology is intended to provide more timely quarterly revisions to estimates, rather than the single annual revision that is currently done. Both their new method and the annual revision leverage the large QCEW samples, while existing quarterly estimates rely only on smaller samples from a different survey. I think the takeaway is that, if their methodology correctly mirrors the annual revision, job growth is being overstated in the quarterly estimates in the last two quarters, and the trend indicates flattening growth.
they are just referencing the research paper that is literally from the philadelphia federal reserve, one of the 12 central banks.
However, people here seem to be in denial about the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's study being legitimate. This is not some private bank, this is one of the many regional branches of the Federal Reserve, aka our national bank that sets interest rates and such.
The website is one of the 12 regional Reserve Banks that, together with the Board of Governors in Washinon, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System.
