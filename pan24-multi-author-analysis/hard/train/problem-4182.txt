…which means no DNC funding or support, no campaign appearances from core party members with high visibility, and a whole bunch of possible primary challengers from both the GOP and Dems.
I can’t tell for certain but it would appear her strategy is to hope that neither GOP/Dem candidate can field a challenger that can come up to full primary, or that when one side loses their supporters will shift to Sinema because they think she’s not as bad as the other guy - on both sides.
If she does decided to run, it will be up to the Democratic candidate and the DSCC (they must not shy away from this race for fear of handing it to a Republican), to convince Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents that Sinema is not a \moderate\ and she most certainly isn't following "John McCain's path".
They need to bring up the fact that she's raking in thousands of dollars from corporations to continue Senate gridlock so they don't pass policies that are overwhelmingly supported by the majority of the American people.
