This cunt knows that he will never be released. So, things like this keep him in the public eye. The media shouldn't have picked this up. Sure, lodge your complaints and let them be considered in the courts and judicial system. But, no one in public should ever hear about this cunt or his wants ever again. He should be jailed, alone, forever and completely forgotten about.
He should know that he has judicial fairness, and has every right that a prisoner does. And he should also know that he and his requests and attempts for attention will never be seen by anyone. That all he is doing is yelling into a completely empty void and will never get public attention ever again.
And they can be kept internal. Everything about this cunt should just be hidden, ignored and in no way talked about regardless. Give him his due process, sure. But there's no need for the rest of society to need to know anything more about him other just knowing he's spending the rest of his life in prison.
There are people out there who view this man in a positive light and think the rest of us deserve to be treated as subhuman trash for imprisoning him.
I'll forever espouse the idea of treating people in prison with at least the barest level of common decency; food, water, a place to sleep, etc etc. I think it's important that we not dehumanise ourselves even when dealing with the most abhorrent pieces of trash in society like rapists and murderers.
With all that said, and as an Australian... even my strongly held beliefs have their limits. This man? This piece of shit? He really tests that limit.
