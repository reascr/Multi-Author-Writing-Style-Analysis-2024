I think you mean Warren,it was Warren who first came out with a policy and bill,and Biden responded to that tweet saying he supports it.Its Warren who made Biden support student debt cancellation,not Sanders.There is proof.
I'm pretty sure Bernie introduced his student policy in 2019 not 2016.The first person to announce student debt policy into her campaign was Liz Warren.
The problem is Sanders over promised and set the bar very high with his supporters during his campaign without even considering what congress would look like.He made people believe all that was needed was a bully pulpit to change votes in his favor, when in reality is even he would have massively under delivered.
The problem with Sanders for me -- and the reason I'll never trust him again -- is he was opposed to his opposition's standpoints throughout his campaign, then immediately took all his donations and started campaigning FOR those opponents when it was clear he wouldn't be the nominee. He did this two election cycles in a row. Can't support a guy like that again.
