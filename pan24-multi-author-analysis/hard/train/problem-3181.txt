I wonder if this will have any fallout among their viewers. I feel like the people watching this shit are just sort of hopeless and will just ignore this or move on to more extreme sources.
This really isn’t new news when it comes to how Fox operates But it does show how not enough people aren’t paying attention.

What most people don’t understand is Fox is giving their audience what they want. If they didn’t do that this audience would move on to some other place. As it is Trump’s base has already done that as they consider Fox to be to liberal for their taste.
When it comes to the base they no longer watch anything on Fox News except from Tucker. They are huge when it comes to conservatives but the base considers them too liberal. You have to understand the base is hard core Trump followers and Fox not only had to many liberal commentators like Chris Wallace but they made the unforgivable mistake of being the first to call Arizona for Biden. They do still watch Tucker but this revelation if they believe will change that. They often tend to disregard things they don’t want to hear. Hell, Fox News has been trying to replace Trump with DeSantis since about last June or July yet another reason Fox is not something Trumps base watches. You just don’t try to replace their hero and remain their choice of where they get what they want to hear to reinforce their beliefs.
