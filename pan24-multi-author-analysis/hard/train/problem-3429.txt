I'd probably drive Swedes crazy, as I'm a typical Atlantic Canadian. That means I reflexively see bus stops, grocery store lineups, and elevators as opportunities for small-talk with strangers. If you're ever stuck with me as a seatmate on an airplane, you'd better bring headphones! .
Ikr. It’s pretty common in Europe that people get killed for burning the bible. Oh wait, I just realized we are in the 21th century and not in the fucking middle ages during reformation.
It’s completely obvious to anyone with half a brain that the leadership of most muslim countries ignore religion when convenient to them. One must live in a fantasy world to think that Turkey would have otherwise approved Sweden joining NATO, but unfortunately a Russian paid agent messed everything up.
When Sweden requested to join NATO, Erdogan used this as leverage to get Sweden to officially designate certain Kurdish groups as terrorists, and to extradite 33 people to Turkey. Sweden conceded, until their supreme court stepped in recently to stop the extradition of a journalist who was likely to be persecuted (he was critical of Erdogan's government).
The Quran incident specifically came after the Swedish supreme court had refused the extradition of a journalist to Turkey, which Erdogan was already using to reject Sweden joining NATO.
