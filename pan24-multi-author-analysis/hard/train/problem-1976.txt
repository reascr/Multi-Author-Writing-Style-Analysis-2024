I agree with you due to the use by medical professionals and media, but I am also annoyed that we (in the US) still call Native Americans Indians. Some misnomers are so persistent, no matter how incorrect and outmodedâ€¦.
Even if we decided to honor the fact that this misnomer has been accepted by most everyone, it would still be logically inconsistent. If Indian is a correct term for a Native American person, then why is this continent called America instead of India?
All joking aside, I do also understand how on an individual a basis that there may be people of Native decent that prefer the term Indigenous to Indian. I was speaking from person experiences. Where you lost me was telling me to shut up and referring to me as racist, which I am the furthest thing from, you could ask my diverse friends group I have carried throughout my life as I appreciate different cultures and celebrate the new traditions I learn with each of them.
You clearly didn't read my statement. First, to answeryour question, yes I have Seminole and Pembroke heritage <12.5% so I don't act like I am Native American Indian as I feel like it's nominal however I respect and love the culture. Do you have any blood in the conversation? My assumption would be no since you sound more ignorant than any Native American Indian I have ever spoken to about matter relating to the subject at hand.
Not arguing with you but pointing out that most people offened by the term "Indian" are not Native American to begin with. I have been in the company of many and not one I have asked has said they feel the term is derogatory or discriminating.
