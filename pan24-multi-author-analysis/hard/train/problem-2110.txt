Former Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville is currently the stupidest Senator. Georgia can’t let Alabama keep that humiliating title when they can elect an even dumber Senator like Walker.
From where I’m sitting, a white Libertarian in Georgia (running against one of the most famous Dem senators of the bunch) dropping out of the race very plausibly could have avoided a runoff…by tipping things in Walker’s favor. And given the 2020 results, I have to think Republicans would have really liked to avoid a runoff at all costs.
That’s literally all “canceling” someone is. They say something people don’t like, people watch something else, they get less popular and get fewer job offers since literally their whole job is to be popular. That’s it, that’s “being canceled.”.
It’s always tempting to blame third party candidates for being election-spoilers, but there’s rarely any evidence or reasoning going into those narratives beyond “their vote total exceeded the margin between the two main candidates and I really wish my person had gotten those votes instead.” In reality, third-party voters don’t usually form a cohesive bloc that would otherwise have overwhelmingly voted for one of the two major parties.
In terms of agency? Actual ability to force the desired outcome? No, there’s really no difference at all.
