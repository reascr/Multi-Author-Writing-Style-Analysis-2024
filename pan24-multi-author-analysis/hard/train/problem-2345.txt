>(c)In this section, the term “classified information of the United States” means information originated, owned, or possessed by the United States Government concerning the national defense or foreign relations of the United States that has been determined pursuant to law or Executive order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interests of national security.
“The classified materials included some top-secret files with the “sensitive compartmented information” designation, also known as SCI, which is used for highly sensitive information obtained from intelligence sources. Federal officeholders are required by law to relinquish official documents and classified records when their government service ends.”.
While I don't believe that Biden's possession of these documents was nefarious (in comparison with Trump's possession which was shrouded between repeated lies and misrepresentations to our government)-- I am deeply concerned that apparently Top Secret documents are tracked so poorly that them missing only comes up in audits or when the person who had them turns them in.
And this applies to both Trump and Biden. I find it absolutely absurd that Top Secret / SCI documents-- documents that have been designated as something which would be disastrous for the wrong person to get a hold of-- are sitting around in fucking banker boxes at people's homes and on desks.
The first set of documents was found back before the mid-term elections-- if anything the reveal's timing is convenient for the Dems given the recent focus on the Republican's House shenanigans. By releasing this now the White House gets to field public opinions through polls ahead of the 2024 presidential candidate filing deadline this coming December.
