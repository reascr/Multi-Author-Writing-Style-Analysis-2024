They lost a nuclear core in North Carolina. Their solution? Buy up the field and put a do not enter sign.
Yes? You know that just because a balloon is deflated that it doesn't just fall straight down right? Wind is going to blow that shit off course hard. And once it deflates and falls low enough, radar isn't going to track shit. The jets fly too fast to really keep on a small ass target falling down.
The jet is travelling at mach speed, and the balloon is travelling at wind speed. Any object dropped by the jet would continue travelling at mach, making this difficult to justify, but I see what you mean.
I don't know, it's likely built into the nose of the aircraft or somewhere around it, it has IR technology regardless. Sidewinder missiles also have their own built in IR technology that the jet can use I believe, though I think the F22 keeps them in a hidden bay for radar stealth reasons.
What balloon? They've specifically said they didn't think it was a balloon and it appeared to have a metal exterior.
