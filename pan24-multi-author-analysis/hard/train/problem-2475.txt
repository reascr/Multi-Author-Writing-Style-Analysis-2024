Fair maps may not be enough to completely flip the legislature blue like in Michigan, WI is still very purple, but at least it'll give us far more accurate representation and make the Republicans actually have to do their damn jobs.
The GOP is starting to lose their foothold in the state as a whole. They keep backing these ultra right-wing candidates here and they keep getting beat at the polls. Kelly is another great example. He is full on MAGA, but he is a weak candidate who has already lost a SC bid once before.
The GOP doesn't care about trying to win people over, they just want their people in power. That mindset led to the blue wave last year. They feel like they HAVE to appeal to the extremists, and the average Wisconsin voter just does not want that.
This election is an encouraging sign for Wisconsin’s election maps. It also shows that abortion isn’t going anywhere, no matter how much the GOP just want to wish it away.
She had no solid messaging other than “I put Darrell Brooks behind bars.” At one point during a “debate” between candidates (it wasn’t a debate-debate, more of a symposium), she was reading answers out of a binder. Zero charisma or personality as a candidate. She did well in Waukesha/Ozaukee/Washinon counties, that was about it.
She really only had the waukesha area because of the trial. The rest of the state preferred Kelly. I'm honestly glad Kelly won because I think Janet has a better chance to beat him. Dorrow could have pealed off some of Janet's votes in the cities.
