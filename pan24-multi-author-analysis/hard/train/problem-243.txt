A lot of that has come down to what Ukraine has needed. Their army started the war equipped and trained with stuff that was ex-Soviet or derived from it, still conforming to the standards and methods of that equipment. Shifting to NATO standard equipment would be a huge effort in terms of training and rebuilding logistics networks, as well as creating the headache of trying to support two different sets of equipment in the field: legacy Soviet stuff and NATO stuff.
A number of European countries that had been in the Warsaw Pact and have since joined NATO are in the process of transitioning away from legacy Soviet style equipment to NATO standards. This means they have a load of old Warsaw Pact standard equipment they know they will be getting rid of pretty soon anyway. It's a pretty simple decision for these countries to donate all this older kit to Ukraine and accelerate their own transition to NATO standards, and this makes life easier for Ukraine because the equipment they are getting is stuff they have trained on and understand how to use.
In addition, many countries do not have material to spare right away, or material which Ukraine would be able to utilize efficiently, so they sent non-military aid instead.
They have supplied Ukraine with satellite imagery and intelligence, several billion euro in financial aid and loans since 2014, hundreds of millions of euro in non-military humanitarian aid, evac and treatment of wounded soldiers since 2014 onward, offered replacements to other countries in exchange for them sending their tanks, etc.
Also, first impressions only matter when people refuse to actually look things up themselves, and trust influence campaigns in social media instead (which is 100% something which has been going on). For anyone curious, Germany has (as of January 16th, 2023) sent;.
