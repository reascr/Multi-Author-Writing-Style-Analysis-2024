He spoke very strongly against the death penalty in his later years, and was a part of multiple miscarriages of justice (such as the time he hanged a man for murder, then three years later hanged the man who it turned out had -actually- committed the murder). He also had the unenviable task of having to hang a friend, one of the regulars in the pub he owned^^1.
I thought if any man had a deterrent to murder poised before him, it was this troubadour whom I called Tish. He was not only aware of the rope, he had the man who handled it beside him singing a duet. The deterrent did not work.
It's not a deterrent. It's a punishment. It's also saving the risk they get out, and saving the cost of feeding them.
It's not a deterrent and its not about savings. He's specifically referring to two men who hacked up and nearly beheaded a man in the street. It's about punishment. I don't agree with the bloke but of those two murderers, one of them will be out of prison before the end of his life.
Don't get me wrong - I do think the death penalty is better gone and isn't even good at it's intended purpose. But I also hate badly designed systems.
Now that's poor system design. If you're sure enough to have them killed then they should have had the time to make their defence etc before that.
