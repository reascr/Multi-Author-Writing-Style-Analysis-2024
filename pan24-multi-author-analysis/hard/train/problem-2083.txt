It’s odd how little economics (specifically the Great Depression) gets mentioned among the major causes of WW2.
Edit: I should preface that I’m a product of the US public school system which certainly mentioned Germany’s economic woes as a catalyst for men like Hitler, but I was specifically referring to the after shock of Black Tuesday and how it either added fuel to, or galvanized fascism around the world.
The rise of Japanese fascism in the 20’s can be directly linked to economic turmoil that created a nationalist fervor among the peasant class which made up the core of the military and many of its officers.
U.S.A. is way more fascist in its social fabric ( pledge of allegiance in classroom, overblown military-industrial complex, relentless mobilization against the external enemy of the day e.g. the communists, the Muslims, the Chinese etc. ) than present-day Italy.
So you’re Italian. Then you know that she’s a fucking fascist in the direct spirit of Mussolini and that they have been growing in influence and power in Italian politics recently.
This woman is the granddaughter of a fascist dictator. What other analogy are we going to compare it too. I’m not even sure if we are on the same page. Right wing populism is real.
Edit: Here, read this if this is just a downvote out of frustration. Hitler and the Nazi’s had a massive populace wave in 1932.
