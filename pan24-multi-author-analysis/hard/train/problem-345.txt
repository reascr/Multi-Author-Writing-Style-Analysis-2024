Exactly they will continue to elect the most hardline conservatives they can while asking why the democrats can put up moderates despite the current president being the most vanilla moderate democrat available.
The kind of Republicans competing with the likes of Trump and DeSantis and the positions they would need to take on to emerge victorious in a nationwide primary would make them wholly unpalatable to any kind of center-left voter.
The only way any Republican should win a majority is by stop pandering for the fascist and lunatic votes, and start being honest on issues to win more of the centrists.
For whatever reason recently moderates generally end up winning on the left side for primaries for national/large elections.
Most centrists would do better in a national election than the primary. But you have to win the primary first. This goes triply+ for the current GOP.
Ehhh the right has been governing for the far right for a while. The left has been governing from the center for a while.
