And everyone else is fucked cause we're now trapped on our planet and can't launch any new satellites while orbit is absolutely wrecked by space debris and destroys any existing satellites.
When the atmosphere becomes so clogged with space debris from collisions and abandoned satellites that it becomes impossible to safely travel through, trapping us on the planet until they all decay and eventually burn up upon reentry.
This is different than geosynchronous satellites which are sunsetted by boosting themselves up into a graveyard orbit (as that takes less propellent than shifting their orbit to burn up into the atmosphere). Most geosynchronous satellites have orbits that decay in the hundreds and thousands of years, so military action on those satellites is a real danger.
Even if that is not a problem, it is a big problem for launching future satellites or spacecrafts. Every rocket launch is now carefully planned in order to reduce risk of collision. And with every launch, more debris are created and catalogued (including the satellite) which will be accounted for every subsequent launch. Launching satellite constellations for trivial purposes is just space junk at this point.
