The corruption goes right from the very top down to the bottom. There's a really good Perun video on YouTube covering it here:
Army leadership takes money meant for producing advanced equipment and awards contracts to cheap alternatives while keeping the change, commanders request delivery for the cheap equipment that never gets produced in return for kickbacks, supply officers sell off whatever new kit does get delivered and dig out old junk from storage, armourers strip that junk of anything they can sell, and the common soldiers end up with bullet proof vests made of cardboard.
There's also a great video on lying in the Russian army, and how it leads to catastrophic battlefield mistakes because nobody is being honest about how things are really going in the trenches.
This is what we keep seeing, Russia launches an offensive, it is laughably under-equipped because their power on paper isnt real, tanks have no firing pins and are useless, troops have 1940s bolt action rifles and no winter clothing, half the artillery shells are duds etc.
Russia still has quite a bit of defensive fire power and just because conscripts are ineffective doesn't mean they can't stop or slow an advance, it just takes more bodies to do so. The war has shifted from a fast paced mobile war to one of static lines and slow shifts of the front.
