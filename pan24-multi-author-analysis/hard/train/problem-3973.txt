Honestly I think it will be interesting to see who breaks first. McCarthy tap out and let someone else take a swing at speaker? If the extreme right wing still does not vote for someone the majority can deal with then it's about more than just McCarthy, which is the hill they are trying to die on. There's a lot of people that are very happy that McCarthy isn't getting the votes.
In a way, what we're witnessing right now is how many adults are required to have basic functions of government. It will at least be enlightening.
At the end of the day it is whether or not a majority of members can vote for someone to be speaker. How many days of failing to elect someone would it take for them to break ranks either as Republicans or Democrats for the sake of having a speaker and actually being able to work and do their job?
Imagine winning the majority and not being able to pick a Speaker from your party because said party is full of toddlers, psychos, grifters and idiots.
I would rather those 6 "reasonable" Republicans willing to negotiate with Democrats hold power than the 20 brain dead idiots trying to take power on the other side.
Promises from the GOP are worthless, so why should democrats do anything to stop the crazies from highlighting what a shit show the GOP has turned into?
This is not whataboutism or “both sides”, but what could moderate democrats receive in return for agreeing to support a moderate GOP congressman for speaker?
