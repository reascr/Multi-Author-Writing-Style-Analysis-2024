Man who barricaded himself in home he does not own insists he must be acknowledged as the legal owner of the home before he'll negotiate with law enforcement.
Honestly the peace promise probably has to include bringing in NATO forces as a deterrent and enforcement mechanism, and then the threat of massive violence if Russia breaks its commitments.
I mean, Russia giving up their nukes would be a huge thing to encourage the rest of the world to trust them going forward, if only because they wouldn't be able to hide behind the nuclear threat in order to invade without direct reprisal.
Honestly I wonder if attempting to coerce Russia into giving up its nukes should also be on the table or if that´d make it too close to the treaty of Versailles. Nukes are a lot of why Russia has been given this long after all and why it´s a problem in the first place.
Russia will never give up it's nukes. It's the only thing that will stop a \_lot\_ of hostile rivals on it's borders from invading now that it's military and military equipment has been shown to be worthless.
