Comparing diabetes to a serious neurological mental illness doesn’t make any sense to me. Considering the mental capacity of someone who’s running for political office seems reasonable to me.
If we can be adults and recognize how different mental health conditions can and cannot influence somebody's ability to fulfill their role as a public servant and representative, it's a fine conversation. We should be able to scrutinize not just how we feel about candidates, but their actual capabilities to govern and the stances they hold given different policies.
It isn't our job to convince people that they should be discerning, and no amount of self-censorship will convince them out of the propaganda hole they fall into. I'm not catering to stupid people who won't change their minds anyway.
There are seriously people going "I like Fetterman's policies but I'm unsure about his condition, so I gotta vote for the TV show fascist charlatan?".
This is what I'm getting at! DID is a super rare and controversial diagnosis and the idea of "alter egos" is better conceptualized as severe mood swings, not the stereotyped holiwood way the Dr that diagnosed him has popularized of a "split personality". Where we draw the line for what behaviors we pathologize and assume to be predestined and not is somewhat arbitrary. It's more accurate to say that Walker is an asshole wife-beater than perpetuate some sort of "ticking time bomb" narrative about his mental health.
There's better ways to talk about mental health and Herschel Walker than this. Herschel Walker is a bad person because of his actions even if (and a big if, considering exactly how controversial of a Dx DID is.) he has a bona-fide case of DID(which is nothing like how it's portrayed in media) not everyone with DID is going to be a domestic abuse monster nor is it something that can't be maintained.
