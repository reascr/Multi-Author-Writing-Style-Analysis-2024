"Men cannot be lesbians" was a statement targeted at a trans woman who identified as lesbian - the potentially offensive nature of the statement is that this filmmaker referred to a trans woman as a man.
In this specific case, the statement "men cannot be lesbians" appears to be part of a pattern of repeated harassment of a lesbian trans woman. Norwegian law covers hate speech based on gender identity as well as other categories such as race, so it's possible that applies here.
Norway's hate speech laws include hate speech based on gender identity, which might cover this statement.
That said, if the hate speech law is being used to lock people up for being an idiot is true, then Norway has some much bigger issues to work out regarding their freedom models.
3 years in prison seems to be the maximum possible sentence for hate speech in Norway - which would include things like serious death threats, so I do think there's at least an argument for that penalty in some cases. In this case, the filmmaker in question may have committed hate speech, but it's unsure - she likely won't receive any sentence at all, and if she is found guilty, she'll almost certainly get far less than the maximum.
"People found guilty of hate speech face a fine or up to one year in prison for private remarks, and a maximum of three years for public comments.".
Yes. Their laws are fucked up. Have the “wrong” opinion on social issues and they threaten you with a crime.
