Also, mankind has proven time and again that it doesn't need religion to dominate the "other" brutalize torture rape and create unspeakable horrors towards each other. If you look for something that needs to change it isn't the instrument but rather the condition of humans. . This is what (true) religion/s attempt to do yet typically, being a man made system/ideal it is ultimately bound to be corrupted and failâ€¦as religions generally have.
a religion is not humanity it is a way to control people, the people being brainwashed and controlled by them are humanity, and the people would be far far better off without the religions.
Jesus was a great dude with a great message, doesnt mean your going to burn in hell (which isnt even part of the actual writing) if you do something like show your hair in public, or eat meat on a friday, or do work on the sabbath(which is Saturday according to the writing by the way).
Religion is a belief in an imaginary big guy in the sky...it has nothing to do with humanity any more than any random TV/Movie cult... Religion and basing your life around it is the exact same thing as being obsessed with comic books and comicon type crap or being a complete idiot about stuff like the MCU, if you remove these things you still have humanity, just less opression of people for having different imaginary sky friends.
Ive read the literature better than you have and was kicked out of catholic school for asking questions in front of too many people, but that doesnt give the leadership of a religion using his name the right to treat others like shit or worse.
