Because of the elevation, it's essentially a fool's errand to get the bodies down. To do so would likely kill the helper. There is even a haunting saying about climbing Everest. "No matter how many people are in your group, everyone climbs Everest alone.".
Yea. I know they will try to move many body's just beyond the trail as to not demoralize climbers, but those are more recent bodies, but that's as far as they're going.
Some dead mountaineers got pushed off cliffs to get rid of them, others were kept where they are because it was impossible to get them out of the ground.
You should see that one video of a Sherpa trying to help David Sharp at 8300m, everyone is slowly crawling up to the mountain in all the videos I see and they just pull him out of the cave like it's nothing. (I'm not 100% if it was david sharp in the video or someone from the 2016 disaster, can't find the video right now, but I remember him being in the pose of the earlier David Sharp sightings by the IMAX team).
There are a few such checkpoints, not just the greenboots guy. Problem with Mt. Everest is, it's so fucking cold up there, you basically just freeze to the environment.
