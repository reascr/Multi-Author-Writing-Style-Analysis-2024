It would have to be pakistan/india border conflicts. More skirmishes between China and India won't help their already strained relationship. It's also a big 'if' that the west wouldn't help if it was china initiating the skirmishes.
As much as I don't think China is right, sometimes the rationale of US involvement is beyond me (at least I'd put it that way).
Then there was also their awkward involvement in Taiwan and HK (largely a domestic matter for China.
It's quite the scary thought that the "strongest" country on this planet is working on the basis of credibility alone at this point (USD's no longer tied to gold as we all know), with excessive spending in their military forces to back them up in order to basically be a barbarian to others who may threaten their position as 1.
Well, borrowing a metric fuckton of money and spending it on the military instead of the citizens fits into that ideology you mentioned as well, but I don't think it's going too well for the people there either, is it?
