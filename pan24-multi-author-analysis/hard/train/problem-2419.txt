Many of those who voted were tricked and lied to by stooges like Farage and Johnson. Now I imagine opinion in the UK is veering back towards returning to the EU.
I still think the likelihood of the UK rejoining is very high, but I don't expect to see it happen for the next 25-35 years or so.
And the UK will also not be able to rejoin on the same preferential terms that existed before Brexit.
It's also worth noting that it wasn't that easy for the UK to join in the first place, the UK wanted to join in 1963 and 1967 and both times the application was vetoed by the French PM at the time. And when it comes to new members, every single existing member has to agree before a new country is allowed to join. Any single member state can veto the UK rejoining.
Rejoining on the other hand will be a sore subject which politicians will want to avoid for the foreseeable future. It's a huge can of worms and talking too much about it can swing voters either way. 10 years down the line it will be the sort of issue that could result in a party winning with a large margin but also losing with a large margin.
