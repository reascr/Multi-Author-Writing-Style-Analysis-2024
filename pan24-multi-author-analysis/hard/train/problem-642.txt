Indeed! Any participation of Russia in competitions has been used by Putin to push their propaganda further.
Oh, you're right... the world is currently in a very complicated situation. While banning russian competitors enrages some of the general public (and spreading the "west is russophobic" propaganda), allowing russian competitors means Putin can take profit from these competitions as well.
Also, as far as i know, participation of russians in big competitions, sports or not, is very profitable for Russia as well (so it ends up profiting more violence in Ukraine).
I'd say any non participation of Russia in competition has much more positive effect for Putin. It enrages general public and unites against the west. Even though I don't care for sports I have a feeling of being slightly annoyed by this. I can imagine how general sports fan sees this.
Those who make political statements at the games should be banned. But you can't judge those who did nothing wrong based on the feeling of "errosion". That's my point of view.
I see your point. Personally, I wouldn't see Ivan as suporting the war, just suporting his family to get by. I'm sure if there was a means, he would probably have gotten them all away from a government he doesn't support. But life isn't so easy. Unfortunately, I think Ivan may also be a minority but wish him luck. Vlad sounds like a bit of a knob though.
