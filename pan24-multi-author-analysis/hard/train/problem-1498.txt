It creates this horrific scenario where we can't protect individuals' data, we can only protect it from small businesses, and make it marginally more expensive for the big business.
I think it's stupid if we just go after TikTok without holding our own US-based companies accountable for protecting our data. Have we forgotten about Cambridge Analytica? What's Elon doing over at Twitter with user data?
We need to have protection for all our data. Not just certain apps, which is what's mind-blowing to me. Russia got plenty from Facebook/Insta, and may still be getting it. China has other methods of getting data, so the threat is still very much there... And I'm sure a TikTok "alternative" will launch that could easily still have ties to China.
They're also making a point of China's potential to use TikTok to promote or hide the videos it wants to. You have a generation of American youth who spend a couple hours a day on TikTok, that's a chance to shape opinions in China's favor for a lifetime.
If the Chinese government does have control over Tik Tok, it could in theory use the app to alter the collective psyche of the US. It could foment division, it could spread misinformation, it could do quite a bit.
