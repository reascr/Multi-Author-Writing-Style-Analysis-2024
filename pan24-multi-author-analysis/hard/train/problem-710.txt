What fucking bullshit, that we are expected to believe this. I am assuming Bennett cannot possibly be so stupid and naive, but just assumes his audience is.
Nazi, warmonger, not going to meet, but, oh yeah, of course not going to kill him, just kill thousands of other Ukrainians.
He would never kill Zelensky, those Russian born assassins sent to do so had nothing to do with him /s.
Yeah, they lie about the most meaningless bullshit, there's surely no way Putin would lie about definitely not wanting to kill Zelensky. That's why they went straight for the capital city and tried to rapidly capture forward positions like Hostomel airport with paratroopers which is just on the outskirts of Kyiv.
Entire point was to decapitate the government, how that happened I think they didn't really care much about (whether they flee, get killed or get captured). Same government they branded as neo-nazis.
Only after they failed, they started to push these alternative reality narratives. Only truly naive people believe this.
