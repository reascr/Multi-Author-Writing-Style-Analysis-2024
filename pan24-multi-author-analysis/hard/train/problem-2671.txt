South Korea scrambled about 80 fighter jets after detecting a large number of North Korean warplanes during a four-hour period Friday, the countryâ€™s military said, in a further escalation of regional tensions.
In a statement, the South Korean military said it spotted about 180 North Korean military aircraft between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. local time, a day after Pyongyang is believed to have conducted the failed test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
So, the US and South Korea conducted "drills" involving hundreds of aircraft (no doubt near the border unless someone clarifies otherwise), and North Korea responded by sending 180 planes flying around their side of the border.
I understand the instinct to trust your nation's propaganda and I'm not here saying "this this and this is how NK actually is", but as you've just pointed out, the known facts do not exactly match up with the picture of North Korea that is painted in the west. I do not trust a thing western sources tell me about nk, a LOT of it comes from trashy SK tabloids that people in SK know are BS.
you mean what they've TOLD you is unsustainable and horrid. In reality, it has been a relatively stable nation (contrast to the brutal fascist regime of south korea in the aftermath of the split, bearing in mind that these were one and the same culture at the time) that has endured in the face of sanctions that have taken down other nations.
