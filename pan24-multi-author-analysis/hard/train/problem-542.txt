This is literally demonstration of North Korea being capable of killing South Korean citizens in their capital. Not good at all. They are supposed to be one of the leading techno nations of the world, and they don't have anti-drone measures? If they don't, the rest of the world is utterly fucked. And that is huge problem. I would not be surprised if this was China testing the waters to see how prepared for 21th century warfare the west is.
So not only SK military failed to shut them down, they also lost jet plane during scrambling to respond.
Depending on what happened to the SK aircraft it could just be bad luck. Hell a few years ago in Belgium a mechanic accidentally trigged the gun on one f16 and destroyed one parked nearby. And if you're in aviation circles which I am to an extremely small degree you will hear with some frequency of military aircraft haveing issues.
I guess youâ€™ve missed the news over the years of drones flying over sensitive us installations without knowing who was flying them. Just because we are starting to take them seriously does not mean we have a lot of anti drone infrastructure and procedures in place.
