She is just one of many to blame, but to say someone who blatantly inside trades on the stock market is worthy of praise is insane. She basically has done the bare minimum imo. The fact we have to hold off a red wave is proof enough.

Studies show the middle actually has the least amount of empathy as compared to those who are considered staunchly left or, amazingly, right wing.
The holier than thou part is essentially making up your own standard for the word blatant. What do you want a signed confession? Her net worth ballooned while a member of congress, they are allowed to insider trade. We are not fuckin idiots.
What a stupid fucking take. The times may be changing, but you don't just throw out past champions like they're trash. Pelosi is a god damned boss, and always has been. Anyone thinking that not being Pelosi is good enough to forge forward with the same power, courage and conviction she had, is going to find out real fucking fast that that's not how it works.
