This is why we need a multiparty, ranked choice system. When you have a political duopoly, people just vote AGAINST a candidate instead of FOR a candidate and we call that dEmOcRaCy.
I'm worried that DeSantis will be superficially "not Trump" enough to lure swing and "Independent" voters back to voting for the side that wants to end democracy.
I just don’t think I would ever advocate Trump winning the nomination over him, even if it’s obvious DeSantis has much better odds of beating the democratic nominee.
If I’m going to claim Trump deserves to be disqualified, and republicans are complicit in his crimes, then I can’t well turn around and say I hope he wins the primary because it’s politically convenient.
Republicans still want Trump, the only issue they have with him is they now think he's unelectable, but if they thought he could win they'd be lining up behind him again. The only reason they like DeSantis is because to them he represents Trumpism without Trump's guaranteed unelectability.
Personally I think DeSantis is equally unelectable in a general election specifically because all he does is culture wars and voter suppression, and that's not going to win over swing voters anymore than it has in the last three elections (2018, 2020 & 2022). DeSantis up there trying to sell that "America is where woke should go to die" and that Americans shouldn't say gay and should outlaw drag shows will play great with the Republican base, but it'll read as just more extreme craziness from the GOP to everyone else. If you want to see how Trumpism without Trump does in general elections, look no further than the 2022 midterms.
