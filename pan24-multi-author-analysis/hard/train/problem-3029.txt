A crucial sign that Russia's wave of civilian infrastructure strikes have failed to destroy the Ukrainian electrical grid.
Ukraine's spring counteroffensive will aim to "drive a wedge into the Russian front in the south between Crimea and mainland Russia," said Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, DW reports.
Ukrainian Military Intelligence has stated that the Major Offensive that is being planned for Spring will take place in Southeastern Ukraine and will be intended to drive a wedge between Crimea and Mainland Russia.
This could very well be misdirection, but I honestly believe Ukraine is going to retake Mariupol and cut off the land bridge to Crimea for a major blow to the Russians.
My armchair guess is that Ukraine will first attack Melitopol, get “bogged down” by Russian fortifications and reserves, before launching their main attack towards Mariupol. Once the Mariupol attack reaches the sea, the forces could flank Melitopol along the coast, leading to a wholesale liberation of Zaparozhzhia and Kherson, and the most critical step in cutting Crimea off.
