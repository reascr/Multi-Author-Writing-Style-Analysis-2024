Nah. China does not want to attack USA unless they've become stupid. China is struggling more internally right now, this was most likely to distract their citizens with some nationalism pride.
But I am under the assumption china is aware an attack on Taiwan is an attack on many other countries.
And Xi has told his generals to prepare to invade Taiwan by 2027 according to the head of the CIA (). In addition, a US general released a memo, prior to the balloon, warning that he thinks we will be at war with China by 2025 ().
It seems like a ton of people on here think war with China is just not gonna happen. We just had the luxury of growing up in a really good time in the world. Large scale warfare will happen again and the United States will most likely be at the epicenter of it.
All in all, an invasion of the US would be like Russiaâ€™s attack on Ukraine but on more steroids you can imagine. Take all the American exceptionalism and jingoism, and remember that those are the majority of people with rifles.
And since America is a wartime country at heart, every single American is fucking pissed off and battered down with as much ammunition as their weapons manufacturers can produce (a lot).
