He isn't so bad as everybody say, it is definitely worrisome that some people are just blindly supporting him, but the country is overall good considering the situation. It was waaaaaaaaaaay worse with the past two presidents. Sadly at the last elections we had only bad options. Current president was by far the least bad.
As bad as you think it was during the administration of Calderon, it is much worse now. That is a fact that is backed by statistical evidence from multiple sources. We are experiencing the worst wave of crime in modern Mexican history under Lopez Obrador.
DM me and I’ll send them to you tomorrow. The sources come from our national statistics organization (INEGI) and they have been impartial in their data collection.
The saddest thing is that there are people that are so incredibly brainwashed that they’ll believe he’s neither corrupt nor violent and that he’s actually a competent head of state. Mexico was far better off under Calderón even during his war- it was safer than under Obrador’s “peace”.
