They don’t even actively chase you down for the most part even during the war in Iraq we would get a few awol soldiers here in there back to the unit they always were stopped for something unrelated its basically a bench warrant. They were Articled sometimes jailed and then quickly out processed with a dishonorable or OTH after completing the disciplinary actions.
Absolutely, believe me wasn’t firing many howitzers in Baqubah everybody was a grunt for all intents and purposes we just liked to give the 19Ds shit with their Stetsons and spurs. A little friendly poke to the ribs.
Edit: if I remember correctly 90 days after being AWOL it becomes desertion and yes a possible death sentence in wartime although this hasn’t been done in a very long time to my knowledge.
Well, there's AWOL and then there's desertion; in the case of AWOL it's more a matter of grounds for disciplinary measures and/or a dishonorable discharge, assuring that you do no receive benefits reserved for veterans that complete service. Desertion is another deal entirely; in peacetime it'll get you loss of all pay and rank along with a few years in a military prison. In wartime it could potentially earn you a death penalty.
