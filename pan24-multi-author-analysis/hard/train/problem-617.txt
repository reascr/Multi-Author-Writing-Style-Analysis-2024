It does matter. Being a tribalist and constantly comparing to defend your side is infantile and doesn’t attack the root of the issue. You’re so hell bent on being on the right team, your own leaders are fleecing you while you fight for to line their pockets. As Americans we are all being screwed and if you think that would look any different under a completely Democratic Party controlled government then you are dangerously ignorant.
Who cares who does it more or less? That’s just feeding your own inability to accept your heroes might be flawed. Corruption is corruption and it should never be as common place as it is now.
Not likely as the right currently see corruption as simply the price to pay for minority rule. They value power more than the rule of law.
I hope it’s legit. I rarely support what billionaires do but this doesn’t sound like a terrible idea for Chicago. Chicagoan’s are more informed on the matter I would imagine. Revitalizing distressed areas doesn’t sound terrible.
I agree. But it’s not illegal at this point. It would take a ‘real’ and genuinely popular grass roots effort in order for enough voters to pressure both sides to take the corruption out of political donations.
