It isn't per se to be a winning message, but it allow them to 'both sides' it, because they basically accuse Biden of everything that could also be charged against Trump in the near future. And secondly, once they wrap up their 'investigation', they can refer charges to the DOJ (who will probs ignore it). And then they will claim it proofs the political prosecution about any charges against Trump.
You're right in if there is corruption, it should be investigated. Nepotism too. That includes the Bidens. But it should be extended to every and any politician.
So at the moment, this seems like just a Benghazi 2.0 (or should that be 10.0 because god knows how many they've done on that).
This sounds a bit too much like Benghazi all over again, grasping at straws to find something, anything, to investigate. If there's anything monetary to be investigated, how about looking into how much money Ivanka and Jared made from foreign business deals while they were actually employed in the White House? Or the legality of the GOP and Secret Service being billed through the nose by the President's businesses?
