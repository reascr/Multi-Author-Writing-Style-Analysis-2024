The point of filling out the entire form? To assure voter fraud does not occur, and that all given information checks out. You don’t file your taxes with missing info that could be used to authenticate yourself, correct?
It’s not disenfranchisement, they haven’t been revoked of the right to vote. The people who failed to fill out their form, which is their own mistake, can return to recast. The government shouldn’t have to hover over you to make sure you know your own mistakes.
Yeah but, if it doesn’t matter why is it on there? I’m not just gonna take your word on it, if it was designed to be filled out it must be filled out. Elections are a serious thing, you shouldn’t just assume they know the numbers and will be 100% honest to them, any law that could further cut back a chance of corruption im all in for.
It wasn't an attempt Republicans have been vastly successful with 'guilty until proven innocent' in the voting booths while constantly getting caught for trying to rig elections themselves. They've already been caught in this election with fraudulent military ballots.
