Yeah but only for special use cases in areas where air is uncontested. While B52s are technically within the category of "strategic bombers", they don't really serve that role anymore because radar evasion capabilities (particularly stealth) is critical for a modern strategic bomber. B1s, B2s, and the new B21 fill that role (in addition to their use as bombers with conventional munitions).
The US has 45 B-1's, 20 B-2's, and 76 B-52's in active service. Normally the low number would be a sign of Russian weakness (like their Su-57 or T-14 inventory,) but in this case the reason is that heavy bomber inventories are limited by the START nuclear treaties.
Even if it's just confirming that the bombers aren't as good as the Russians say they are, that's still important information for how air defenses are set up or managed. Best case scenario is the bombers are actually advanced and any information already gathered can be confirmed and/or added to.
I know everyone is talking about how bad this must be but let's not forget the impact the MiG 25 Foxbat had during the cold war. As far as I know, it still holds the world record for the fastest combat jet and the fastest naturally aspirated combat jet ever produced.
That's because none of them remember the impact the MiG 25 had during the cold war. Or know how old half the designs in the US military are. Or realize just how many resources Russia still has at it's disposal.
Another example Is the Battle of Mogadishu. Had the US known that the insurgents figured out that they could weld metal sheets to the back end of their RPGs to direct the back blast away, they might not have used the Black Hawks in the way that they did. A couple of bucks worth of welding and metal sheets = 2 Black Hawks down.
