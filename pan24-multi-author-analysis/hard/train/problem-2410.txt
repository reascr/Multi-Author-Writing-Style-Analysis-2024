Police get shot: "We don't have any suspects, so we just killed everyone who isn't a cop in the city.".
This is a news report. They're gonna give you facts, not speculation. If something LOOKS like terrorism to the journalist, they ask the investigators if they're treating it as terrorism. Then they report that they asked and what the response was. That's all you should want or get from a news outlet. Anything more is Fox and Newsmax.
This is NYT reportage, not Fox New Entertainment. It's not their job to insert their opinon on any part of this. They are reporting a fact: authorities are investigating the case. And part of investigating is finding a suspect's motivation and admissible evidence to win their case. This is how things start.
"It's obviously politically motivated" isn't a legal concept, and there is no precedent-setting Ducks v Quacks.
I wish people would learn to distinguish the language of various entities and institutions, and also that context matters.
Everything starts with an investigation. You're becoming outraged at something perfectly normal and good. You can't just yada yada yada over everything and go straight to a guilty verdict, or even charges.
