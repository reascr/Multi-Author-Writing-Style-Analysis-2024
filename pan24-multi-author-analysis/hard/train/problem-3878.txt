Becket was a bureaucrat who tried to play the game and overplayed his hand. He was advocating more power for the Church, and by extension himself, in secular affairs. The political power he sought was personal, not democratic which sounds a lot like Putin.
There is no obvious successor to Putin because he would never allow that threat to exist. He jails or kills his rivals.
Putin has had decades to consolidate his power internally and they can barely sustain a war with his closest neighbor.
At all other times, when one Russian despot was taking the post of his predecessor, turmoil and killings (if any) were limited to inner circle of power.
The transition away from Communism also unleashed a lot of violence and poverty in Russia, until Putin took the reins as the next strongman. Domestic affairs stabilized, and Russia again started playing a central role in international affairs.
The period from Tsardom to communism was followed by a lot of violence and poverty and chaos until Stalin emerged as new autocrat. It was only after that that Russia again started playing a central role in international affairs. Successions after that were structured by the party.
- the best predictor of the future is the past. Russia will continue being an autocracy. But there will be a long period of violence and turmoil before a new autocrat emerges.
