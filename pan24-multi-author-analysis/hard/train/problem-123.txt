By the way, elections were a combined one of district/county, city council and metropolitan municipality elections, done at the same time, all ballots in the same envelope - which means you could vote for one party in county/district level, for another in metropolitan level.
More background, minister of interior (of AKP) called Imamoglu a fool and he replied with “the people who canceled the election are real fools”.
AKP claimed he "cheated", so they cancelled the election, taking the victory from Imamoglu who later commented "the people who are cancelling the elections are fools".
Elections are only rigged on a very minimal scale, other than that the Turkish elections are pretty legit, the AKP government tries to do stuff to hinder it like the re-do for the Istanbul election but as we saw CHP won with even a bigger vote the 2nd time.
2- They will announce someone else as the candidate, which will divide voters and possibly lose a chunk of them, which will benefit AKP.
AKP’s district level candidates were more popular than their metropolitan candidate and got more votes. They were happy in district/county level but not happy about loosing the metropolitan municipality.
