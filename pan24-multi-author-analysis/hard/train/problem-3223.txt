Cubanos are not some magical special Latinos that are automatically pre-disposed to vote Republican. This is a result of a long period of incompetence of Floridian Democrats in particular.
Cuban Americans were swinging for Obama as late as 2012. I don't feel like this is anything more than demonizing Cubans.
Blaming Cuban Americans for falling victim to propaganda, while doing nothing to combat that propaganda, ain't the way forward for anyone.
But again, you look at Cuban voters who are more conservative and contrast this with the effort the democratic party puts into other Latinos, or even other races entirely.
Even though Florida Democrats haven't done a great job in recent history, this isn't a Hispanic voter problem, this is a specifically Cuban phenomenon.
Florida's FRS has a fairly limited amount of choices. Blackrock(the company DeSantis is having a hissy fit over) offers the best and cheapest options on there, so it's quite frustrating that DeSantis is trying to kick their plans off the FRS.
