The only difference between science and mad-science is whether you stop to ask, "What is the worst that could possibly happen?" Like at the Manhattan Project when the answer was, "We believe it is possible we could ignite the atmosphere.".
Boh! What a question... I would not know. I guess it would harm you, but on a scale so small you probably would not notice. 1 atom is so very very smal... But others, more knowledgeable, might disagree.
Nope, sorry, not a physics expert, but electrons go at the speed of light. (Around the nucleus of the atom.) I'm pretty sure about that. It is the speed of the actual atoms that matters.
What we call "temperature" is nothing more than the speed of atoms. This sounds like a made up number, because it does not mean that you could even use it to cook an egg. What is does mean is that those atoms will be going very fast for a very short amount of time. In that time, they may achieve fusion.
Fusion refers to two atoms fusing into one. The gotcha here is that every atom’s nucleus is positivity charged, so they want to repel each other. Also, because of inverse square law, the closer you get to nuclei together, the stronger they repel each other. That strenh grows exponentially (squared) the closer they are together. However, if you can overcome that force enough and get their nuclei close enough together, the weak (or strong, I can’t recall) nuclear force takes over and pulls the atoms together, achieving fusion and releasing, and this is the technical term, a fuck-ton of energy.
(though it's probably the g-force the projectile feels when it hits the target - which is indeed relevant if you want to achieve high enough pressures for fusion).
They’re hoping that they can fire this fuel into the other fuel with enough force that it’ll punch through the repulsion due to the positive charges and achieve fusion.
