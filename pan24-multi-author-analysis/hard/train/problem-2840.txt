What comparison here is worthwhile? A fucking whale is nothing like those other animals, and the attempt to compare them for the sake of argument is idiotic.
Oh, there's your issue, you just assumed Japan isn't killing endangered whales and decided to go with that opinion like an ignorant jackass.
While I don't agree with whaling if Japan wishes to continue killing it's own marine life that's on them, but the sei whales and bryds whales are highly endangered the minke have pretty healthy populations.
Yeah if the whales don't like it and the people don't like it seems like a prime opportunity to stop and invest in something whales and people like. Or a least something people like that doesn't kill whales.
Not all whales are going extinct. There’s over 1.5 million whales in the oceans. I can’t read the article because I live in Europe but I imagine endangered species are still being treated as endangered.
What’s worse, killing a human with no legs who can’t run away or a human with no arms but legs so they could run away?
