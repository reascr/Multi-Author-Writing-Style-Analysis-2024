TCM isn't the reason why they insist on using domestically produced versions of the COVID vaccines which are significantly less effective than the foreign produced versions of the same vaccines.
The issue isn't that they're pushing TCM but that the actual medicine that they do use are just less effective than their foreign counterparts.
On the other hand, isn’t a lot of our medicine derived from ancient sources (herbs and all) - so… I’m sure there’s some element of viability to TCMs. Perhaps not against COVID, as it’s too novel? I don’t know. Would need to do some actual research and reading up to find out more instead of blindly believing the crowd and current sentiment.
How about you take some time and do some actual research and reading before being so rude and insulting.
Chinese medicine most definitely works. It's not a fix all and sometimes you do need to embrace western medicine but there are many many many studies showcasing alternative medicine treatments.
Traditional medicine has been used and is still being used across the world in regions where modern medicine is not as accessible. To say it’s completely quack is just discounting billions of people as fools. What makes you think traditional medicine do not work at all?
Also they've stoked the traditional medicine fire too much to now go back and say that they actually need real medicine.
Seems like some folks are very honed in on the fact it’s called “Traditional Chinese” Medicine instead of it being simply named medicine. Word games? Kinda pointless to discuss about it in this case.
