Pretty much all politicians, regardless of party, lie about their records of what they accomplish in office and their personal and professional backgrounds prior to becoming members of Congress and when they run for election and reelection. George Santos just happens to be a very public example. Election fraud, applying this line of logic, takes places on a large scale every couple of years and is a common practice by Democrats and Republicans; in their case George Santos is a very egregious case in point.
Well, unless we make it legally punishable for politicians to knowingly lie to the public, there's nothing we can really do about this until he's up for re-election. The GOP won't do anything because 1. they're all a bunch of frauds too, and 2. with only a 4 seat majority, they won't do anything to risk control of the House, including punishing or even mentioning his lies, they need his vote.
At least, going forward, they'll have to live with the stink on that guy, as they do Matt Gaetz, Gosar, Bohbert, etc., which hurts then in future national elections in close districts.
To some extent the voters DESERVE the politicians they elect, especially when they believe all the crap this guy spewed all over the place. Also have to hand it to the somnolent campaign by this guy's Democratic opponent, who obviously believed s/he had so little chance of winning that there was no way to justify the expense of any opposition research.
He's absolutely correct that he did nothing criminal. Lying from politicians has never been a criminal matter in the US. We couldn't afford all the jails needed if we were ever foolish enough to criminalize politicians lying.
