Prohibition doesn't prevent consumption, it only makes it more dangerous for users, criminalizes normal people, and funds violent gang activity. Keeping it illegal creates more societal problems and doesn't stop people from using it.
Well keeping it illegal just increases violence in the form of gangs and other nefarious people. If it was regulated then it would taxed and those funds could be used to treat people who have an addiction and it would decrease the amount of people in prison for possession. Locking people up for consuming drugs is assinine. Legalize it, regulate it and tax it.
Well that's what coke dealers do. They get the coke and cut it for more profit. If it was legal then you could get the primo stuff and not have to worry about overdosing on some adulterated coke.
Say what you say but coke will never be legal and thats good thing. If u are willing to snort it then dont come crying about how you get sick if its unpure. Thats the risk using such substances has and its very well known.
