Tracking assets at an enterprise level is _hard_, especially when it comes to documenting how things leave service. I can't imagine how hard it is with such a large org.
That's not to say there isn't corruption to be worked on, but there's also going to be a lot of investment needed to improve asset tracking, it's going to take a long time to implement, and it still will never be perfect.
I'd wager most of the unaccounted for assets are just old/broken shit stashed or disposed of without someone knowing what form to fill out.
It's not like the money just disappeared, it was spent on assets, but the recordkeeping of what was purchased and where the assets are exactly is just missing.
The unaccounted assets are _somewhere_ in a warehouse, but there's just missing records of what was purchased, when, and where they were sent.
Another part is that many assets get trashed and disposed of and are never properly documented. We had them. They sat on a shelf for 25 years. Then they were tossed, and private Pyle didn't file the proper paperwork because he was going to be transfered next week, and fuck it. That's why.
The last part is the worst part. People in the military move around constantly. Right around the time someone is figuring out how to do their job, and deciphering the shit that the previous person left them, it's time to move to the next assignment. They in turn, leave a pile of shit for the next person. And on and on. Civilian side isn't much better. You're split between people that move around a lot, and people that never budge. Most of the time is spent taking training that has nothing to do with your job, and trying to figure out how to use the 6 software programs needed just to enter in your vacation time.
