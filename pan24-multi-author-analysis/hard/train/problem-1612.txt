The US warned Germany weeks before the explosions that they had intel indicating sabotage to the NS1/NS2 pipelines was likely. That gave Germany weeks to try to prevent the sabotage or at least monitor for it.
Russian ships, and a submarine, were spotted near the location where the pipelines were sabotaged 1 week prior to the explosions.
So, Russia has a history of blowing up their own pipelines during conflicts to apply pressure to their adversaries. They expected winter to be brutally cold and the EU to have a lack of gas, thus requiring the EU to back off from their support of Ukraine if they wanted the pipelines repaired. Turning the gas flow off is extortion and might be viewed as warfare, but blowing up the pipelines gives them plausible deniability.
That being said, this conspiracy of the US blowing of the pipeline is garbage and backed by nothing more than puppets of the Kremlin trying to sow more internal fights so they can focus on their war crimes. Shame on you OP for playing into this. Because if you truly took a deep dive in thia story and the sources, you couldnt believe this propaganda garbage...unless your working for a certain group.
And I'll also add as an American , a real one, I'm just as critical of my government as I would be of any hypocritical country. They have done some bad shit and continue to do it all the while people bicker about the opposite parties. We need to be critical of our governments to keep them as honest and accountable as possible.
I cant stand the current level of communication access that allows anyone to just throw something out there that has little to no facts to back it up. When I was in college in journalism class my professor warned us this would happen. Catered one view news intake, baseless information with no multiple sources to back claims, and anyone can just post misinformation to confuse those that dont do critical thinking methodologies.
