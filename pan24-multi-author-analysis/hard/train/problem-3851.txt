Life has been preying on other life for almost as long as it has existed. Humans and our close relatives are all omnivorous and some cultures subsist entirely on meat by eating the entire animal. Meat is hugely nutrient-dense, which makes it incredibly valuable for people without easy access to food, and for the rest of us a few servings of meat a week do a lot to boost our nutrient intake.
There is not way the meat will be a viable day to day food option with a higher standard of production.
If by the meat industry numbers, what you could do is have like 1 Glass of milk and 1 piece of meat a week tops using non-industrial farming.
Shit, there is no way to do INDUSTRIAL FARMING and sustain the levels of meat consumption without government subsidies (i.e. giving money to the meat industry).
30-50% less meat seems like a small price to pay to me, even as someone who eats meat. Weâ€™re not asking to cut out all meat just some. Not bad. I can do that.
I get that. However, if our existing vaccines can be updated to fight this, and an outbreak is likely, I would bet Big Pharma is already working on, or at least has a plan to make, a targeted version.
Could a virologist (or at least someone smarter than me) ELI5: Don't we have a really good understanding of the flu virus, and wouldn't our existing vaccines be updatable to fight this?
