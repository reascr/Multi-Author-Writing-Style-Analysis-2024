Hmmm looks like the russian economy is tanked even harder with the war and there is a high probability that this will end with the pike in putins ass up the way to his head. Sooo great job.
That's pretty much how it has always worked. Except substitute EU for the U.S. You think the sanctions on Iran and Iraq were supposed to be fair or something? The global financial system is a tool of U.S. politics. Always has been (since WWII anyway).
The Kremlin’s right about this, just not in the way they think. Zelensky’s already said the war ends when Ukraine recovers every inch of occupied territory, including Crimea, and Russia is made to pay reparations.
For once, Peskov the Kremlin mouthpiece is right, Zelensky will end the conflict when every last Russian soldier is killed or kicked out of every inch of Ukrainian sovereign territory. The reason the war in Ukraine “could be a lenhy process.” is because Russia will never win, only defeat and utter humiliation await Russia at the war's end.
Exactly, this ‘war’ has always been about Pootin trying to snuff out any competition from Ukraine, hence taking the Crimea and East Ukraine where all the resources are.
The funny thing is that when this concludes with Crimea and the Donbas back with Ukraine, Pootin and his regime will be in a failing country while Ukraine will be a powerhouse of Europe.
