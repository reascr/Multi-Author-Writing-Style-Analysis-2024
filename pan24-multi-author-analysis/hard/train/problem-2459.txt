Pinning this comment to address people's questions and worry around article 5 being invoked in light of the 2 killed in the Polish border town.
Initial findings suggest that the missile that hit Poland was fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile, Associated Press reported on Wednesday, citing U.S. officials.
But I would be ok if Poland made an overtly aggressive stance on their border and started shooting down missiles over western Ukranian airspace.
Are we speaking about a small corridor along the border or is this seriously defending most of westen Ukraine (including cities like Kyiv) against russian missile strikes?
I'm guessing more an air defence zone being implemented along NATO country borders in Ukraine, and probably within a limited area within Ukraine itself. I don't think anyone will want to escalate this by directly attacking back, but NATO can't afford to have it happen again and is well positioned to start shooting down anything that looks threatening near their borders. Luckily with the lack of Russian air superiority in Ukraine there's a fairly limited risk of further accidental escalation.
