Is there a US law that prevents US military to be stationed at the border? I see so many nations have their army patrolling and guarding the border like in EU, China, India, Africa. Whats stopping USA from posting troops on its own southern border?
In short, Posse Comitatus does not prevent the use of US armed forces for border security. If it did .
Federally-activated National Guard. In other words, (which covers nationalized troops) rather than (state level NG). Two separate sections of US Code, one covers active, federal, military (those covered by Posse Comitatus) and state militia (national guard) that is not. This is how NG troops were used in GWOT, and deployed to Afghanistan.
So your source is...a guy. That is stupid enough to get caught, and worse to only come back with cash.
Yes, cut off the drug money, most of the money goes the cartel. If violence erupts from that, then it's the Mexican goverment's responsibility to deal with that. And, violence already happens on a daily basis in Mexico from narco infighting anyway.
