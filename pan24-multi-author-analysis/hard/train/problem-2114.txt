Challenger 2 is always called outdated by Russians. 4th Gen tank that was upgraded in 2008 and 2014. Ironic for the guys driving 1960s and 1970s tanks into battle.
Challenger armour is still highly classified but has Chobham armour which is pretty much the base for UK/US armour protection. Highly capable and then the European standard version has a number of ERA playes to assist with warding off different types of attack weapons.
..but the Western MBTs have far superior optics, targeting and gun range & most crucially armour protection. It will be very,very difficult for a Russian tank to take out a Challenger/Leopard in a tank on tank encounter.
And the Ukrainians manning them will have a far,far better chance of survival/escape from the tank than anything they're using now if they're hit by another tank or a anti tank missile/RPG. Catastrophic instant 'cook offs' like we've seen with so many Russian tanks, would be very unlikely, given the 'blow out' panels and separate ammo storage in Western tanks, designed to stop such a thing from happening.
I'm worried these tanks will make it to the front and not be able to cross bridges without the bridges being reinforced, which just gives away to the Russians where your tanks are going to come from.
Russians don't live with total news blackout; they will hear that NATO are now supplying heavy tanks.
..and I've no doubt the Russians will be super eager to secure their first 'kill' of a Challenger, Leopard or any other NATO tank, if for no other reason than the propaganda value.
If you are a Russian AFV commander you might have been told that the Ukrainians are running out of armor; but then being told you might face modern MBTs that will probably see you first and kill you before you see it?
I think the clever thing here is to keep working on Russian morale to the point enough soldiers decide that killing their officers might be the best option; all the way to Putin.
