I see it as a life and thus the right to life can only be suspended in extenuating circumstances. Also, they did democratically decide that it was not constitutional for the federation to impose on the states? Is it not democratic for you to vote for the issues? Dumb take, if you ask me.
Well, for me, at least, it is up to a vote in my state... But they couldn't help but add more than just abortion to their proposal so I will have to vote no.
Next, Iraq isn't controlled by ISIS... But if it is life saving or posses some other medical risk, I am all for it. But then you would say: "What about rape and incest?" And I would say: "Yes, rape and incest, but beyond that no." Then what? If I say "Injury, rape, and incest" would that sate you or do you want more? Does it go from "life saving" to "stay out of the doctors office"? That's the real issue... But if it was state by state we can vote on it... Which you say is "anti-democrat.".
LMAO... If you want to live somewhere abortion is outlawed, you can move to Iraq with ISIS, the other religious nutjobs who want to restrict women from access to a potentially life saving procedure.
When a nine year old rape victim is prevented from having an abortion, I’d like to think that the fucking state shouldn’t be the ones having a say about what to do.
