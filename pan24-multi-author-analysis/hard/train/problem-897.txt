But men being what they are, there will always be one finding a weak moment. There have been a couple of those in recent months, regarding trivial amounts, and taken care of. That's a normal process in every administration.
They're in a fight for the survival of their state, themselves as individuals and their families. Every incidence of corruption is a threat to that survival and treated as such. You can see it in the results.
Having crooks at every level is how you get Russian quality results in this conflict. For them, nothing works.
Ukraine has made remarkable good use of their military aid, achieving unexpected success against a fearsome adversary. Prior Ukrainian Administrations were quite corrupt, to the point of becoming Russian puppets. The corruption became so acute that the people rebelled and beginning with Poroshenko in 2014 Ukraine has been a model of clean government.
Ukraine is so clean it's a model government? I seriously doubt that. The current administration there seems to specifically be planning to tackle their massive corruption issues after the war, because otherwise there's zero hope of them joining the EU in the next 10 or so years.
I really don't appreciate the "how dare you criticize the hardworking Ukrainians" tone your comment is either knowingly or unknowingly perpetrating. Also, you literally just repeated what I said but worded differently with the "corruption is a threat to their survival, so it is in their best interest to fight against it" moment you had.
