Edit: people can read the California Dem platform (they summarize in the preamble, too). Is it the entire party doing this? No. Is it a significant minority? Yes. Will the turncoats be punished? LOL no, they are re-elected with party resources and liberals give them elevated committee assignments. For example, this last time it didn’t even make it to a floor vote because the turncoats were put in charge of committees and simply refused to let it be voted on.
We need to slash and burn all state parties of these types of corrupt people. We will become just like the Republicans if we don’t.
Just because Democrats are better than Republicans doesn't mean they are immune from criticism. No idea the next time they will control both the entire legislature and the executive, so failing to pass good laws is a serious failure on their end. I'm complaining that the Democrats who win elections are not progressive enough. They don't enact the laws which the general public wants. Not saying both sides are equal...
Republicans are obviously awful. But pretending "just vote Democrat" will fix our issues is naive and unhelpful. Our system of government is fundamentally broken. Manchin and Sinema were part of my point. The comment above made it seem like Republicans were stopping everything and just blindly voting for Dems would save us.
