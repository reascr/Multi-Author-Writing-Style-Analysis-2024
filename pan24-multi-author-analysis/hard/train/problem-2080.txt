Neocon and neolib aren't just liberal and conservative with modifiers. They're fiscal and foreign policy positions. That's why someone like Reagan, who was very much a conservative, is also a neoliberal. Yes, he's a fascist. That label applies to the vast majority of Americans and American politicians.
I don't think you understand what neolib and neocon mean. A person can be both, which Reagan was. Neocon being their foreign policy position with neoliberal being their economic position. Tucker is not hawkish. He's just a neolib, but not a neocon.
Indeed, I would say that he's an exceedingly bland neocon. The Tucker Carlson you see on FOX today is a character being played so that the real Tucker doesn't have to sit on the sidelines scamming money from neolibs at the Lincoln Project with all of the other exceedingly bland neocons.
Another shocking example of how Tucker is employed by Fox as an entertainer, not a journalist, and certainty not someone truthfully reporting the news. Letâ€™s not that Tucker and his wife were close friends of Hunter Biden until his father ran for and became president.
