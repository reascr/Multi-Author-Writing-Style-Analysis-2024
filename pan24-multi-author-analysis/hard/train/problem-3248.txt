The one thing I tell to every libertarian and yet they refuse to believe that the free market won't work itself out. Given the chance every corporation will fuck everyone over in a heartbeat for a few extra bucks. And corporations are so big nowadays that there isn't enough competition for consumers to have any reasonable alternatives.
A completely free market doesn't work because it assumes consumers purchases are influenced by morality more than cost.
They have the misconception that a highly competitive free market is the natural state of things. In reality, monopolies and cartels are the natural state, because without government regulations preventing it, the largest companies will use their power and influence to force smaller competitors out of business.
Actually the real problem, the one under the surface that is unsaid, is that corporations are direct competitors for governments, although they desire the good of no one except their shareholders, which tends to be the very wealthy few. So we sacrifice community, rule of law, meaningfulness, for a system which gives no benefit to any one.
