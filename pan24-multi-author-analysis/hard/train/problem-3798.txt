The newsmedia needs to get WAY better at headlines. Too often they are deceptive/inaccurate. The vast majority of people (unfortunately) do not read past the headline. The headline is without question the most important part of the article. Saying that you "clarify" it in the body is meaningless.
Really awful headline that will trick people who don't understand basic US civics (which is a significant number of Americans). This bill will go nowhere. It will not become law unless it also passes the Senate and gets signed by the president, which has zero chance of happening.
We're never going to get a filibuster proof senate from the Corporate Democrats. Except that Obama did have a supermajority, and instead of protecting Roe they protected insurance companies.
It's still a shitshow in case you haven't noticed. How stupid do you have to be to think that the solution to for-profit insurance being unaffordable is to pass a law forcing us to buy it?
Pretending it just forced people to buy insurance without understanding how much it changed insurance is extremely disingenuous.
