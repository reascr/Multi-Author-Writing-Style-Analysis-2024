When America supplied Saudi Arabia with a complement of their tanks, and provided dozens of instruction manuals for the tank crews to read, the Saudi Arabian general in charge immediately confiscated all the tank manuals, so that no one would know more about the tanks than him. He was more interested in securing his own power and job security than training competent tank crews. Perhaps Russia has a similar issue.
Also I would imagine a lot of countries are probably rethinking whether Russia is a reliable country to buy arms from. Russia already took some of the tanks that were supposed to be sold to India and used them in Ukraine instead and with the sanctions being imposed it raises questions about Russiaâ€™s manufacturing ability.
I doubt that any will actually be sent if they send any and when Ukrainian forces destroy them it would literally tank the commercial value of it for export never mind the first one they capture would likely mean the West will see how advanced the Armata is and not just the numbers the Russians put out.
The morale and propaganda hit that losing their most prized and state of the art tank to the Ukrainians would be too much to risk it in vulnerable offensive roles when they still have thousands of T-72s and T-80s in storage they can quickly repair, modernize, and use for offensive operations if they must.
as front line/ breakthrough tanks. Even the dozens of the most modernized T-90M Proriv tanks Russia recently sent over to the front have thus far been used to take long range shots at Ukrainian armored vehicles and set infantry positions up to 5km away.
Gaijin is based out of Hungary where it moved to in 2015. The developers are originally Russian, but they got the hell out of dodge after Crimea was annexed.
