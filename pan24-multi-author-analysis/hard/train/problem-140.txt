Anyone who says he has lost his marbles needs to just rewatch that masterclass. He took their schoolyard jackassery and owned them. I’m honestly not sure how Repubs move on from that.
Agree completely with the first part. I don't want it privatized either. I want it gone. You seem to have misunderstood my point, so here is an example. My grandmother is very wealthy and receives a bit more per month from social security than my grandmother-in-law who is and has always been dirt poor (I did a budget for both). How is this in any way fair if it's supposed to help the poor? Why not, instead of letting poor people be taxed out of what little they make, let them invest the same amount instead?
Again, if you insist on forcing people to invest their money in their own retirement, you could at least agree that government could let you invest (your own money) in an IRA, real estate, or some other legitimate investment. As shown in my op, this would generate an average of something like 23x the amount generated now for retirement. Tax all IRA capital gains at an extra 2% and now you have a system in which the people who did save their 12.4% retire as multi-millionaires and the ones who chose not to still get to retire on the current amount of benefits. All this while not increasing the amount paid in to the system through SS. It's not a fixed pie- in our current system, you pay in $225,000 to get out $175,000. In this system, you would get out $4,000,000. This is money that was created by letting people invest in products and services. As it is now, all this potential created money is wasted on a program that you yourself don't believe you can retire on.
If you can’t clear 2-3% net of fees having money invested for 30+ years, you’re doing something very wrong with such a long time horizon to work with. And that 2-3% studies have shown being the rate of return on your money in S.S. is generous… it’s much more likely to be lower for anyone 45 of under.
