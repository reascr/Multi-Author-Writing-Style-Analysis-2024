It would really suck if it required all new R&D, although it would be cool to see how fast the militaries new AI whatever the fuck they used to create a supposedly flying NGAD could create a stealth refueler.
I would imagine you could retrofit it to do the job buts itâ€™s the most expensive plane on the planet and kind of a waste of resources as a refueling plane.
It is not like Boeing has a wide body stealth passenger jet lying around that they just need to slap some props and some refueling gear onto.
The AF has wanted a Blended Wing Body / Hybrid Wing Body cargo jet for a while now as it'd be more usable volume and less fuel needed for lift. Only thing holding it back is advanced materials designs needed to actually build a giant triangle skeleton that can fly. This is slowly changing and was subject to export controls under Obama, which is relevant in this discussion as it was when we first really began telling China No and telling Boeing No to outsourcing.
It's the future of aviation. How soon we get there is another question, a few prototypes at the end of this decade for 2030s production is a long time to wait for the future.
It's also a major force multiplier when combined with our UAV fleet, which is what this is really oriented towards. The USAF and Navy want aircraft whose uptime can be measured in months, not weeks. This is extremely useful if an asian country wanted to .
