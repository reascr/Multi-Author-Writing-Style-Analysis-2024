It has always been an oligarchy of sorts considering the disproportionate power of a rather smallish group of people. Robber baron were the technology oligarchs of yore.
Who are the oligarchs? If all the political power is in the hands of just a few people, we should be able to name them like we do with actual oligarchs instead of just citing statistics from government reports like this article does.
If you want me to believe that we live in a real true oligarchy where the rich are stifling our efforts to do anything about it, call me when the majority of primaries are won by progressives.
So every year we keep reaffirming with our votes that this status quo is fine with us. Every election that does not dramatically shift the composition of congress to a progressive majority that wants to tax and regulate corporate wealth the way that everyone who complains about an oligarchy wants it to - is a granting of permission for the oligarchy to proceed.
Every election, 80% or more of the votes are cast for either Republicans who want to expand the oligarchy or centrist democrats who want to do little to nothing about it. This includes the primaries, where progressive candidates routinely lose.
