It does if you're scared you'll get jailed for voting in the wrong place or if the polling location you used to use is no longer there. The point of gerrymandering and voter suppression is to create fear.
Like massively purging people off of the voter polls. Like an asshole who is too scared to really let the people vote. Bunch of crybabies who can't actually let people vote for what they want. Teachers deserve a raise. Teachers also deserve a shit ton more. Everyone does.
I guess that's the difference between us? I'm not cool if we do it, but you're cool if you all do it? You're cool with electing people to subvert the will of the people?
I'm talking about the last election where Kemp was Secretary of State. Abrams conceded this race, I don't doubt it. But if you have to be on the side that can only win by gerrymandering and voter suppression, you don't get to be on the high horse.
If they had an old school republican candidate who appealed to moderates Warnock would have probably lost.
Warnock ran against the worst senatorial candidate I can remember, and is barely winning. Abrams maybe ran a better campaign, but against much better competition.
