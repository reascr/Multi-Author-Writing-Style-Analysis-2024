No what happened is: he was recruited by Wagner from prison. He then surrendered to Ukraine, and as a pow he even did a couple of interviews. I guess Ukraine wanted to show that turning yourself in as a mobik is the way. Then he got swapped in a prisoner exchange, and Wagner made an example out of him: donâ€™t surrender to Ukraine or your head is flattened by a fucking hammer against a pole.
So he was convicted for murder, joined the invasion for a pardon and deserted, was then traded back to Russia as a pow for a ukraine pow, and the Wagner gang murdered him.
Yeah, he was prison, Wagner, surrendered, prisoner of war, given back to Russia, then killed for surrendering.
Heres an idea genius, if russia will kill me if i surrender, maybe i wont surrender. Or im sorry, let me extend my arm chair, if ukraine will kill me i surrender, maybe i shouldnt surrender.
And I just hope Ukraine won't let another like him be exchanged to their death. Good chance they actively try to avoid this sort of thing, but I just find tragic things to be tragic is all. There's enough senseless death in war, and a potential administrative oopsie or lapse in thinking or judgement resulting in torture and public execution is pretty shit.
Referring to them as deranged fucks is sympathizing with them because predictable torture and execution of a returned POW, then broadcasted for the world to see, is abhorrent to me?
