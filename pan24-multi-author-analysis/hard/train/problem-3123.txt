Well this is a complicated situation though because in one hand pension is great as it takes care of the elderly population, on the other hand if pension is a significant portion of your gdp then in essence you are paying the older generation with the future of the younger generation and for a country that is facing natural population decline it puts more pressure on the younger population. I don't know what the solution to such a problem would be but it is one that we need to figure out as more and more countries will have to wrestle with the same question. One more problem that comes up in this is that if a country is seeing a natural population decline then the interests of the older population have a higher representation than the interests of the younger population.
Maybe I'm being naive, but the inevitable consequence of people living longer, a falling birth rate and an ever increasing proportion of older people in the population is that people will have to work longer (unless they have saved enough to self fund retirement).
There are two factors at play, first is there aren’t enough younger people to pay into the system and the second is that people are living longer than when they set the pension amounts.
Now old people outnumber young people and the system can’t work with more people taking money out than there are people putting money in.
Ps4: everytime legal age go further it’s defacto allowing people who have capital to choose to go out if needed and force those who can’t to continue. And often people who have capital are the one that have activity that they can continue to do being older.
