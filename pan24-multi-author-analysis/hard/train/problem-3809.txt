Guarantee you Republicans are currently working to flip this ‘provoking people to attack their own country’ bit in order to point the finger at Antifa and just about any media outlet they feel like.
Another problem is that there is no similar apparatus of politicians and tv personalities "provoking people to attack their own country." Billionaires and the politicians doing their bidding have pushed the left to protest, not some demagogue. There is no figurehead crying, "Attack!" Meanwhile, because of their rigid hierarchies and staunch obedience, conservative groups are quite easy to trace in terms of who is telling who to do what.
I love how they have organizations of right-wing extremists, with names, ranks, centralized leadership, etc. Meanwhile, "Antifa" is all they've got on the left, and there is no Antifa. It's not an organization, not a coalition of organizations, not a loose affiliation of organizations. It's literally just what happens when fascists pop up. Anti-fascists also pop up.
Holy shit, the brainwashing and fascist hate in the MAGA crowd is nuts. I always knew they were that way inclined from the r/TD days, but seeing it in this report, given this context. Wow.
Yep. I was functioning for probably 9 years? Through various stages as well for sure. Made rules like only beer which would help but then I had some serious beer binge drinking which eventually led me back to drinking liquor until things got worse and I had to do a "correction". Or course that only worked until... It didn't. The bender i was on was "functioning" but getting worse for about a year until about 6 months that was really, really, bad. But never support a racist, fascist, criminal traitor bad.
