The US Army is quite literally deploying (2022) its first armored vehicles (Stryker) with 50kW laser short range defense systems. The US Navy now (2022) has the first 60kW laser defense system integrated into its systems. And I believe the US Army has just taken delivery of a 300kW system.
tl;dr: The US is outfitting its forces with laser defense systems, they're just so cutting edge that they're not going to be exported and they're so new they haven't seen actual combat yet.
I believe the US Military already has a number of laser air-defense systems and are working on additional ones.
You know, it was back in 2000 that we had the Laser Avenger, which took the standard Avenger air defense vehicle, and replaced one of the SRM4 racks with an ER small laser. 250 kilowatt is really pretty shitty against y2k threats, but now that slow-ass swarm drones are such a threat, the Avenger's laser cannon is much more capable of swatting things out of the sky.
Also, NASAMS is one of the shortest range and least capable anti aircraft systems the US has short of a MANPADS or CIWIS, and it's still ruining Russia's day.
