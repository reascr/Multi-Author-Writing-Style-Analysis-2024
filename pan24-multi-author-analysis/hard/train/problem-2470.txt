Before allowing Sweden and Finland to join NATO, Turkey is playing their "swing vote" position and ostensibly want from Sweden (to give up Kurds that Sweden has been sheltering), however they also have lonerm interests in Russia (as a balance to the West, economic, military etc).
If Turkeys plan is to be in NATO to sabotage any chances of countries that Russia wants from getting in then we just need to kick Turkey out of NATO and proceed with getting Sweden and Finland into NATO.
Why keep a power in NATO thatâ€™s working on behalf of Russia to sabotage the protection of countries coming into NATO?
This shit seems all to convenient for both Russia in sowing discord within NATO countries, and for Turkey's domestic elections.
Turkey at the time was a lot weaker than Russia, its dictator comes to US his foreign thugs best the crap out of several US citizens in US soil. On video.
So I can see why someone would chose this particular case as the weakest time of the US. Yours was to and you are probably right.
