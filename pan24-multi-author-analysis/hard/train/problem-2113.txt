"I also fixed his campaign, which had completely fallen apart. I was all in for Ron, and he beat Gillum, but after the Race, when votes were being stolen by the corrupt Election process in Broward County, and Ron was going down ten thousand votes a day, along with now-Senator Rick Scott, I sent in the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys, and the ballot theft immediately ended, just prior to them running out of the votes necessary to win. I stopped his Election from being stolen.".
Man... I have no proof for this, it's only a feeling, but I tend to think Trump and his lackeys fucked with the 2020 election a LOT more than has ever been alleged. Usually when Trump accuses someone of doing something, it's something he himself is doing.
I think we should take a moment as a country to contemplate the fact that Trump now just openly and overtly admits to specific crimes and we all just shrug and say “oh well, it’s only Trump”.
To think that we've reached the point where Trump thinks boasting about crimes he didn't even commit will get him more praise and attention than boasting about how rich he definitely is.
