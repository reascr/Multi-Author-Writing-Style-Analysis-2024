And I'm also not saying the cost of living is the same between any of these places. People making more money in the US are not coming to "live like a king" but that the availability of (for example) jobs in software that pay $200k+ is significantly higher in San Francisco than it is in any other city in the world. Shoot, you just said the median salary in the UK is 30k. That's equivalent to $37k in USD compared to the . Yeah, making $77k in San Francisco is not going to give you a luxurious lifestyle, but I'm trying my damnedest to agree with your statement about why an American thinks $20k is nothing and you, a Brit, think 20k "is good" in your words.
Yeah 43k in Sydney isn't the same as 43k in London, but also no rational person would be making that comparison because 43k in AUD is 24.5k in GBP.

This is mostly a myth, salaries might be slightly higher but its not high enough that you're suddenly living like a king.
Oh look, another bad take. It's nothing to do with conversation rate. I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make here, 18k is about the minimum wage in the UK. So its still not the same as what you get in Sydney.
