I think programs like this are way better than UBI, there is no reason for the income to not be means tested on some level. No reason for Bill Gates and a homeless single mother of 2 to receive the same amount of help from the government.
UBI, just seems like a poor policy compared to almost anything else we could do. Unless it's specifically a UBI that leaves existing welfare mostly unchanged, which I would be fine with.
Doing things like free universal health care, free higher education, expanding EITC to cover most of middle income America, tax credits for child care, etc. These would be more effective programs over UBI.
I think programs like this are good, even if they’re just baby steps towards UBI. But it’s saddening to think how little $1K/mo is. That amount might help you keep housing if you’re struggling, or help you get housing if you have other resources you can add it to, but it can’t take someone who is homeless and put them in housing. And once you’re homeless, I’m sure there are all kinds of money sinks that will drain that $1k away much faster than if you already had housing.
