What does it matter if the passwords are salted using a master password? The only thing they get is a useless hash. No idea why all these comments are raving about how password managers are bad. They are perfectly fine so long as you have a long, powerful master password as is required for using things like LastPass.
Edit: Misunderstood you. Maybe? If you meant the individual passwords- The individual passwords are encrypted, yes, not hashed, but the master password is hashed, not encrypted, and the encryption is secured using the master password which is hashed. So if you forget your master password, all passwords are lost.
That said, you're not wrong that if you have a half-decent password that's not reused then you're pretty secure.
It's not like your usual login where password recovery simply means replacing your hashed password with a new hashed password. Replacing the hashed master password is useless if the old password wasn't used to decrypt the vault first.
If they fail the solution shouldn’t be “make a new/stronger password” or “don’t use cloud password managers” it should be something else entirely.
No, I mean literally, if your master password is hunter2 and they got your cloud vault, they still wouldn't be able to unlock it. The security comes from the master password + the secret key, which the user can't make shit if they try & 1P never knows.
Like it shouldn’t be up to us to find the safest way to secure our passwords. We’re not not multimillion dollar companies with vast resources and employees, they should be working on a new solution, similar to the google authenticator app or Apple Pay where each login interaction is unique.
