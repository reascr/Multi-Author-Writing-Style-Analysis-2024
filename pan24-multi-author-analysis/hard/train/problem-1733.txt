All these latest events have proven is that the Cold War is back on the table. This time, the proxies of the East are effectively gone from the equation.
Realistically speaking, being that the Cold War was simply a bunch of smaller proxy wars between communism (China and russia) versus the west, the Ukraine war is technically an extension of the Cold War. Russia props the war up as a proxy battle by fighting on behalf of the separatist regions, but what it is is the final battle that eroded the Cold War proxies to the source of the scourge. Just because the USSR dissolved doesn't mean that the Cold War ended. If anything, the Cold War went on ice after the downfall of the USSR and Putin decided to rekindle that fire.
Had Putin been successful with Ukraine, we'd be seeing a new threat to Thaiwan by China, which again comes back to similar logic as this potentially being an extension of the Cold War.
Scholz: "Hey, I'd be up for all of us working together and to not divide the world in spheres of influence, but China and Russia are a threat to that. The west must work together more closely and stand up for freedom and democracy".
