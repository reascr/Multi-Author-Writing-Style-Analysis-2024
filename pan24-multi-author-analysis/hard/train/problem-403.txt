That’s kinda been their MO when it comes to war fighting. They throw a huge percentage of their male population at the war, lose a major portion of that percentage, and then are more or less screwed for 40-50 years as their workforce has to be birthed and live long enough to become “usable”.
Except 100s of thousands of men of reproductive age dead and million emigrating is going to accelerate that. The crises was 25 years off. It’s going to be sooner because of this war.
Most of their population growth is in the south eastern republics although that’s were many of their soldiers have come from until now. Regardless, most of the emigration has been from western Russian cities. So in addition to population loss, you get demographic shifts.
Yeah like 100k-200k dead and wounded men of reproductive age plus the million they lost to covid and the million that emigrated since the war started.
I lived in Paraguay in the early 2000s and I believe that the country is still feeling the effects of that demographic shift caused by the death of so many men in such a brutal war.
> Roughly two-thirds of Paraguay’s population perished during the conflict, including around 90% of its men. Brazil and Argentina would go on to annex enormous swaths of Paraguayan territory.
