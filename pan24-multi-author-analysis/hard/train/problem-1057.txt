I remember in the late 80s bookstores with any kind of Media Criticism section had a shelf groaning with books about the coming News Apocalypse. The news was fake for nearly 25 years before Trump announced that any media criticizing him was “fake news.” Typically, conservatives will take 25 years to get on board with changing circumstances - once their misinterpretation of the consequences will fit on a bumper sticker.
MSNBC carrying water for "mainstream" Republicans and trying to pretend that Trump and Santos are things that happened to the Republicans and not the result of several decades of conservatism...
As someone who was forced to watch the Rush Limbaugh tv show, I can tell you for a fact that blatant and obvious lies were acceptable to Republicans long before Trump got involved in politics.
Trump absolutely was a follower, not a leader, and he smartly learned in the primaries that just repeating Limbaugh talking points and validating his base was all they really wanted. He just had to ride the wave.
Carlos has likely done a few “offscreen” loyalty tests at this point, it isn’t like he’s winging things this loosely, it’s absolutely in coordination with “The Third Right”.
It’s sad, I used to think “At least there’s probably virtuous and good wealthy billionaires who can counter the bad ones”, but now I’ve finally accepted that anyone who reaches this kind of status has to be a sociopath of some kind. Rupert Murdock has only increasingly succeeded with his propaganda machine, and the other media moguls instead have pivoted to “how can we get in on that action”. They will not save us from their own greed.
