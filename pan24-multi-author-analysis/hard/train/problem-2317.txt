It’s actually about oil … China is just a player … the real movers are not the governments either it is the oil companies involved here … Venezuela oil politics are way way above anything we can comprehend.
Venezuela has been on the shit list of the US since 1976 when Venezuela nationalized the oil sector … The oil companies (namely Chevron) went all holy war on anything Venezuela since. They are the big reason Venezuela went to hell in a hand basket. But now US need Venezuela and they sure look better than Saudis and Russia to work with … Also if Venezuela economy can get turned around US could reduce the 2nd largest group of illegal immigrants coming into the US. Venezuela should be one of the richest countries in world ….
And yes, Venezuela is HEAVY oil which the US is by far the top refiner of. Even if US gasoline/diesel consumption craters in the next few decades, those gulf coast refineries will stay open and export refined product. Its quite feasible the US could dominate the refined fuel export market in the future. lot of locations in developing countries will require diesel for their small generators/construction vehicles to supplement solar.
Venezuela is badly in need in help with their oil industry. If i were Chevron though I'd be asking for payment up front (US might agree to unfreeze some of their assets and those go directly to Chevron).
If this works out it will help a LOT of people in poverty in Venezuela by helping them have more money for food imports.
Yeah, the people here thinking this money will go toward solving the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela are delusional. This money is going straight into the pockets of corrupt politicians and oligarchs. The Venezuelan government has repeatedly proven that they don't give a fuck about the suffering of the Venezuelan people.
