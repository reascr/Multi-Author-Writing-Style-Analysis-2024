This isn't possible. Churches, especially in the South where I'm familiar with, are nothing more than mandatory right-wing community meetings with Christian window dressing. One time I attended a church in Pascagoula, MS with a former friend and I kid you not it was like watching a 1hr speech prepared by Fox News opinion writers where they spoke out against immigrants, atheists, and the evil Democrats. I went to several churches with this person (they were in the choir) and it was the same every time.
The people here, this kind of congregation for example, are bombarded with scary stories from right-wing media constantly. They listen to it on their drive to work (the 1 radio station in the state has a morning show that is very right-wing), they talk about it with their co-workers during the day, they listen to it on their drive home, they watch it on the TV over dinner, and at night they read about it on their phone before they fall asleep.
I'm not sure how you reach out to that. Without aggressive, questionable, measures I don't think there is a way. They are programmed to hate Democrats and liberals no matter what. They don't see Democrats and liberals as "people" even. Just the "enemy". An enemy they are convinced they are at war with.
They are nice to you. They are probably not nice to another set of people. In 2016 I learned a lot of the people I grew up with that I thought were good people ended up being extremely shitty people once Trump was elected. Turns out they were only good to me and because I was like them - I fit in the "good" container in their minds so I wasn't in the "bad" container that had the same people Trump wanted to attack. They also did not know I was atheist or Democrat.
Hell, I'm an atheist and I feel closer to christ than I did as a christian. I do good things because I feel that's what I should do, not because I'm trying to show out for some other fake-ass bible thumpers. If there's a God, she'll know us by our deeds not our words.
