It not just one day. They can continue to attack it. Not even sure how to protect the workers that try and repair.
I am not sure how this is not considered serious war crimes at the same level as intentionally attacking civilian centers.
Attacks on nuclear plants or dams (that risk releasing radioactivity/floods) and directly kill countless civilians would be a war crime.
(who presumably should know but also has a political reason to lie) called them a war crime, but lists many Western military manuals considering power stations valid military targets.
Some targets are clearly legitimate, including all military personnel directly engaging in hostilities on behalf of a belligerent party who are not hors de combat or are not members of a neutral country.[2] Some civilian infrastructure, such as rail tracks, roads, ports, airports, and telecommunications used by the military for communications or transporting assets, are all considered to be legitimate military targets.[2].
1. Civilian objects shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals. Civilian objects are all objects which are not military objectives as defined in paragraph 2.
3. In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.
