That’s not just true. Mainstream progressive politicians in the US (AOC, Sanders, etc.) would not be considered “conservative” in Germany. He wouldn’t be on the far left in Europe, sure - and some of his policies are supported or implemented by some European countries, but his agenda as a whole would not be considered conservative by any European country’s standards. And the same goes for many other progressive US politicians.
A candidate like Obama or Biden might absolutely fall under the CDU’s platform more than any other, but to say that US leftists wouldn’t even crack the center or center-left in Germany or in the EU at large is just objectively and provably false.
I often see this thrown around and I think the most accurate comparison is that the Dems would essentially include most of the CDU and SPD ideologically, while the Republicans would have the right of the CDU, right of the FDP, and the AfD. Most of the CDU would be equivalent to Clinton Democrats or maybe New England Republicans.
The CDU is sort of like Mitt Romney or probably more accurate Eisenhower kinds of Republicans. The SPD is sort of like Bill Clinton. That is center left and center right. It is true the AFD is the hardest right party in Germany but the analogy to the totality of Republicans is unfair even if there are a lot of assholes.
It would be less wildly inaccurate to say what is the AFD in Germany is the hard right edge of the Republican party if it is in a major party at all. The most extreme people aren't in any party though it has gotten worse to be sure.
