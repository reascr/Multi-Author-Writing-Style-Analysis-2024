Here's an idea: don't bail them out. Intervening in the marketplace ruins the concept of capitalism. Especially if the intervention is to keep a business afloat (airline industry) or to protect them from foreign competition (baby formula). Protect the organization of labor, yes, and protect worker rights, safety, etc., but leave it at that.
Back on the original subject, we shouldn't bail out any business. If a certain industry proves to not be profitable enough for the private sector to manage and it is deemed essential, then and only then should we attempt to nationalize it.
He should have threatened to nationalize the whole industry and proposed taxing the rail billionaires huge percentages of their wealth to help pay for retrofitting a system that they neglected for decades in an effort to improve their profits.
Yes, he should have let the strike happen and joined them on the fucking picket line. He should have called for other unions to strike in solidarity until the very reasonable demands of the rail workers were met.
It needs to be said that the choice democrats made was the economy and a plan supported by eight railroad unions versus the demands of 4 railroad unions. The democrats chose “the economy” and let the demands of the four rail union fail. The democrats are not blameless in this situation; They knew very well they were abandoning the demands of 4 railroad unions. The performative vote for the sick time bill was obvious.
