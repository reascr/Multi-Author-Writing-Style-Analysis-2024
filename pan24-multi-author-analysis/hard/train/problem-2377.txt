Russia is choosing to destroy Ukrainian Infrastructure. Russia is choosing to send human waves into the meat grinder. Why is the obligation on Ukraine to surrender but not on Russia to stop their invasion?
The West doesn't need to try to destroy Russia. Russia is doing an excellent job from their own actions.
The West didn't turn Russia into a Fascist kleptocracy. The West didn't force Russia to bleed out it's own military through corruption. The West didn't force Russia to mobilize 300k recruits only to throw them away into a meat grinder.
Finish the meat grinder, end of war maybe, Russia doesn't care to qonquer, care to be safe. Ukraina is destroyed by elite warmongers, we wish to be the last fight. Focus on WORLD Prosperity and not for a few pockets.
Your last paragraph will clear up sooner(end of war) than all the scheme of West to destroy Russia and feast on the riches. Is childish now to talk geopolitics, after all the attempts every century to destroy Russia, learn something, Russia is in the blood veins of this earth, it affects us all, we can't stab our own body, it's a sin, a mistake, only paranoids and sick greedy entities do this, don't be a part at least.
Because Russia was patience 9 years and warned with all hands and feet, even zelenski back then was seeking peace and signed Minsk agreements, but nazi regime in Ukraine didn't stop shelling and killing civilians, what did you expect?
