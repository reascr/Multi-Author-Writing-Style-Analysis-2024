It's like, why did DeSantis pay over half million dollars for plane tickets that shouldn't have cost now than 30k.
So in short, the court knew what it was doing was wrong, and, because it's all they know, did something else wrong to try to pressure others in their party to choose something less wrong.... That tracks...
4 is the only possibility I can possibly believe, but as I said before, justices do _not_ want to have the appearance that public outrage / pressure can change their legal opinions. If the supreme court changed their ruling after the leak due to public pressure, then it would open the floodgates because they'd be proving that they will bow to public pressure. The only sensible move (and the move they took) was to stick by the draft ruling.
Someone in favour of abortion rights has _no_ interest in leaking the opinion, I guarantee to you that the leak is on the anti-abortion side.
In other words, they donâ€™t actually give a shit about abortion, and are using it to advance their own self interests while hurting the average voter.
