That’s if we aren’t pretending you aren’t trying to make some context free political statement that these dudes could simply opt out of civilian conscription and crossing into Ukraine.
This mobilization hasn’t even taken place yet therefore none of what you’ve described has actually happened - they are in fact presently civilians.
It directly states conscription or ‘drafting’ and even contrasts it against a previous statement that outlined the need for conscription was redundant given how many men with previous service history (non-conscripts/veterans) could be utilized instead. They even outline the industrial and residential areas that they’re going to pool conscripts from for mandatory service.
They are presently civilians (because this hasn’t happened yet), they will be (future tense) killed by a Lockheed Martin product.
Pray tell, just what is the point of BourboneAFCV's original comment, that spawned this chain and your vehement defense, if it is not to disingenously imply that Lockheed Martin will soon be killing civilians?
