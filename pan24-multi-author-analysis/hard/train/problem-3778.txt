It is the usual expression in Turkish: "1915 olayları". Everybody uses it but obviously not for the same reasons and not with the same motives.
Because Erdoğan has demanded that it be the official name at the UN and for diplomatic matters. The English name is still "Turkey" but people who think that that makes them look smart use "Türkiye" now even though they shouldn't. Erdoğan and the Turkish people certainly wouldn't use "The United States of America" when speaking in their own language if Biden made the same demand at the UN. Actually, no Turkish people uses "Türkiye" when speaking in English, they're 100% aware how cringe it would sound. Reason for that demand from Erdoğan: "I'm a strong leader See I can force them to say "Türkiye" ".
Every case is different. In the present case there's no name change, Türkiye has always been called Türkiye in Turkish and is still called Turkey in English. If you make a speech in front of the UN or are a diplomat, you're supposed to use Türkiye now but honestly I have no idea how respected or enforced this official change is.
Some of us, like myself up til the last couple comments, would have perceived it as being more courteous to any turks we might speak to, since we're not aware of the domestic opinions on the name change. However, I'm glad to hear it, because typing "türkiye" sucks. I don't even know how to make a umlaut.
