I think if someone invented a satellite that doesn't need cables for interwebz stuff it could be a game changer ðŸ˜‰.
If what he mentioned is the main behaviors then even if we got rid of cables that doesn't prevent satellites etc. Sure they'd be "slower" but if all one has to do is connect to set it off there's not really much need for a fast connection. As for bot networks with DDOS, I doubt they need a fast connection to set off the attack either.
If they outsource the hacks or send their hackers elsewhere in the world then cutting the cable isn't going to work. That doesn't even get into how easy it would be to reroute the traffic to another location that isn't "cut off", they could just reroute through China if they wanted to. China being their ally they could just use the cables that run there. To stop the hacking it would require people to actually follow the best practices for IT security and let's be honest here, the vast majority of people don't and it only takes one mistake to leave your network open.
My brother says that ransomware and state sponsored infiltrations for the most part are the most common forms these days. Is that what you're seeing as well? (He's also in cybersecurity).
I am not surprised at all. Considering how interconnected everyone is there really isn't a way to "cut Russia off".
