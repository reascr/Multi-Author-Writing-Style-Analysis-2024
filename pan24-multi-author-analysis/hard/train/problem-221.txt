His whole fit on Twitter yesterday was 100% designed to rile up the MAGA base. Just in time for elections.
The issue is after the election. Who gets verified on twitter as your senator or representative of after Election Day if the candidate who didn’t actually win claims they did?
Any politician who was relying on Twitter to win them the mid-terms wouldn't be waiting until the week of the election to get verified.
If they stop verifying politicians this close to an election it won’t matter. If they verified people erroneously it won’t matter. We are too close for it to matter.
If you are waiting until the weekend before elections to establish your online presence you probably shouldn’t be a politician.
So in theory more politicians could be verified because they may relax qualifications to meet demand with a smaller team.
Trump was on Twitter in 2020 as the current president, but I know you meant 2021. It didn’t matter if Trump was on Twitter or not. Every message he wanted to spread was spread by mainstream media. More widely than Trump could spread it on his own.
