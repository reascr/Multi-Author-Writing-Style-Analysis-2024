Yes, Ukraine only has enough troops to attack on one front. And, everybody knows it will be to try to retake Kherson. Russia quickly moves more troops and equipment to defend Kherson. Suprise! Two weeks later Izium is liberated.
For everybody speculating about what may have hit Engels base, or capabilities of the new 1000km Ukrainian drone, keep in mind that the KH-101/KH-102 missiles were powered by single 400 kgf Ukrainian-made, Motor Sich JSC R95-300 turbofan engine.
Cant wait to see the crybabies on Russia TV say its unfair when Ukrainians start to fly the 1000km+ Drones all over Russia to take out energy infrastructure and military equipment.
Wait i heard Ukraine had over hundred S-300 systems at the start of the war (and didn't lost significant amount either), does Russia really has less than UA?
Russia was also building newer systems (up to mysterious S-500 which is claimed to reach space...) but they are of high-value and rarely used on the battlefield Ukraine claims a couple of S-400, we will know after the war how many were lost and left.
I do not think that many Ukrainian S-300 systems were in good shape before the war - you need parts from russia where they were produced but after 2014 that was absolutely impossible. Number of suitable missiles is even more improtant and 8000 is the number which circulates. I do not think that Ukraine had anything close. Please do not forget that Ukraine was a relatively poor country before the war. Keeping such systems in operational readiness is very expensive.
