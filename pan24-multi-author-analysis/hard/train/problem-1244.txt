Even if India and China vote against Russia it will work against them in the long run since Russian Economy will stand back up again after 10 years.
Blaming russia won't stop the war, Yes India has condemned Russia in during events like the Bucha Massacre and Modi's message to Putin "This is not an era of war".
Russia has a abundance of natural resources which makes Russia self sufficient and also helps Russia to sustain the 2nd Most Powerful military, so if India and China who get Military Equipment from Russia at cheap price.
Blaming Russia will show Russia has no friends but when they have India and China with 40% of the worlds population defending them either directly or indirectly, Russia feels more empowered. If China and India agreed to sanction Russia, it would be over for Russia.
India has been propping up Russian war efforts by buying Russian oil. This canâ€™t possibly be related. That was sarcasm, you morons. I hope you learn to understand reality and that a statement can be sarcastic.
