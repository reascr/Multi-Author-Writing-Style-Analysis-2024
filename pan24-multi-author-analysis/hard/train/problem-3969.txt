It's the internet, usually lowest common denominator gets upvoted fast. Repeating a joke means there's not even an attempt at trying to be funny or clever because you are guaranteed "success" and people crave attention.
There's literally no point in trying to argue against it and, honestly, arguing against it can be as nonsensical as the thing you are complaining about.
By whining about it and shitting on it, you're taking all that away from them because you're annoyed by the repetition of it without ever understanding or caring about it's actual purpose.
It's not nessesary to inject further negativity or involve yourself in any way if you don't like it. It's only a problem for you because you've taken it upon yourself to make it your problem.
When we start being complacent, keeping silent about obvious wrong doings, not making these stupid "jokes," it allows idiots like Kanye and Musk to spread their ridiculous opinions with an even louder contrasting voice, leading to things like promoting fucking Nazis and people being ok with government sponsored murder.
The grim reality is this guy (like many, many others) will probably face mortal peril from his government because of his outspoken criticism of their methods.
