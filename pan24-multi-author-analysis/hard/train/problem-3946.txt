Seems like the democrats had that same reaction every election for a couple decades too. And they always shocked Pikachu face when a more progressive candidate was popular. Glad that's kind of turning around.
Well, more that the establishment democrats have been doing the 'move toward the center to attract conservative votes' thing, but the center has been moving further and further right.
I understand why you’d take the other interpretation, but closely reading the last two sentences of the post seems to make it clear that they’re saying progressive candidates are more popular in spite of the establishment belief in both parties that they need to hug the middle or right.
I offered an explanation to someone replying to you, but please correct me if I’m the one who’s wrong. I’m pretty sure that you’re saying establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats both think that voters want more conservatism, when the opposite is true.
I think that the person you’re replying to meant that Democrats have been saying candidates weren’t “conservative” enough, literally exactly the same as the Republicans. It doesn’t seem like they were saying Democrats were doing the ‘equivalent’ of the same thing on their side of things within their end of the political spectrum, and picking a bunch of Bernies and AOCs in their primaries ... rather, they’re saying Democrats were completely MATCHING the push to the right, both parties in the same direction.
I’d have to agree with that. Older democrats think the country is way more conservative than it is, and keep pushing the blue dog types on us.
Apparently the Republicans want to save America by making sure 2024 is an absolute blue wave for the Democrats. Or they’re absolute morons who are lost in their own bubble of misinformation.
