And oh yeah, Americans are stupid, and the presidential election outcome is reliant on a hand out to slave owners.
Electoral college, the slave state device for keeping minority in power, can be gotten rid of with 2/3 vote.
Especially true since the Electoral College was a device created by the slave states to preserver slavery from popular vote.
It determines who is the democratic winner of the election. It determines legitimacy in a democratic republic. If the popular vote doesn't win the election it calls into question the nation's democracy.
If overall turnout wasn't so depressing this would be a decent argument even with the electoral college in place, but that isn't the world we live in.
Paying attention to national popular vote numbers when the campaigns are focused on the electoral college is folly. If the national popular vote mattered, Democrats and Republicans would push for higher turnout in all their safe states instead of focusing on the swing states, and the national popular vote numbers would look entirely different.
But it isn't based on the national popular vote, which is where that 3,000,000 number comes from, it's from a bunch of separate state-level popular votes. We can argue that the electoral college is unfair (no argument here), but our system of government is based on established laws and those say that Trump was the legitimate winner of the 2016 election. Yes it was a disaster and yes we as voters should do better selecting our government officials, but until we live in that world, or voter turnout isn't so dismal, thinking that the national numbers tell us anything meaningful is a mistake. The national numbers are the result of campaigns that don't care about the national numbers.
