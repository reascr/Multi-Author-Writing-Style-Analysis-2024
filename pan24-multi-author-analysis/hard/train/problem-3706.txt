He was probably forced to lie that he had been kidnapped as he was most likely a part of POWs 45 for 45 exchange that happened the same day. Russian POWs donâ€™t just walk freely on Kyiv streets ready to be kidnapped. Ukraine has not officially commented this so far, but if he was in fact exchanged against his will (which Zelensky promised would not be happening) after he already stated he wanted to fight against russia - this is a huge mistake on Ukrainian part and will reduce the level of trust and desire to surrender.

Don't take it personally, but you're a party involved into the war and im beyond giving benefit of doubt at this point.
And that he was (probably) forced into the exchange. So you're implying that he wasn't accepted into Ukr army (or any pow switching sides program) and he was kicked back to mommy Wagner instead.
