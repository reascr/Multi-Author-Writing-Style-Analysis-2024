No, most people just have an own interest in voting VVD. Especially if they are a “ZZP’er”. Most people in the Netherlands vote for themselves, not for others.
The average Dutch voter has no idea what they're voting for. "Oh this Rutte guy looks friendly and smiles all the time, surely he'd make a good PM." or "I've always voted VVD, I'll just do the same this year.".
Besides. Lots of things that western companies make for CIS countries are not actually imported but made locally. More often than not, in Russia. And if the company decides to pull out, they can't take their production lines from Russia. They'd have to sell it to a Russian company that would just keep making the same product under the different brand.
Which, in the long run, actually helps Russian economy, which replaces imports with domestic products. As well as Chinses economy, which still abides by sanctions but has loopholes around them and doesn't care about all the boycotting.
Russian government thrives on it actually. Who do you think all the business in Russia belongs to? Instead of buying high quality goods from European companies (who would pay small income tax to Russian government and then transfer all of the income back to their European bank accounts) Russians will now buy low quality goods for about the same price but all the money will remain in Russia. Or go to China in case of Chinese goods.
