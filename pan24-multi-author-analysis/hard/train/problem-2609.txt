Yes, my wife has had three children. Had we not miraculously got the medical attention we needed seemingly by chance for the last one, there was a good chance both mother and baby would be dead (a chance comment during a routine appointment made the doctor do an ultrasound, revealing a placental abruption, requiring an immediate caesarian - otherwise baby and possibly mother would die).
Yep - my wife's had three kids. First one was a 38-hour labour. Second was relatively straightforward by comparison. Third was an emergency caesarian - had a complication (placental abruption) not been caught, seemingly by chance, both baby and mother could well be dead.
I'm sure all those who didn't want the girl to abort her pregnancy, which was inflicted on her against her will, will be more than willing to take the child off her and give it the very best upbringing while asking nothing in return...
How the actual fuck do you refuse a termination of pregnancy to a disabled child who was raped and is clearly unable to care for herself, and then site the CONSCIENCE clause?
Did they ever let those Ukrainian women carrying Russian rapist babies get abortions or did they continue to help the rapists by forcing the victims to carry their babies?
Well even now after further restriction of access to abortion in Poland rape and health risk or life risk of the mother are legitimate causes for fully legal abortion in Poland. Doctor who refused to execute the procedure should be prosecuted for the failure to comply with their professional obligations as a doctor.
Yes but it is as it was before. I forgot that doctors can refuse and base the refusal on so called "conscience clause". However in this case doctor must delegate the patient to another doctor willing to execute the procedure which they did because patient aborted the fetus in another clinic.
