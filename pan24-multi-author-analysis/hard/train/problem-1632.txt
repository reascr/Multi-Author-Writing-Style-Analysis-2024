Not really. If you had nothing really on the line at the start and get into a nuclear conflict it doesn't even matter who is at fault. You went from being fine to everyone involved losing.
The idea is not to get yourself wiped out if you can avoid it. The line countries seem to have decided for that is not directly attacking Russia because they've decided spinning those dice is not worth the risk given how fast everything could spin out of control.
The reason for the "treading thin ice around Russia" is they have nuclear weapons and western countries know that. If they didn't NATO would most likely already be in Ukraine.
Wouldn't you want to be proud of being first to stand up to Russia with a big fuck you and supporting Ukraine? I know it's logistically more difficult than that, but stop pussy footing around Russia - they're already exposed for what they are. Decide now, or later isn't going to change what Russia may or may not do.
I seem calculating and cold but i think we hold Back so russia gets grinded down slowky and not stompt in in go. So they Lack the will and Power to lauch atomik or further attaks in general.
