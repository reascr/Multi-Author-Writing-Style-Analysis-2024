Nope. Not the same. Let me help you understand. One person knowingly shoplifted items from the store and tried to deny it and refused to give them back when ordered to. The other accidentally walked out with sunglasses on their head, forgetting they were up there and turned around and went back in the store to pay for them, once they realized their mistake.
For all the Bitching about her Emails and going after Biden for this, doesn't excuse Trump for knowingly partaking in something he knew damn well he wasn't supposed to be doing and when asked nicely, flat out refused to do the right thing.
Now Republicans and MAGA would doublespeak and excuse him anyway, but there are plenty of uninformed yahoo's out there who will look at this and say "oh, guess Biden did the same thing.".
While not as brazen and obstructive as Trump's document fiasco, Biden's will ensure that Republicans and MAGA have an out to excuse Trump from doing a more egregious version of what they said Hillary should be jailed for doing.
I leave room for the possibility that it was not Bidens error and you see that as confirmation that it wasn't?
