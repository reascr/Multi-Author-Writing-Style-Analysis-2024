I love that the debate in Canada is always about doing more. Even the political opposition criticizes that Canada should do more. Nobody worth mentioning saying less.
I'm not talking about Doug and his henchmen, although I must add that they're awful autocrat wannabes with many similar behaviours to those invading Ukraine. Like the right to protest their work conditions that was revoked by "decree." My comment was on the topic of the news article by OP. The debate in Canada with respect to Canada's actions in support of Ukraine are about doing more.
Since the recent war, other countries are taking more Ukrainians than Canada, so the global Ukrainian diaspora is in major flux.
In total, it's 10% of Canadians are of some portion Ukrainian descent now, which in a country with as many ethnicities as us, makes Ukrainian a major ethnic group.
You are correct about the largest Ukrainian diaspora in the world being in Canada. Before the war, Canada was on its 7th or 8th wave of Ukrainian immigration. We're one of the few countries in the world that has been consistently open to Ukrainian immigrants, they had very hard time immigrating elsewhere.
A huge number of Canadians are of Ukrainian descent (I think itâ€™s the highest number outside of Ukraine and Russia), and plenty still have close ties to Ukrainian culture. I can see a lot of people going for this.
