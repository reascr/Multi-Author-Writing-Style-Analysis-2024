I was born in the USSR and live in a country that was occupied by russians, so i have many personal anecdotes with average russians. I also occasionally watch russian state tv which constantly hammers the message into those same average russians that me and my countrymen are untermenschen who should live at their mercy. This is also the reason why a large part of russians living here have not and will not learn the local language - it is simply beneath them. The fact that they are victims of brainwashing is irrelevant. Germans were also brainwashed before WW2, it was no excuse to their actions.
What happened after WW1 pushed rhe Germans in the arms of Hitler because they had no hope and nothing to lose anymore.
Unfortunately future is dark when present is ruled be fools like in Korea, Afghanistan, Syria, IsraÃ«l,... and even in US during Trump.
The only way after Ukrainian victory il to educate people and take examples on what was done with Japan and Germany after WW2.
But I believe that let Russian people in misery would probably push them in the arms of another dictator like Germans after WW1.
