SCOTUS can also occasionally say that previous justices got it so wrong they have to revisit a decision. It’s helped in overturning cases like Plessy v. Ferguson, but what we’re seeing now is that flexibility being weaponized to rewrite precedent to backstop conservative policies instead of to right a major wrong (conservatives will tell you that’s exactly what they’re hoping for with “religious freedom” decisions, but the “injustice” they’re fighting is that they feel discrimination should be legalized, sanctioned, and even institutionalized).
The joys of stare decisis- a lot of what’s “the law” isn’t actually in statute text, it’s what previous judges and justices already decided in similar cases. And when they can’t find either of those, that’s when SCOTUS is supposed to step in and have the job of actually interpreting the US Constitution.
If this is an organization created by the Legislative branch wouldn’t it be legal by that sole fact, and thus negating the need for this to be ruled on by SCOTUS? I don’t understand.
That’s why I am asking. I have a perception, but this isn’t something I understand. It gets muddled by other perceptions and opinions. It difficult to just assume that all cases that reach SCOTUS have merit. I also have an assumption that the legality is researched upon creation, but that means little either way. 😩 it’s also obfuscated by partisan goals.
