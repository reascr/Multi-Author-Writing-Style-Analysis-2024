Btw, if people are fine with calling this traitor and should be punished, then shouldn't what China does to its citizen whom it deemed to be traitors (corrupted politician, defector, spy, etc) acceptable.
No need to include "for money" - "People that do this should be considered as traitors" is fine by me. Not only do these pilots get money, but they are likely provided lots of other comforts in order to get more info out of them. Honey traps are common tools.
Imagine if a Chinese pilot defected or provided these trainings to Australia - the reaction of the Chinese government would a secret massive hunt including repercussions to the pilot's family.
What the contract says and what the pilots actually have to do could be different things in China where such contracts are just mere paper. It would be good to hear the pilots' experiences, if they ever return.
Is it on only pilots we worry about here? If an infrantryman went to China to train their soldiers is that also bad? Doctors? Naval officers? Just curious as to where we draw our lines.
Ok let's keep going, if we are in a cold war then you would agree that corporate secrets and such are also a big concern (Nortel) so perhaps the next step is to make it illegal to conduct business in China at all. I mean if we do allow Chinese business people into Canada or vise versa, Canadians might pass off vital secrets.
