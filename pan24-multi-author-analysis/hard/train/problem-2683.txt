I am not American I am as fit as a fiddle and worked my life in construction. I want all countries to bring back manufacturing to their individual countries. Supply chains are broken and basically China now is holding world to ransom.
It’s not cheap also like it was in the first place to manufacture in China wages for the Chinese people have been rising very fast. I don’t begrudge the people of China a better standard of living. But it’s time people manufactured in their own countries.
Getting other countries up to scale to supply global manufacturing demands will take way more time than we have.
The really big issue with that is that even when you bring your manufacturing ops domestic, all of the feedstocks are still sourced in China, so you're hosed either way.
Everyone complaining about putting too much reliance on China for manufacturing but nobody wants to do anything about fixing the supply chain, at the same time enjoying the low cost goods coming out from China. If things were manufactured locally you'd probably only able to afford like 5 items for your whole house.
