“The complete collapse of the Thwaites itself could lead to sea level rise of more than two feet (70 centimeters), which would be enough to devastate coastal communities around the world. But the Thwaites is also acting like a natural dam to the surrounding ice in West Antarctica, and scientists have estimated global sea level could ultimately rise around 10 feet if the Thwaites collapsed.”.
>“A 2021 study found the ice shelf could shatter within the next five years, and last year scientists said the Thwaites Glacier is hanging on "by its fingernails" as the planet warms, with the potential for rapid retreat in the coming years”.
“While it could take hundreds or thousands of years, the ice shelf could disintegrate much sooner, triggering a retreat of the glacier which is both unstable and potentially irreversible.”.
So melting will probably take a very long time (century timescale) while a progressive collapse might happen much sooner (years to decades).
Then we get to see what the effects on ocean salinity are and how much the newly exposed land contributes to global warming.
I think the fear is that once Thwaites is gone it's no longer supporting these half mile high walls of ice from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The physics of ice, as we've modeled it, indicates that this wall of ice will collapse, which exposes a new wall which collapses, exposing a new wall, etc.
