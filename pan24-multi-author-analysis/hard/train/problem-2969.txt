I’ll believe it when I see it. Republicans follow the “hastert” rule, which means no legislation gets a vote without the “majority of the majority”.
That means even if a few house republicans want to pursue legislation with democrats, they will be blocked by the house speaker following a bullshit rule put in place by a Republican pedophile.
The house is going to spend the next couple years doing nothing except searching for Hunter Biden’s laptop. Also, I haven’t seen a centrist Republican in a very long time.
I would love to be wrong, but this is how every Republican house has worked for literally two decades. The Republican speaker will not allow a vote on a bill that might get minority Republican support. This ensures their house is only passing party-line bills, and kills bipartisanship when republicans are in control.
This is why a bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013 was never brought up for a vote in the house, because John Boehner use the Hastert rule to prevent the bill from coming to a vote. This is even though it would’ve passed with bipartisan support. This is how Republicans operate, and by the way the Hastert rule is named after a convicted child molester.
