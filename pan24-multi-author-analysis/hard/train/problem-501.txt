Re-electability is the fall back argument a candidate's opponents will use because they don't have a real argument against them. As far as I'm concerned, there is only one drawback to Biden round 2, and that is his age. Until I see signs that his age is affecting his ability to do the job, that isn't a good enough reason to oppose him seeking a second term.
I voted for Biden the first time to get rid of Trump. I'll vote for him again because he has been an effective president, and his policies shifted leftwards more than even my most optimistic hope for him.
In any case, I'd be happy to vote for any other younger Democratic candidate who will get more votes.
From the people who say they want somebody younger as president being met with your "oh so you think DeSantis would be better?", to this exact comment where they mention a more progressive democrat instead of Biden and you go ahead and say "yeah, Trump would've made it way worse".
Biden was always going to run for a second term, and as far as I know he has never said otherwise. The most he's done is not publicly commit. I personally think this was a strategy to manage an overheated media.
From what I can see, Biden's already either a) shown he gets more votes than those candidates by defeating them in the 2020 primary, or b) they have already said they're not running in 2024.
