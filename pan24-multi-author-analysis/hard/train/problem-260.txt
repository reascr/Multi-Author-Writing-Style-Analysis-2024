Well… they get to see how long it took us to notice them. Also, just because we aren’t sure what this thing can do doesn’t mean we take their word for it that it’s nothing. Their batshit response doesn’t suggest it’s nothing. I hope we recover useful bits from the downed balloon.
Edit: I am not making conclusions about how long or not long it took us to notice. Only saying that might be a motivation for this weird Chinese balloon shenanigans.
China: Launches strange balloon, admits it got away from them. Urges calm when the story hits US media, claims it's a weather satellite only.
US: Waits days, then shoots it down (according to China, a weather balloon) after it passes over the ocean out of an abundance of caution and being fully within its rights to do so.
Right wing media in general was at a fevered pitch over this. Radio was just as bad, they ran with it all day I assume based on what I heard since they did more than one rolling update during the part of the program I listened to and it was just nonstop "this is a travesty, we should have shot this down immediately, Biden is a weak president, no one fears us, etc...".
