I'm sure you've seen the videos of idiots asking where Obama was on 9/11 and the like. So I would be surprised if there aren't a bunch of those twits who - if they acknowledge she testified at all - believe (or purport to believe) that she pled the fifth continously.
In the same way, as you acknowledge — Trump made a big deal about people pleading the fifth, so it's fair to roll our eyes at him.
It’s probably good not to characterize pleading the fifth as an indicator of guilt, despite how disgusting Trump is. It’s such a harmful attitude to assume that if someone doesn’t want to testify, they must be guilty or a criminal.
If you’re the criminal defendant you don’t have to outwardly plead the fifth. The state has the burden of proof so by design you don’t have to put on a case at all if you don’t want to - your defense can be that the prosecution failed to meet its burden. Also throughout the entire proceeding the court pounds all of this into the jurors’ brains and the logical outcome - a requirement not to hold it against the defendant if they don’t testify.
A jury in a criminal trial shouldn’t and won’t hear any testimony regarding a Defendant pleading the 5th. Any prosecutor who brings out that testimony will be looking at an ethics complaint and potential reversal on appeal of any conviction.
