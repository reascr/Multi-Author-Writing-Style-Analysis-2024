They wouldn't have been invaded once. Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurance which included Ukraine and they agreed to "respect the signatory's independence and sovereignty in the existing borders" and "refrain from the threat or the use of force against the signatory" amongst other things.
Ukraine tells Russia to go fuck itself with the ceasefire offer given the history of Russia blatantly violating such deals a gazillion times since 2014, and the inanity of asking for a ceasefire while retreating in the midst of an invasion that genocidal. Russia makes a sad face and cries "why u no want peace", calls Ukraine a warmonger, and has the usual audience of brain-dead morons point fingers at Ukraine, NATO, the EU, etc.
No concessions to Russia, no appeasement, no ceasefire, and no peace talks until the last Russian soldier leaves Ukrainian land (pre-2014 borders).
Seems like you missed the part where Ukraine “agreeing to a cease fire” means to literally stop firing on the lines of the invading, occupying force that is entrenched in Ukrainian soil.
Ukraine accepts ceasefire, but responds to Russia's inevitable attack during the ceasefire. Russia whines loudly about how evil Ukraine has violated the ceasefire and must be punished.
D; Ukraine accepts and actually honors the ceasefire, but Russia blows up some of its emptied out hangars and blames it on Ukraine for not wanting piece.
Ukraine accepts ceasefire and sticks to it. Russia launches a massive attack with impunity, while gloating about the fools that believed them on national TV;.
