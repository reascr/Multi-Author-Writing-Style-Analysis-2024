Everyone already knew the US had provided Ukraine with the medium range GMLRS missiles, but had refused to provide the long range ATACMS missiles. What this article adds is that the HIMARS launchers in Ukraine came with custom DRM that would make them reject ATACMS missiles even if you...sourced one in some other way.
They're saying the combat software on Ukraine's HIMARS does not allow for firing ATACMS, even if Ukraine had gotten ahold of them from someone.
That is correct because Russian forces now have access to nato weapons systems from the battlefield and could give them on reverse engineering it or finding measures to counter themâ€¦ but we should still support Ukraine to defend themselves!
Moreover, Ukraine would need to know this upfront, in the case they thought they were only range limited due to ammunition and someone's life depended on hitting an enemy target...
It makes no sense for the United States to keep this secret! The entire point was to send a message to Russia that these assets were sent for self defense purposes only, in an effort to avoid escalation.
