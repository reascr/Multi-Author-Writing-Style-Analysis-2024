The Republican party had no choice but to nominate him, that's how primaries work. No important Republican politician wanted him, but the Republican VOTERS wanted him. The problem isn't a few creeps like McConnell or Cruz, it's the entire Republican electorate.
After your voters ALL said they want him, you're going to turn around and say "no, vote for Gary Johnson instead?" That's the short road to political irrelevance. And if a politician cares about anything, it's power and relevance.
And for me it always comes back to money in politics. Capitalists have had the working people of this country by the throat back 150 years, with some brief shift in power in the early 1900s. We need another shift to get money out of politics for good, until then we will be on a cliff looking down at the decent into fascism.
The disinformation machine is hard to overcome. It should be obvious that if you care about humans and their well being, then who I vote for is obvious to me. republicans are fucking me and us over by giving tax cuts to the rich so the country is always broke. and were told this country is just too broke we cant possibly keep feeding the schoolchildren and we cant possibly keep social security and medicare and medicaid. Republicans are proposing to cut social security, some suggesting that they decide if they should renew it every year or every 5 years, which is not how you run a long term social safety program. And if old Republicans relying on social security or just about to need it because they didn't save enough for retirement STILL vote for those guys. I mean, either their just totally ignorant or they think it's a joke and are just really dense as to what those cuts would mean. It would mean a whole bunch of poor and middle class people don't get to retire. They will never have enough money to scrap by without a job, who's ok with that? I'm not.
