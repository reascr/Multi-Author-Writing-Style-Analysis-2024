They could do a copy whenever they want. A lot of stuff you see outside is a copy, or is a "fake", aka a restoration that has not much of the original in it anymore. If they want the original I don't side with them. They sold them, if they want them back they buy them, only if the British are willing to sell.
and it was Greece the peninsula, not Geerce the nation. That was born, ironically, because of the extreme hellenophilia from the west, especially England, that fuelled nationalism and greek identity in Greece in the modern era.
The concept of Greek nationhood was a very real idea when the Elgin Marbles were taken, hell there were several active revolts trying for independence decades beforehand in the 1700s. Acting like the Greek nation-state is centuries off and not something that was actively being pursued by the majority of Greeks when the Marbles were taken is disingenuous.
To add some context. The British legally acquired them by buying them from the Ottoman Government when they were occupying Greece. The Greeks say that that legal claim is baseless because they themselves weren't the ones who transfered them, it was an occupying force essentially trading away their heritage for cash. To the British it's completely legal because they have a bill of sale, to the Greeks its the equivalent of someone holding on to the Eiffel tower because they legally bought it from the nazis in 1942.
The purchase took place in 1812, 20 years before Greeks gained their independence from the Ottomans, and only 8 before their independence war began. Once they became independent they immediately officially asked for them back.
