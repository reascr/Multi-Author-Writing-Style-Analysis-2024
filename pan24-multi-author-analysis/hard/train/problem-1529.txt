tangential aside, that was actually built in Ukraine, if i remember right part of the reason it has so much trouble aside from poor design is that it was basically unfinished when Ukraine achieved independence from the union and the soviets basically knicked it out of dock before Ukraine could potentially lay claim to it.
doubtful to be honest, presuming any sanity left in the russian command, staging ships there literally brings them right into range of ukraines anti-ship armament, and if they actually dock, the artillery.
probably cause after the moskva, that resupply ship and losing one their newest shiniest boats to ....wana say it was direct fire rocket artillery or something daft like that, they refuse to get their ships close enough for Ukraine to hit again, specially now they have even more anti ship capacity.
I wonder if they are planning a large missile barrage to support an amphibious landing, further destroy Ukranian infrastructure to force them to negotiate, scrambling because they recieved a tip-off about a possible attack on their fleet in port, or simply redeploying back to Sebastopol. Hopefully things become clearer in the next day or two.
