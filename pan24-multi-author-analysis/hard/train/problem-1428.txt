I honestly can't think of a single reason not to vote by mail unless you live in a state that makes it difficult - but Michigan just wasn't one of those states this year.
I had mine mailed to me. I filled it out with the added benefits of being able to re-read ballot proposals twice or three times over. I got to take my time researching every candidate on the paper. All without having to worry about holding up the line, or looking suspicious to some Q nut, or catching COVID (which still exists, folks!).
At the end of the day, I don't judge my fellow Gen Z and Millennials for their choice, since a lot of them still voted in the end, but I won't pretend to understand their logic.
Mail-in has innumerable benefits over in-person voting, and Michigan's courts in particular took very strong steps to protect it against the election deniers' nonsense this time around.
They get a voting guide before that, and another mailer that shows them how many of the previous elections they voted in, all of which help remind and encourage to vote.
They can write a short paper detailing how they would register and plan to vote should they ever acquire citizenship in future and maybe compare it to their step-by-step voting processing back in the home country?
