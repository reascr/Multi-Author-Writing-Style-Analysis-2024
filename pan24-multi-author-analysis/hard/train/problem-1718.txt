It's a little better now because labor has flexed its muscle slightly, but the fed is doing everything it can to shit on labor to "cool inflation" when they should be taxing corporate windfall profits instead.
But unemployment numbers are a smokescreen. They often ignore those who just stopped asking for unemployment, and ignore all the jobs that are poverty wage dogshit.
ya i don’t think low unemployment is the win they are claiming it is- if so many people can’t really afford to live/have access to basic needs, what’s the fucking point ?
Unemployment is not the same as Underemployment (not measured), wherein People are working but not able to support themselves on their income.
Now I just want to remind everyone, unemployment isn't a binary "person A has or doesn't have a job", but rather one person working 4 jobs to stay afloat and 3 homeless, unemployed people is also a 100% employment rate.
Employment stats should only show the percent of the population with at least one job, and a separate stat showing the average number of jobs people hold. THAT would tell the story a lot more accurately than these feel-good reports.
