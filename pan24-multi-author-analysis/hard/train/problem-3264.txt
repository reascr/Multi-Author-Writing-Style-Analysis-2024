McConnell doesn't have to do what he says because he'll get re-elected no matter what. Only reason I can think of that he'd bother condemning this is to try and keep Trump from the nomination since he knows he's poison for the GOP in elections.
Looking at the people who are most likely to toss their hat in the ring for the GOP in 2024, Trump may actually be the least dangerous. All the other viable contenders embrace some form of Trumpism and are likely to do even more damage. And given the damage Trump himself would do if he got re-elected, that's saying something.
We are at the beginning of finding out just how much long-term damage Trumpism is going to do to this country. Trump was successful in a couple of things. He was successful in exposing the fact that there are a lot more racists and bigots in this country than anybody was comfortable admitting to, even if they knew it privately. He was successful in coralling them into a voting bloc that reshaped the GOP and in many cases can no longer be ignored due to its sheer size. He was successful in showing us that continuing to push the envelope as far to the right as possible, then pushing it further, is a viable pathway to victory in some areas. And he was successful in showing us that our government really doesn't have an answer when someone like Trump comes along and says "So What? What are you going to do about it?".
