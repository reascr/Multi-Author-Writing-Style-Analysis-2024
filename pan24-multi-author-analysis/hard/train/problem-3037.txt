Respectfully it’s more like she has seen the writing on the wall. I feel like she would have stayed if the polling supported her, but even that’s turned against her.
Shes had a pretty good run, but as more of the bullshit flung her way seems to be sticking and her polls dropping I don't blame her at all for bowing out early in the election year.
Also, she's dealt with a lot of events during her leadership, which is actually one of the same reasons our last leader stepped down before the election 6 years ago lol so who knows she may be feeling too much stress or something from all the hate she is getting.
Whilst I don't completely blame her for the cost of living crisis as that probably would have happened anywhere, under her leadership NZ has seen a housing crisis so large its worse than like every other OECD country in this century. Once again, like I said its little things as well, crime, healthcare, etc.
Also, an all time NZ classic, Robert Muldoon in the 1980s announcing a snap election whilst drunk, which he immediately lost by an absolute landslide.
Preferred PM means nothing though, you don't vote for PM, only party. John Key occasionally polls around 5% in preferred PM even though he hasn't been active in politics for like 6 years.
