We face an existential threat to human civilization, and we are speeding up as we go over the cliff.
The point I was trying to make (perhaps not so well?) was: show me a dozen Democratic members of Congress - the party that I routinely vote for - that will significantly slash the Pentagon's budget.
Also also anyone who expected Democrats to cut national defense spending kind of doesn't know who we are. We like work projects, domestic job creation, and national security, we're not the ones who dipped into the military budget to fund a boondoggle border wall.
Bear in mind also that we need to replace all the arms, ordnance, and munitions we've provided to Ukraine from our own supply this year.
Oh fuck, I love that, I'm stealing that. "I don't support the military industrial complex, I'm just a militant Keynesian: It is the role of the federal government to stimulate private markets by any means necessary.".
Au contraire, my friend. I can't change your mind. Just Google the opposite of what you believe is true like, "policies that encourage population growth." I can't tell you for sure that it'll work. Your sentiment has that "all we tried was nothing" energy.
