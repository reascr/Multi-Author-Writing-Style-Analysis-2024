Not only was it pretty intriguing and a good concept, but it also highlights this exact scenario pretty (what I think) accurately!
So many "Christians" would be gunning for him, labelling a terrorist or worse. The other half would be trying to figure out how to make a profit off him. (There's a prophet/profit joke in here somewhere, lol!).
Yep. You later find out they mean "Love thy White Cisgender Christian Neighbor who better belong to the same church as you and HATE all thy other neighbors".
That's definitely 95% of the reason why right wingers want to ban it so badly. It is undoubtedly a sketchy Chinese company with major security issues, but so is every right-wing app (or so many other social media apps) ever developed.
It might be worse if they tried to have an ad for humanists or atheist causes. I am pretty sure someone tried to do a much more low-key ad (just one ad that night versus a whole campaign) years ago and it got blocked for being too "offensive" or "controversial".
Wasn’t long ago that a good way to get the admins to act on hateful communities was to get advertisers’ attention — what’s to be done when the hate is coming from the advertiser?
There was the ad that said Jesus didn't turn his family into outcasts and I immediately knew these ads were trying to appeal to the parents who went down the qanon, anti vax, etc rabbit holes.
I can't quite figure out what their aim is with some the refuge commercials yet because they do seem to be pro immigrant on the surface, but I don't trust that surface view. If anyone has interpretations, feel free to share. I feel like there might be a narrative I'm missing from being away from the church in so long.
Sorry we didn't turn our family members into outcasts because they like Jesus. Some of us put up healthy boundaries with parents who started showing their racism, prejudices, and vicious closed mindedness in public at increasing rates.
