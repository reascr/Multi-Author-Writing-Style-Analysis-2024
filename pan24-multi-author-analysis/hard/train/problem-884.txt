Sounds good, I hope water quality continues to be routinely tested and that the Government will impose penalties high enough to deter farmers and factories from letting their chemical waste run into waters.
We also have federally and state mandated water quality monitoring programs at known polluted sites. If you look at all the EPA National Priorities List (Superfund) locations, a part of the legal process involves studying the sites to establish baseline water quality, and then periodically testing during and after remedial actions are taken to make sure those actions actually keep the water clean. We usually do similar monitoring/testing for sediment, soils, vegetation, and animal tissue.
Generally, municipal drinking water and wastewater plant influent/effluent are tested for various contaminants regularly throughout the year, and held to specific standards. The big problem is making corporations take action if their industrial discharges cause water to fail standards.
Environmental scientist here! If it's any reassurance, water is pretty rigorously monitored in this country. The EPA and state/municipal agencies all test water quality indicators and pollutant concentrations regularly, and the results should be publicly available through the websites of those agencies.
