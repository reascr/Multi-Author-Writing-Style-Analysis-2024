You make about as much sense as a horse with a kickstand. This is about reparations, which is a bunch of crap, considering no one involved is alive today. Hope you live in California.
I do not live in California, thankfully, but my great grandparents came off the boat long after the civil war and slavery were both ended. I owe nothing to anyone and my tax dollars should not go to anything like this sort of thing. And since when can the offspring, generations later, be held accountable for their ancestors? But, not my state, so you folks have at it!
Heck is more than ten times the gdp of America. All of America doing nothing but paying black folks for ten years. So they really think the suffering of their ancestors entitles them to this today?
And again, how can the portion of a nations wealth that has been denied to black folks be greater than the sum of all portions of wealth?
And I know that this is just supposedly for discrimination faced in San Francisco, by why is what black San Franciscans faced not worth the same as black people everywhere?
With the SF case it seems a case of lost economic opportunities when the tech giants came to town, but even if successful (which I doubt) .. think that would apply to all racial groupings of long term residents who lost out when the inevitable reverse discrimination lawsuits hits.
Redlining and blockbusting went on into the late ‘60s (mostly Los Angeles) but remedying that for just the existing poor brings a price tag which is 2x the state budget. So California would need to increase it’s income tax and other taxes to cover it. This as bigger companies continue flee (at least their HQ) as well as younger professionals making over 100k/yr. Thus the burden falls on recent immigrants including POC (i.e. spend $200k to get $200k).
