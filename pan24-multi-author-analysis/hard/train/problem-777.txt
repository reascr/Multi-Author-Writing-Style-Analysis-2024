Give n McCarthy thinks that the American people should actually see all that happened instead of a report that's written on a political bias, my assumption is that all 14,000 hours would have to be shown unedited to provide the whole story.
“Flashback: McCarthy told reporters in Statuary Hall last month that he thinks "the American public should actually see all [that] happened instead of a report that's written [on] a political basis."”.
I’m saying he’s a liar and this isn’t the real reason he’s releasing it exclusively to Tucker Carlson. Do you think Tucker Carlson is NOT going to spoon feed us what they want?
Anything Tucker Carlson says about anything should be taken with a grain of salt. He will pick and choose what and how he says it all. After all it's FOX NEWS.
This is Fox News propaganda. Thier hosts constantly & every single night launch attacks on what they call "the mainstream media," when in reality FNC is the most "mainstream" of them all - boasting average primetime viewer counts that are TRIPLE that of MSNBC & CNN.
And that's the (rather obvious) problem: Tucker needs literally just a few seconds, out of thousands of hours of footage, to paint a picture to his viewers.
