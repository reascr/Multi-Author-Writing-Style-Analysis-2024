>But according to the publication, officially, this import is not classed as coming from Russia â€“ it came to the country through the use of loopholes in regulations that allow the origin of the oil to be obscured.
However, maritime experts say the way the UK registers imports, as well as the increased use of ship-to-ship transfers, will make it difficult for the UK to sanction Russian oil.
It's also that the loophole is an unusual practice by which the UK registers imports, according to copied to its discussion over in /r/europe, and would have to be changed by the UK:
EDIT: to clarify, the news here for me is that UK is masking imports with the help of germany, the netherlands and belgium, as stated in the article.
the 'countries through which it was imported' as a 'loophole' for anyone interested are Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium according to the article.
It's 're-sold' by the countries in question as the loophole established in Europe to allow the country of origin to be changed. If you simply modified the country of origin on the label when it arrived, it would be breaking international trade laws on 'origin'.
Just having goods pass through a port wouldn't be enough to qualify as a product "originating" from the country in question.
