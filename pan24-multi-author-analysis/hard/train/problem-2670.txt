People try to normalize Liz Cheney for doing her job regarding the January 6th committee while ignoring that her politics outside of that are dogshit.
If you're concerned about Cheney's ideology, you don't understand what the speaker does generally or what she'd need to do in this coalition situation. The only thing she'd be needed for is settling rules disputes, which I'm not worried about and you shouldn't be either.
Still better odds of moving their bills than they would have under actual GOP control. And the actual mechanics of the legislative process would be a subject of negotiation. They might choose to put a lot of that in the hands of committee co-chairs and devolve power from the speaker's office (more like old days legislating where committee chairs ruled their fiefdoms).
In order to have a House that functions, you would want a coalition with maybe 10-25% of Republicans who are willing to make a deal to get co-chairmanships and co-staffing on committees, and you get a House that functions. You still are able to move legislation that aligns with your ideology, thought it might be slower, and you don't have to worry as much about insane investigations because subpoenas and investigative steps would require consent of committee co-chairs.
The prize — winning over public opinion — would go to those members who (1) show themselves to be most effective in cobbling together legislation that gets enacted, and (2) are responsive to their constituents' concerns.
