Which is part of why I’m hoping this creepo hangs in there and pollutes the GOP House for the next two years.
He may be, but is he more evil due to knowing how to work the system to get the results the GOP have been clawing for decades. If you ask me who is more nefarious; Trump or Ryan and I will tell you it is Ryan or any GOP member who is willingly to hurt this country to fluff their own pockets.
It's sad when Republicans who used to represent the ultimate of Republican scumbaggery, like Paul Ryan, are now the principled voices of ethics and reason in comparison to the current crop.
I feel like after the absolute disaster of the Bush Jr Administration the republicans were challenged to change some parts of their ideology but instead they doubled down especially with characters like Sarah Palin. And then the tripled down with trump. They’ve been on a downward spiral for the better part of 20 years and their answer is to stubbornly cling to anything that gives them any semblance of power. To spite their face.
