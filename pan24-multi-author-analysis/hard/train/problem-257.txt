I'd still be shocked if we ever see an indictment - I don't think there is anywhere in the country you'd get a fair jury. All it takes is one MAGA in a country where 30% of the people think that Trump was robbed by the Dems and he walks free.
Justice has never been equal in any country ever. Trump is not another citizen and it is naive in the extreme to expect Trump to be treated the same as Joe Janitor that no one has ever heard of.
There is literally no one - no one - who pays attention to politics at even the most basic level would say "Biden is too old, therefore I'd rather the exact opposite of him in virtually every way, win. An old GOPer whose policies I hate is way better than a yucky old man that I agree with.".
Yep. He's probably found out, or guesses, that the DOJ will indict him the day after the election, so he wants to announce before that happens so he can claim that he's got immunity or it's a politically-based witch hunt. But if he announces right now, he pisses off the GOP by fracturing the party right before an election. So he's basically got a tiny, tiny window of opportunity to announce.
