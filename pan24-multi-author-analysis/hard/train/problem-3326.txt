I've be shocked if Wagner didn't have it's own agents in the Russian military structure, perhaps it's as simple as Prighozin giving the nod to the right guy and Putin's dead that evening.
All Prigozhin does is broadcast bold bandit-like rhetoric that Russian and credulous Western media picks up on, and that happens because he's powerless, just like Medvedev, after he was demoted to unimportant roles. In the West they just can't imagine that power in Russia can be as centralized as it isn't in the democratic countries.
He doesn't have any real power, as he can't even do anything against the (pro-Putin) Saint Petersburg mayor that's criticizing him for using an illegal mercenary army, is constantly being searched by Russia's security apparatus, and doesn't even get a meeting from Putin. Plain and simply, there's no evidence on the ground that Prigozhin is building up influence among Russian siloviki, military and policymakers.
I suspect his big value is that he gives off the appearance of "independence" from Putin, allows the latter to shift responsibility for breaking Russian law to subordinates like Prigozhin, and makes Putin seem "moderate" in comparison.
Can't tell if this is shifting the blame to try and protect themselves or if it's a favour for Putin to help build a narrative that supports even more direct control ("I am the mother Russia", "Today I will announce the first Putin Empire", etc).
