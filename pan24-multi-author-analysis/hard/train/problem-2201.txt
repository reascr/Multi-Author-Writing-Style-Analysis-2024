I'm pretty sure the Pennsylvania Supreme Court shot down the gerrymandered maps and redrew fair maps, North Carolina's Supreme Court did the same but the Republicans regained the majority on the court so the old maps will go into effect of the next election, Wisconsin has a Supreme Court election next year, that if the Democrats win can use the new majority to strike down the gerrymandered state maps. Ohio and Texas are borderline impossible.
But what would Newsom add as the VP pick? California isn't going to be a swing state anytime soon and there are other white male reps or Senators to pick from that would make more sense, imo.
We need to see more from Shapiro, but Whitmer has a bright future if she can use the new Democratic majority in both Chambers of the state legislature to their fullest extent.
Would really love to see the Democrats expand their bench of up and coming players, but Whitmer would be an amazing choice for a presidential run in 2024 or 2028. Buttigieg as a running mate would be an interesting ticket.
