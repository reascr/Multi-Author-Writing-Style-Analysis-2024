It’s an occupation not a genocide. When you take it to a 100x extreme, you lose any credibility and turn people off.
But rather than insult me, perhaps explain how and why you came to hold your views of the current situation.
Existing Israeli policy is a direct result of decades of failed peace negations and “bad faith” efforts from the Palestinian side.
While I don't feel there is a viable treating partner on the Palestinian side, how long will we support this with absolutism? We have to balance our relationship with Israel and it's protection with our own sensibilities.
Israel has not attempted in good faith to negotiate an equitable & reasonable solution for peace. Israel benefits from the current state of affairs because they have an excuse to steal more land from Palestinians.
If Israel really wanted all of the land the Palestinians are on it would take a couple days and the land would be leveled. Meanwhile, Jordan and Egypt treat the Palestinians far worse and no one ever talks about it. Probably because the last time Jordan tried to help them the Palestinians almost destroyed Jordan for the favor.
