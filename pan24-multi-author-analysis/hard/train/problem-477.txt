A new Department of Justice-funded study of all mass shootings — killings of four or more people in a public place — since 1966 found that the shooters typically have an experience with childhood trauma, a personal crisis or specific grievance, and a “script” or examples that validate their feelings or provide a roadmap. And then there’s the fourth thing: access to a firearm.
EDIT: I'm not saying guns should be allowed. I am against A2 generally, and it's obvious that if you take away guns, you have less gun violence. You still have violence. But gun violence is way too easy: grab gun, point, shoot, kill.
If turning in my guns would get rid of gun violence I would do it. Problem is that there are so many guns in this country, if responsible law abiding people turned theirs in, only criminals and gang members would have them. Uvalde and other incidents have showed us that the police have no duty to protect us and that when seconds count, cops are minutes away. You can choose to pontificate and take a supposed moral high ground by trusting yours and your family’s life to cops, but I’m not.
So don't tell me you're protecting yourself and your family, because you're not. You're protecting your money and your stuff. I'd rather not give my money to a criminal, but even moreso I'd rather not die.
Like, is that ever going to actually happen to you? I know home invasions do happen, but if you're really so afraid of them then get better locks, get an alarm system, and get a dog. Go read any article about what former burglars say deters them the most when scoping out a house, and they'll tell you it's a dog.
It's so strange. I get into arguments on Reddit all the time with Americans who say they need guns for protection.
If someone points a gun at you and says "give me all your money" and you give him all your money, nobody dies.
If someone points a gun at you and says "give me all your money", and you point a gun at him, then one of you might die, and it might be you.
