Like the advantage of 50 years of the most peaceful, democratic global order in history, freedom of international travel, safe shipping lanes across the globe, etc. And no I’m not American - just appreciative, despite America’s many faults and mistakes.
I think it’s true from peace measurements this past 50 years have been the most peaceful in human history, on average. I say the most peaceful because of course there are still plenty of genocides, civil wars, etc. it isn’t perfect and I hope the next 50 years is even more peaceful. But we no longer have major, powerful countries sending millions of people off to their deaths against each other (up until Russias invasion of Ukraine) which was common throughout almost all of human history.
Also the Ukraine war showed countries they need to not be dependent on powerful authoritarian countries for trade.
Blah blah blah consequences blah blah blah choke off your entire economy by simply blockading the south China sea blah blah blah JV team playing against the varsity.
You're right. When did anyone say we'd do it before that? If china or any country ever actually follows up on these hollow threats to attack US assets or allies, that would be an act of war, therefore triggering our response.
Does China seriously think threatening the US really matters, when it comes to their freedoms? Are you going to take away our RMT's for our video games or keep people from staring at their screens while they drive? Then we may counter with something worth noting. You already took away the worlds recycle bin. Signed: Wall-E.
