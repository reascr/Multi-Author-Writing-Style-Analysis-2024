Hillary was talking about how marriage should only be between a man and a woman in 2013 which was Obama’s second term. There’s been a huge positive shift in the last decade.
So yes, things are better than a decade ago. But just one meeting of old regressive people In power can revert all that progress. With or without the people's approval.
Yes better now. But that can backslide quickly. I mean just look at Roe v Wade. Something people were so certain was just inherently safe gone in a moment. Decades of progress rolled back.
Yea a lot of people get discouraged but there’s been a ton of progress made in the last ten years. A big part of it is people are more comfortable coming out so now everyone has a gay friend son niece nephew brother aunt uncle etc. Even conservatives poll slightly in favor of gay marriage now.
I like Obama but I will always hold a grudge against him pushing off gay marriage stuff until half way through his second term. Even then it took Biden running his mouth for the party to actually do anything with it. Felt pretty betrayed.
