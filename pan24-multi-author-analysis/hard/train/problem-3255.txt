Let me put this in perspective: Ukraine is not a military ally, we do not have military agreements to protect it, so we don't have existing laws allowing us to implement emergency measures to break all the aforementioned agreements/laws/policies.
I do actually appreciate your intent. If the West wishes to roll back some degree of economic integration with China due to how China's policies have shifted, they are entirely within their rights to do so. No one can reasonably object to this. And indeed you cannot be expected to condone the kind of oppression China is moving towards, nor should you forsake supporting Taiwanese autonomy. Also, just logically speaking, the world needs to diversify its supply chain so that a disruption in China doesn't plunge everyone into shortages or a recession.
If the Chinese people want a strong central authority we shouldn’t try to mess with that by using trade and supply chain integration as a means to liberalize them.
I do think we should engage diplomatically with china and other non-liberalized counties but we should not integrate with them. It’s previous obvious that we are headed to confrontation and we should be honest about that.
