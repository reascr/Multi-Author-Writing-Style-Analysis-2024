It's a little bit complicated and requires two stamps for anybody outside of Vermont. It also requires you to receive a letter back, does not allow for offensive names, and will require a crypto wallet. So, legally, anyone who wants to can sign up for the sweepstakes.That is not to say that it will be legitimately operated but it would be pretty funny to see HasanAbi doing a show live from the cocktail lounge at Mar-A-Lago.
What was unexpected is that he set up a sweepstakes surrounding the NFTs and sweepstakes are required to follow certain rules such as having no purchase necessary.
But it was completely expected. Everybody knows that Donald Trump only cares about making money off of his name and the gold-plated trailer trash brand that he has turned his name into.
And he wouldn’t be Donald Trump if he wasn’t chasing small money when there’s much easier, huge money to be made.
How much money could that scheme possible even generate for Trump? A million dollars? Ten million? I can’t imagine more than that. How humiliating for a supposed billionaire to debase himself for such small change. And just wait until the headline next year: “Remember those $99 Trump trading cards? They’re now trading for $3.50”. So a very public and unavoidable round of mockery for someone who hates being mocked, especially when it comes to money.
