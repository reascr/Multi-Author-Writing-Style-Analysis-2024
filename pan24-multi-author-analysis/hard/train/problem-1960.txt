Of course, that is only because the employers organization denied the employee union to have special exceptions that would have prevented life threatening situations from happening.
The issue is mostly related to the state, I don't expect companies to do anything that doesn't increase their bottom line, but we need a government that is more employee-friendly. Such as becoming more of a wildcard in forced negotiations, the ideal is that employee/employer enter the negotiations to find a solution without involving the state.
That's the ideal solution, but governments, generally, are becoming less willing to kneecap employers behaving badly.
The similarities are the government intervening and stopping the workers from getting their reasonable demands.

Either way, the government is at fault for siding with the employers in the forced negotiations. And this has always been the case, even when the Labor party was far more socialistic. Which I wish they would stop, because employer unions are starting to take that for granted and try to force government involvement during every strike.
