Which is crazy outdated. Maybe those numbers made sense in the era of B52 swarms delivering bombs but in the 21st century an ICBM attack is pretty much unstoppable. Multiple warheads on a ballistic entry from outer fucking space along with a ton of decoys are not something that can be defeated. Full stop. We don't need 4,000 nukes.
That's the whole idea of the nuclear trident. My point is basically that you don't need to account for the most warhead heavy aspect the Trident, the bombers.
Spread some ICBMs out on submarines and land based silos and you're fine, 200 will do. 400 if you want to be super duper over armed. "Oh sorry, we can only destroy 25 major Chinese population centers and 250 million people while still accepting a 50% failure rate AND keeping half the nuclear fleet in reserve" boohoo, sorry we can only destroy you to 2 full fledged superpowers in nuclear armageddon in an era where only one other superpower exists.
I also think that no world leaders are willing to accept the risk of 20+ cities in their country being destroyed by nuclear weapons. And preventing even 10% of missiles from getting through is gonna be nearly impossible.
So they are fixed point, with tons of space and you would be able to easily counter direct attacks, additionally there wouldn't just be one platform, but hundreds, so like the nuclear triad. You would have to take out all of them.
You are right. Sorry for my erroneous post... Somehow, I must have confused some data in some news and got that impression... Still more than the next 13 military powers combined...
