Edit: it's actually almost amusing that automod flagged my message for hate speech because one of my words was "too close" to something that "may" be hate speech (using another word for "not smart person"). This is why people like the Republicans will win, we're arguing about how close something may be to hate speech and which words you are allowed to use to say "not smart" and they're literally plotting insurrection.
Also explains why a lot of truck drivers are nuts. They used to exist solely on AM and CB Radios. This was one of the early echo chambers. The truckers would listen to AM radio a lot due to its huge range (less constantly switching/finding stations or listening to static). They would all talk to each other on CBs, reinforcing each other's BS ("did you hear what St Rush said yesterday???"). My dad was a trucker in the 80s-90s. He was huge into Rush. He died in 09 in an accident. I am often grateful I didn't have to watch his fall from "Rush is cool" to "MAGA-lardo.".
Yep. Plus they have been buying up every radio station available and now have FM conspiracy radio and there are more than a dozen Rush wannabes nationally and countless locally.
