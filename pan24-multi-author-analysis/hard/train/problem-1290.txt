So fucking dumb. They trust the medical profession to do open heart surgery but don't trust the medical profession advice about blood.
A hospital doesn't have the facilities to do this, and using untested blood would be medical malpractice and the doctors are correct to refuse to do so.
They can't just shut down the whole facility for doing this, run a small batch of select unvaccinated people's blood (and it may be that they need a whole bunch of it), and then switch back. They process blood in bulk.
It would mean that other people potentially wouldn't have access to blood that would normally be made instead.

Blood donations aren't like in the movies; you can't just hook a tube up to someone and stick the other end into someone else. You need a blood bank to process and standardise the blood, which would need to be done even in this case. What if 2 of the 20 volunteers have gotten their blood type wrong? That would kill the child. What if one of them has meningitis and doesn't know? Or HIV? Or one of many other blood borne illnesses? Not only that, but what happens if they only get 3L of usable blood from the volunteers and then end up needing more than that?
this is stupid, obviously, but can they do some thing where the parents donate some of their blood and they use that? I assume the baby won't need that much blood right?
