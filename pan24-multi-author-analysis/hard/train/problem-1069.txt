A year? This has been going on for at least a decade. The West has a weird fetish with claiming Putin has dementia/Parkinson's/Cancer, etc.
They did not claim Putin was in perfect health, every comment they made focused on claims that were speculating on severe illnesses like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's etc.
Why do I feel that Western stories about Putin's health are Russian propaganda designed to enable Putin to fake his own death and escape to Venezuela?
How did this escalate to "fuck off, Putin-propaganda, strawman fallacy" talk? The way I see it, they took your reply as supportive of the rumors so he kept going on the same angle. I can see how you would feel they ignored what you were saying, or that they were mocking anyone believing Putin is sick in some way.
Personally I like the idea that Putin is secretly quite sick, and I don't think the rumors do harm because they are also harming Putin's image. But I also don't think being annoyed by what are essentially rumors, and a long pattern of them means that someone is a Putinist.
