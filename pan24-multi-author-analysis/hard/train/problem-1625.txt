Of course rising prices is a problem especially for those with lower income, but we need to step back and look at the big picture.
Exactly. I'd venture to bet that there is a disproportionate amount of older people tapping into savings in this because that's what people do when they retire.
Fair. So of 65million people or so those numbers don't seem too out of control. Assuming we're only talking about adults, at a glance those numbers look fairly aligned with age distribution.
Now let's fast forward to a later stage in your career when student loans, cars, etc are paid off. You now net $100k per year instead of over the majority of a decade. How much can you save now? A lot different of a picture than before.
There are 330+ million people in America. Of course "millions have no savings". Millions will always have no savings. Hell, I had no legitimate savings until about 30. That's kind of how it goes.
That's not how it should go. It's almost like wages are too low and the cost of living is too high. We shouldn't expect the youngest generation to go through over a decade of poverty, anxiety, and hardship just to have the bare minimum. That should not be normal in the richest country in the world.
