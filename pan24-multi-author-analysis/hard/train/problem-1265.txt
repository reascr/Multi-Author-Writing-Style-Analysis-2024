I disagree with short selling and think it should be banned but I really don't think trying to set up a short sell and then trash talking the company you're trying to do it to should be legal.
There’s a whole cult around the idea that shorts are bad because, well, people don’t like hearing “I think your company is so bad I took on unlimited risk on that basis”.
Short selling puts a price on my skepticism. If I think a company isn’t worth its present value, I have two choices: I can (1) kvetch about its overvaluation like any random asshole or (2) short the company, putting my money where my mouth is.
Yes, it does affect jobs and economies. It would be worthless to the economy if it didn’t. Being long also costs people their jobs because it causes companies to reorient toward what the market rewards, which may not be employing people.
Short selling is important to the economy and should, arguably, be encouraged. Part of the reason we have such massive boom-and-bust cycles is social norms around shorts, leading to companies being massively overvalued.
