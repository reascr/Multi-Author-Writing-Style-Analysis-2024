Women could not generally do the sort of back breaking labor that was required for survival in those days; and men obviously could not get pregnant or breast feed. So it was an "equal" contract.
Historically, it was a contract by which men and women both committed everything they had (for men, their ability to do hard agricultural labor; for women, their ability to have children and take care of them) in order to generate sufficient resources to support a family.
But that doesn't have to be the case. You could have a woman be the bread winner and a man be the care taker, or an equal distribution of labor with both members sacrificing career progression in order to take care of the family. In such cases, I wouldn't say the man gained more by marriage.
A man couldn't run a farm without a wife and vice versa, simply because it wasn't a one person job.
And it was a shitton of work, way more so than today since most people didn't farm commercially but to supply themselves. Everything to do with clothes alone was an insane amount of work. And plowing needed to be done constantly as well.
