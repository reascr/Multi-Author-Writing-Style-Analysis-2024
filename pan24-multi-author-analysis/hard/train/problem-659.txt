That's a weird interpretation, a counterstrike is by definition a response to an enemy strike, and in the context of defense, it would be a response to eliminate the enemy's capacity of launching an strike.
After browsing a few paragraphs: counterstrike = ability to destroy an enemy missile in flight, or at its base of deployment.
So even if the counterstrike is after an enemy attack (as the name itself says) it would still be BEFORE an enemy launch.
Otherwise it would be a first strike or preemptive strike, which by definition is different to a counterstrike, and what Japan wants is counterstrike capability.
So, Japan is debating obtaining missiles to shorten the time-of-flight to a ballistic missile base in an enemy country (North Korea), which is significant because Japan was preciously self-defense only.
"The capability, which would allow Japan to fire upon and disable enemy missiles before they are launched from foreign territory, remains controversial among legal experts, given that Japan has pursued pacifism under its war-renouncing Constitution since 1947.".
