The Speaker is elected from a simple majority of the members-elect of the House, so the winner will need 217 218 of 435 votes. Jeffries could theoretically be elected Speaker, but only if he received enough votes from across the aisle.
Yeah the thing is that if Jeffries gets the Speaker we will get votes on Democratic bills. The bills will get voted down but at least they will get voted on that. That's something that matters come election time when votes are out in the open. If McCarthy gets speaker through deals with the crazies he will stonewall all progressive bills and then the media will blame the Democrats for doing nothing for two years because they like to do that.
McCarthy should talk with Jeffries and give speaker to him in return to go with a moderate republican agenda.
exactly. speaker makes the agenda. In return for Jeffries being speaker, he will push a moderate republican agenda out along with a democrat agenda when needed. Anything democrat won't get passed since republicans own the house but he can still push it out there as long as he throws in some republican bills. He's there so there won't be a witch hunt on Biden and Hunter.
