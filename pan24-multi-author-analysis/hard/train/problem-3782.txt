The Supreme Court rubber-stamping Independent State Legislature Theory would nullify democratic guarantees embedded in virtually all state constitutions since the founding era.
Under independent state legislature theory, Presidential Electors can be decided however the state legislature chooses.
This has been my thought on Moore v. Harper for several months. The conservative court might be able to steal a few Presidential elections this way, but they're also guaranteeing themselves a role as the House Minority for years to come.
In Wisconsin, where Republicans have gerrymandered themselves to a majority in both state legislative houses despite the fact that it's basically a 50/50 state, the GOP can just decide that the state voted for a Republican President.
The only way this would be utilized is in swing states that have been gerrymandered and have a majority republican legislature with Democrats winning statewide seats.
The House is gerrymandered to shit and the Senate is hard to keep since there are more red states than blue even though democrats get far more votes overall. The House passes the budget and the Senate votes in judges who make sure red states get their welfare.
