Genocide is . Ethnic cleansing is . The term ethnic cleansing began as a euphemism and has spread in usage because it describes a wide range of malicious behavior without actually accusing someone of a specific crime.
However(and I know this is uncomfortable), ethnic cleansing was not always considered genocidal or even called that. It used to be a method of relocating ethnicities to be with others in an effort to "help" them "self determine". Usually it was the former colonial master countries that did this when overseeing decolonization. And despite how scummy that is by our standards now, it wasn't an outright malicious attempt to destroy or remove, but an ignorant solution to create a form of harmony(I know, I know. Reaaally dumb).
HOWEVER, I have a half-hearted defense of the US system. Out of all the potential fascist usurpers that have come to power over the years, Trump's has thus far been extraordinarily unsuccessful beyond him rustling some violence and winning(NOT BY A POPULAR VOTE. Remember, he lost that) an election for a seat that he was under constant beaurocratic scrutiny for.
Good question: Genocide is a broad term used to refer to a series of actions or general intent to destroy a population.
So while it isn't inherently considered a genocide by itself, it is a frequent component of one. But the word also changed a lot and can be conflated with genocide anyway if you want(full circle, hope you don't feel you wasted your time reading this shit), making the original commenter technically also correct. Idk. I probably could have left it alone and the point wouldn't have changed. Lol.
