Even though Trump is the face of the GOP and has been since 2006, he never did win the popular vote.
THAT'S how compelling the GOP's current "platform" is. The BIGGER problems is that they don't seem to care. Their leaders are raking in HUGE AMOUNTS of money and cozying up to anyone who is willing to push cash their way for cozying up to them.
If it wasn't for the outdated election system and the decades of GOP de-democratification of state election systems, the GOP would be luck y to win a Congressional house once every 10 years.
I like how a lot of state Republican parties are looking at how DeSantis is able to win over senior citizens and Cubans in bright red Florida as if he is somehow a compelling candidate to swing states.
I bet migration of retirees from the Midwest (+PA) to Florida can explain why Democrats have managed to remain competitive in those states. Itâ€™s the sacrificial lamb.
If the way Miami voted this year is indicative of a lasting shift, Democrats can write off Florida for at least a couple cycles.
