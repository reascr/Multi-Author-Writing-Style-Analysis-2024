Granted, they should be on different networks for work and personal, but the home situation still arises.
Because if I have a government issue phone and I take it home it's probably going to connect to my wifi where I will also have my personal phone. On top of that I will probably take my personal phone to work and connect it to the wifi.
I have my own phone. I had tiktok on it until recently. I take my work laptop home and it connects to my wifi. This would imply that tiktok can pull data from my work laptop even though it's never touched the service.
Tik tok will take data from any devices connected to the same network. So if you have tik tok on your personal phone connected to your home wifi but also a government issued phone connected to the same wifi. Tik tok gets the data from the government phone.
I meant to comment this one your comment butâ€¦Tik tok will take data from any devices connected to the same network.
