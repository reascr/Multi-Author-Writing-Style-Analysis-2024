Imagine being upset that several countries get to discuss what's fair for the group and coming to agreement in a democratic order, instead of a single country bullying weaker countries into submission.
You mean a collection of countries from around the world who have worked together diplomatically to establish a set order of rules that each have agreed to follow in order to prevent conflicts and increase mutual prosperity?
Those same rules that other nations have agreed to abide by in order to have access to this trade market, only to then break the rules and then get angry when the countries they lied to slowly stop doing business with them, while still giving them time to change their behaviors in order to maintain good relations and continued business?
Diplomacy is a negotiation, and these laws and treaties were not written by a single nation, or a small collection of regional nations, but by many nations found around the globe over time to ensure peace and prosperity.
Trade relations are built of mutual respect and an adherence to agreed upon rules for mutual peace and prosperity.
