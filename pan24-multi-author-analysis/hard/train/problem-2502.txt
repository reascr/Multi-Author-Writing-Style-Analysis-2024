The Taliban today are almost exclusively former mujahideen. Not the fly by night pawns that flip allegiances every other week, but the competent group of commanders. To your point, many anti-Taliban groups are also former mujahideen. I also get what your saying, insofar that obviously Americans didn’t recruit fighters using an extreme religious angle, but the Americans knew that was happening and still maintained an “enemy of my enemy” approach. I wouldn’t call that lack of oversight and more deliberate indifference, which kind of defined US foreign strategy in the late 80s and early 90s (Iran, Nicaragua, Iraq). Put another way, I really don’t think the Taliban would have existed in their current form if it wasn’t for US intervention.
The mujahideen were very diverse and can't simply be described as precursors to the taliban, the taliban started out by fighting against the mujahideen, although plenty of mujahideen fighters would later join the taliban. It wasn't the US running the madrassas expounding the extreme deobandi ideology that influenced the taliban.
Uh, the Taliban are not Wahhabist, they subscribe to a completely different branch of radical Islam, although in practice it's not that different.
But now Wahhabism has taken a center stage in Islam, with different sects claiming Wahhabism and discrediting other Muslims. The Taliban thinks they represent Wahhabism, while Saudi’s think they represent it. Then lots of infighting between. Is that right?
