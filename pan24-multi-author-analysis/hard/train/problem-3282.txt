Harry started in a cavalry unit and deployed to Afghanistan but iirc served as forward air controller. But then he became an Apache pilot and went back.
He was an apache pilot. The Taliban were very rarely able to shoot down helicopters, especially at night. It’s very feasible that he was able to kill 25+ Taliban in this role. Many attack helicopters pilots would’ve killed alot more than that.
He flew with and directed helicopters. I think he did have a guard with him apparently, but it was a role he could do without their direct interference I presume.
Whilst at the time I think Harry wanted to have a purpose in his family. And the proper career for him was seen as the military. He probably felt then that going to Afghanistan was a way to get away and feel more normal. Just another soldier. But he still couldn't really escape it.
I definitely think it's questionable but I think his quotes are being taken out of context. It seems to me, based on the military's comments on the issue he's probably more reflecting on his time critically rather than with praise.
I feel sorry for him but I always feel uncomfortable about airing dirty laundry in autobiographies you have to buy.
I don't think its a brag. Sounds more like he's reflecting on his time in the war and how he was trained to feel emotionless about the killings. Hard to tell since the only source is a Spanish version of the books and outlets are quoting things probably out of context.
