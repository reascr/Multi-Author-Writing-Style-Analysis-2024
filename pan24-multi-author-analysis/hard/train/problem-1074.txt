Fuck no on Harris. I mean, fuuuuuuuck no. When she was the first to drop out of the last Dem primary with 1-3% support, she shouldve never even been VP imo.
You make good points but I think many moderate, centrist Dems are really not getting, even now, that millions of people voted to get the former piece of trash out of the presidency. Biden would certainly win again against Trump but DeSantis? Enough low-info “indepedent” voters would “give him a chance” over Biden.
The people who lost to POTUS Joe Biden I'm not sure would somehow be a better Presidential candidate than he. US Senator Bernie Sanders lost because the Mainstream Media was so against him and US Senator Elizabeth Warren didn't drop out when the others did. US Senator Sanders would have beaten Donald Trump in 2016 and we would have presently been in the 2nd term of the Sanders Administration.
US Senator Sanders lost the primaries in 2020 because POTUS Barack Obama was still more popular than US Sen. Sanders and got all the 'moderates' to drop out and endorse Joe Biden and US Senator Elizabeth Warren didn't drop out.
Even if all of that is taken as b.s., the DNC will never, ever allow a person like Bernie to win as evidenced by that nonsense during the last primary where every candidate dropped out right as Sanders got momentum to rally behind Biden.
That is just silly and ridiculous, and it is hard to believe any of the people who claim to be Bernie Sanders supporters while promoting that stuff.
There are a lot of people online who claim to be Bernie Sanders supporters and yet they say basically nothing that is not an attack on other democrats. These people are not believable.
