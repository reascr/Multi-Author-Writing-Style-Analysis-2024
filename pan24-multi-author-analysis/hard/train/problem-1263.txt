To some degree you could liken the ability to convert to religion, but I wouldn't, as transphobes have a penchant for claiming transgender people are 'an ideology' already.
It's hard to liken it to religion for me because religion is about belief, a trans person would be trans even if they chose not to believe they were trans or even if people convinced them not to be trans. If someone talks someone out of converting to Christianity, then they aren't a Christian. If someone talks someone out of transitioning, they still have a transgender identity, they just aren't allowed to acknowledge it.
I have seen cishet people ask what being trans and being gay have in common as a way to divide the LGBTQ+ community, and this is it: being gay or trans is being a person living as something not considered the societal default in a usually imperceptible way.
I'd also be interested to know if a lot of trans youth is actually normally presenting as both genders at different places, like out at school and dressing feminine but I guess changing in between and being a boy at home? Is that common?
Like if the child is suicidal because of their gender dysphoria, would that then trump the need not to out them to their family? Should they just suggest they need help but not why or how they know?
