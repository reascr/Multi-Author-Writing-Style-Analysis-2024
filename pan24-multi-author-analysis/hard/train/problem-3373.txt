Correct. They absolutely will not turn on him. It's Reagan's 11th Commandment (as in he literally said this and called it that): Republicans never criticize other Republicans.
Ever since Reagan's days Republicans do not criticize other Republicans except when actively campaigning agains them (primaries and such). Once that's over with, no Republican can ever do any wrong in the eyes of other Republicans.
The threat of getting primaried is an axe at the neck of all Republicans reducing their ability to act out of consience always looking to the party dads for direction.
The core Republican leadership could have (and I imagine wish they did) jettison those whining assholes so many times over the years. Hell, several of them are implicated in the January 6th insurrection attempt so it's not like Republican leadership would have to look far for a valid reason when, in reality, it's because they have no real policy doctrine except grifting wherever/whenever possible and do not have the best interest of the GOP at heart. But here we are, years later, watching McCarthy do the song and dance to keep them happy. It's both hilarious and depressing in how pathetic they all are.
Republicans are anti-democratic. That goes for the party leadership, it’s politicians, and (increasingly) its voter base. This is a fork in the road for the county. Do we stomp down anti-democratic (I’d argue, fascist) policies championed by Republicans and their base? Or do we let it continue to fester and erode the foundations of the country?
They elected him under false pretenses. And while I absolutely think the Republican base in the district are fucking morons, that does not mean his blatant lies can, or should, be ignored.
