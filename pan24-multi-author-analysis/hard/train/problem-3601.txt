Right wingers act like conservatives are persecuted and censored. In reality, social media companies ENCOURAGE conservative speech since the extreme nature of much of it leads to higher user engagement, whether it be for or the cries against it.
That's a big reason why right wing social media doesn't end up working. Things like Parler had their issues with child pornography and such with lack of moderation, but many conservatives simply found it less fun when they were spewing shit segregated from the rest of the internet.
Social media companies are more than fine with stoking the flames. It's just when one of the right's beloved figureheads crosses the line into a direct call for violence or uses a slur, the movement wants to cry foul that they're being censored for being conservative.
Guess it just seems to me like the right gets labeled extremists too often and in a dismissive manner, when “the left” has just as many offended. I was being a little too reactive.
Weird that more people on here aren’t more concerned about a government body saying their biggest focus is quashing political extremes.
