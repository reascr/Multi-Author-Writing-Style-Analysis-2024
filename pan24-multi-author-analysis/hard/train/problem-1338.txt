Utah mails a ballot to every registered voter. They have since like 2010 or 2012. Republicans don't mind mail in ballots, they only mind Democrats being able to outvote Republicans.
In any state where the cities outvote the rural areas, but barely, they want to end mail in voting. In states like Utah where even the cities can't (or won't) outvote the rural areas, they don't care.
In cities, mail in voting allows people that work 15 hours a day to barely afford a studio apartment for their family of 4 to vote. Those people will usually vote Democrat because they want a higher minimum wage and better support programs. They don't have time to vote in person.
You don't have to vote. You just feel a social pressure. You've never done anything because of a social pressure? Fill out a survey, listen to a sales pitch a few minutes longer than you would have, ect.? Also, it's weird because voting patterns have patterns to them and you can reliably sway the ballots you pick up to favor one side over the other. It's not going to be 100%-0%, but it's pretty significant. I just don't like the idea when people could just mail it or you could let someone they know hand it in. Why allow a stranger in the mix?
The ballot harvest thing is really messed up. I had my fire department visit my home and my wife answered. They pressured her to vote on increasing the fire department taxes. Like, sure... they didn't explicitly say they wanted us to vote that way but you know they want us to. And you just feel like you want to make them happy.
This very specific instance was this year during the primaries in Oswego. So I'm not sure if that might have made it different. But the fire department tax increase lost by exactly one vote in the end anyways.
