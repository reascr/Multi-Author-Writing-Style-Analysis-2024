Yeah and like anything else in reality it has nuance, a US military industrial complex is a good thing, we dont want to import military equipment. How much money its draining is not, how much control it has over congress is also bad.
They need to stop actually letting the GOP use the debt ceiling as a way to demand things and just ignore them. Tell the public that while the GOP are trying to crash the economy and make cuts to things people actually want and use, the Dems are looking at ways to actually govern and pay for things Congress already approved.
Biden should say, even if it wont happen, that he's directed WH legal counsel to look into whether he can simply ignore the debt ceiling because of the 14th Amendment. Or that he'll just order the Treasury to print coins to cover the debt.
If the debt ceiling is unconstitutional, there's no need to mint the coin. They just point to the previously authorized spending bills and continue on as normal.
The bond holders are the lender in this analogy. If they believe the US won't repay them, they won't buy the bonds or will demand much higher interest rates. Just like the credit card company would increase your interest rate or not raise the credit limit.
Can a credit card account owner create their own currency when they hit their credit limit? That's why the analogy breaks down. Government finances can only be compared to a household budget in certain ways, and the rest mean there is no valid comparison.
The credit card analogy breaks down however when the government can just print new money instead if they REALLY think the spending is necessary. The federal government literally spends money into existence.
