Kanye running for President as a Republican is a nightmare scenario, especially in light of Trump meeting with Fuentes and the midterms, because denouncing him alienates those racist voters, but doing so literally alienates everyone else. And I doubt Ye will be the last R to go mask-off Hitler-lover before long.
The guy who created the Alt-Right Playbook on YouTube said that Republicans treat White-Supremacist voters like the mad woman in the attic: they feed her, but they don’t talk about her. They know Nazi’s and racists make up a huge portion of their base, but they can’t openly court them because it scares the shit out of everyone else, and breaks the illusion of plausible deniability which other Republican voters have regarding their more regressive policies.
It was absolutely NOT too much for the GOP, they just want to keep their wholesale embrace of bigotry out of writing as much as possible after the midterms revealed their electoral vulnerability- and also as they know that more indictments and sedition convictions are incoming.
No one should confuse cheap talk and lukewarm consternation with actual actions to fight anti-semitism and other forms of bigotry within the RepubliKKKan Party. We’ve seen a touch of the former and absolutely ZERO of the latter from the GOP.
