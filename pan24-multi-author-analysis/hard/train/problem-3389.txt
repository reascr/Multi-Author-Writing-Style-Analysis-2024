Turns out, consumer spending rose because companies jacked up the prices on necessities like food and gas. Why would companies do that? Greed. Economics generally makes no provision for unbridled greed. Greed and graft can crash a whole economy, and therefore it is illogical. It shouldn't exist. But it does!
I mean I think we are in it. They always call it after it's happened. Look at all the high flying tech companies laying people off. But as inflation stays high and unemployment rises it gets exponentially worse.
People have been saying we can just run deficits and monetise them so we have been doing that for decades. Across those decades we have also had persistent inflation.
Inflation occurs for all sorts of reasons. One of those reasons is when you dilute the value of money by printing more of it. This is so called quantitative easing which we saw multiple times under Bush Jr. Another reason is just plain increasing the price charged for goods and services, because you as the provider, feel you can or should get more for it, or because your costs have increased.
That's not to say some supply chain/price increases were not real/natural, but it was clear that many were well and above what any kind of natural inflation for those products should have been.
