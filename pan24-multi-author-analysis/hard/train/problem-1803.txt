That whole saga was crazy. First the Dem won with one vote. Then the Republican found a thrown out ballot where someone voted for both candidates, but they changed it to be a vote for the Republican because the other votes on the ballot tended towards Republicans. That made the election tied, heading to the "drawing." Then, the Republican was chosen to be the representative with their name being chosen from a bowl.
What rubbed me the wrong way was (1) the ballot being changed when it shouldn't have and (2) when you watch the video of the "drawing" it appears quite obviously to me the person doing the drawing knew to grab the Republican name. It was very odd. I would have rather they flipped a coin to avoid any possibility of bias. But I'm guessing they wanted a Republican in the seat.
And I doubt Republicans will oust Boebert in the primary in '24. Colorado has the Presidential primary in March but the primaries for all the other offices in June. And no major statewide offices are up next cycle, so the June primary will probably be low turnout, dominated by MAGA crazies on the Republican side. Really, the Republicans' best bet for holding this seat is to offer Boebert a cushy Fox News gig starting in January 2025.
I can only imagine the cries of fraud that would have come from the MAGAs if Boebert had lost. Tina Peters was the Republican County Clerk for bright-red Mesa County, one of the biggest in the district. Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold had to remove Peters from that post because Peters improperly handled and granted access to voting machines. Peters has now been indicted for a bunch of felonies related to that.
Yep, and that's new this cycle. In fact, it's the nonpartisan redistricting that led to close races. If not for that, Dems could have engineered a solid-R district on the eastern plains and another on the Western Slope, with the other 6 being solid D.
