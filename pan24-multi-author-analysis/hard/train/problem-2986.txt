There is Directly from Ukraine Ministry of Defense. They list Pischane and Chervonopopivka as locations that Russia has shelled. Those areas are controlled by Ukraine and P66 runs through both of them. It is directly north of Kreminna. This is from two weeks ago.
As as of at least two weeks ago Ukraine controlled parts of P66 so it isn't usable to supply Russian troops to the south of that.
That kind of doesn't make sense considering the P66 connects to the P07 north of svatove, which is already substantially in Ukrainian hands. What it does mean is that there are no substantially convenient defensive positions all the way to starobilsk from there, opening up sieverodonetsk to significant advance from the northeast and driving a nail in Putin's "capture of the whole of luhansk oblast".
It would theoritically put Starobilsk, which is a major supply hub for Russian forces in the Donbas, within Himars range if Ukrainians were bold enough to put those things in the frontline - they have done during the kharkiv offensive.
I'm sure retaking Kreminna would create a bunch of strategic opportunities for Ukraine, but the logistical issue of that highway being unusable as a supply route is already playing out, and the Russians have already adapted their logistics to deal with it. Anyway this discussion is rather pointless to be honest, as the liberation of Kreminna is unlikely to happen anytime soon.
No, that highway has been under artillery observation by the Ukrainian forces for several weeks now. The Russians are already using alternative supply lines.
