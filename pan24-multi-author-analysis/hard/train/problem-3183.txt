"Oh, definitely! My dad had it last week. Took out a fascist dictator and woke up the next morning with a hangover. Can't fault him, of course, he was hypnotized, after all.".
Look into it. It's really interesting. Medication companies are realizing that a lot of their medications don't work any better than placebos (and sometimes worse than placebos), so its cheaper to use placebos. There are also placebo surgeries.
It's not really the placebo effect. If you have a kidney stone and receive morphine, it going to have an effect whether you believe or not. Don't ask how I know (.
For those who say hypnosis is real and works, it is provided you want it to work. I took a hypnosis class and it was absolutely ineffective on several people including myself. I just wasn't ready to allow even the sense of someone else controlling or affecting me take place. Yes, I was taking the class but couldn't ever get over the feeling, it didn't work for me. You cannot hypnotize an unwilling person.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean hypnosis is not a real thing. It’s as real as meditating is. At the end of the day, they still did with the hypnotist said. Even if it was just in a play along type of way.
