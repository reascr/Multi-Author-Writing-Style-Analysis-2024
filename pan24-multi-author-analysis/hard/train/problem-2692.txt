Uh, how is the union winning sick days a no win situation? Didn't I just read that Buffet made enough money yesterday to cover two weeks of sick days for every employee? Rewarding workers at the expense of the idle rich seems like a huge win to me.
No, that's a conservative corporate-favoring stance for him to take. Not remotely neutral. Neutral would be "let the unions and the businesses fight it out, this is a free market.".
So its not one or the other. Force the Rail companies to give the Unions what they want. Instead, Biden is forcing the Unions to take what the Rail companies want.
"Union anger at deals, and at Biden But the membership of four of the unions rejected the tentative deals. The other eight unions are prepared to honor their picket lines and go on strike as well without a deal or Congressional action, and Biden’s voiced sympathy for the demands about sick time didn’t satisfy some of the union leaders Tuesday.".
Yes it is. Congress passes a single bill that forces the Rail companies to provide sick time. Done. Strike averted, economy saved, workers get what they deserve.
