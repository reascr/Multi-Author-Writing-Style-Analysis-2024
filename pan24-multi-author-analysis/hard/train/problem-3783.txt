And probably further advanced US interests waaaay more than that dollar amount would in other ways. Foreign countries love American things that go boom.
I think the person meant, if Putin attacks Estonia then NATO will respond collectively and probably F Russia up, but it would still suck for Estonians, as that initial Russian blitz/strike will probably F up Estonia.
There has long been a scenario feared by NATO leadership where Russia occupies the Baltics in days, and then NATO being too uncommitted to initiate a liberation war against Russia. Given how the Ukraine conflict has reinvigorated NATO, I assume that this scenario is now less likely.
NATO has already increased it’s presence in the Baltics and Eastern Europe as a response to Ukraine. There are thousands more boots on the ground in these countries, each bringing their own equipment, munitions and support. Estonia could donate all of their own military equipment and should still have enough support nearby to repel an invasion.
The irony that Estonia could feasibly need that weaponry in a land war yet western nations bleat about depleted military stocks they’ll never actually need. The UK is now sending top tier tanks, follow suit Europe!
