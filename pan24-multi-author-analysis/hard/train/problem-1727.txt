3.2 million in the New Hampshire primary to run pro Buldoc ads while simultaneously saying that election denying politicians like him are a grave threat to democracy?
Besides outvoting them, what is it going to take to minimize if not fully prevent election deniers and insurrectionists from gaining political influence?
At what point does mass civil disobedience, including armed resistance, become a necessary or justifiable response to people who openly and explicitly state they will not respect the outcomes of elections or the peaceful transfer of power? Put another way, if election deniers succeed in taking over elections and render our votes meaningless, is peaceful resistance to unpopular or unjust government policy even possible?
That said, while Electoral Count Act reform would protect against a 2020-type challenge, there are myriad other ways for an election-denying secretary of state, attorney general, or governor to gum up the electoral process, restrict voting rights, or sow confusion around elections. And presidential elections aren’t the only concern: They could cause problems for other races too, and almost certainly will where they’re virtually certain to win. Absent major (and unlikely) political reform, they’re going to continue to pose a risk as long as they remain so influential within the GOP. — Travis.
