I don't know that this is true. How many Democrats has she betrayed in her first term in office? Do you think they'd line up to vote for her over someone like Gallego? Depending on who the GOP nominates, she could pull from them.
Which Republicans voted for Biden's judicial nominees, and the legislation that was passed during this Congress?
But agree that 2024 will be a chance for Democrats to replace her in the Senate. I don't think she can win as an independent, especially not one who betrayed Democratic voters. The real question, then, is will she be replaced by a Democrat, like Gallego, or will she be a spoiler and get herself replaced by a Republican?
Unclear whether this is true. I'd probably take her over a Republican unless 2024 goes extremely well for Democrats and her vote is unneeded. But incumbency does have huge advantages, so ceding the seat to a Republican is probably a bad idea. It might be better to bide their time and then oust her in 2030, rather than handing the seat to Republicans, if it looks like 2024 will be tight.
This move will definitely cost us the Senate in 2024 but I think it's better to let a republican get in for six years than to cave to simena's disgusting tactics.
