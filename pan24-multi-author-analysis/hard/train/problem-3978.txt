like, can I get some context please? why is germany blocking brazil from exporting weapons to the philippines just because they don't want to send military equipment to a conflict they have no relation to?
If Brazil doesn't want Germany dictating who they can export to they should stop signing contracts with Germany to buy systems to put in said exports saying Germany has to approve all exports of those systems.
"Germany is producing critical parts of the tanks and Brazil has signed a treaty to not export them without germany's acceptance which is absolutely in line with all treaties of that kind.".
Hm. While you are certainly right that many people here (and in general) tend to grossly oversimplify political calculations that they don't even grasp (and this is very much so not limited to westerners), it would be foolish to assume that the people in the federal chancellery, the ministries and the Bundestag are doing the same. In case you still do, let me assure you that we know what we're doing. Most of the time, at least. There is a significant apparatus in place to deliver well rounded background information, and they are good chaps that haven't disappointed me for what its worth.
