I will say that the major force to having to have both parents work, as a must not a choice does play into this and its not "all their" fault. That being said, its still like 90% failure on parents.
Letting a 7 year old explore the internet without guidance and oversight is like letting your child run loose to wherever they want in the outside world.
I would say limited internet access for anyone under 16, maybe even 17, I don't think it should be law but I wish more parents were more proactive with their kids.
I can tell you people do consider it bad parenting if you don't have communications at all times now and I can assure you that 11 is the minimum age with many expecting you to provide a phone at a much lower age.
Also ITT: Parents who don't want to interact with or parent their kids, and distract them with phones to avoid parenting their children.
ITT: Lots of parents who are offended by the idea they've done a bad parenting thing by giving their kids unfettered access to Snapchat and TikTok.
