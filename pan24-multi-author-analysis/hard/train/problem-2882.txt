6 months later, in the basement of some government building, a worker is seen pushing a button once every minute on the minute. Coincidentally, once a minute, every minute, a missile has been hitting Putins last known location.
I'm pretty sure if a Russian missile landed near Biden's hotel, B-2 bombers will be flying all over Moscow the next day.
It's the same reason why the US and Russia always notify the other about every single ICBM test or rocket launch they plan to do.
Russia and the US might be rivals, but they aren't idiots and regularly share information like this.
Like we know Russia REALLY doesn't want to actually start shit with America itself, despite the constant bluster. So they probably canceled the days volley of missles towards Kiev, just in case. Incredible. Really shows the hierarchy.
With all the bluster of tsunami nuking Manhatten, Russia is terrified of having to actually go toe to toe with the US itself.
Look how many wars the US started to revenge 911. Think about how many we would start if our 1 enemy killed our president. Dead meat.
