Agreed. Putting aside all the jokes I wouldn’t be surprised if this is an actual suicide. The guys entire life was the military and he was fired last month. I don’t think he was necessarily a “threat” to anyone although it’s Russia so who can say? Still I do get a sort of grim satisfaction when seeing high ranking Russians who supported Putin have their careers destroyed.
Look, I know you're not a Putin apologist, we frequent way to many of the same subs for that, but that was a bad take!
Some within the milblogger space, such as Igor Girkin have also been openly critical of Putin directly. Girkin was a separatist paramilitary commander in Ukraine during the initial separatist period, including as the Supreme Commander of the Donetsk People's Republic (one of the two separatist regions in the Donbas). He fell out of favor due to losing ground to the Ukrainian Army... and the very public shooting down of MH17 (as an Australian, we owe him 38 lives, but I'd settle for one).
They are pro-Ukrainian, but call out the Ukraine and the West's failures as well. Like Ukraine's recent strategic reservations about carrying out timely offensives due to concerns about the supply of western artillery and ammunition.
