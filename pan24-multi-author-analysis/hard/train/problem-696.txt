is what the FTC lawsuit says is an issue any different from whats going on currently with platform exclusivity deals? why are they only worried about it to stop this merger and not preventing exclusivity deals entirely?
Why should a deal be halted if the acquisition neither creates a monopoly or is likely to be used in the furtherance of monopolistic practices?
The question is, is 13% of the video game market a monopoly? I don't think it is, though it is certainly a large share. Does Microsoft engage in monopolistic practices as a video game publisher who also manufactures a console? Not as badly as Sony does, not as badly as Nintendo does, its two closest competitors, neither of which are Chinese companies or tied to authoritarian governments.
There's Tencent (Which is actually the biggest video game company, not Sony). There's NetEase, EA, Embracer Group, Apple, Warner Brothers, Square Enix, Take-Two, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Paradox. Konami is making a huge come back, and just posted its biggest year.
So, basically you have a deal, that although huge in the industry, doesn't give Microsoft a monopoly, doesn't make Microsoft the market share leader, and they use less predatory business practices with their current property than their closest competitors.
This is supposedly bad because it would make Microsoft the third largest publisher with the means to harm competition with their ability to affect console experiences for other publishers.
