There’s plenty to criticize the Founders on, but no one could say they didn’t have foresight. They specifically created a mechanism by which the Constitution could be changed because they knew America would eventually transform in ways they couldn’t foresee. The entire premise of “What would the Founders want?” is totally disingenuous. Especially since we all know the Con SCJ’s will abandon any pretense of “Originalism” once it becomes inconvenient for them.
The only reason for "originalism" is to use it as an argument to regress when the world around you changes in ways you don't care for. Originalism, applied to the 1st amendment, would mean that speech on the internet isn't protected and you can't record police; it would mean your electronic devices aren't protected against searches; Hell, you could make a ridiculous argument that any house built with fiberglass insulation isn't considered a "house", as used by the 3rd amendment, because fiberglass wasn't a thing back when it was written.
Ultimately, "originalism" is a theory that shouldn't even exist. It relies on treating the Constitution as a static document, which is expressly not what the founding fathers claimed it to be.
