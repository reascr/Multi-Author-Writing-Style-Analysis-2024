And that it's inspired by the Japanese 2ch to begin with, which hosts the dregs of society and just like 4chan has a looooong list of rapists, pedophiles, murderers, etc among its frequent users.
Of course. Japan is famous for having stupid fringe ideologies run amok (conspiracy nutjobs, fucked up sects and cults, and various related extremists etc).
I think people tend to overlook how insane the cultist ideologies that exist in Japan are. There are a good amount of religious cults that exist there that are so fucking bad that there are people that pretend to be normal, befriend you, and drag you into some indoctrination ceremony to have you join with forced coercion. They straight-up have double/sleeper agents for this shit! It's not surprising that there are Qanon fanatics there.
