It’s a gutsy move, but it’d work out. The insurrection caucus hates McCarthy guts, they won’t vote for anything he wants. And anything he passes without being bipartisan won’t make it through the senate. They’ll spend the next 2 years screaming about McCarthy instead of getting anything done. Win win for Dems.
> The Dems made an offer. They’ll back McCarthy if he puts in rules that he must pass a budget (can’t shut down the government) and must increase the debt limit (can’t default on debt). So, you have to actually do your job. They offered this yesterday.
I doubt this is anything more than talk. But it makes the Democrats look reasonable while pressuring the GOP .
Only a damn Democrat would capitulate to Republicans at a time like this. Jefferies has consistently been getting 212 votes, which is way more than McCarthy. If there's a coalition it should be Republicans voting for Jefferies, and not 18-20 Democrats voting for the fascist McCarthy.
Sounds like a reporter asked "Would you be open to forming a majority coalition with the Republicans?".
She said "Anything that gets us communicating with each other" and the reporter took that as a yes when it's obviously avoiding answering no.
