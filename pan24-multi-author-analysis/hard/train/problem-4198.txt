Like they were so super concerned about the Mueller report, you know - that report that DEFINITIVELY showed an actual and very concerning connection between Russian spies and the Trump Election Campaign senior management….
The Mueller investigation was focused on Russia because Trump and a bunch of key officials in his administration were directly compromised by Russia.
Trump’s dealing with Saudi, UAE, and Israel are corrupt, but his dealings with Russia are a threat to western democracy in our war with global fascism.
All of that doesn’t preclude the fact that Trump and Kushner were also compromised by Saudi, the UAE, and Israel.
The fact is there was plenty of evidence that Israel, Saudi Arabia and UAE were backing Trump and were likely involved in election interference to help him win in 2016. Not only did Mueller go out of his way to avoid that rabbit hole, so did the Democrats. Everything was focused on Russia. There was so much emphasis and attention placed on the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian government proxies, where all they talked about was adoptions, which was code for lifting sanctions. What few in the media focused on was a far more important Trump Tower meeting 3 months before the US election where emissaries of Israel, Saudi Arabia and UAE literally offered to help Trump win. It was reported on in the NYTimes but the story got zero traction. Everyone in the media was obsessed by Russia.
