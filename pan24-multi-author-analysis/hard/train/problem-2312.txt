Most of the west is grassland plains, not desert. The Great Plains as it's called, makes up a third of the US land. Though some areas have been utterly ruined by human actions and can't really be called grassland anymore. Still, with a bit of water and some caring we could make the Great Plains great again!
Nope, most of the west is not a desert. Most of it is grassland plains, and has been so for thousands of years. Those grassland plains are also a major breadbasket for not only our nation, but for many others as well. Now the southwest has many areas that are deserts, but there are some health benefits for people to live there. Like people who have asthma or bad allergies to plant pollen have it easier there.
Good, the only pipelines we should be building are ones for fresh drinkable water to be moved across the country. At least when those inevitably leak they won't destroy the local ecosystem and contaminate the land with all the chemicals we see in oil pipelines.
So yes it is habitable, but you are correct that humans have caused a lot of damage to the environment through our lifestyle choices.
People out west always try to ruin the environment and shape the environment to fit their bad lifestyles. It is a desert. Stop trying to pretend it is habitable.
