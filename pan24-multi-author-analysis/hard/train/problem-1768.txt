THIS. We eventually got two rounds of PPP and it didn’t even cover 40% of our actual hard costs, yet we paid every single staff member their wages to stay at home for all the lockdowns out of our personal savings. However, we had to wait months because the first round went in seconds despite me applying the literal moment it was available.
I then found out about Ritz Carlton, a company that didn’t qualify both in size and revenue receiving $800m due to them quickly setting up LLCs for each department in their massive hotels, claiming each department was a separate company and therefore slipping under the employee number count.
You’re right. I’m the highest tier at my high street bank (private bank management etc) but we got closed out from PPP by large companies that had managers put them in the front of the line. That’s where all the first allocation of PPP funds went - to giant corporations that had dedicated managers to file for them.
Fraud was rife and Trump And Kushner both received millions in PPP funding. How is that not illegal and why aren’t conservatives asking for lynchings due to all the waste of tax payers money?
It confounds to no end how the GOP can whinge about misappropriated government spending... And then waste all of our time and fucking money investigating a gesture to save the citizenry time and money.
Here, let's save taxpayers the money for this sham non-investigation of a made-up Republican fake nonscandal and tell the public what the results of the investigation actually are.
Good to see our tax payer dollars are being put to good use and not on frivolous investigations that will result in anything actionable that benefits the American public. /s.
