Well, given that ballots still have about 24 hours to arrive to an elections office, if they were postmarked on Nov 8, it's...kind of impossible for vote counting to have concluded counting all votes by now. Literally could not have happened, if ballots are still in the mail.
Ah, there's the difference, in California, you're allowed to legally drop your vote in the mail the day before election day, have it postmarked on election day, and have it arrive after election day, and be counted.
Hey, if you could point to a system that allows a legal vote dropped into a mailbox the day before election day, and postmarked on election day, and received by the elections office 3 days after election day, to be counted on the night of election day, I'm all for it, but it sounds reality-bending.
Actually the state allows for a couple of weeks for ballots to arrive as long as they're post marked on or before election day to account for any postal errors.
Also does Canada allow up to 7 days for ballots to be delivered if they were post marked by election day.
Mail in ballots have to arrive by election day. But again, there's no reason they should accept them afterwards.
