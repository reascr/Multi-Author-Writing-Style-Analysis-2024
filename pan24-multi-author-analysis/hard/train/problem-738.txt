My bet would be on Nikki Haley being the last one standing. Pompey and Pence have the same charisma problems and Republicans love to point at their token minority candidates.
The only thing keeping the GOP hopes alive for a presidential victory in 2024 is the lack of a charismatic candidate from the Democrats. If the Dems had someone like Obama running, they would have no chance in hell.
What they need to happen is Trump to withdraw and endorse Desantis. Which won’t happen. Then they need to adjust their platform to appeal to younger voter voters and more centrist voters. Which also won’t happen.
Uh no they won’t. Have you seen the outrageous levels of hypocrisy the republicans are willing to stoop to? Where’s my explanation for turtle boy blocking Obama’s pick for Scotus and then turning around and doing the same thing? When you have no honor and completely flexible morals there’s no need to explain anything. Neocons don’t vote for explanations, they vote to “own the libs.” Remember when all the super “pro-life” repubs were pushing Herschel for governor just ignored his ex girlfriends coming forward with the receipts for the abortions he paid for? He lost but just barely and that wasn’t a primary. You don’t need explanations when you can say the magic words “fake news!”.
It’s going to be quite the circus. I gotta say, as much of a douchebag president Trump was if he actually has managed to bring the Republican Party to its knees just like Lindsey Graham said he would he may very well turn out to be the most influential PUSA of my lifetime.
