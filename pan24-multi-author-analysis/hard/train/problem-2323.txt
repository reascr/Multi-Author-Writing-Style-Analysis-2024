The translation here is idiomatically incorrect. He didn't say Putin is a "nobody" as if he was a loser. He suggested that Putin doesn't exist, being either dead or incapacitated, and therefore cannot possibly meet to discuss terms with Ukraine.
This is the second or third time in the last week that he has alleged Putin is dead or at the very least, not making decisions in Russia anymore.
I'm talking idiomatically not literally. He's not saying Putin is "nothing" as if he's a loser like most people in the thread are implying. He's suggesting that Putin isn't the decision maker in Russia.
To me its more likely that either Zelensky is genuinely pointing out Putins absence or he wants to provoke Putin for whatever reason.
Accusing Putin of being dead also probably stems from the old USSR tactic of hiding leaders as internal power struggles ensue. Putin dying would be a change of pace but it unlikely, my money is more on him laying low because he feel and pooped his pants and now he must wait until enough time has passed that everyone can just forget about it, he is Birthday Boy for life after all.
I was so bummed when that CnC project got cancelled that was supposed to let you play as every faction from the Red Alert, Tiberium Sun and even Generals games, don't even remember what its' name was. Crying shame though, would've loved to do a Soviets vs. Nod skirmish. Could've done without the Scrin and Rising Sun though, those felt forced imo.
