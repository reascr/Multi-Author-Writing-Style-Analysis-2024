My brain is tired and I may have misremembered some of that. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
I think it was the day after inauguration: Trump, Kislyak, and Lavrov together in the Oval Office with an official TASS photographer, not a single American present. If TASS hadn't released the photo, we'd never know it happened.
Wikileaks released the hacked DNC emails within a hour of the Access Hollywood tape being aired on TV. There was nothing in the emails but some chicken recipes and normal DNC business but the entire U.S. media turned on a dime from "grab 'em by the pussy" to "hacked DNC emails.".
P.S. - I'm not defending Trump. I'm just saying that buying Greenland seems to have the same kind of upside as the or the .
Why does everybody think buying Greenland is a bad idea? It apparently has huge mineral reserves that are being exposed as the ice melts, and when the North Pole is ice free for extended periods Greenland is poised to be a huge shipping distribution hub between the Pacific and Atlantic.
Now of everything on this list, I would say purchasing Greenland was probably the most same and forward thinking, as it would have given us control over most of the North Atlantic/polar sea which, thanks to Republicans, is becoming more ocean than ice and can be a valuable shipping lane in the coming years.
