Unpopular opinion, now, can we restrict EBT cards from being used to purchase goods that almost guarantee obesity, diabetes and heart disease? I'm looking at you, liter sodas, candy bars, etc. I mean, you can't buy cigarettes or liquor with EBTs, but pure corn syrup, we're apparently okay with that?
Edit: I should add the underappreciated impact of lobbying by industrial food (corn) producers like Archer- Daniels- Midland, Monsanto, etc can't be overstated in policies like allowing these foods to be subsidized.
Nope. I didn't make up the fact that diabetes afflicts economically depressed populations at a higher rate than the population at large. But you know this.
There is another side to this. As a kid my family was on food stamps (EBT), my sister, brother and me all got low blood sugar often. In my brother it never got too bad but me and my sister brother feinted from it on occasion. Me more than anyone else. Because of this it was necessary for us to have high sugar stuff around because if I didn't eat every couple hours I could go down and having something to get the blood sugar back up quickly when I noticed the signs was very important. I have a high metabolism and have always been energetic so I would burn through calories faster than most. It took me a long time to get used to the fact that I have to eat frequently even if I'm not hungry and I'm able to mostly manage it now but still there are times at work where I have had to sit down and get someone to bring me a candy bar so I wouldn't drop.
