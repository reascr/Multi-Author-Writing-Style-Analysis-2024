So to be clear, NZ law already states that it’s illegal to discriminate against someone based on their age from age 16. So this decision applies specifically to 16 and 17 year olds, since the current voting age is 18.
What this ruling is about is it that there is no solid justification put forth as to why a 16 year old can't vote, but an 18 year old can.
Seems like a pretty open-and-shut case that it is illegal to restrict voting to people ages 18 and above, since that is clear age-based discrimination.
The Supreme Court has declared that the current law preventing 16 and 17-year-olds from voting is unjustified discrimination and inconsistent with the Bill of Rights.
The Human Rights Act says that you can't discriminate against people over 16 based on age, but leaves open legal discrimination on the basis of age for people under 16:
“If the government does not make the voting age 16 now then they are consciously breaching our human rights.”.
“Today New Zealand’s highest court has confirmed that stopping young people from voting is a breach of our human rights. Preventing me and other 16 and 17 year-olds from voting is an unjustified breach of our right to be free from age discrimination. The government and Parliament cannot ignore such a clear legal and moral message. They must let us vote.”.
