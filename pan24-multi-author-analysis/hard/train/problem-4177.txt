Don't give them ideas. My wife grew up in rural PA, and for some reason, her school had a real problem with her being left-handed. She had teachers that forced her to use her right hand for everything. To this day she still has problems with her handwriting.
They also get to further hurt the LGBTQ+ community during the whole process, and get to point at drag queens as "causing the kids to be trans" which is an added bonus for them.
I think the whole point is to find a way to ease into outright banning trans people. If they can wiggle their way into fully banning drag shows and/or labeling them as adult content, then they can move into labeling any trans person just walking down the street as being "obscene" or "offensive." It also lumps the two groups together for people who don't understand the differences, and pushes the narrative that trans people are only "performing.".
Of course. My post was actually fairly factual, just a bit out of date. Left handedness used to be thought a sign of demonic influence and so had to be forcefully “corrected”. This was accepted by many as 100% true and self-evident, because the church said so. What we’re so terrified of today, our descendants will think us barbarians not too far in the future, unless the evangelicals set us back another century, again.
