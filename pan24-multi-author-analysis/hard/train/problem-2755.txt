Not an expert but the biggest difference is likely to be more up to date fire control and battle management systems in the Challenger 2, as well as a better sensor / imaging package.
But the UK also has a much bigger military budget so this is indeed an impressive contribution from Morocco.
Morocco will also presumably receive an incentive, and I wouldn't be surprised if they get rewarded with more modern USA equipment.
Morocco is one the USA's oldest allies, and perhaps one of their biggest allies outside of NATO. It doesn't surprise me; it's had ups and downs but it's held strong.
Man, now I want Moroccan food. There was this awesome place near me run by a super cool, super talented Moroccan chef (when I say super cool, he taught Arabic and French at a local school, employed many students, paid well, treated them well, and taught them plenty while working). Sadly he couldn't get enough business to sustain it, but I don't think his end goal was to make a ton of money off it anyway. He considered it a "project" iirc. But damn it was good.
Which is 100% a good thing. The US should be helping pick up the tab here, and I am glad that my tax dollars helped pay for that as well.
