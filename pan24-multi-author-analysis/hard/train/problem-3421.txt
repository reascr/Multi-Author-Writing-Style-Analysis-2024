I guarantee that I care more about hard working Americans who vote GOP, than some of the representatives that they hire. I want hard working Americans, no matter how they vote, to get affordable food, shelter, health, and education. Why? Because it makes us all better.
If the US were to make a statement that, "If you work hard. We will make sure that food, shelter, health and education are affordable, if not free." And actually make that happen we would have less crimes, and be better as a country. However, the next question is how do we pay for that? The answer is tell the wealthy that some of their tax breaks / tax loopholes will be going away. Of course they don't want that. They want more profit for themselves. So they pay. They pay politicians, radio hosts, tv personalities to say the same bullshit. "If we just give the wealthy even more tax breaks we will be better as a country!" But you need a distraction or an enemy to prevent asking questions like, "Is the result of higher grocery prices because of a supply chain issue, or is it for-profit corporations wanting to make more profit?".
This is what I was thinking. The real question is : Why does the GOP base, who are outspoken enemies of the elites, continue to vote for GOP leadership that is very obviously the elite?
