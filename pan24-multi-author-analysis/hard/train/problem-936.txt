I’m a doctor. Currently got $340,000 in student loan debt (which is down almost $100,000 in the last 2 years). I don’t qualify for forgiveness. I support it, but also know it’s not a good answer to the problem of runaway cost of education and predatory loan rates (by our own government). I fortunately earn a great wage so I’ll do just fine without the one time forgiveness of $10,000. That being said, I think the lack of interest during COVID has done more for me and others than a one time payment can ever do. If they want to solve this issue they need to invest in citizens’ educations, not profit off of them.
Education is a public good if it, in some manner, contributes to the Gross Domestic Product. There is very little a guy with a PhD in Etruscan Nose Flutes is ever going to contribute.
It’s time to put that PhD in Cro-Magnon Musical Instruments to work (or start flipping burgers) and pay back what you owe. It’s high time you learn that nobody owes you a Goddamn thing.
I would, with conditions. Perhaps interest free for a number of years, with interest kicking in a year or two after the borrower begins generating revenue.
I think they're referring to "revenue" as in the borrower getting a job that provides more in income than they spend on necessities. The government already loses money offering student loans.
