Every single one of these "But why are they voting against their own self-interests?" articles misses this crucial point.
Hell, back in the 1960s the NRA supported gun control legislation because the Black Panthers were arming themselves in response to state reprisals. Guess who signed their favored bills into law? Ronald Reagan, California governor at the time.
I'm not sure what point you're arguing here. Are you simply saying that GOP voters must be rubes with no understanding of what they're supporting or....?
If you’re saying the GOP is lying, I generally agree. If you mean all people who vote Republican are lying about wanting less government and are actually authoritarian fascists, you’re vastly oversimplifying it.
I don’t think anyone has ever said ALL conservatives are fascists but to say you can’t see the fascist tendencies in the American Republican Party (especially in the past few years) is being academically dishonest at best. “Small government” means a lot of things to a lot of people. Many conservatives I know conflate “big government” with that time they had to wait 30min to get their photo taken at the DMV. Unless it happened to them personally or one of their own, they have difficulty empathizing with folks even if their economic interest align. For example, obviously I don’t want to lump all Latino people together but generally speaking as a group they tend to be very Catholic and pretty conservative. You would think the GOP would be all over that but I’m assuming leaders made a calculation and figure it wasn’t worth risking the 1/4-1/3 of GOP who can’t let go of their racism and xenophobia.
