Reflect on that a moment and then step back and recall what Chomsky said about how media filtering works.
You cut down an existing forest to make the pellets. If you cannot say for certain that you have trees growing at least equal to your rate of cutting and burning (and releases from soil after cutting) you cannot say for sure it is carbon neutral. If something happens to the forest grown to account for your cutting (and you must be sure it is not double counted as an offset for something else!) you cannot say for certain it is carbon neutral. In principle, in the absense of unforeseen events and perverse incentives, it can be. That doesn't mean it is in reality. It does mean you can convince people that GREEN MEANS GO and they can have whatever they want as long as they have what the market demands they pay for it.
The carbon neutrality of a legit pellet enterprise is only as good as their accounting for sequestration elsewhere, and they do not necessarily have control over that. One more forest fire than was accounted for at the start of the project and all that carbon that was supposed to cancel out the burning is up in the atmosphere.
The problem is not the danger of deforestation, but rather the emissions from burning wood and releasing it into the atmosphere. At least you don't get the ancient CO2 from coal or oil, but it's still multiple decades of CO2, and burning wood is also pretty dirty with a lot of fine particles and other gases that are troublesome.
Problem with burning is that it released CO2 immediately, and It takes decades to recapture the carbon, so really not carbon neutral for a long time.
This articles analysis limits their themselves to looking at initial CO2 use of biomass, rather than looking at the full lifecycle.
