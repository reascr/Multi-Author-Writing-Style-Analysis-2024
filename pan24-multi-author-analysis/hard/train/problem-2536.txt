In that there is no immunity to breaking the rules similar to what TFG attempted to get away with. Security Clearances and rules for classified material are the governance of the Executive. The Legislative can request (and will often be given clearance due to obvious oversight needs) but some sort of special select committee will probably not get along well with the WH. But the Legislative needs to play entirely by the rules laid out by the executive, and will be punished if they try to leak and or abuse classified material.
If they want to dictate how, or what, it would require passing laws that the executive branch would have to follow. That would be particularly hard given their position.
Sounds like a good way to get paid to grandstand and try and win in the court of public opinion. Fortunately though, the DOJ doesn't have to answer to Congress about their investigations like this, nor is there anything that says Congress can dictate how an investigation is done.
They may have to answer a subpoena, but it doesn't mean that Congress can dictate to them how and what to investigate.
Doesn't every part of the Executive Branch answer to congressional subpoenas? Their only defense is Executive Privilege, but that doesn't apply when Biden is specifically not involved in the investigation.
