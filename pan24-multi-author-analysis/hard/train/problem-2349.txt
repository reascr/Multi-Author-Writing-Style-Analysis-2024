The difference is that in Ukraine, the doubt was based solely upon Putin's decision to invade. In this case, it's much more about whether Russia can even get to the border.
That would require Russia to take back Kherson and to take over Odessa for this to be possible. I don't see either happening in early 2023.
However, it is very likely that taking over Moldova in early 2023 was a part of Russia's "grand-plan," so Moldova's intel chief is not entirely incorrect. But we all know by now that this "plan" was flushed down the toilet the moment Ukraine repelled the initial offensive.
If they had concentrated their entire offensive on the push to Kyiv, it may have worked out. Instead their forces- and their flawed logistics- were stretched along several huge axis of attacks Instead of just focused on one.
I'd also wager that they could have also targeted all the bridges over the Dnieper and taken the enfi Eastern Bank, splitting Ukraine in two and getting themselves a much easier front to defend against counterattack over the river.
