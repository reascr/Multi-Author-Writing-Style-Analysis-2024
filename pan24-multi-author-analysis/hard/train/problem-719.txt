not even including the wounded, its mind blowing that a modern country is losing so many people every day. The US army trains 50-60k soldiers a year. Last year they fell short of their goals at 45k trainees. If ukraines numbers are accurate enough, Russia has had a KIA equal to 3x the annual US army training for 2022. 9x losses if you include a 2 to 1 wounded to kill ratio.
So that would be like the US having 311,000 dead soldiers in one year of fighting or close to 1 million dead and wounded after a year of fighting with almost nothing to show for it.
No wonder Russia is having to snatch people off the streets and you know they are not getting even close to adequate training.
We know Ukraine will ultimately defeat tyranny, and the UK will continue to train and arm Ukrainian forces with the equipment they need.
“We will continue to support Ukraine to ensure a decisive military victory on the battlefield this year,” Sunak told MPs.
Sunak said the UK would stand with Ukraine “for years to come,” and backed a call by Labour Party leader Keir Starmer for Russia to be held accountable for crimes committed in Ukraine.
