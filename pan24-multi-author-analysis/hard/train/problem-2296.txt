Imagine if some random agency like the ATF went rogue and started murdering people and terrorizing the public. The Department of Justice would immediately cut off the agency’s funding to stop the carnage. And no one would bat an eye. But ‘defund the police’ makes people lose their minds, because they’ve been so conditioned to accept this shit as normal.
These are police officers that like to think they’re hardcore but in reality? They’re too chickenshit to sign up for the military. But they sure do like to pretend they are. This is why we have a 2A problem in the United States, also why people feel like they need to carry concealed.
We are held to a higher standard and often held accountable for fuckups like you mentioned above. But it is war and shit happens. Domestic law enforcement attacking civilians and it’s not even a war zone? What’s their excuse?
Shit happens in the fog of war. I’m not justifying or excusing it. I find it reprehensible as fuck. It’s why I didn’t renew my contract after the second time. I did 12 years and got out under Obama. Believe me, I know there’s a lot of former military dudes now in law enforcement. A few police agencies tried recruiting me after I got out and I told them to kick rocks.
