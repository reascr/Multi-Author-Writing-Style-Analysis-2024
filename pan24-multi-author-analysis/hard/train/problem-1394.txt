I think the point is that it's a Pyrrhic victory. If the defense costs more than the attack, then repeated successful defens eventually leads to a Russian victory.
To be a success, the reply would be to indicate that these defenses enable Ukrain to continue it's defense and that is why it isn't a net loss.
Except the defensive missiles don't really cost Ukraine anything and the West is happy to be able to have the real life proving ground for their defense systems.
Edit: Because there was some confusion, I was talking about Russia using S-300 missiles to attack ground targets, not using S-300s for AA defense. That is why the cost comparison between S-300 missile and Shahed drone is relevatant.
Compared to most modern munitions, these drones are very cheaply made and cheaply bought. Some of the reports I've seen say these Shahed drones are $50,000 to $70,000. When you compare that to a single S-300/S-400 missile costing more than $1,000,000, these drones are very cheap.
They've been using cheaper defense measures against the Shahed drones. The Gepard flak cannons as well as mobile teams of heavy machine gun crew have been picking up a lot of the slack on these. Not sure what the exact ratios of intercepts are but the UA and western support are well aware of the issues of dealing with low cost drones.
