My assertion that if three of the worlds largest producers of raw materials AND advanced technologies with a bonus of gigantic cheap labor force to boot got together- the world wouldn't be able to fight back is on point. You forget that plenty of alliances would be forged in order to buddy up with the big three. I only asked about what you assumed in order to understand what exactly would bring you to the idea that anyone can fight a united US, Rus and now a Chinese front that you added onto my original thought...and Brazil for some odd reason.
And yes, please do tell who would be the big enemy that these three would have trouble flattening together. Entirety of Africa? Or south America? Or EU could stand a chance at all? Maybe if an independence day scenario happened we'd see that kind of cooperation between these nations.. but you're assuming way too much and crediting powers to a president that he simply doesn't possess. If nothing else cultural differences alone wouldn't allow for unity. The world requires these big nations to be at odds in order to maintain a balance and keep citizens fed. Big difference between diplomacy and intricacies involved in negotiations between nations for a more united (self interest focused) world and a full blown alliance and cooperation.
Obviously you're very anti Trump, which bothers me none. What bothers me is you thinking that Trump would miraculously unite these three and there would be "Western allies" without US.
Frustratingly confusing would be exactly the way to describe it, and Western allies would not have any idea what to do. Your assertion that there would be no one to fight is beyond ridiculous.
