Fun facts. The sanctions placed on Belarus originally had nothing to do with its support for Russia. They were there as a response to the crackdown on the 10 month long protests following the previous Belarussian election. Lukashenko's grip on power was so tenuous that he was forced to call upon Russia to help put them down.
Makes you wonder where we'd be if Yanukovych had had the courage to hold out for Russian support. Would Ukraine be like Belarus now, its population living with sanctions applied on Ukraine in an attempt to punish the old elite. While we, brave and righteous redditors that we are, tell them to just revolt if they want the sanctions removed.
I'm talking about the 2013-2014 Ukrainian protests and revolution that saw the pro-Russian Yanukovych (then Ukrainian president) chased out of Ukraine.
When Ukrainians came out in protest to sham elections, they built barricades and threw Molotov cocktails until they won.
When Belarusians came out in protest to sham elections, they took their shoes off and stood on benches until they got manhandled and ran.
