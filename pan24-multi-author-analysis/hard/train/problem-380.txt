We’re not innocent by any means. The US has done plenty of shady regime change shit, interfered with elections that were prob going to have socialists win but NATO came into existence after two very costly world wars to try and keep that from happening again. Both Europe and the US knew that once Germany was vanquished, Russia was the next largest threat to that peace because Stalin was a psycho. Seems Putin would like to become a psycho rival to Stalin with this brainless move to invade Ukraine. He most likely thought he’d get away with it like the other questionable military actions he’s engaged in. Problem is this time he picked a country right on Europe’s doorstep. We’d be looking at a very different conflict right now if Trump had won.
Heard the Russians had to stop using them because guess what? Those drones were designed and made to work in the high temps present in Iran, not the frigid winter temps of Ukraine.
Iran had drone operators in Russia. A missile strike hit a base, said to be where the saheed drones were being flown from.
