Xi will be fine if he does nothing, i.e. don't invade Taiwan, don't lock people up like in 2022, don't put out any bright ideas like banning an industry overnight...
Stop making it seem like its the democratic west holding back China. It is literally its own leaders and totalitarian system.
Yeah because the powermad despots in the CCP are powermad. They literally want total control of every side of life, economy and the world. Why else would they have the most sophisticated surveillancesystem in the world and constantly act hypocritically and like a total loser. This system allows NO true competition unlike the west.
If China was democratic, free with open elections then no lol. China would be a titan of stability unlile today.
right titan of stability like India? And no western countries would ever survey their citizens, US surely have stopped since Snowden. Or have they outsourced it to other nations in the 5 eyes to get around spying on their own. China will never be able to align with the west unless they lack the ability to become a peer with the US, no matter what their form of government it is. Never in history has the dominant power allowed a rising power to peacefully become its peer. But like you said if Chinas leaders are so inept and they have no market competition then dont worry about them they will never come close to the US right.
