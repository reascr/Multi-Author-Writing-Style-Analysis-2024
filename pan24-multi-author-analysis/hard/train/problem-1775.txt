In the event the GOP intends to go all of the way with this, Biden should raise the debt ceiling himself using the 14th Amendment. Force the courts to stop him.
If they don’t get their way the leverage they intend to use is a completely Washinon-caused financial crisis, fully expecting Biden will take the blame since he would be presiding over the economy if the country defaults.
The GOP is playing “the extortion game” just like they did in 2011… they suddenly want to balance the budget by cutting Medicaid, Medicare and everything except defense while drawing a red line at revenue (tax increases) in any negotiations.
Just like Nixon's "secret plan to end the war", which of course, was not a secret plan to end the war, Republicans always talk about how they want to reduce the national debt, then when they get control of the congress/white house they run up the dent even more because they have no intentions or plans to reduce the national debt just change the spending to the things they want to spend on...... That is the Republican's plan.
