I’m not against intervention globally but the US should think longer and harder about the consequences before hitting everything like a nail bc all we have is a hammer. This was the consequence of the dumbest people being in charge of the west too.
we have had some spectacular failures around the world too. Afghanistan being the latest but Libya is another recent example. Like I said, I’m not against intervention but I remember reading excerpts of Hillary Clinton’s emails and they said something like “convincing Obama to bomb Libya is our greatest foreign policy achievement” and then later “omg we never could have guessed what would happen later” as the situation devolved into what it is today. Too little thought goes into what could happen if things go sideways.
Quite right. Going further, whose idea was it that led to that? sadly, it goes back to US imperialism and “regime change”.
This is unfortunately not new for this regime. If you are someone they consider a dissident, they have no regard for decency towards you or your family.
This is who this regime is. It’s who they’ve always been. It’s why we want a regime change. They are cruel to the core.
