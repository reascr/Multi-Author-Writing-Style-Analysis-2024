Sanctions could work but they would have to be catastrophic for both sides to have a chance. Haven't seen evidence of any willingness to do that.
Doesn't work if the choice is a country dominating the world one nation at a time with the threat of nuclear war if anyone intervenes.
1) Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, really anybody - will use this nuclear blackmail strategy to get what they want. We’d be in for a shit future.
I just want to clarify that anybody labeling proxy, compares it to the fear of “communism” spreading or other small-ish consequences in this the past.
Second, no one said anything about proxy wars being bad (or at least worse than the alternative). It was an observation that we're already regressing back to the cold war era a bit just by nature of the groups taking sides with funding the Ukraine/Russia war.
I put it in quotes just to say that Ukraine falling is about as serious of a threat to global freedom as we’ve had since WWII!
Ukraine isn’t third world, they are best described as former second world (soviet bloc) and now first world (aligned with US and western Europe).
the meaning of “third world” shifted over time to just mean “poor countries” but Ukraine isnt that either.
