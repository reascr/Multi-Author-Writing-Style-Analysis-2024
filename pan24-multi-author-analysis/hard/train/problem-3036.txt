The whole 2A thing is just a political sleight of hand thing, just like a magician does. It is a distraction from what the GOP really does.

The GOP has convinced the gun nutters so much that nobody will dare to take away their rights as long as they can have their guns, that those nutters have become blind to see that the GOP is doing just that. Like freedom of speech, or the right to organise, or the right of religious freedom, the GOP is all in favor of limiting those rights.
