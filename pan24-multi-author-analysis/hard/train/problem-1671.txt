Or perhaps nihilistically trying to extract concessions. If Hungary has already decided that it does not care about being seen as a jerk, then why not make Western Europe pay Hungary in what is essentially a hostage situation? Hungary is of course acting immorally and in bad faith, and everybody would be poorer if everybody acted like Hungary.
I am sure there are other NATO friendly airbases in Europe. There might be reasons to not kick Hungary out, but airbases seem unlikely to be a good reason.
With regards to Hungary, there are mechanisms in the EU to at least make it unpleasant for Hungary. But unfortunately Poland has been protecting Hungary. Which is quite interesting, how that Hungary more or less supports Putin, while Poland is super anti Putin and supporting Ukraine.
Yeah sure, Orb√°n would give Hungary to Putin in an instant and you would have Russian military bases in central Europe.
Hungary, the NATO country working for Russia. If NATO needs fast access to help Ukraine, Hungary will be stalling them and putting up resistance, basically helping Russia. Kick putin!
