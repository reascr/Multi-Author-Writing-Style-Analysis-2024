"the new rule does not affect stabilizing braces that are "objectively designed and intended as a ‘stabilizing brace’ for use by individuals with disabilities, and not for shouldering the weapon as a rifle.".
The goal of this seems to stop the "braces" that are really just rifle stocks and not the type of braces that form around the forearm and can't really be shouldered.
Please not that the rationale for all this is that braces mounted on pistols make them more concealable. Except that that is absurd, they make pistols _less_ concealable. The whole thing is performative and will make zero difference in violent crime.
The new 233 page rule was written by the Department of Justice, not the ATF, at the instruction of the President, to make gun regulation conform to the President's personal preferences.
The new, less corrupt President promised not to further politicize regulatory agencies, but he made it all the way to February before he tried to push a professional gun control lobbyist in as Director of the ATF. And he made it til April before he decided to write a blizzard of gun regulations from the Resolute Desk. Regulations that can put people in federal prison for ten years who were obeying the law.
