They don't even charge the priests with a crime! They let them get transferred to a new church and start over. It's nuts.
I see religion is the major factor dividing people, creating hate, and motivating terrorist acts and even wars.
You mean, the pope that publicly admitted actively covering up the abuse of priests for his entire career, enabling the abuse of children for decades, and never once helped a victim or assisted authorities?
I misread the headline and thought it was talking about a single priest abusing nearly 5000 children over 70 years, or about 1 child per week, and I was absolutely flabbergasted trying to imagine how one pedophile found the time for so much molestation.
Worse, I read about a priest accused of molestation by some 30 or so men, the church paid the families off and moved the priest to a school for deaf kids no lie.
I also blame the church more for how they keep on handling things and protect abusers they know are targeting children than the fact they realized they have child molestors amongst them.
And yeah I do hate pedophiles and every single person that protects them - which has been and still is the Catholic church's MO.
My point is that the priests were pedophiles long before becoming priests. It's a long time safe haven for them. Do we really think they believe any of what they preach? I know, let God handle it, I'm sure He will.
