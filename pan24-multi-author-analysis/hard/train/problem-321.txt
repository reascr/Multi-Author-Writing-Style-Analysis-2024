I think Trump takes a deal to avoid any further investigations and to avoid a potential prison sentence. He pleads guilty to a lesser charge, pays his millions in fines, avoids jail time, and goes back to his excessive complaining about everyone being against him and everything being rigged. Part of that plea deal though is that the charge he pleads guilty to prevents him from running for public office ever again.
Which leaves Pence and Cheney. Pence, the one who is very much pretty far right, but not MAGA and still respected the results of the 2020 election, and Cheney, who is more to the middle than Pence, and has been the most prominent opponent of Trump from the very beginning. My guess is Pence gets the nomination and Cheney accepts his offer to run as his VP. That's my official prediction for the 2024 Republican ticket. Pence/Cheney vs Biden/Harris. I think Biden/Harris win big because the MAGA crowd won't turn out to vote for that particular ticket.
If the GOP doesnâ€™t figure out how to keep Nikki Haley, Pence, Tom Cotton and Younkin etc.. from running, Trump will be their nominee. And they will lose again.
And so the GOP is poised to repeat the mistakes of 2016: have a super crowded field of candidates, that split 70% of the primary votes while Trump grabs the hardline 30% who will always vote for him, no matter what.
I think it's very much up in the air at this point, and Trump's influence as a third party candidate seems to be way over-estimated, especially after the 2022 midterm results.
That will not be true in 2024, especially with hundreds of thousands of avoidable covid deaths to his credit, an insurrection, and so on.
Perhaps, perhaps not. In 2015, Trump had the benefit of being a novelty (as in newcomer) on the national stage, a Washinon outsider, and no political record to defend.
