The same US investigation says it wasn't deliberate: "This investigation was biased BS from the start Totally untrustworthy Except that other part that confirms what I already thought!".
Yes. Though one could agrue that it might be useful for other Palestinian cases against Israel in the ICC.
have you read what al jazeera said about the Israeli investigation? They may not agree with the conclusions, but seem to acknowledge Israel did investigate.
So Israel did look into it, and they did accept a certain amount of responsibility. Not sure how this doesn't contradict your claim Israel never investigated, and denied everything. (your accusation of Israel lying may still be accurate, I have no way to determine that. and unless you are privy to all the information from the Israeli side, you probably cannot prove it either. Still I cannot disprove that claim - Although the US does back up the Israeli version).
Didn't Israel, and the US already investigate this, and basically concluded it was an errant IDF bullet?
The US investigation says that bullet was likely fired by IDF: "SEE? This 100% proves it was an Israeli bullet. Thank goodness we finally have an honest investigation!".
Yup. And it was funny seeing people talk about it after they had already decided before any information was out there that Israel had deliberately targeted her.
