You need to find better sources. Either Spain would be sending grossly outdated equipment from WWII, or they are sending 80% of their stock of Leopards for that number to be true. The 321 number only makes sense if all armored vehicles are included. The stated goal for the EU is to provide enough tanks to field two battalions, that's roughly 90 tanks.
This has to be a misunderstanding. They've been pledged 70 tanks so far, I'm guessing this means all armored equipment equipment to include the Bradleys from earlier in the month.
And it’s gonna be supported through proper combined arms with all the strykers Bradley’s and all the other light tanks and apcs being sent plus all the non self propelled artillery already there.
Considering how effective the small amounts of himars and self propelled artillery has been it’s gonna be pretty wild to see how all this armor does.
Well I’m thinking the Iraqi army and especially the republican gaurd were a far better force than Russia is currently.
Not a military guy but why will the western tanks fare any better than the russian tanks that we have all seen being blown up by the Ukraine military?
