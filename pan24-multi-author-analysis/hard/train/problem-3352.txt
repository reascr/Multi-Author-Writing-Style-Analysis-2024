I live in Europe and all police encounters where pleasant exept one where I had a car crash and the police didn't even leave their cars to properly asses the situation.
One thing I do find wird about American police is the road side sobriaty test why does police still use it at all we do have breathalyzer. In Austria if you get pulled over and the police whants to check your alcohol lvl they do a breathalyzer but you can also instead demand a blood draw wich will make the police less friendly because this annoys them to no end but why are American cops still sticking to sobriaty tests instead of using a breathalyzer instead those things are not even expensive.
Yes I can list them all to you in Austria we have 3 types of weapon catagorise. Catagory A, B and C.
I find it Stange that this is not something tought here since to become a police officer you have to complete your 1 year of mandetory service in the millitary normaly you can also compleat it as a civil servant doing stuff like being a paramedic or caring for the elderly but to specificly become police you need to have served. Keeping that in mind you would think this makes police even more agresive but aparently it doesn't.
The people we want to become cops won't become cops because of the way we view the cops.. The only people left are the people we'd rather not have become cops.
