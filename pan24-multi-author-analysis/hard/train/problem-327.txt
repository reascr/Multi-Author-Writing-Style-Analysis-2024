IMO: Yes Presidents should still have the power to unilaterally act during a crisis... the democratic process is often too slow and fraught with endless debates, arguing, and gerrymandering (edit: Filibusters) to get things done when they need to get done NOW.
Yes, we're starting to see a trend where an emergency is declared or taken advantage of in order to get through a policy decision that Presidents can't get through Congress. That wasn't the intent of it, the goal is to give the President some leeway to respond quickly to emergencies while Congress spins up to provide longer-lasting relief. Some more guardrails or restrictions on emergency powers are needed.
Agreed. There was bipartisan effort after the fight over the border wall to reign in Executive emergency powers, but the GOP tried to play politics and let Trump build his wall. Sadly it died and we didn't get any more traction on it. But I agree that we really need to address the emergency powers issue to prevent abuse.
Using emergencies as a 'Tactic', should have some kind of oversight, but not to the degree of preventing its use when it's needed. I do like the idea of auto-expiring periods where extensions need to be confirmed.
In Canada they have auto-expiring periods of emergency periods, that then need to be extended. They also tend to have parliamentary commissions after the fact that investigate the use of power and what exactly was done and the impacts.
It's a little different though because the democratic process isn't so slow. Often times parties have a majority and can really pass any bill they want.
