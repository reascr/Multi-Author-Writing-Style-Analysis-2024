Yes, like Europe and America. France is still stealing money from African countries, and assassinating leaders that try to pull out of their predatory and corrupt nonsense. still punishing Haiti for their Slave rebellion, their fines are still causing terrible effects in their economy. British colonists still have most of the money and land in South Africa and still enslave- sorry, “Employ” black people over there.
It’s important to consider most of these migrant workers are males, from African countries and Asian countries. You people pretend to care about them but everytime too many blacks or Asians sit in your country you cry “Rape” and “White genocide”.
How the fuck is talking about notorious slave states and colonial powers fucking “Justifying” slavery?
You think countries that are poor/somewhere in the middle right now didn't meddle in slavery? Didn't have a genocide or two? Don't have/had way bigger problems with corruption than the rich country club?
It's really nice to see corruption starts to get uncovered. It's a long way to transparent and fair "democracy". There's this german former minister Sigmar Gabriel who makes similar comments on how the conditions of the foreign workers have changed so much for the better. Always sounds so fishy...
