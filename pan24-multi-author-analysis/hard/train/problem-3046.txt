Yes but no. They got out more energy than the lasers put in. But the lasers themselves and all the supporting machinery that power them used orders of magnitude more energy than that in order to produce the laser light pulse.
"While the pellet released more energy than the lasers put in, the calculation does not include the 300 or so megajoules needed to power up the lasers in the first place. The NIF lasers fire about once a day, but a power plant would need to heat targets 10 times per second. Then there is the cost of the targets. The ones used in the US experiment cost tens of thousands of dollars, but for a viable power plant, they would need to cost pence. Another issue is how to get the energy out as heat.".
"In the latest experiment, researchers pumped in 2.05 megajoules of laser energy and got about 3.15MJ out â€“ a roughly 50% gain and a sign that fusion reactions in the pellet were driving further fusion reactions.".
Even those working on Fusion agree we are still decades, at least, from it being a viable source of energy.
