Western countries will publicly support peaceful protests but supporting a revolution in another country is very different.
That is why most western countries and article don't use this word even if there might be a few revolutionary among them. You essentially would justify Iran using armed force against them.
Edit: I might have not expressed myself clearly enough. There are good reasons to not call it a revolution even if you think it is. That is why you see this term rarely used.
Iran killing protestors is a breach of human rights. Iran defending themselves against an armed revolution is not. If the UN and other governments were to call this a revolution it would be very bad for the people living there (unless they do have weapons to defend themselves by then).
Or the criticism is that we will bomb civilians for 20 years, leave, and then immediately the group they claimed to protect are back where they started under the oppressive government but now with more dead people.
Lol unarmed protesters have no chance, they will continue to be slaughtered until their will is broken as has happened every time unarmed protesters have gone up against an autocratic regime. For every Gahndi and MLK you need a Singh and Malcom X.
