They aren't righteous. They know it's wrong, but when the people telling you to not buy oil due to an illegal invasion also did an illegal invasion and cared not for what the rest of the world thinks.
It's wrong to buy Russian oil, it's a fucking war and the world is leaning on Russia, India is literally just being trash In this choice, be with the world or be greedy, India chose greed nothing else.
India would make a huge strategic mistake boycotting Russian ressources but y'all are too focus insulting everyone that doesn't align 100% with your side to see the whole picture.
That's my side as well but it's utopic nonetheless, and sometimes the outcome is profitable, even if that means a dictator or a shitty regime makes money from it.
India is not at war with anyone and has urgent demographic problems. If you blame them for buying cheap oil it means you don't know anything about how the world works and I won't argue with you more.
As many of you have said in the comments it is unfair for the developed world to judge the developing world for buying and using cheap oil.
