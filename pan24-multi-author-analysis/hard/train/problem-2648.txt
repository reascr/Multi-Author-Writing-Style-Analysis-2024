Both. Its both. We help Ukraine with money we steal from Russia by funding our own economies to assist in there rebuild while simultaneously full on capsizing the russian market. Meanwhile there is an even deeper foothold in the Ukranian market do to an influx of western brands from construction materials to cocacola. Soon enough the populous is as enfatuated with overprocessed-designed-for-the-dump-garbage as any stadard American is and full populist assimialation will be complete!
Even better, make a UN order that all transactions and imports to Russia must go through Ukraine first (with a appropriate charges made to Russia for infrastructure and fees)as to put Ukraine in an economic and political authority over the enitirety of Russia as far the Western world is concerned.
Now I know this is a very often repeated sentiment on Reddit but this could only EVER work if Ukraine gives the money to Ukrainian companies without any foreign ties. Otherwise it's essentially a way for Western countries to distribute the Russian money among themselves.
There's simply no way to spin this so it doesn't sound a lot like "I'm just gonna take that money and pump it into my economy, but it's for a good cause so it's OK". It'd be a different question if you find a way to do it so you don't directly (or at all preferably) profit from it.
The best solution IMHO for the people is to move them to somewhere with existing infrastructure ASAP, not scream through the newspapers how Russia needs to be disowned and devise weird schemes that of course will apply to that but not to any other war in the past or future and will likely worsen the situation socially and politically.
