Boebert just said that McCarthy gave in on the single member motion to vacate. This is where Boehner was smart enough to realize he was done and Ryan was smart enough to refuse to allow if he was going to take the job, because a Speakership where one person can force a vote to vacate isn't a Speakership at all.
Boehner was threatened with this by a sizeable amount of Tea Party reps who were willing to sabotage legislation over it, and resigned rather than be forced to accept it. Ryan refused to consider the Speaker job if this kind of thing was on the table.
Some Republicans want to lower that threshold to 1, which means just one Republican could instigate a vote on whether to vacate the Speakership at any time.
I think he sold his soul to the devil saying he wanted to be part of a historic Republican speakership and this sure will be historic that they have to do multiple rounds of voting for the first time in 100 years. Speakership might not be his.
It is kind of funny but he had to move out of the minority leader offices and I dunno where else he would go. Kind of weird they do the moving before the vote.
I think there's a very good chance Scalise steps in and wins by being someone who isn't Kevin McCarthy. Probably has to grant some committee chairs to some radical folks too but that comes with the territory apparently.
