One of the problematic aspects of her technique, showing where the right and left horseshoe on some things is that it buys into that both sides bullshit thus diminishing the very real threat to democracy the alt right is because it is directly connected to the establishment GOP.
I'm not sure how you came to it being a "both sides" things when the premise of the article is that the alt-right is leveraging it's organizational structure to tap into fears and concerns of the "crunchy" left in order to recruit them. Anecdotally, you can see this pipeline a lot on social media where being interested in herbal medicine triggers the algorithm to spit out survival/prepper content, which in turn leads to anti-government content, which in turn leads to white supremecist content. You rarely, if ever, see a pipeline from crystal healing to left tinged anti government content. Just look at all the old hippies and how many of them voted for Trump, the "crunchy" left is less interested in left wing ideas and policies than they are motivated by anti-establishment rhetoric, which is why they become easy marks for the alt-right, especially since there isn't an organized left wing to provide a counter balance.
Think of all the old hippies who voted for Trump, they didn't do it because they are conservative, they did it because they thought he was anti establishment. That's their organizing principle, more so than liberal/left ideologies, which makes them easy prey for a right wing element that also peddles antiestablishmentarianism. I think dismissing the proximity of the "crunchy" left to the alt-right is a dangerous oversight because the kind of people who believe in crystal healing and other spiritual woo woo have already focused their identities on rejecting common sense, which makes them vulnerable to the sort of magical realism found in conspiracy theories and other pathways to alt-right views.
