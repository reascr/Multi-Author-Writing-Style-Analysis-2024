Israel created a charity that emphasized Islamic identity to oppose the PLO who were non-religious palestinian nationalists.
Israel cut ties and imprisoned their leader in 84 when they began arming. They were not called hamas yet. They had not published their charter.
This is like blaming Britain for US war crimes because they created the 13 colonies. Hamas was not hamas when Israel was involved.
I’m talking about Hamas and Jihad of course, they are the ones in charge in Gaza. They don’t give a shit about their kids. Heck, they would prefer kids to get injured and die for their shallow, stupid and cheap propaganda.
The IDF are doing the maximum they can to prevent hurting innocent people, but that’s exactly why it’s almost impossible when Hamas and Jihad use their own innocent people in such way.
LOL it’s so funny to see all the surprised people here. “Why would the Palestinians put their children at risk?” “That should be condemned”.
So your point is the people setting up rocket launchers around schools and hospitals are not Palestinians?
You are blaming Israel for Hamas putting rocket launchers next to schools? In what way has Israel forced Hamas to do this?
Who do you think is sneaking around Arab Palestinian Gaza launching rockets into Israel? If you say Iranians I’d probably believe you. Iran runs everything else there, using Hamas as their paid proxies.
