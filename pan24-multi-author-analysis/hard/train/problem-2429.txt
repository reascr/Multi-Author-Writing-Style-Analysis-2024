> Also last year, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., introduced the Youth Voting Rights Act, which also went nowhere in the Democrat-led House and Senate. That bill didn't change the voting age but would have allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to start registering to vote to make sure they are able to vote as soon as they turn 18.
Why should we let boomers and silent generation vote when they have but a few years to live but not let 16 year olds vote who have their whole lives ahead of them?
People 18 and older were already voting due to the . The Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not pass a law to lower the voting age for local and state elections and that's up to the states to decide, which many of them allowed. For federal elections it wasn't overruled by the Supreme Court. So the 26th Amendment accomplished two things, making it so no one 18 or older can be denied the right to vote due to their age (which they were already allowed to vote for federal elections and many state and local elections), and two allows a protection for this right that isn't easily rolled back with another law.
H.J.Res.16 - Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States extending the right to vote to citizens sixteen years of age or older.
There's nothing in the Constitution or otherwise that I can see that requires a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age.
