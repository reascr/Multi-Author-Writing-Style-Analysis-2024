The problem with wolf is they could well be Finnish/Norwegian/Russian those animals move long distances and don't respect borders.
There have been a large number of relocated wolf's in Sweden, problem is, these animals move long distances and tend to move right back to where they came from.
That's not entirely true, the Scandinavian Wolf population is infact concentrated toÂ the Southern parts of Central Sweden. This means that there's no land connection to finland and there's rough mountain terrain to Norway. In the northern parts of Sweden there is rarely any wolf's.
We already have reintroduced them. This is about controlling their population not about exterminating them. In fact, wolf's where almost extinct in Sweden untill we did reintroduced them.
Edit: should mention that wolves only returned to Denmark within the last decade. Hunting them is illegal and has led to prison sentencing.
Based on a report by Aarhus University thereâ€™s an estimated number of 30, rising by 14 in 2022 through successful breeding. So far more than 5.
Yes. Which seems to be based on ignorance rather than an enlightened approach to wild life. One shot a wolf and got a prison sentence. Other places theyâ€™ve been blamed for attacking livestock, yet it was determined through saliva samples to have been a dog (at least the one I remember). Itâ€™s a shame really ðŸ˜”.
