Russia and the Soviets abused Ukraine so much... But look at the majority of famous "soviet" Engineers, scientists, generals... Vast majority were Ukranian.
Khrushchev and Gorbachev strike me as two men who deeply cared for the health of the entirety of Eastern Europe. I'm sure terrible things happened under their watch, but they were moral men. Both Ukranian.
I could be wrong, but out of everything the majority us as Westerners respected and feared out of the Eastern Bloc was largely Ukranian. I don't want to put them as a whole on a pedestal... Pre-2014 ukraine definitely had some bad actors, a ton of corruption and a largely anti-LGBTQ sentiment. Since the birthing of what everyone considers the "Modern Ukraine" post 2014 and during these dire times, These People have stepped up dramatically.
This small nation is such an inspiring guiding star that all of modern civilization can learn so much from. I have so, so much respect for the people of Ukraine.
As an American, I am thankful that my tax dollars are going to Ukraine. This is one of the first times that I've ever 100% agreed with my government. You and your country will win this, and one day maybe you will see me as a tourist in your lands enjoying and learning about your culture and history.
