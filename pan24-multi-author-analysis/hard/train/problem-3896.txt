Logic works as more India buys higher loses Russia has to bear so it's effective. This leads to a net outflow of money from russia. I think it's hard for you to understand basic concepts of money. I suggest you read more about it.
Turkey is giving drones , South korea is condemning and India has given essential medical humanitarian aid to Ukraine. So that should exempt all three for purchasing Russian oil.
Buying Brent just gives money to another country but buying Russian oil makes Russia actively lose money.
Above all, you are doing a disservice to Russia by propping up Putin's regime to oil money. The Russians won't be thankful for that after he's gone.
But I am not buying the "necessity" argument, given that I heard none of that before the war. India was getting by before the war without Russian oil, and I've yet to see a reason why it can't after Russia decided to use terror attacks on a massive scale in its invasion.
Thank you for acknowledging that India buying Russian oil is simply doing the terrorist state a diplomatic favor, and not some sort of dire need that we've been led to believe.
Duly noted that India's needs include doing, as you said, doing a diplomatic favor to a in Russia buy starting to buy its oil in huge amounts, thus perpetuating the war it wages, destruction, and endless Russian and Ukrainian deaths.
India owes nothing to Ukraine, its duty is to its citizens first and foremost, and it's hypocritical when all those countries buy a lot more from Russian than India does.
You're fucking up ties with both Russia and the West by trading with Russia, but continue saying it's an "Indian need" to do so.
You make it sound like the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the only thing saving India's economy from imminent collapse.
