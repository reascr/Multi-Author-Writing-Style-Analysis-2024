Lawyers close to several Republican witnesses in the Fulton County investigation into post-election interference by former President Donald Trump and his allies are preparing to move to quash any possible indictments by the district attorney, Fani Willis.
The special purpose grand jury served as an investigatory body that could recommend charges but could not indict. Willis is now deciding whether to pursue charges and open a "regular" criminal grand jury, to seek possible indictments against Trump or others based on the special grand jury's recommendations, compiled in a report it made following the completion of its work.
Their attempt to do so would be based on recent public statements by the forewoman of a special purpose grand jury, Emily Kohrs, according to two people familiar with the discussions who spoke with CBS News.
“Lawyers for several witnesses are preparing to move to quash indictments, based on the forewoman's comments, which they would argue taint any such charges and the investigation.”.
