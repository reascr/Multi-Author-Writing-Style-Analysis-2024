Hey, I vote R every single year and yes, this is getting embarrassing. Maybe if the GOP didnâ€™t have a massive hard on for abortion abortion abortion, still support Trump, and actually find some better candidates for the MOST important states, something might have went differently.
So... given that abortion and supporting Trump in his treasonous acts seemed to be their biggest issues this election, why do you vote for the GOP?
And either way, it's not like the 2016, 2018, and 2020 elections weren't dominated by similar issues as these, so my question remains about why exactly you support this party if you think they're wrong on these topics.
It is kind of incomprehensible to me that you would vote for a party that you disagree with to that extent (because again, those were the issues they kept bringing to the forefront), and then try to blame me for not changing your vote because I ask you what is it exactly that motivates you to vote like that.
It was a genuine question! From an external perspective, these made-up/ginned-up cultural issues (furries, trans people, CRT in schools, etc.) seemed to be the main arguments made by the GOP, other than the ones you already said you weren't on board with.
