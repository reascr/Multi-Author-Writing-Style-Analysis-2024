Congratulations to the people of South Dakota, who overcame the cruel indifference of Republican troglodytes like just re-elected Governor Kristi Noem, who showed more interest in adding Donald Trump to Mount Rushmore than helping South Dakotans access affordable health care.
Hopefully there is a smooth path to immediate enrollment; you’ll likely recall the unconscionable refusal of Missouri Republicans several years ago to appropriate the necessary funds to cover Medicaid expansion costs after voter approval of Medicaid expansion.
Although Republicans everywhere are comfortable denying health care access to poorer people, they will support the maintenance and expansion of health services, especially in underserved rural areas. Tying Medicare expansion to improving the access and quality of hospitals and clinics, which are available for all residents, is a winning combination for fighting against efforts to stymie the people’s will. Health care access isn’t a right or left issue. It affects everyone in the state Legislators need to be reminded often.
