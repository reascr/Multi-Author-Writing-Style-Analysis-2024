It’s clear to them Trump isn’t the way anymore. If they do go against Trump, which they most likely will, it’s because they are desperate for moderate votes, not because they gained a conscience.
Then again, his voters are lemmings who do what they’re told by him and Fox, so if it’s not OKed by either of them, I doubt the GOP will buck the trend.
Maybe I'm being overly cynical, but I feel like any GOP "civil war" will be long over before election day and conservatives will be in lock-step behind their leader. Two years is a long time for fox news and others to push a new narrative. Everyone seems gleeful about the prospect of some kind of DeSantis v. Trump fight, and while I'm sure it will be entertaining, I can't imagine it lasting two full years. I fear that by election day, they will have their fascism mascot picked out and all dutifully line up behind him.
I guess I just don't see this intra-party fighting as some sort of death knell for them because it actually seems pretty common. These people hate each other, we just can't forget that they hate us way, way more, and they'll happily unite if they think it means they can put a boot on our necks.
I guess this just reminds me so much of 2015/2016 that it makes me nervous. Republicans were absolutely eviscerating each other for months (including Trump) until there was only one nominee left. Then they declared him their messiah, kissed his feet, and pulled out a win that shocked all the people that had been eating their popcorn and watching the melee (including me).
