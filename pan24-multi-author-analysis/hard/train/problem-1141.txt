And I suspect its because Black people overwhelmingly break for Democrats. Where a white conservative person would typically vote for a Republican, the Black Conservative person may STILL vote Democrat due to the rampant racism apparent in the Republican party.
However, the black community will continue to support democrats for the time being, because the overwhelming consensus is that the brand of conservatism that is currently ruling the GOP is the main threat that has hurt them in the first place for decades.
Here is an alternate headline: Black Democrats overwhelmingly prove they’re willing to protect the rights of others, even when they admittedly don’t understand them.
Besides the other responses, something you're missing here is that being a party of civil rights means protecting vulnerable people even when it's not an overwhelmingly popular stance. The qualities of the party that make a huge majority of Black voters side with Democrats are the same qualities that make things like trans rights an important part of the party's platform.
Everyone has their own pet issue they think should be the center of attention. Even if it is popular on its own, it isn't always the best one to unite a diverse group of voters. But despite that, many Democratic candidates continue to support the idea of universal health care in one form or another.
A substantial number of Democrats and swing voters also don't agree with the idea of a single-payer health care system. It has probably shifted a little more in favor since this poll, but this is the one that came up when I searched.
