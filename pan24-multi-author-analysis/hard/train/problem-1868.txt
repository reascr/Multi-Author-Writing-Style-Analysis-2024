It‚Äôs a God send that Hershel is a walking dumpster fire‚Ä¶ this is all that matters for the Dems at this point üëá.
‚ÄúIn the senate, Democrats‚Äô priority will be to confirm federal judges and executive branch appointees nominated by the president.‚Äù.
To add to this - they have a very impactful duty they can do independently (confirming/blocking judicial nominations), whereas the House needs the Senate to pass legislation.
Considering there won't be any legislation to pass for the next two years with the House back in Republican hands, all the Senate can really do is confirm some more judges, and 51 Senators will do nicely for that.
it also paints the FALSE picture that 50 or 51 senate members being the same party should be able to pass bills all by themselves. that is NOT A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, people arguing that "Democrats held all three branches and got nothing done" are going to bat for republicans, trying to get people to stay home and not vote. It is completely unhealthy to pass bills requiring 100% of your party's vote and 0% of the opposing party's vote. Republicans are so uniform that they have very good luck doing that, they passed many bills doing that, Democrats are very diverse, they only passed a few bills using that method, it is NOT TRUE that 50 Democrats is a "majority", and it is completely unhealthy to expect congress to operate without crossing the aisle, which republicans have been refusing to do for 15+ years now.
