The private right of action is a big deal. Can sue the crud out of official/agencies/etc that do not respect it.
The religious freedom elements give me moments for pause. But it is something. I just want my marriage to stay legal man.
This always had to do with legal marriages. As in yoh are entitled to the same legal rights by signing the agreement that binds you to another in tax law benefits, and benefits entitled to closest kin when decisions of life and death and wealth are in question. That's it. That's all this ever was. How any individual or group feels about all the extra superfluous stuff is up to them.
No extra clause is required because to force any church to marry someone is not, nor would it ever be permissible under the 1st Ammendment. The idea it ever was a conversation at all is a fiction straw man cooked up by the fear addled minds of conservatives. No one was ever going to force religious institutions to marry people in their ceremony when they don't want to. It violates the core of the Bill of Rights. Any language added on is just to placate the idiots who thought that was ever a thing to begin with.
As someone else replying to me said, including language about it in the bill is to placate the idiots.
Exactly. It seems like a knowingly cynical maneuver to me. But it may have been what was necessary to get the GOP senators on board.
Here I am using "the state" in the sense of "the government" (like in "separation of church and state".
The state does not interfere with who gets to be married in your church, and your church does not get to decide who can get married by the state or another church. That is separation of church and state.
What you want is for your church to decide on whose marriage is recognized by the state. That is NOT separation of church and state.
And the state cannot make laws respecting religion. The state can't force a religious group to perform a ceremony.
