She or someone down the line could be easily misinformed due to the language. I've seen enough officials calling BMPs tanks to only count on such information from sources who made their career to study war.
The UA may have a training and equipment advantage but that only really affects infantry on infantry action. Nothing keeps you alive when artillery hits you. You may survive shrapnel with better gear. You may survive losing a limb if you can get treated on the field and evacuated. But your odds are about as low as the poorly equipped conscript on the other side.
It's hard to come up with numbers or ratios since Ukraine has had access to some pretty good targeting information and precision munitions which allowed them to make much better use of their expended artillery. But there is no doubt that they have taken severe casualties that are at most equal to the estimates we have on the Russian side.
There is no way Ukraine has taken almost as many casualties as Russia, and hasn't collapsed.Military dead and wounded, 65, 70K max. and thats highballing.
claims of 100,000+ Ukrainian military casualties is approaching Russian claims, which everyone knows are fucking ridiculous.
US intelligence came out at the beginning of the month and said the both Ukraine and Russia had 100k+ military casualties each. European Commission estimates seems to be in line with that.
