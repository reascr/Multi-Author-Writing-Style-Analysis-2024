Well they should, its a non-nato country that attacked a fellow nato country. Article 5 needs to be enacted. Funny how when people thought it was Russia they were basically screaming article 5. So much hypocrisy.
Ukraine executed the false flag attack on Poland so poorly that there was no chance to blame Russia without losing all credibility. Now they are calling it "stray missiles" and "accident" adding that none of this would have happened if Russia didn't invade Ukraine... Idiots.

And none of this would’ve happened if the Russians weren’t attacking. Criminals are held liable for injuries and deaths that occur during the commission of a felony, even if they didn’t directly inflict said harm themselves. The Russians are the criminals here, if they want this to be avoided they can walk their happy asses out of Ukraine. It’s super easy, the border is literally right there.
