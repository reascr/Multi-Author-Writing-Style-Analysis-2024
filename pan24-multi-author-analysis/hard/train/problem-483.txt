China requires the same thing from all foreigners, but when countries demand this of China, the Chinese government accuses them of being racist. Do the Chinese government not understand the meaning of hypocrisy?
You need to understand the way chinese nationalists think. They see themselves as a superior race and are taught from young age that the rest of the world is full of primitive sub-humans that "pretend" that they are worth anything.
There is no such thing as hypoctisy, because they are above us, so they should be treated with respect.
I have met my fair share of chinese tourists during my travels around Europe, especially the middle-aged rich pro-CCP kind. On one trip I was with a guy from Taiwan who could understand what they were talking about. There was very little admiration towards the countries that hosted them. At almost every building, monument or other places of historic interest they would talk about how primitive and sloppy the handwork was compared to chinese standards, how China build this and this better and so on...
