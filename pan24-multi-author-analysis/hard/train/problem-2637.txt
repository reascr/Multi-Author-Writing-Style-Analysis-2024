It's hilarious at this point. I'd like to see the last 6 Republicans in the roll call suddenly decide to vote Jeffries, drop the mic, drop the curtain and we have the new Speaker .
If Republicans get passed this speaker vote then they can finally get started on their agenda of doing nothing except endless hearings on Hunter Biden's dick pics.
It may be the end of the Speaker vote but it is the beginning of Republican investigations, going on Fox News to rail against the federal government, and a disastrous outcome for the next debt ceiling vote. Surely, we will have McCarthy to thank for a default because he handed the keys to the House to these MAGA Republicans.
Once a Speaker is chosen, McCarthy will have given so much power away to these MAGA Republicans, they will be running the show.
These are Republicans who supported Trumpâ€™s efforts to overturn a US election and who voted against impeaching Trump for inciting a violent attack on our US Capitol. They care more about chaos and clicks than governing for The People.
As Steve Bannon said in 2017, their goal is and always has been deconstruction of the administrative state.
