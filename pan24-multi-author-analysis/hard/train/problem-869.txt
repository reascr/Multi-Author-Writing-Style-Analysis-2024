You can stop a country from getting nukes, you cannot stop a country which already has them. Which is the entire point of my comment.
The Jews because they were constantly persecuted around the world (Much like the black communities in the US after slavery was ended, but they still suffered from extreme segregation from white society), and the Arabs living in Palestine because they wanted a new identity for themselves after the failed venture which was the vast Islamic empire, denied by the British despite promises to the Arab population.
I find it all extremely hilarious. A fanatic violent regime is trying to be the new North Korea, and all redditors do is discuss what Israel did or did not do, instead of trying to stop it.
Second, whatever issues you have with Israel and Palestinians has nothing to do to Iran's nuke problems, but I can discuss it further if you want to.
I don’t want Iran to have nuclear weapons, but be fair, the only reason why you don’t have a problem with Israel having nuclear weapons is because Israel is friendly with the west. Israel treats Palestinians terribly, and is a massive threat to its neighbors.
First, Israel is not a massive threat to it's neighbors. It factually gave back more land mass than it's entire size in exchange for peace with it's neighbors. So your comment is very wrong.
