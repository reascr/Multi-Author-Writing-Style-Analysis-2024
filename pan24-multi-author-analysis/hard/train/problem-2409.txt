This has HUGE implications. It means EU countries will set a precedent to further restrict trade and increase sanctions on Russia. But what's even bigger is it also applies secondary sanctions to countries and other entities that trade with Russia. This is very good. It forces the rest of the world to play along with efforts to punish the aggressor.
Parliaments in several of Ukraine's most ardent EU backers - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland - have declared that they consider Russia under President Vladimir Putin to be a state sponsor of terrorism.
While i strongly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and it's actions there are indeed terrorism the reality is that this label done by the EU was done purely out of political motivation because of Russia and EU having an antagonistic relationship, thus making it much easier to call them a terrorist state. The same thing would NOT be possible for Uncle Sam no matter how justified it would be if the same standards that calls Russia a terrorist state was applied to America.
The U.S might be a savior for Europe and some parts of the rest of the world but is a terrorist to those who had to suffer for it's actions like Latin America during the Cold War and the Middle East.
