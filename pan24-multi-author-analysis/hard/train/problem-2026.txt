Mother: “It’s the Americans driving this, of course! Look at their laboratories. They are developing biological weapons. Coronavirus literally started there.”.
Mother: “They even found all these papers with signatures from the U.S. all over Ukraine. Biden’s son is the mastermind behind all of this.”.
It's so wild to read the guy mention Hunter Biden as the evil mastermind behind the war. Just another item of proof that Russians use the same propaganda sources and creators as do the Republicans, which is quite scary to consider.
Unfortunately I think Russian and Chinese propaganda is working and it seems like more of their populations are believing that the US and Ukraine are the aggressors in the war.
Same woman who believes it's the Ukrainians who are deluded by fake news and propaganda. Meanwhile, she sounds like a Qanon nut in the U.S. Interesting how the Russian and American far right use all the same talking points and conspiracy theories.
Interesting that she believes that if the US president dies the entire effort to aid Ukraine will just collapse. Has lived under despot so long that she just assumed all other countries are run by despots as well?
