If you had bothered to read the law, you'd realize that acknowledging the reality that trans and gay people exist is illegal in public schools in Florida.
If you think it's age inappropriate to discuss the existence of gay and trans people, then you certainly agree that it's inappropriate for any child to have married parents, or to expose your children to gender-segregated restrooms.
Obviously, everyone agrees that acknowledging the existence of gay and trans people is appropriate for all ages. The law has nothing to do with sex, you just haven't read the law yet.
Technically speaking, under the letter of the law, Florida's Don't Say Gay law bans gendered restrooms from schools, teachers from wearing wedding rings, etc., but so far, the law has only affected queer people.
I could continue to list examples of how that vagueness makes it unlikely that the law will be used as anything other than a cudgel to use against LGBTQ people, but you ignored that in my earlier post so I don't think it'd be useful.
“The Trevor Project says these provisions, "appear to undermine LGBTQ support in schools and include vague parental notification requirements, which could effectively require teachers to 'out' LGBTQ students to their legal guardians without their consent, regardless of whether they are supportive.".
Wow. Thank you for pointing that out I did not see my comment gave that kind of a vibe, but I still don’t agree in totally removing accountability. I understand that some have to take them to have a better future. Everything worth getting requires sacrifice. We take different routes for the same end goal. I still want to empathize a change to the system to make education more accessible and affordable.
