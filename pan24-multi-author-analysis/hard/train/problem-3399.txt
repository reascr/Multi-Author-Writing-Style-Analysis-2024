Japan is ranked top 5 in the world for military strenh, but then again Russia is like 3 and we saw how that went!
Heck even discounting the USA, Japan alone has a beefy navy, one which is better than the Russian one, and a good airforce.
I think Russia would struggle to transport troops across to JApan and JApan's air defnce systems are probably pretty good.
Now imagine how much worse it'd be vs. Japan's stronger (than Ukraine), modern military with no land links, having to approach by air and sea across a much further distance. That's not even including all the aid Japan would still get from other countries.
Yeah I have no doubt Japan even without an ally fighting alongside them would stomp Russia, considering how bad they're doing in Ukraine...where they have land links and even hold territory since 2014, it's absolutely ridiculous how atrocious their logistics are.
And based upon Russian ability to wage war in Ukraine...which they had a land border with (easier to invade), shared a language (easier to move within the country), and didn't have defense treaties with the most powerful player in the world....yea.
I don't think so, an attack of Russia on Japan would trigger America defense treaty with Japan...also keep in mind the US Military...well they are already prepared to wage war in Asia cause of both China and N. Korea. We also keep 7th fleet in Japan.
