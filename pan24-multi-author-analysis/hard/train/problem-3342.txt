Don’t forget that he was buddy buddy with Putin while trying to dismantle NATO and ending military funds for Ukraine. The writing was on the wall. This invasion was planned with Trump’s support. Putin failed because Joe Biden got elected. Russia would have succeeded as quickly as they wanted if Trump had won.
USA warned them about the whole thing before it happened. They didn’t believe at first because no one thought that Putin would be that stupid. The question remains is: would Trump have warned Ukraine of Putin’s plan?
Or does Trump mean he would have not supported Ukraine and it would have fallen to Putin without a fight?
So if Trump had won, I don't think Putin would have invaded Ukraine, he would not have felt he HAD to.
Then again, Trump thought that Putin was a "genius" for invading Ukraine to make it "independent" ... even though he previously said Putin would not "go into Ukraine". Here's a reverse timeline;.
January 2022: Former President Donald Trump said Russia controls Germany because of its dependence on Russian gas and said the Russia-Ukraine crisis is a "European problem.".
That said, without the support that the US gave so far, I'd bet that the war would be a guerilla war with lots of street fighting right now.
