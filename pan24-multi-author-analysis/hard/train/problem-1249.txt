I read the book about 2 years ago when another communist sympathizer in my life used it as an apology for the Soviet Union. It relies almost entirely on third party information with no independent validation of the sources themselves.
For one, his work has non-existent peer review in academia. His book is devoid of contemporaneous Russian sources and his information almost exclusively comes from news organizations in the US.
Without direct access to the information and validation of those sources, Michael Parenti can be dismissed entirely out of hand.
With respect, there were 15,000 executions in the entire history of the USA. Even taking this at face value (which is beyond difficult to do), 700k executions is insane and barbaric.
In any case, the killings of political opponents were not in the millions or tens of millionsâ€”which is not to say that the actual number.
Nah. If we are going to engage in conversations about the past, we might as well be honest about what was actually going on. Stalin is not above criticism whatsoever, but to spew anti-communist rhetoric with seemingly little to no basis in historical fact only serves the interest of the global capitalist elite.
