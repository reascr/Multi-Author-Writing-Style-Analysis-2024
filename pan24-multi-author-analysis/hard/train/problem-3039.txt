I was in 5th grade when this happened, the two 5th grade teachers at my school had applied to be the teachers on the flight, and had garnered a fair amount of community support in their pursuit. Neither advanced terribly far in the process, but both used the launch as a teaching tool that year. My entire class was watching as it blew up. I can still remember the looks on my teachers faces.
I watched in school like many of you. My science teacher turned the TV off and sent us back to our regular classrooms. Before I left, I confronted her. I said "It just blew up, didn't it?" And she lied to me and sent me back to class but her eyes told me the answer. I had thought about nominating my teacher but I didn't and all I could think of was those poor kids in her class.
Then in a total mind fuck, I had boomeranged back to my parents' in my 20s and one morning my dad wakes me up to tell me the "Challenger exploded" I was like, what year is this? Feeling like I was having a Freaky Friday experience or something, but he meant Columbia. So then I was double sad.
