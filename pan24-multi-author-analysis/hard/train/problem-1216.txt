I know it requires jumping through hoops because, aside from reading about it in a more recent context, I had a breast augmentation myself at 19. It was considered a reconstruction and paid for by insurance due to a congenital anomaly. I had to see multiple psychologists and therapists for assessments and interviews, as well as consults with multiple doctors, before the surgeon would perform the surgery and before insurance would pay for it. And I wasn’t technically a minor anymore!
I remember shopping for a dress for my first high school dance. It should’ve been a really fun day spent with my mom and older sister. Instead I ended up bawling in the dressing room because none of the dresses would fit my chest correctly. I always wore a sweater or jacket or something over every shirt I wore, no matter the weather, so I could cover up my body.
I was born a woman and I identify as a woman. I 100% consider that surgery to be have been “gender affirming” because I was flat as a table and always self-conscious about it. I felt more like myself and the gender I identify as after that surgery. I consider all breast augmentation to be gender affirming - why else would we want our breasts enlarged?
I've never thought of breast augmentation as gender affirming until now. Hell, I didn't even think about how what you said relates to me until I had already typed, "signed a dude". See, I was going to say, "signed, a dude who is not personally affected" because what you said makes so much sense.
