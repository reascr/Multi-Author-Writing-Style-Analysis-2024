While I kinda agree that Russia should be the most I am not surprise Israel would be a top 5 most condemmed.
And soft on Saudi, and Qatar, and Iran, and Syria, and wait... there's a clear trend here where all the surrounding countries are worse but get a pass but Israel gets condemned.
Unfortunately every other Arab nation will go after Israel, then other countries will go after Israel to piss of the US, and then finally Israel is a giant douche about Palestine.
Oh for sure Israel was always going to be near the top because UN, but anyone who doesn’t have Russia at the top of their AH Countries of the Year list just doesn’t even deserve a seat in the UN or local dive bar. Putin made everyone else look good this year.
And that’s why the UN is a joke. You have countries like Saudi purposely destroying food and medical supplies in Yemen causing one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent times and these morons are playing “I’m not touching you.”.
This is absolutely absurd. I don’t care what you think of Israel or the actions of their government (I personally would like to see Netanyahu jump off a bridge or locked in jail), but they are most definitely NOT THE WORST. Russia? Iran? Afghanistan? Saudi? There are so many countries that contribute nothing but misery and in case anyone didn’t know Israel contributes a lot to scientific research and development that benefits us all. The UN is just a joke these days.
