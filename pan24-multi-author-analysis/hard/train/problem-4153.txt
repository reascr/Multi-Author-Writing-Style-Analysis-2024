True, but russia also uses ceasefire as time off to regroup, prepare/make weapons, mobilise and train people to launch another attack breaking all previous agreements. So having a ceasefire with russia isn't really an option.
I really can't see Russia ever giving up any part of Ukraine unless forced out, and Russia will only agree to a ceasefire if they get the land they think is theirs. That won't stop Russia though - it ultimately wants ALL of Ukraine.
If things keep going as they are, ukraine will retake their country. It isn't going smoothly but they already took back several bits of land lost in the shock of the initial invasion that Russia can't take back, and the Russians already lost more people than they can recover from.
The best option would be total russian defeat and withdraw, along with restoration of the ukrainian borders. Otherwise the Russians would be emboldened to keep doing what they're doing to their neighbors, and that further justifies why they seek refuge within nato. The United States is completely justified in supporting this.
