They have learnt that they can gerrymander and restrict voting with impunity. They have learnt they can lie and use half-truths to stampede people. They have learnt that anti "woke" works, and demonising the "radical left" is a popular policy.
Trump will get the nomination if he is not in prison, and if he is free still, he will use this to play the victim again. Why you might ask, well the GOP desperately wants to win again and at the moment no one is stepping up. I think DeSantis will step back, he's clever enough to realise the pain of going against Trump's base at the moment.
2024 will be a sh\t storm, and I see the GOP winning both the house and senate if something is not done about the broken electoral system in the USA.
America is tired of Trump, and if Republicans run him again in 2024, his loss will be even greater and even more humiliating. Unfortunately, the GOP has no choice but to let him continue to hold the party by the balls, because if they attempt to kick him out, he takes his loyal MAGA voters with him and the Republicans can't afford to lose any votes.
I agree that the election systems are broken at the state level in some red states where gerrymandering is horrific, but in 2020 the presidential election and blue state congressional elections were pretty uneventful, and the Dems performed great.
A lot of rational people are rightly confused when they see the GOP continuing to attack civil rights, free speech, and reproductive rights when those issues cost them nationally in 2020 and 2022. But that's because those people don't understand the plan.
We're going to see the GOP hunker down in their fiefdoms as a regional party, lobbing political and legal attacks on the feds and promoting sectarian violence on blue urban centers, daring the feds to take action.
