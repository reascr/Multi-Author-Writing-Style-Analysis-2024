China as a country is lead by a one man dictatorship now with a cult of personality on the level of Mao Zedong.
Stop moving goal posts. If the vaccines do not prevent sickness then they are not vaccines and are treatments.
Why so many people saying the Chinese vaccine don’t work? There is data out there verified by not China that it is in fact very effective. Just because you get fever doesn’t mean anything, as long as a ICU visit is prevented it has done it’s job. As for the unvaccinated that’s on them for not doing it and listening to people like this who says vaccines are not that effective.
Rebuttal 1: If the vaccines were effective then that would have naturally resulted in a zero covid outcome for the vaccinated.
Well when you reject the vaccines that work and use vaccines made by yourself that turned out to not be so effective against the original COVID-19 strain, now multiple variations later, you will have to accept the fact you messed up big time.
It's my understanding their Covid vaccines are more traditional dead virus style vaccines instead of the efficacy of the mRNA vaccines.
MRNA vaccines can be tailored, and have been, with each booster to adapt to the latest strain of COVID.
