Bear hunting in Canada is a money maker. Whether or not the culling is necessary, they will make excuses to do so. They had to outlaw grizzly bear hunting because their population got to dangerously low numbers due to poor oversight.
Guard regiment bearskins are byproducts of legal culls of black bears, in areas where they're overpopulated. No one goes "oh Privates Smith, Jones, Ahmed, and Fulante need hats, go kill a few bears.".
Yes. There are some fungus-derived "leathers" being created nowadays, but even so, most "vegan leather" is just pleather under a new name which means it's going to start shedding microplastics after about five or six years of use. As opposed to real leather, which has a lifespan of decades and is biodegradable.
Not all leather is biodegradable. They have to use a specific tanning chemistry to allow leather to biodegrade.
You can't just ignore the toxic processes used to create the leather, though. It is not some "all natural" product with zero environmental impact. Tanning chemicals are not biodegradable.
Google says 90% of leather is made using a chromium tanning process, and chromium tanned leather is not recyclable or biodegradable. It also causes heavy metal pollution, which I'm not sure is the case for.
