I think that the 20 hold outs want a scalp and the most likely outcome is that Scalise or some equally loathsome rep will end up getting the job and McCarthy will be humiliated.
The only other possible outcome I see is that dems broker a deal for a coalition government that cuts the far right out of the process. It isnâ€™t impossible to imagine a few republicans in more marginal seats defecting and voting for a moderate dem or switching parties to break the stalemate.
As for any Republican in any semi competitive district they are going to be dragged down even if that Republican in question is a moderate anti MAGA. These two years are going to destroy them.
And here we are again. They can't do anything and now everyone is watching. Whoever gets the Democratic nomination for 24 be it Biden or the ketchup pack on my work desk, they'll sail into the presidency like butter on a hot skillet.
I mean this is just a continuation of the first half of the Trump presidency and by extension the last part of Obama's.
