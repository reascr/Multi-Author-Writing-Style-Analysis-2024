Because the billionaires have no real power. They exist entirely at the pleasure of Putin. They are useful to him, sure, but compared to the FSB, GRU, OMON, and all the other police state tools that Putin has, there is very little the oligarchs can do against Putin. They can't trust anyone - anyone they talk to or hire might easily be in the pocket of FSB. The best (even only) shot they'd have at killing Putin is by doing it personally, and given how paranoid Putin is, I'm not sure what you'd be able to kill him with if you even did get close to him.
It's an oligarchy ruled by the police state, not by the billionaires. The siloviki have the power, and that's just a fact. Look at what's already happened to the billionaires that stepped out line. I wouldn't even call them oligarchs any more, just billionaires, considering how limited their power is.
He pretty much centered all power around himself a while ago (which is a big part of how this debacle started in the first place), even the billionaires don't really have much sway in something like this.
