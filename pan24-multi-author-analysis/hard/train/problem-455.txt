“Trump had not referenced the ECRA effort on his Truth Social page since the beginning of the week. By contrast, he dedicated roughly a dozen posts to the Jan. 6 committee’s criminal referral to the Justice Department. “.
True. All I'm saying though is that Trump is also responsible for the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, he even admitted that he lied when he told Bob Woodward that he "deliberately downplayed the threat of COVID-19 because he didn't want to cause a panic." Yeah it may not have been as many deaths as the previous Republican president but Trump is still responsible for hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths too.
But don't forget that Trump era regulatory roll backs, public health policies in general and then his covid response led to the unnecessary death of hundreds of thousands of people too.
As bad as Trump was he wasn't as bad as the previous Republican president, whose lies to congress and the American people caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not over a million people.
Those are all things he campaigned on (or Republicans generally) and a large portion of the population support regulatory roll backs (they'd probably roll everything back if they could). To me that's different than lying to the public to do what you want to do.
