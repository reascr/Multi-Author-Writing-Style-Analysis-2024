For god's sake. For probably the millionth time, the man's cover was "philanthropic art- and science-loving billionaire starfucker.".
It is more than presumable that 99% of the people in his contact lists, flight logs, and visitor book— from celebrities, Nobel Prize winners, random royals, and celebrated journalists all the way to house painters and dry cleaners— were there as part of that cover life (and/or regular life), and had no idea what he was really up to.
I really wish people would stop doing this. Even if they're just trying to be "funny." (DAE find no part of this amusing??).
Yes. The fucking answer is yes. Do you live in America? Do you understand the concept of transparency? Did you not think we had the right to know what happened behind Iran Contra? Or, Watergate? Or White Water? Or January 6th? The Constitution demands transparency for the people. They are supposed to answer to us. Thats the way its written. Our leaders have been implicated in Epsteins crimes. We absolutely have the right to know. WTF? Dont tell me im not answering the question when you dont even understand the basic principle of the question you're asking.
