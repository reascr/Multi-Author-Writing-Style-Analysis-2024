To play devil's advocate, it's pretty common to have higher thresholds to make sure changes are going to be consistently popular. So if it passes one election but not the other, then it may not actually be majority popular.
We’re guaranteed the opportunity to vote on it during a midterm and during a presidential election, and it works. That’s how we got our renewable energy measure passed a couple years back and I’m looking forward to RCV passing in 2024 as well.
It prevents the kind of tomfoolery that Republicans tried earlier this year in Kansas with abortions. They used a special election, which usually have older and more conservative turnouts, to try to push through a statewide abortion ban.
As a Nevada resident, I actually like that we have to vote on measures twice. It prevents a minority party from introducing a ballot measure during a relatively low turnout midterm and then pointing to that as they use it to make unpopular (but difficult to reverse) changes.
This won't really benefit either party, not really, but it WILL benefit the American people because it will moderate everyone, it will no longer be a binary choice between crazy/unacceptable people and we will get the consensus candidates, who will be someone we are all sort of ok with.
It allows the final result to more accurately represent the will of the people, you can safely vote for an independent if you want, and then your vote will go to who you would prefer from the major parties instead of being wasted.
We have preferential voting here in Australia (same thing different name I guess), and being able to have your first preference for someone you actually want, and then being able to say, well, if I can't have who I want, then I would prefer this candidate next. It means you can vote for someone who is more representative of you, and still giving your vote to someone who represents you more if your best choice doesnt win.
