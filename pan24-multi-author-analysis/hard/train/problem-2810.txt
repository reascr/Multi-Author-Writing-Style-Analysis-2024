The key part that Trump's team are skipping over in that quote is that says that documents "shall, to the extent practicable, be categorized as Presidential records or personal records upon their creation or receipt and be filed separately.".
So disgraced-former-President Trump would need to show that he declared these documents as personal documents when they were created, and that they were treated as personal documents, and were filed separately. Given how incompetent and disorganised his administration was, this might be hard to do. Instead his lawyers simply assert that he designated them as personal documents, and argue that him having them shipped to Mar-a-Lago proves it (i.e. their argument is that it would have been illegal for him to take Presidential Records to Mar-a-Lago, so they cannot be Presidential Records and must be personal records, so by sending them there he was designating them as personal records).
Of course, that is nonsense as it would be too late for him to have designated them as personal records when he sent them to Mar-a-Lago; they have to be designated as personal records upon creation...
So... that is kind of what the law says (see e.g. which notes "the President has the discretion to determine what is personal material").
When the law says that the President determines what is official and personal, that means they have to make that determination, not that they get to pick and choose. If you're at a potluck supper and someone says "Which dish is yours?", you don't get to decide.
