Wouldn't matter. It would be swept under the rug. Now that DJT has made bigotry fashionable again they will still vote en masse for whoever is the poster-child of hate and intolerance. (I didn't coin the term DeSatanis).
I agree the right would be well served by a muti-party system with ranked-choice voting now that they are split. It never would have happened (at least in my state) if the repugnicans stayed together. Then we can push the left away from center-right and back to the left by the majority of left-leaning voters voting progressive first and Democrat second (to prevent our votes from splitting our party and helping the right).
If one ignores the whole “one party trying to take away people’s rights and making a blatant march toward fascism” thing, the conditions were right for Republicans to sweep the midterms. They didn’t, and that’s a huge blow to their political agenda.
It was a “butt kicking” in that it didn’t follow the expected outcome, both from historical precedent and polling.
Speaking for myself, I’m most worried about Republicans taking the Senate, as that’d give them the same “stonewall every judge appointment until we have a Republican president” policy they had under Obama’s tenure. Regardless of how you feel about politics, vacant positions in government need to be filled. The job is more important than the person doing it.
