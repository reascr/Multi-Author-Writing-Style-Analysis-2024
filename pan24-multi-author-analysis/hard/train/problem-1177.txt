Granted it's only the word of one politic analyst, but the mere fact this can be said out loud in Russia is deeply unsettling imo, nuclear weapon or not.
I said months ago, that the propability, that a substantial amount of nuclear weapons in Russias control are duds is higher than the propability that a lot of putins complexes stem from the fact that he is a absolute manlet.
Until last year the US inspected their warheads as did russia inspect ours it was a treaty, they absolutely have working nukes, this joke that russias nukes dont work needs to die,do the have the 5,000 nukes they proclaim, most likely not but they have enough to still ensure mutual destruction.
Edit; I know Russia has nuclear weapons but are we really sure they're in any condition to actually work? I mean it seems like Pooptin let the oligarchs and his cronies use military funding for nothing but their own greed.
I fucking called this months back and people downvoted me and gave me shit. Maybe it's too early for a full victory lap but screw the reddit hivemind I'll take it.
My previous comment from 169 days ago; Russia has shown that anyone alive from or in Ukraine is a 'valid' target, gun or no gun. The only good thing to come out of this is to show the world they need not fear Russia like it's a superpower. Not anymore.
