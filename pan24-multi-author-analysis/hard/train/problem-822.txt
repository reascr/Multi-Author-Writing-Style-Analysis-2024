Trump was not the first to raise it, and he had next to zero influence as no one took him seriously. He was barely seen as a caretaker President for the US.
Other countries they supply would also be shaken and likely start looking for alternatives "just in case", which would lead to all sorts of shenanigans.
There's a very good reason why diplomacy calls it "Putin's war", and its because Russia will outlast that little manic.
The rest were the usual suspects of Russia alarmists who for decades spend their time crying wolf about anything Russia does or doesn't do. They just happened to be right in a big way for a change.
Most people against Nord Stream were against it for any number of selfish reasons, in many cases completely unrelated to actually caring about the EUs or Germany's energy security. Trump, for example, just wanted to sell more US LNG in Europe.
> Russian LNG made up 16 per cent of European seaborne imports during the period. While the total volume of 17.8 billion cubic metres represented a fraction of the 62.1 bcm pipeline gas flows during this time, it nevertheless leaves Europe exposed to Vladimir Putinâ€™s weaponisation of energy.
