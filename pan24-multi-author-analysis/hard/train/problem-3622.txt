India is one of the closest major partners of Russia. Most of India’s military is made up of Russian exports, and India runs a big trade deficit against Russia. And just generally, Russia wouldn’t want to lose such a major country as a close partner.
I didn't mean India, I meant russia is losing, and russia is pulling favours so that their allies would be for stopping the war as it is. Where did I say that India is losing?
I just want to be friends with India. Holding on to the Cold War/War on Terror grudges is understandably harder for India than the US, but citing Pakistan as the reason is kind of nonsense, when both the US and Pakistan despise each other. We’re aligned with India in many, many ways, and the US has been courting India for YEARS in the fight to limit Chinese expansion.
Explain to me why India would abandon a decades long relationship with a key geopolitical ally to pivot towards a U.S. that in the next administration might very well turn hostile against it (just like we’re doing against China now). Of course these countries would be better off on good terms with the US - too bad our 70+ year history of complete foreign policy clusterfucks literally pushes most of the world to remain non-aligned or seek consistent security in the arms of Russia or China.
