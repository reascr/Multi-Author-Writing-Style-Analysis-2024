Ya that's a wonderful sentiment, truly, but until gerrymandering is outlawed across the US, it is literally making it impossible to beat repubs who do the same. We will lose the damn country if we pretend politics isn't anything but no holds barred at this point and I assure you we did not fire first on this sentiment.
they have allowed shit like this before and it's going to continue to be a conservative tactic in the state because they know people aren't politically literate enough to spot these fuckers.
Progressives are consistently running terrible campaigns that don't sway anyone who wasn't already part of their base, and/or splitting votes from each other by crowding the field because they're all too self-righteous to drop out to consolidate support.
Much like how progressives are more passionate about preventing insufficiently left wing Democrats from getting elected than they are about preventing far right Republicans from getting elected.
That's because a lot of New York "Democrats" are actually Rockefeller Republicans who want to vote for moderate Republicans, but moderate Republicans don't exist anymore, so they're forced to vote Democrat instead, and they drag the party rightward.
