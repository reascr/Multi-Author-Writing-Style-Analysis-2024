We only make basic steel. Mild steel grades. Higher value added specialty steels is not our forte. That is the reason why a country like Japan has same volume output but double in terms of value addition.
India will expand but with domestic consumption as prime focus. We are improving. For ex, we are almost an export hub for automobile manufacturing now. India has been able to develop grades reqd for automotive industry. It's an entire eco system that needs to grow and evolve. But China is so far ahead, it's futile to even think of competing at this point.
With Russia being in Chinas influence they wont help against China. There is no way France can provide enough arms to India for a fight against China. Only remaining entity thats can really help India is USA here. And thats what my comment alluded to. With Russia in Chinas influence, can India afford to lose west as a partner.
And with Russia not for rescue, there is no way India can fight a long war with China alone. China domestic arms industry is expanding at mind blowing pace even to give US generals sleepless nights. India on the other hand is mostly dependent on other countries namely Russia and USA/France. Make in India is still in nascent stages and India still depends on other countries for critical components.
Moral issues aside, India might regret this later. Russia would be Chinaâ€™s bitch after this war, so India would have no support from Russia against China and no western support for its alignment with Russia.
No doubt India is spending money buying stuff. But we are not talking about Pakistan here, we are talking about China here. India can not match China in a war. India might be spending 70 billion USD every year but China is spending more than 300 billion. And Its still less percent of GDP than India indicating still more potential.
