Are we? When I did fire drills I didn't think the school was going to burst into flames, when we had earthquake drills I didn't think the school would be torn apart, when we had active shooter drills I didn't think it was ever really going to happen. The message I got is that we go through the motions just in case something ever actually happened, not that it meant we are in constant danger.
Has to be the case if they are actually terrified because that shit is an extreme outlier. In my time at school Sandy Hook happened more people at my school died from alcohol poisoning, car accidents, 3 suicides one from walking onto a highway and two from walking in front of trains, and one from a congenital heart defect that they were unaware of. None died from mass shootings. Not at my school or any nearby schools. Which I am pretty sure is the experience the vast, vast majority of students have.
I am pretty sure it is most don't think about it. Unless of course like I said adults are going out of their way to deceive or traumatize the kids to make them think they happen more than they do and that they are at significant risk.
Why do you want people that are overworked, underpaid, and constantly stressed to have a deadly weapon while in the presence of children that actively cause more stress??
