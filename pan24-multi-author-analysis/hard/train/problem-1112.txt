He’s never had the support of a majority, and the same people who voted for him in 2016 did so because they didn’t actually know what kind of person he was, and there wasn’t an incumbent and Clinton had been demonized. Not saying anyone should underestimate trump, just that conditions are different.
Odds get better if trump can’t win the primary and tries for a 3rd party run, then splits the vote between the open fascists and “nice” fascists.
If trump is even allowed to run for a second campaign than it immediately becomes a referendum on wether America wants a fascist state or not. No question about it that point, that’s what we’d be voting for…and when you make it that basic I’m just not sure how much faith I have that we do the right thing. I’d say the 2024 election (if it involves trump) would be akin to the 1860 and 64’ elections. Those were referendums on slavery and the continuation of the civil war and essentially one issue focused. I’d rather avoid the whole dinner than have to sit at this table.
Not disagreeing. The difference is in that one has openly taken off their mask by attempting a coup/overturning election. I don’t doubt that desantis wouldn’t be bad, but he can still say he hasn’t pushed the full button openly. If that makes sense ?!?
