It depends. If Congress created the spending program and gave the Executive Agency responsible for it wide latitude in administering it, then they could withhold money by not "meeting the program qualifications". But if Congress was very specific on how the money is allocated and spent, then it would be unconstitutional to withhold it.
Except a credit check and background check are not discrimination, it's the landlord doing their due diligence to ensure their tenants are likely to pay and not cause a problem for other residents. If you had evidence of landlords disproportionally denying minorities even though they passed both checks because the landlord was using race, then you would have a discrimination case.
I disagree, the next best step would be to ban landlords from conducting tenant screenings that use credit and background checks as a cover for discrimination, and force all landlords to accept any tenant that has the money to cover move-in cost.
If diversity means you have to rent to an unemployed crackhead because she happens to be a minority, you are forcing the property owner and the other tenants to accept risk that they shouldn’t have to.
Diversity is fine, but don’t purposely sprinkle in impoverished shitty people because you think this is what my neighborhood needed. I am no longer safe in my front yard and I am sure my resale value has been greatly affected. What sounds good on paper isn’t necessarily great in practice.
