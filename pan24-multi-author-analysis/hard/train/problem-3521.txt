is a pretty good assessment of the russian threat; they made a lot of mistakes earlier in the invasion, but they seem to have learned and adapted, and they still have a significant numerical advantage over Ukraine, and the benefit of long range missiles that makes no corner of Ukraine safe.
yep. The main thing is that as things stand, russia would eventually wear down Ukraine through sheer strenh of numbers; we need to make sure that Ukraine has whatever they need to push russia out of Ukraine and even strike military targets inside russia, so that they no longer have the ability to field fresh equipment and soldiers to continue the invasion.
Russia can certainly try to restore it's massive soviet era stockpiles of shells and tanks and vehicles while under sanctions, and it clearly has no regard for the life of Russian conscripts.
If they are going to send crude waves of poorly equipped infantry, Ukraine should take them out at ranges they can't respond to, rather than letting them get close enough to engage in hand to hand trench fighting.
However the West can and is ramping up production of largely technologically superior heavy weapons, many of which can eliminate targets outside the max range of soviet equipment.
