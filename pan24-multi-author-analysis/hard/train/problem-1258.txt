You definitely wouldn’t want the peasants to be capable of defending themselves, they should absolutely be fully reliant on the state to protect them.
And you appear to be attributing Heller to the "kangaroo court made up of Republican idealogues forced on the court with zero Democratic support," but that's just incorrect. Heller happened in 2008. The filibuster for judicial nominations wasn't abolished until 2013. Every single justice sitting in 2008 was confirmed with both Democrat and Republican support. Most of the justices involved in that decision were confirmed with over 90 "yes" votes in the Senate. Two were confirmed with fewer than 60. Not exactly the ultra-partisan kangaroo court you were describing.
Either way, Heller was decided by a court whose justices were largely confirmed with overwhelming support from both Democrats and Republicans so his idea that it was decided by a kangaroo court falls flat.
Also, when many millions of more people in our country support Democrats, yet we have a Supreme Court with an ultra Republican majority... yes, it's an illegitimate kangaroo court.
Except, it is a kangaroo court... made up of Republican ideologues forced on the court with zero Democratic support.
I am not trying to excuse the Republicans at all, however they weren’t alone in creating the current partisan court. I do not doubt in the slightest that had the shoe been on the other foot our court would be equally partisan just with a liberal bias. Hell, if you look at the voting record of the court up to 2016 (haven’t looked since our former president started nominating true crazies), the liberal justices overwhelmingly voted as a single block and the conservative justices had a much more varied record where they would cross over and support ideas the liberal justices supported. That has likely changed with the three new justices though.
