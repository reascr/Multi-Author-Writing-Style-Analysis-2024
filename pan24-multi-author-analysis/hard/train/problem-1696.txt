Moderate Dems: We're prepared to support .38 caliber and smaller firearms being allowed in the spirit of bipartisanship.
Honestly I think the moderate stance on gun control is stronger than the progressive stance at this point. A lot of progressives have been shifting far enough left to get their guns back.
Progressives are realizing this as they wake up to the reality at hand and shift further left. Pink Pistols, John Brown Gun Club, and SRA membership is exploding. It's mostly the old neolib holdouts that are delusional enough to think there's any hope of reasonable middle ground compromise with the far right that are still holding on to the old Democrat gun control platform.
Tbf, a lot of Democratic lawmakers could do a lot more than they're doing to resist the GOP and just keep trying to take the easy way out by pushing dumb platitudes about bipartisanship while doing things that their donors/GOP donors (lots of the same people) like. The way to fix that isn't by punishing the Democratic party/punishing America by allowing Republicans to get elected, though it's turning out to vote in primaries and making sure all your friends and neighbors know who the good and bad Democratic lawmakers are.
Maybe if progressives stopped chasing partisan dreams in a country with a moderately conservative median voter, progressives would be better able to legislate rather than standing in the corner quiety thinking "they don't know I'm a pro at legislating” to only complain that their absurd demands weren’t given serious considerations when they don’t reach and pass both floors of Congress.
