No, it's because its a second crime for her, for most of these people if not all, its their first crime. It's amazing how we argue for lighter sentences for people then decide we don't like what lighter sentences look like when they're handed down.
If you want to be technical about it, casting a ballot with the intent for the vote to be counted, if you're ineligible is a crime.
A provisional ballot literally means: “I’d like to vote, and this is what I would vote, but hey government, please check if I’m eligible and if yes, then please register my vote. If not, please disregard it.” So where’s the criminal intent?
That is not evidence of intent to commit a crime. That is intent to vote. If she intended to commit a crime, such as with these other assholes, that would be worthy of punishment.
What these examples actually show is that when would-be criminals try to cheat, the existing system is strong enough to catch and prosecute them. This doesn’t prove the need for new voter-suppression laws; it helps prove the opposite.
