I can't find it again but if you include a column for $200k and up, the difference is statistically insignificant again. Democrats control 20 of the 20 wealthiest congressional districts, represent a supermajority of households in the 1% and collect more money in political donations in 5 of the last 6 cycles.
Why would you pay off the education debt of the middle and upper class when you could pay off the debts of the working class? Must have something to do with who they vote for.
And like I said, no one needed to be bribed to vote for the left. The reasons I gave above is plenty. Plus no one had to vote for the left to receive relief. Its not some leftist "perk.".
That’s his point. His position is that the Executive didn’t have the authority under the HEROES Act to enact this program, and that the correct branch is the legislative branch. Because the executive took the action that the legislative should have taken, Biden effectively prevented the plaintiffs from being able to comment/question the eligibility requirements. I don’t agree with the ruling at all, but that’s his conclusion.
I don't really understand how it is unconstitutional in their view. Congress passed a law giving the department of education the power to handle the loans. It is not a powers issue if one branch willing gave that power to another, That is my understanding at least.
