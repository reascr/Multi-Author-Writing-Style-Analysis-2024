I mean Boris was writing anti EU hit pieces for decades in the lead up to this, it's a death by a thousand cuts and the back of the mind type thing from seeing headlines or blatantly false information in papers. They also made sure no one investigated Russia's influence with regards to brexit for the Russia report, clearly trying to hide the evidence they were paid to be a part of the whole campaign, party donations are a powerful thing and they kept taking them for Russia with no fuss.
There’s fascinating analysis of the Russian involvement in Brexit, it was primarily fed by platforming pro-brexit politicians and pumping out thousands of fear mongering articles to weaponise exisiting British ‘patriotism’ and convince the public they’d be better off alone.
Russian agents aren’t working to build support for Russia, they’re working to internally destabilise countries by amplifying internal issues and using it to distract said countries from the rest of the world.
Also because the propaganda doesn't have to convince anyone to support Russian causes, it only has to convince them to oppose local causes. So anyone who has a problem with anything is a potential target for propaganda that simply magnifies the existing problem, and suggests counter productive actions. Russian propagandists have already spent decades infiltrating every kind of extremist or malcontent group you could imagine. The only thing that's changed recently is that social media has made the approach more effective.
