Biggest problem is that even if you don't buy apple, which i don't, the alternatives aren't much better, and anyone saying you don't need a smart phone in today's world are pretty disingenuous or naive. I would gladly pay more for a phone made in the west at higher standards, but they are not really on the market or at least i have not found one.
I am not young, just always surprised by the ignorance of Americans, you seriously didn't know that iphones one of the main products of one of the largest companies in the world, are sold outside of the US?
No one goes out of their way to learn about iPhone in other countries, but most of us probably know that Apple has been the world's 1 company for a while. Most of us probably know a company can't be 1 just by selling their top product only in the US. We know that Samsung, a Korean company, sells phones in the US. It's just a really simple and reasonable assumption that iPhones are sold in other parts of the world, especially when they're not even manufactured here. All of these things I'm explaining to you are really basic for most people, which is even sadder as you keep trying to sarcastically pretend I'm wrong or something.
In the time it took you to write all of these “let me get the last word and try to sound like a smart person with sarcasm” comments, you could have entered one or two Google searches that would have made you more of an expert on international iPhone sales numbers more than anyone in the thread.
Yes, it's indirectly important. Not knowing they sell iPhone in other countries is, again, exceptionally ignorant. It's like not knowing if Africa has airplanes, or if dogs have hearts. It means there is something really lacking in how you understand and encounter general information about the world.
