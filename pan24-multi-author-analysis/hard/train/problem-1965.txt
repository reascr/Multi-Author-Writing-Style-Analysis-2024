As a practicing Catholic, I hope whatever is the result of reform, there’s an option for me to continue following the core tenets of the faith (penance and self-reflection, almsgiving and unconditional love) while also bringing the church into the modern age. The Catholic Churches here in the US have always hammered home the New Testament and Jesus’ teachings taking precedent over Old Testament scriptures: Loving your fellow man and treating others with respect has been taught to me all 12 years of my Catholic education. Because if Jesus were came to us today, he would teach equality among sexes, creeds, and races. That’s who Jesus was and what his underlying messages were. He didn’t exclude people or put asterisks on rules. It’s time the church to practice what they preach and follow those teachings.
The church need to get with the times. They're a part of our society, not ruling over it and not unaccountable to it. They don't get to tell entire countries how to treat large groups of the population. If they want to keep their hate-filled dogma, as far as I'm concerned they are more than welcome to do so - as soon as they give up on all the benefits they already have over the rest of society in terms of taxation, legal accountability, etc.
If yes, we agree. If no, you're saying there are certain issues where what a religion wants should outweigh what the nation wants. I'm not onboard with that.
I strenuously disagree with that premise. In the western world, the state is accountable to voters. The church is only accountable to their imaginary friend.
All I did was point out that it isn't in a slightly less polite way than you did. If he's gonna be making those kinds of slanderous claims, a bit of return fire should absolutely be expected.
