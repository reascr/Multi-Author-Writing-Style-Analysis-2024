Oh and there is no risk of secondary sanctions on those that don't follow the cap. As long as they don't use eu infrastructure to do business.
It doesn't matter what Europe sets. Russia wont sell to them. And since there are plenty of buyers for Russian oil, Europe is just going to be forced to get their oil elsewhere.
So I guess it's okay now to import Russian oil if it's not above the price cap. I think $60 per barrel is still kinda profitable, isn't it? A little bit under the .
If they're desperate for money, that could change. , it only costs Russians about $20-50, so $60 is still profitable. But I guess Europe can still lower the cap even further. We'll see how the market responds.
Wouldn't the capped price still influence the market, though? The rest of the world could bid at $60 (without fear of sanction from Europe, isn't this the reason why they set a price cap in the first place?), and Russia will have to sell at that price; today's , so it is not far-fetched that Russia can lower the price to match the current capped price.
