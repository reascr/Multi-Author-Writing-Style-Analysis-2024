Right, and his vice president, George HW Bush, balked at it and called it Voodoo Economics. He could not bring himself to "buy in" on such a crazy set of claims.
The way they did it was to loudly criticize the economy no matter what was happening in it whenever they could attribute what was happening to Democrats. They never offered alternatives, they just loudly complain. It's never been about improving the economy for them, just gaining power. It's fairly effective because the votes they need to steal are votes from poor people. They convince those people that they aren't poor, the problem is the economy. We don't need to help the poor, the problem is the Democrats' handling of the economy!
Not to be devils advocate but the last two years did not exactly show that the democrats do better in terms of economy.
Posted this before but here are a few links that give some history of whom is better for the economy, and yes it is democrats.
Dems have proven to be better for the economy, but somehow Republicans have convinced the majority of Americans that they are better at managing the economy.
