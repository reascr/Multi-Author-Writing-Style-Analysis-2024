Biden's immigration policies have always been a soft continuation of most of Trump's policies, while just not being overtly racist in the rhetoric about it. And yet, the moment he took office, Republicans insisted we had thrown open the borders, and they'll keep insisting that, and would keep insisting that even if Biden literally ordered the borders sealed shut to all visitors.
They spend several long paragraphs on Biden administration promises about what they'll eventually do to clean up a problem they chose to create and they're choosing to maintain every day they refuse to allow people to enter the United States to apply for asylum. We could solve that problem in an instant if Biden decided to drop Trump's policies and went back to how we'd been handling asylum before the orange asshole instead of trying to come up with a friendlier sounding version of the exact same shit.
CBP under Biden is saying, "If you want to enter you must separate from your children," so, yeah, we're separating families. The Trump administration didn't separate families who never applied for asylum and weren't able to enter the US either, so the only difference here is that this administrations family separating policy appears to have been an accident whereas Trump did it as an intentional cruelty. But I don't think intentions matter much to families stuck in tents in the desert.
Republicans lying? Well, that's unheard of, I'm sure that'll come back on them when people find out /s.
