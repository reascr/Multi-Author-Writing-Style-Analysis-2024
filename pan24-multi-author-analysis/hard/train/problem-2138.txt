This is the critical point -- the workers pushed Disney, Disney caved, DeSantis got pissed. This is ultimately DeSantis versus the workers themselves. Disney just got in the middle of the real fight. DeSantis is trying to suppress the voices of real people while pretending this is about unfair corporate advantage. He scores the political points he needs with his base by going after gays, to moderates he looks like he's leveling the playing field for business, but what he's really doing is suppressing dissent of the masses while boasting of how free we are here. When people talk about the rise of fascism, they're talking about strongman types telling you how free you are while they put shackles on your ankles.
Disney needs to fight this tooth and nail and make DeSantis double down and lose, or we're all going to pay the price for it as our freedoms get taken under the guise of liberating us.
I have this feeling that Disney (and other corporations) are going to sink DeSantis' political future and make an example out of him in the 2024 primary.
In my dream fantasy world, I like to imagine disney execs saying theyâ€™re closing disney world and moving somewhere else and blame Desantis and government overreach. That would screw up his rep in such a big way.
