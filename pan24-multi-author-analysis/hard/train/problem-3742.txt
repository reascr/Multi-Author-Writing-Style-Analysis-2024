[] The guy who came up with the plan and paid for it is very likely pro-Russian and has worked for RT but that does not necessarily mean he actually is on any Russian payroll or something.
He isn't. The guy possibly on Russian payroll is Frick who proposed the idea to Paludan. There is still no reaosn to think Paludan is on Russian payroll, he is a useful idiot. If you had read the (admittedly shitty) article you would have known.
ehm yeah sure this news article here seem pretty questionable. they have been burning the koran for a freaking long time now, way before the ukraine war.
A guy who has been known to be burning Korans for like ten years now has been linked to Russia? So in what ways was he aiding Russia for the other 10 years he was burning the Koran?
What you need to understand is that Turkey is not blocking you over the koran burning. That part is just posturing. There are elections soon and to ignore it would lead to poor outcome. No the opposition in Turkey is not necessarily the better alternative. They were giving Erdogan rough time for not pressuring Sweden even more.
