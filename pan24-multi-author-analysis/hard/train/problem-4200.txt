I wonder what happens. Quatar has done so many shady things in this process, but now FIFA might get sued for huge amounts of money. Maybe that is the only thing that will make FIFA actually do something.
This is FIFA. They buy/sell/own the World Cup, and therefore your loyalty to it. They \sold\ the WC to Qatar who bought it without even blinking they have so much goddamned oil money. Now it's in their country and they want their fucking Sharia rules on FIFA. FIFA will bend, you know it, because fuck all of you, the money has already changed hands. FIFA doesn't care what you think. Qatar sure as fuck doesn't care what you think, you can fuck right off. They already have your money from oil and will get more tomorrow. You want beer? STAY HOME. Don't come to Qatar for the WC. You'll only fry and regret. Fuck this whole fuckshow.
Fuck you FIFA. You forced Brazil to sell it in stadiums but hey because it's Qatar, fuck your own rules right. Bunch of money hungry fuckwits ruining the world cup.
Not saying Fifa isn't shit or corrupt. But the problem is Qatar that they chose a country where they have very little recourse or control and just have to play along at this point. They aren't "letting" Qatar do it - they have no power in Qatar.
In Brazil Fifa could probably sue the govt for that, fund an opposition party or run ads against the government.
I didn't say anything about Fifa not being shit in anyway. Just that in this situation the fuckup was putting yourself under the control of an authoritarian regime, not being more respectful of Qatar's requests re: alcohol than Brazil's.
