It's not the weapon manufacturers causing the deaths, it's Russia invading that's causing all the deaths.
Or, to put it another way: who was responsible for all the death and destruction of WW2? Weapon manufacturers? Or the countries that invaded other countries, then had to be beat back at gunpoint?
Or, maybe, they were saving up to get out of the country, waited to see if it got worse, and when it turned out the war would last much longer, they ran.
However, it's pretty clear, IMO, that a country having weapons doesn't automatically lead to a country invading its neighbors. After all, most countries have fairly extensive arsenals but don't invade their neighbors with them.
You think a lack of arms companies would keep a country hell-bent on destroying their neighbor from declaring war? The ruzzians straight up deny the right to existence for Ukraine, and are waging a war of ethnic and cultural genocide. Even if the ruzzians didn't have private companies, the central government would make the guns from smaller shops, or would even create their own defense department.
