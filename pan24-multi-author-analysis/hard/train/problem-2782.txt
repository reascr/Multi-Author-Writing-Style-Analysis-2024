It hardly matters, they're de facto NATO at this point. Everyone likes Sweden and Finland is now manufacturing large parts of the F-35 fighter jets. U.S. troops are permanently stationed in both countries.
Hell, Norway changed their criminal prosecution laws so the U.S. would have "first chance" at prosecuting offender soldiers (which can't possibly go wrong in anything like, say, rape.) And Norway is already a NATO member.
Why should Sweden rebuild parts of Turkey because they want to join NATO? For humanitarian reasons , sure, for joining NATO, no thatâ€™s still blackmail from Erdogan.
I'm sure there is considerable pressure being put on Turkey in the background, from the USA and other NATO gov'ts.
Background: The US has begun to exert pressure on Turkey. As usual, the US has to save the Europeans a.../backside. Just like in sending arms to Ukraine.
I think it's awful that Sweden feels like they have to do this now. There is no question at all that in a liberal democracy it must be possible to burn any book. Personally, I think that burning books is entirely stupid. It's something the Nazis did, too. But gain: In a liberal democracy, that must be possible. It's pure blackmail by a socially backward autocracy: Turkey. They would have been kicked out of Nato a long time ago - if it wouldn't be that they control access to the Black Sea.
