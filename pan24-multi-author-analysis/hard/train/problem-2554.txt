First off, wikileaks was (is?) an amazing thing and sadly from what everyone around Assange has later told, be it his co-founders etc., the man is a megalomaniac narcissist asshole.
Assange is an incredibly shit person it amazes me so many people try to defend him. Nobody ever went after the reporters Snowden used, that is journalism regardless of how I feel about what Snowden did. People are trying to create controversy where there just isn't any with Assange.
Assange is not a journalist. You have no intrinsic right to groom mentally unstable US military personnel and convince them to steal classified data for you. That's what he did and he's going to go to jail for it.
Assange claims he didn't know it was from the Russians. The US claims that he did. The former would be journalism (i.e; the reporters who published the Snowden leaks were never indicted). The latter is espionage.
Looks like he's being charged as a spy. I'm surprised. I don't think most will stick. He's not a citizen. I'm not even sure he can be charged for breaking our laws while in another country.
