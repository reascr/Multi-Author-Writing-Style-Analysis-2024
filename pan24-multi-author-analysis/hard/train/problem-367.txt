Japan did not end with a true unconditional surrender, they redefined it in 1945 to give them a way out so they didnâ€™t fight to the absolute end like Germany did.
Please note especially the part at the start where Japan unconditionally surrenders and also the part at the bottom where they surrender the emperor and his government to whatever MacArthur deems fit.
Japan surrendered on the condition of sparing the Emperor among other things, the US wasn't even sure the peace was going to hold until nearly the formal surrender in Tokyo Bay.
Those were accepted because they were beneficial for the U.S. indeed when they tried to keep their Emperor in their first attempts to surrender those pleas were rejected. Surrender happened first, then the U.S. decided what Japan could have. Many documents were seized as a result of Japan losing. They weren't really a token Japan could throw in for favorable terms.
Edit: if you want to downvote can you at least try to prove me wrong? I don't care about votes but my counter was objective fact.
