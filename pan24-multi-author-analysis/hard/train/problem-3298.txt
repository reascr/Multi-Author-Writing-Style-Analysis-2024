It's a real problem that technology has so outpaced government legislation that they have no idea what to do with it. It's a problem on a lot of fronts.
That's not even the issue. Because in every single case where this "new technology" is by design self similar to analog solutions, both by trying to replace a use case AND the intend to be theoretically adoptable by DAU, they insist on this "being something totally new and totally the limitations that fundamentally were agreed on in terms of boundaries don't apply".
You know who has no idea? Their voters who don't understand that this whole "this is totally new and need bold new ideas" is nothing but a powergrab and rerolling the dice on already settled matters.
So voip totally isn't the same thing as a phone call, so why not act like the privacy rules around phones have totally nothing to do with it?
The problem is that their "not having ideas" is how to sell something they already couldn't get several times in the past, but they feel really confident that THIS time they can frame it believably. And as a fall back position they have the "woe us, this is rather difficult and new", because they REALLY want to avoid the accusation of "this is difficult because it's really old, and we were told we can't have that".
