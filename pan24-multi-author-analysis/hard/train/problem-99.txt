Swiss here, this is the real reason. Rejecting the re-exporting of the Gepard ammunition was the dumbest thing ever Switzerland did, and it's hurting real bad all around. That's way politicians all over are looking for some really clever ways to fix this without formally changing neutrality laws in fundamental ways. Like one is to sell back a lot of the surplus Leo 2 tanks to German (they were produced in Switzerland but since it was license Germany legally counts as country of origin). Which would allow Germany to export them to Ukraine without Switzerland's approval, even under current laws.
They want to allow other countries that bought weapons for their own defense to aid Ukraine rather than having Switzerland stop them from doing so.
I would guess that our government will attempt to find a loophole to allow sending weapons to Ukraine, but from my experience, swiss neutrality is here to stay for the forseeable future.
Switzerland can still be neutral and at the same time allow other countries to export weapons and ammunition that they've produced. I mean if the other country already purchased the items and have possession don't stand in the way.
