A few years ago I worked packing items for Amazon during the Christmas season through an outsourced employer. A thing that really sucks in working for them is that your performance is recorded by automatic systems. While there is a lot of demand for products almost no one is fired, even if their performance is low. Once the season is over, the demand drastically decreases: there are just not that many objects to pack and everyone's productivity decreases as well. Then they start firing everyone because their productivity is low. For me it was fine to be fired like that. I expected it, but others were sad about it. Working with automatically-recorded metrics is super stressful because those metrics can be used as an excuse to fire people whenever Amazon wants. They could just be honest from the beginning and tell everyone we just need you for a couple of months.
Indeed they were hiring seasonal workers, they said so and it was not a surprise to me. What I found disingenuous was firing outsourced employees with the pretense of low productivity from the employee. There simply was not enough demand.
You are right. Some co-workers felt that could lead to a steady job and Amazon pretended they needed us for a bit longer than they actually did, just to keep the workers invested in their job.
You thought you had a steady job - and if you're doing amazon you might not have many options - and then you get dumped because amazon just doesn't need you anymore.
Where I am at average salary is 18.75 an hour for amazon warehouse. Assuming 40 hours a week, the positon would cost 39000 per 52 weeks. Times 10,000 that's 390 million.
