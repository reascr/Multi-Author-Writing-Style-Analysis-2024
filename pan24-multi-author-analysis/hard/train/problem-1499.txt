And that's before you factor in that college in the UK costs so much that a lot of their own students would study in countries like The Netherlands for 1/3rd of the price and get a less outdated education in the process.
impossible, precisely because there are no more foreign students, therefore the costs of universities (and everything gravitating around universities) will be borne by British students.
if the British universities cost for example a billion and instead of for example two million students now there are only one million who pays this billion? Do you want British students to really not have to pay more?
EU students used to pay home fees for UK universities. Post-Brexit, they now pay international fees, which are triple the cost. So in actuality they're making more profit from them now even with half the EU student intake. Not that it's a good thing overall but from a purely financial point of view they're better off now. Especially since for many courses universities actually lose money per every student paying home fees.
