I still think it should fail the establishment clause as being denied an abortion is very much being forced to adhere to a religious dogma that is not your own. (So IMO the "Abortion Ritual" direction the Satanic Temple has taken is interesting.).
Right. This is why a "right to life" protects plants from being uprooted too -- heck, being confined to a womb is an intolerable abridgement of a fetus' right to liberty.
There should be a Supreme Court case over the right to an abortion based on freedom of religion, considering that Judaism and Islam don’t believe life begins at conception. And Numbers chapter 5 instructs people how to perform an abortion. Even if a Christian cites “thou shalt not kill”, abortions evidently don’t violate that commandment, or Numbers chapter 5 would not explain how to perform one.
Numbers chapter 5 in The Bible contains instructions on how to abort a bastard child, so The Bible supports abortions for unmarried women, and Jesus never condemns abortions, but he does condemn a mob who sought to punish (and stone to death) a woman for extramarital sex. When red states banned abortion, they condemned many women and girls to death in childbirth, which is anti-Christian.
And even then, you have all those states that kept passing anti-abortion laws anyway, even in defiance of Roe/Casey.
Even if somehow there were, the fact that the government might not have tried to exercise the power for fifty years is irrelevant, because that restraint was dictated by SCOTUS!
You think there's adverse possession for rights, or to retract powers from the government? Yeah... no.
