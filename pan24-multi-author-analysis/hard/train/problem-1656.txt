You can see it as an ingredient most of the time. Sometimes it's called "celery nitrite" which is tricky because celery sounds healthy.
If you aren't getting meat from the butcher section of the supermarket then it probably has nitrates in it.
Nitrates are very important in cured meats as it allows them to be made and processed without shit that will kill you.
>This week a meta-analysis of seven studies involving a total of 6,250 subjects in the American Journal of Hypertension found no strong evidence that cutting salt intake reduces the risk for heart attacks, strokes or death in people with normal or high blood pressure. In May European researchers publishing in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that the less sodium that study subjects excreted in their urine—an excellent measure of prior consumption—the greater their risk was of dying from heart disease. These findings call into question the common wisdom that excess salt is bad for you, but the evidence linking salt to heart disease has always been tenuous.
That is highly highly unlikely. Any meat product that is cured or prepared like a hot dog must have nitrites in them.
You can purchase uncured hot dogs with no nitrites in them. Not the same, but its not like they are a meat alternative either with different textures etc. Not going to try and promote any type of hot dog as a health option, but I will mention them just as this topic is touching on nitrites in general.
