To Taiwan, sure. It is not a threat to western nations though, they are much more at risk from fascism growing internally in them.
I'm much more worried about the police knocking on my door due to the rise of authoritarianism that is brewing in the US here. If you think the police will be coming because somehow China has imposed themselves on the US, that is just completely delusional. I never defended or "sucked the teets" of any dictator and have no desire to. I'm calling out the US because its authoritarian trend is much more of a threat to me. It is not a defense or excuse for China, but acknowledging we have more pressing and local threats than China.
Prevent them from what, and how to prevent them? China has not demonstrated a desire to impose on the US, challenge yeah, but not force any kind of regime change on them, let alone anywhere near the capability to do so if they wanted. The US is trying to justify imposing themselves over China, and you are buying into the propaganda parroting that it is up to the West to prevent them.
China is so blatantly using them as a proxy for fighting the "west", while selling them overpriced goods. And their other option is to back down against the sworn enemy they thought their cyber warfare and Conservative party infiltration would bring low.
I'd hate to be a Russian right now. Putin should just off himself a bit early and save himself the painful slide into neurodegeneration.
