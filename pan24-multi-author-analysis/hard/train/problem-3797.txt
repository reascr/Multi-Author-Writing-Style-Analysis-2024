Mate, genuinely, I'm not even scratching the surface. His history of violence is so horrific I've literally had comments automatically removed for talking about it. He only pulled out of actively driving with the intent of murdering a man because of a Jesus bumper sticker. He wrote a freaking book about it.
Walker does not have DID, he just uses that as an excuse to dodge accountability for legitimately horrific acts of domestic violence ("it wasn't me, it was an alter!").
Yep. The last time I voted for a Republican was 2012 iirc; I voted for the Republican (who cast the deciding vote for an anti-discrimination bill that passed) that was running for Lt Governor rather than the Democrat that was... well. Let's just say that from what I could tell at the time the Dem running was further to the right than the Republican.
So please, enlighten us on what the republican house ran on that would make you think they are going to do anything?
What is the republican agenda? They voted against lowering gas prices and lowering inflation recently.
