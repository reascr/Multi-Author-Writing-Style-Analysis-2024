Sound good, but means nothing. So him choosing not to live in the Pope's luxury quarters but in a small apartment only sounds good, but means nothing? So him still driving his almost 40 year old beater of a car only sounds good, but means nothing? So him turning the Pope's summer vacation palace into a public museum only sounds good, but means nothing?
So that history makes it even more important to try to change. And Francis tries to be the example of that change. He lives in a simple apartment --- not the Pope's luxury quarters. He drives an old car, a 1984 Renault 4L.
This is a man who is doing his best to live his life as an example of the virtues that he preaches.
Just because he's not wholly onboard with your dear-to-your-heart human rights issue doesn't mean that he's not better than previous popes.
Ya' know, I really like the message he's trying to deliver, but I feel it would be better if the Catholic church didn't laud their wealth and power around. It kind of demeans the point of what he's trying to put out there.
