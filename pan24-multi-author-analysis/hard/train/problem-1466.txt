You cannot take humans out of systems entirely. Therefore there is no such thing as a perfect system. How do you weed out the ones that are 'too imperfect' to continue? An institution cannot fully and actively control or prohibit actions on the part of individuals. To say the sum of an individual's actions then reflect that institution would mean that every institution is corrupt.
Unfortunately it's exactly this vagueness that gives rise to the need to remind some that it's not so black and white. If these sources of ingrained institutions, as you call them, remain vague and intangible why should anyone simply accept that a serial killer isn't just insane, but actively encouraged by, for example, institution x or y that does more good than bad in the eyes of most? If we actually care about solving any real issues we're going to have to be more precise, otherwise it's just openly saying 'I'd rather be right than effective.'.
But we are. While you may have the intelligence and personality of a wilted daffodil, you are not a plant, you are an animal.
All animals, including humans, will always choose to pick on the most vulnerable if it is deemed in their interest to attain something from another being. It's just common sense (if viewed from a purely risk/reward aspect). You don't see apex predators trying to take down the strongest members of a group of prey. They always go for the weak and infirm members. Lowest risk of expended energy, lowest risk of defence, and therefore lowest risk of damage being done to them by their prey. This gives the highest reward compared to going for the strong member of the group.
