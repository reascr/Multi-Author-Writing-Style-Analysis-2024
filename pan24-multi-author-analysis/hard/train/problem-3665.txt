Most medical R&D is done in publicly funded universities or with public grant money. When those researchers find something then big pharma companies swoop in and do the last mile to bring it to market n patent it.
These companies get decade-long exclusive rights to drugs they’ve developed. Only after that time, will generics become available for a cheaper price that still may be too expensive for some. They are incentivized through profit motive to develop drugs aimed to reduce symptoms instead of curing the underlying diseases and medical conditions. Think of it as subscription vs. one-time fee. These companies use government and institutional research to bring their products to fruition, in addition to the $$$ we already addressed. How does this relate to Covid?
Well, let’s remember that private companies deserve to profit from their labor and efforts; but to the extent they are piggybacking off governments, public universities, and other institutions, then using the IP generated from that to profit from public health emergencies or novel and fast-moving health issues (like pandemics) they should not be allowed to charge for the IP. Looking at the vax in isolation your argument carries more water, but looking at the business as a whole, and in the setting of reality as opposed to business class, one is not impeding the private nature of pharmaceutical companies by asking them to take an L on a portion of future profits, which year over year are in the billions of dollars.
Sorry for the novel. You didn’t exactly answer my question as much as repeating the phenomenon I mentioned in my comment but here we are.
