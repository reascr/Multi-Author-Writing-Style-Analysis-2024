Heh. My grandfather lived through that. One of the things he did to keep his siblings and himself alive (they were still kids when my great grandfather died - they didn't have anything and we're too young to work the farm) was to mentally map the floor plan of the store. Then, that night, he returned with his sister.
Iirc, some models of hybrid American pickup trucks work that way - they're designed to operate as a worksite generator and, if equipped, sometimes feature a 240v, 30amp connection. ... Heck, one guy I know has a regular has powered pickup and he has that ability.
A plug-in hybrid like that would likely have a 16 to 20kWh battery - I say 'likely' because I haven't done any reading on that since just before covid hit.
Are there any models of hybrid cars where the gas engine can be used to directly charge the batteries, without actually driving the car? ( Idling at home, say. ).
Yeah. I think being a "competent" tsar of Russia meant you had to be able to ruthlessly put down reformers (of which they were many). You also had to have some good policy ideas, but it doesn't matter too much if you can't even stop a peasant rebellion.
