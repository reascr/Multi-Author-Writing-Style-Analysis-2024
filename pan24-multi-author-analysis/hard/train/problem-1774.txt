Good thing all the hungry people in Minnesota are school aged. Cuz this really does nothing to address hunger of anyone who doesn’t go to school. Better to give rich kids free lunch than to actually help a 50 year old person get some food because “kids” is great for politics.
They already had it so that poor kids got free meals, but this makes it so that everybody does. So a family of millionaires get taxpayer funded school lunches. A single 25 year old mechanic has to fund a millionaire's kid's free lunch. Add to that the (let's be honest, likely) corruption of the food contracts, issues of food waste, etc, and it's at least something you shouldn't casually be like "see, no biggie" when we have no idea what the future ramifications will be. The thing just passed.
I mean, if you're gonna argue for everyone to pay the same amount of taxes regardless of income level, that sounds good to me. Otherwise, yeah, we do have tons of stuff that is income dependent.
It's that people will have to pay for the rich kid's meals, not that they get them. Very similar to the student loan thing, where blue collar, middle class people are gonna have to pay the debt of rich yuppie professionals.
