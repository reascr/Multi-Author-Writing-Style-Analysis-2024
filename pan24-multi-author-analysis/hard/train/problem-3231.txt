I will however say that the people who purport that weed does no harm and somehow you can magically light it on fire and inhale the fumes without Ill effect citing the lack of studies are compete morons.
I get your point. But there's no safe amount of things you can light on fire and inhale. Whether that's weed, tobacco, firewood, trash, etc etc etc. It's not safe to light things in fire and inhale the smoke.
I will say it point blank, lighting things on fire and inhaling the smoke and carbonized ash of ANYTHING is bad for you. Some things might be worse to burn and smoke than others but there's the healthy amount of things you should smoke is 0.

I'm not disagreeing with anything you say, but the people I know that use tobacco seems to consume a lot more of it, and generally by smoking or vaping. In my red state, old-fashioned cigarettes are mostly in style here, although I do see more vaping when I go downtown to the city. I know a lot of marijuana users that have switched to edibles, as well. It's an area worth studying in depth, for sure, and I won't disagree that smoking anything is bad for your lungs. But are two joints a day worse for your health than two packs a day as this study seems to imply?
