Something like that probably is inevitable, but it will emerge from the gaming world not the communication world. There is no need for it in chat or voice applications. It is just a pointless corporate boondoggle.
Because people who run companies tend to be pretty dumb in a lot of regards. They hear Zuckerberg say it’s the future. They think Zuckerberg is a tech genius. They want to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing. They are too dumb to realize literally no one wants it.
Look at literally every video game companies announcement of how they’re going to implement crypto. It’s clear they don’t understand it, but saw people making money from it and tried to get in on it.
They're not only trying to make people like it...they're trying to make people want to spend their own real money on fake bullshit within it. As if people have any money to waste on crap like that these days.
They're disconnected from reality. No business is gonna go and buy all these VR headsets for its employees to do meetings when phone calls, emails and zoom chats get the job done as it is.
And not only that but they seem to expect it to simultaneously have mass appeal and to be used as some sort of expensive business communication tool.
