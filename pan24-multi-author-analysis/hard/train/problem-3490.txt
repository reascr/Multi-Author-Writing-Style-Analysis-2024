I would read that as they are wanting to ban all semi-automatic firearms. Which would cover most firearms including hunting rifles, handguns, and so called "assault" weapons.
What's the definition of "assault weapons"? The last time there was a federal assault weapons ban it was just a gun cosmetics ban.
Plus, banning ARs is just nonsensical if you are not also banning all mag fed semi automatic rifles. I could go out and by a Mini 14, and have a 30 round detachable magazine for a gun that fires 5.56, which to my knowledge would be totally legal in the case of an assault weapons ban. The same goes for buying a mag fed SKS, or even a .22 with a drum or 30 round mag.
Plus, per the FBIs crime data from 2019, rifles (doesn’t specify whether it’s an AR or not) are only used in quote “2-12% of gun homicides, with most estimates putting it at around 7%”.
Also, are we just not going to acknowledge that handguns are used in the majority of gun homicides in the US, but we don’t see anyone trying to ban those.
To be clear, I’m all for gun safety laws (and am pro second amendment) but “assault weapon” bans are an ineffective way of doing it and is purely used as a political tool and is just a feel good half measure.
Almost anyone that looks at before and after pics of guns that were sold and were affected by the ban won’t be able to visually tell the difference.
This is correct, manufacturers will just tweak the gun designs to be outside of the legal definition of an “assault weapon” and basically sell the same gun regardless. Just like they did the first time.
