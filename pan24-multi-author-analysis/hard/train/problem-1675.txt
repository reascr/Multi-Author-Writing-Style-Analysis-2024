This. Genocide, rape used as a war tactic, snipers lining up men and boys to be shot execution style is still very very fresh in the minds of all of former Yugoslavia. Srebrenica remembrance marches are held all over the globe every year. It is very understandable why they would be cautious. Putin is not known for being kind.
Putin may not have much choice. Right now everyone else could kick Russia's ass if they were to decide to invade someplace easier. And Putin needs a win pretty quick if he wants to stay in power,...
I don't have a problem with their choice, and I don't care what percent don't want to help. As long as the next time their economy collapses or their country is devastated by a natural disaster or invasion that they don't come whining for help. If they're consistent, then great, no harm no foul. If not, they can suck up the life lesson.
And when Russia decides to annex Croatia and no one comes running to Croatia's aid, I hope the Croatian people really thank their government for showing Europe how important it is not to get involved in a war more than is necessary.
Serbia decided to annex Croatia and no one came to our aid, we had a weapons trade embargo and had to buy on the black market, were forced to postpone for months declaring our democratically decided independence while our cities were burning and world recognized our independence carefully, prolonging the war.
Nevertheless, we are providing weapons, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but how dare we not give absolutely everything that's asked of us.
It was never part of Greece, Greece is pretty far away from Croatia, unless you mean Roman Empire when it was based in Constantinople, and back then half of Europe was theirs.
