Do we know what was in the documents and whether it was especially sensitive information? Applies for both cases. Difficult to ascertain how serious the story is without knowing that.
I personally think this story is overblown. But do we even know the contents of these documents, in either case? I think that matters in order to try and ascertain intent.
It's funny though how we assess "intent". For "our guy" he gets the benefit of the doubt, their guy meant it.
I think there's a reasonable chance this story was intended to hurt Biden because he's insisting on seeking re-election and there are those within the Democratic establishment that don't want him to run again.
But even though this is still “wrong,” I don’t think you’ll find many on the left who defend Biden tooth and nail the way the right circled the wagons and defended Trump despite a multitude of transgressions.
I think Biden is doing great so far in his presidency, and I believe this was an honest mistake in his case, but if Trump going to jail means Biden needs to go too, so be it. Sorry, Joe. Should have been more careful.
