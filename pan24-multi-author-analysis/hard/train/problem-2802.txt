Because those are in Red States. It’s not about housing these people. It’s about using them as props to score political points with the Republican base.
Republicans have made their point. Now let's see if Polis, Abbot, DeSantis and all the rest are actually interested in doing something about the issue.
they aren't illegal, they have been screened and released to await their asylum hearings. These migrants we're talking about crossed legally, followed the process and have broken no laws. Calling them illegals makes you look like an ignorant, racist moron.
"closing the border" doesn't mean what you think it means. You can't close the border and also allow traffic for import/export or travel. Closing the border would kneecap the economy. Not only that, these migrants aren't just going to turn around and leave, closing the border will only increase illegal crossings.
No one's arguing CO is being mean to the arriving migrants....just that this is fucked up for the southern border states to be doing in the first place.
Your comment doesn't make any sense. You're responding to someone insisting the feds be sent to stop the human trafficking, which it is when southern states take people, including children and young girls who are at high risk of being 'lost' and send them elsewhere.
It sounds like you're mocking his request for the FBI to get involved, as if what's happening to the migrants is not all that bad because they are being bussed elsewhere to a safe location.
