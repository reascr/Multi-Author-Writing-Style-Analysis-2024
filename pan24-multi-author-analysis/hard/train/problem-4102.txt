does it matter where they are whaling given whales dont know about national borders? its a barbaric practice regardless of where its happening. the international community needs to red line this shit and have consequences even for our allies.
dude, fuck them the same. the only communities i can give a somewhat pass are inuit communities that have to do it for survival, but they take a whale here or there for survival. Denmark, Iceland, Norway etc should get fucked for it too.
Denmark, Iceland, and Norway may also be criticized. But I have a feeling that Japan is being attacked in an unusual way.
serious question, because i don’t know shit: is any other country doing it as aggressively as japan? i ask because i haven’t heard of any other country commercially hunting whales [or sharks]. also because someone else mentioned that some japanese schools serve whale meat once a month - which they called ‘infrequently’.
Japanese public schools are still serving whale meat. Due to mercury poisoning, this sometimes kills the kids. Almost all Japanese people i have met have eaten whale meat. Few, however, will admit it unless they trust you. Some are also ignorant of actually consuming it as they were probably children when they did so.
