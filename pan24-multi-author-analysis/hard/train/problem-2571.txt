Trump, on the other hand, deliberately took classified files from the White House when he left office. When the National Archives told him they needed them back, he balked and refused. After further negotiations, he returned some document and claimed he had nothing more, until an informant let the government know that Trump actually did have more files, at which point they sent agents to ask him to secure them, and eventually raided his residence since they were worried about who might be getting access to them. In more recent filings, DOJ has actually alluded to the fact that he still has some classified documents he needs to return.
The difference here is, the documents in Biden's possession appear to have been left at these locations inadvertently, and the moment they were found, they self-reported and sought to return them to the National Archives.
They found about a dozen documents with Biden that were located in an office and a garage with nothing to indicate the information was used maliciously, plus Biden’s team immediately returned the docs and are aiding the investigation and special counsel.
I believe this should be investigated if for no other reason than clearing up any national security concerns, but let’s not act like Biden’s and Trump’s cases are even close to the same thing.
I think so- they're going to a full transparent investigation and assessment of the danger and culpability, and Biden will probably come out of it just fine.
He erred, but it's never the crime it's the coverup and they're going to show painstakingly that only Trump attempted a coverup.
I could've swore that the Trump classified documents were known and making headlines before the raid...am I misremembering? I feel like I'm correct but I don't quite remember any specifics and that was all only 5 months ago. I blame the constant daily barrage of bullshit headlines.
