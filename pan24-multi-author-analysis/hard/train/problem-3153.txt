The US needs more immigrants, we have a shortage of min. wage workers. But the current system of just letting them in by the thousands each day with nowhere for these people to sleep at night or get some food is messed up.
We do but we also have tons of entry level jobs that need people to work them. These jobs used to be filled by immigrants but for years we have made it hard for them to come to our country.
2) When we do set up a base, we leverage the labor of the people who are going to be housed there. Our troops are able bodied adults that have had training in following orders, are literate and have skillsets that are documented and catelogued. As a group, the migrants are nothing like that. So we'd have to truck in (and temporarily house) our own troops just to get the "migrant base" constructed.
1) I call hyperbole on the claim that we can set up a military base in a couple of days. We can do things like that in months or maybe weeks (assuming that we already have rights to the land on which it's gonna sit), but a big base is a big undertaking.
