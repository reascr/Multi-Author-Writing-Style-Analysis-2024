He's in a state that is like 80% Trump supporters. I don't care what he calls himself as long as he keeps voting to confirm Biden's judges, keeps Dems as the majority party, and votes for all but the most ambitious Dem bills like he always does.
Not someone outside of WV, not someone who is going to describe to me the game of politics, not someone who is insisting to me that he votes with Dems and that's all that matters. I just wanna know why WV people like the dude and if they feel confident in re-electing him.
If it gets him re-elected in West Virginia then he can do whatever he wants. He’s still voting for Biden judges and the IRA, which any other senator from WV would never do.
He caucuses with the Democrats, which means Chuck Schumer — not Mitch McConnell — gets to decide what bills get voted on, what pace we confirm judges, etc.
Particularly 2018 Florida (sooo close) and 2020 Maine (wtf Susan Collins??). Those should have been Dem wins.
I do wish we could’ve gotten rid of the filibuster for voting rights & tbh rebalancing the Supreme Court because of stolen seats. But we needed to win more seats in order to pull that off.
The following cycle, in 2020, Swearengin got the nomination. She lost 70-27. The Republican incumbent beat her by 43 points.
