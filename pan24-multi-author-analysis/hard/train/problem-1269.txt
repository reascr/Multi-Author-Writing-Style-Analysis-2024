Obama ran on change, and McConnell ran on "no". When they blocked everything Obama did, Democrats got disheartened and stayed at home.
Democrat voters want change. Republicans are perfectly happy with gridlock. Trying to be bipartisan hurt Democrats massively from 2008-today.
It's so annoying seeing people still blame the Dems for Republican obstructionism. If 95% of the Dems support a thing and 95% of Republicans oppose it, people will blame the Dems for that 5% opposition and not the Republicans.
If not for the filibuster they could force the vote right now, given how popular legalization has even been in red states, the GOP would either need to yield and vote in line with Democrats or explain to their voters why they voted against.
So let them try and see if there's enough Republicans that support breaking the filibuster especially now that their party is in disarray.
Democrats should just bring back the talking fiilibuster - once the Republicans stop talking - we can move on. Manchin has even said himself it's too easy to obstruct legislation.
