The bigger problem is Floroda is more mild in the summer than, say, Arizona or New Mexico or Nevada where summer can get over 120 degrees and those places will just keep getting hotter so they're not realistic for a location despite have the land for it.
They won't move somewhere where they can't be open year round because of snow or ice, so that eliminates quite a few more states that have a ton of land available.
Well, I figure that Florida is just going to eventually be covered completely by water, and Dusney will be a moot point then. LOL.
I always giggle at this take. Clearly you’ve never been to Disney World. The Avatar Flight of Passage is a $500 million building that cannot simply be picked up and moved somewhere else, and that’s just one ride. What about the surrounding infrastructure of roads and hotels, will those all be moved as well? How about the theming, underground tunnels, and monorail system?
You can’t pick up and move hundreds of acres of land and all the developments on top of it, and even if you could, an equally sized swath of land nearby to an international airport in a tropical state doesn’t exist anymore.
I can’t see how you possibly could have been to Disney World when you seem to think of it like it’s a traveling carnival. Buildings are permanent construction, not portable, and the idea that Disney should or would “write-off” a profitable theme park over political differences is farcical.
