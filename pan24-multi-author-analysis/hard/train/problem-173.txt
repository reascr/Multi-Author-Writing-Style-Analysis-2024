Backstabs; interesting choice of a word from an Indian news source. Implies that they should be supporting Russian invasion and atrocities by doing the opposite or at least be inactive.
Well interesting as in it implies where the sympathy lies, then again its no surprise there are issues between India and Pakistan but as far as journalism goes not a great headline.
So why is India pointing the finger at Pakistan and calling it a backstabber if Pakistan are only engaging in their own self-interest as India does? You can’t have it both ways if you wish to be taken seriously.
When India is invaded, will people remember India’s indifference to Ukraine being invaded? Perhaps; perhaps not.
And India profits off cheap Russian gas by “ backstabbing “ Ukrainians by not recognizing and denouncing the Russian imperialist invasion… deliberate targeting of civilians, torture , kidnapping, forced deportation and other war crimes.
I don’t trust much of what India claims about Pakistan, and, for the same reason, what Pakistan claims about India.
I am an Indian and it feels weird to defend Pakistan. India's position on Russia is hard, but fair. If it stops oil trade with and removes Russian oil entirely from market there would be economic crisis everywhere.
Sensationalized headlines aside, not all countries have the luxury to ditch cheap Russian oil. India is doing what it needs to do in order to keep its economy doing well.
