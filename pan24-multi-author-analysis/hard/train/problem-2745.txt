France still has crazy young talent and will be a huge force in 2026. Hopefully Mbappe can chase Messi’s record!
Surpass Messi soon… need to move from PSG though. He already has everything he could’ve won in France and a World Cup and can probably get another World Cup he’s young i think the only thing he is missing is a UCL title. As for World Cup records he is 5 goals from tying Miraslov Klose record in all WC. Mbappe has so much time and already done so much.
Mbappe and Haaland are next two greats in the making. With both Messi and Ronaldo at the final stages of their career they will carry the game forward.
I’m not a fan of Ronaldo and don’t care, I’m just answering the question. You can’t talk about the Red Sox World Series drought without talking about the Yankees, these things go hand in hand.
Yes and that’s literally the conversation and why Ronaldo comes up? Messi solidifies himself as the best of the era if not all time is a meaningless statement without the context of who was also in that running.
I was cheering for your side the whole tournament, I’m not a Messi fan (although he’s the 🐐) but can’t really be too upset by the outcome in the scheme of things. The French still have a historic performance.
