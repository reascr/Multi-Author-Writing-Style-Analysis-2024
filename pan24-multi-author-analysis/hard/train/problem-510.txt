As a kid slavery and racism were very real lessons in school and it wasn’t that long ago… you can talk to people who lived when black people couldnt drink out of the same drinking fountains as white people….
Yet… in my lifetime I fully expect to hear from the younger generations that slavery and racism are just propaganda and myths and that it never actually happened.
Institutional, legalized racism was a horrific part of American life when boomers were born, and we should talk about it much more.
"All these black people angry for no reason, they obviously just hate America, which has never been anything but a force for good in the world.".
Yes. I wish they'd fight back, especially on book banning. We need them to also call out this Christian nationalist crusades they are on right now. The fact no one is even trying to call these fundies from Footloose out is astounding.
"Roberto Clemente is scary. He along with Stargell with the Pirates were the first all minority infield to win a World Series. That is something so scary!".
