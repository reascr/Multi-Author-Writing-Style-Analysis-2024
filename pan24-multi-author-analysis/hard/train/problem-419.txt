I’ve always voted in a very blue state. Somehow I didn’t realize the implications of the 2020 census and redistricting and our house race went down to the wire. We won but my point is that it’s easier to vote and just not worry about it. I’ve always voted but this was the first year I bothered to check if my ballot was received properly. Weird feeling like my vote made a difference.
Can't imagine not voting. We've just had an election with one of the lowest voting percentages (I think ever) and it was about 84.4 % of the voting population afaik.
It's easy to get the 2nd highest turnout in 30 years when their typical rate turnout is abysmally low. This turnout was still lower than everyone else, so I don't see the point in rewarding mediocre performance by young voters.
Young voters didn't vote early and they didn't show up at the polls, they were the lowest participation and vote share once again.
That's a great description of the internal dialogue of the 3 out of 4 youth voters who didn't turn out this election.
And until many younger adults become established in society, they don't give a damn about politics and voting.
Or if your generation had actually made it easier for young people to vote they would. If your generation had made a political system that young people could and would believe in they would vote.
I found my motivation to vote, as did many in older age groups. It's up to young voters to do the same.
