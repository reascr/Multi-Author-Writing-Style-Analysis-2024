If the west stops dragging their feet and arms Ukraine to the teeth with much longer range precision artillery and a lot more armor, they can take Crimea by the end of the year.
Russia can be defeated in 2023 if the West stops dragging their feet and gives Ukraine the long range precision artillery that is able to reach its borders.
if Ukraine is armed to the teeth, we ought to fear them taking Moscow before we worry about their weapons falling in Russian hands; who wouldn't know how or where to operate them.
Depends if he uses tactical or strategic nukes, people don't seem to realise that nuking Ukraine does not necessarily mean mutually assured destruction. Everyone also seems to think article 5 would be activated in the event of a nuclear strike on Ukraine because of radiation crossing borders, hate to break it to everyone but they can detonate a nuke over Kiev with minimal fallout.
Even if russia nukes Ukraine with a strategic nuke and fallout crosses into Poland and article 5 is activated, we're not just going to start nuking lmao.
It's literally been stated by NATO, nuclear fallout affecting an allied nation would be a justifiable trigger for article 5. I have no reason to think the nations that would be affected by the fallout from a nuke ukraine (if there is any fallout as you said, there may not be) would hesitate to hit the button.
But using any nukes at all in this fashion would have to result in russia getting cut off, and all nations in this know it including china. Otherwise it sends a message that nukes are OK to use as long as there's no fallout in neighboring nations and I don't think any nation, US and china included, want that memo.
The supposedly second most powerful army in the world is begging for weapons from pariah states like Iran and North Korea .
