Anyone that listened to hardcore history on WWI (highly recommended) knows this is true. Tough to be on the other side of rape or baby murder.
Rape is absolutely being used as a tactic. The authenticity of the audio may be in question, but thousands of rapes happen isn’t a coincidence, it’s a feature.
You are missing, OP is pro Russian, they think the rapes are being exaggerated to make Russia look bad and Russia is the real victim here.
Well someone who doesnt really read articles sent me one thinking it was proof of Russians condoning rape.
They are not being raped because Russian women are so thrilled by the idea and ask for it, thats all people are sceptical about.
Russian’s be raping, they are raping A LOT. And the world will be better when every last Russian soldier in Ukraine is a sunflower.
And let’s be clear here. In a world where Russia invaded Ukraine, kidnapped Ukrainian children, murdered countless Ukrainian civilians and buried them in mass graves, and raped thousands of women. What OP is most concerned about is that the audio recordings of Russian women telling their husbands to rape Ukrainian women (and these recordings exist) are potentially unreliable. That’s the big picture issue that OP is concerned about. The authenticity of audio recordings, not the factual documented atrocities.
