Conservatism originated from the aristocracy as a counter to the French Revolution. The more you know, the more you realize they're the same old feudalists they've always been.
The Founders were, by modern standards, terrible people, particularly for being slavers. But if they were here today, they'd take one look at the GOP and go, "Those goddamn Tories are still here?!".
Yeah. There are plenty of LGBTQ+ wrestlers all across the industry, enough to run entire shows like Effy's Big Gay Brunch every Wrestlemania weekend. Not just here, even in Japan trans wrestlers are pretty respected. YENY/ASUKA, Yu Ishino even though he came out after retiring and even Nyla Rose herself were able to become something in Japan. It was her work over there that got Kenny Omega's attention and ultimately led to her signing with AEW.
Not even NASCAR is truly safe from them anymore. They banned the Confederate Flag from all races, Dale Jr. aka Redneck Jesus has supported the ban, Bubba Wallace has a good chance of getting another win under his belt this year to go with his sponsorship bucks, Brandon Brown's (yes, that Brandon) career is completely ruined due to both being toxic to most sponsors and getting rug pulled by a right-wing crypto scam, Matt DiBenedetto (another big time MAGA guy) is stuck in third-tier Truck Series purgatory despite actually winning a truck race last year and cup series driver Cody Ware even said Trans Rights on Twitter.
There's still a lot of right-wing assholes in the sport, there will be for quite some time, but even the heads of the company themselves know that they need to move on from the old school stereotypes if they want to survive into the future.
