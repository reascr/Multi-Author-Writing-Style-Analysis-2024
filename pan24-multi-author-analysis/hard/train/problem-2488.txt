RealPage and YieldStar specifically. From what I can tell they don't care if most of their units sit empty because rates are too high so long as just enough tenants stick around and pay the exorbitant rent. The goal is to maximize profit over occupancy. That's the game that's being played and is a prime example of how even the upper class are going to end up joining the poors as they are forced to give more and more of their money to an ever shrinking owner class. It's how the 1% has become the 0.1% and will eventually be the 0.01% and so on.
That's the ultimate goal. You have a job, and the company not only provides your health insurance, but also the roof over your head and food on your table and even the transportation to the job itself in exchange for 50 or 60 hours of labor every week. And you really can't leave because where are you going to go and with what money? It's modern day slavery. I've said it before: we're much more like China than Europe.
They've accumulated so much money because of how cheap it is to borrow going back over a decade that they've literally run out of things to buy. So on to the next asset class: residential real estate.
I'm thinking of it as they see the rental housing as a way to make money are and investing 1bn in it.
So they are building additional housing capacity with the intent to have it as rental only. Yes, making only rentals available in the future is bad. However this is new housing, which should alleviate both rents and purchase prices in those areas.
Except they price out the rest of us from ever owning a home buy artificially inflating the price through the purchases. I understand what you are trying to say but the full picture isn't being painted.
