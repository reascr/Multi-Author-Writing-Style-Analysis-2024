this ALWAYS happens. Breaking news drops and you get really reasonable takes in there (looked at their top post about this and the top comment is how all news, Fox included, with shareholders, lies to the people. Many highly upvoted comments agreeing that Fox is BAD).
The only feasible outcome I can see from that sub is them ditching Fox but moving towards NewsMax or whatever the far, far right media is now.
Fox has always has their bug in the lower corner say “Fox News.” This implies that all of these “entertainment/ opinion shows are actually journalism driven. Only after lawsuits does Fox management claim “these shows are not news, and should never be used to form an opinion.”.
If there ever was a Defamation suit that could combat Fox News and its Editorial shows it might be Dominion's civil suit. From my not lawyer understanding Dominion has to show both intent and damages which is very difficult to do. However Dominion has texts and internal communications saying they did not agree in accusations of fraud and they have show damages, the number of canceled contracts by multiple states specifically commenting on potential fraud.
Final reason why Dominion could pull it off. They have the money and legal team to fight it. Fox will not be able simply tie the case up and extend it till Dominion runs out of money.
