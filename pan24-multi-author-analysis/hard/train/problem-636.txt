'Red herring': most crime guns are smuggled from the US, police believe. It'd help if the feds kept stats, but they won't. This is not a domestic gun problem: registered, or 3D printed.
3d printing is a terrible tool for making a gun. My 80 year old lathe is much better suited to the task. (Well atleast the barrel and a few other critical parts). Most any machine shop will have the tools and equipment to make guns. It won't really be a cheap as guns smuggled in from the US. But the point is it can be done and be totally under the radar. 3d printing a gun is really a bad joke. It can be done but it won't be anywhere as good as a properly machined gun. There are 3d printing processes that could possibly make a good gun, but they are very expensive processes. CNC machining is far cheaper.
All that said, none of this helps with the real problem of the thousands of illegal guns that are already out there being used in illegal ways. As long as we have a right to privacy those guns will be out there. It's only when people do incredibly stupid things that people get caught with them.
To me it's silly to outlaw guns. I'm all for better regulations around guns, but prohibition is a dumb idea. We have enough privacy in Canada to circumvent most prohibition laws. So instead lets have people who want to own guns, give up some of the protection that privacy provides.
Well, gee, you outlaw the lawful purchase of guns, and people use 21-Century technology to make their own. Did this actually come as a surprise to anyone? The concept of people improvising their own weapons to get around laws has been going on for thousands of years.
My point wasn't about the criminal laws. It was more about the apparent "surprise" at the rise in ghost guns, as cited in the article. That should have been anticipated years ago.
