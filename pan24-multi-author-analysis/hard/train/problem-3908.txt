It would be funny if it had said something like “nazis are bad and will always be bad. We won’t flip flip on this one”.
No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.”.
Isn’t it interesting that the people closest to those in power making laws vote heavily for one party.
Blaming Democrats for things Republicans vote against is just par for the course for your average American conservative.
Are these classic conservatives (that are more closely aligned with today's Democrats) or extremists that dominate the Republican party in the US? Pretty big difference.
