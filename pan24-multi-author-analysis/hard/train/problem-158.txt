Second, please go back to the 80s and 90s REMEMBER airwaves, newspapers, etc. They rarely painted Trump wrong. In fact, he was McDonald commercials and most Americans just found him a joke around that time. There were journalists that were barred from speaking against him: Taj Mahal. Not everyone knew that he was an ass. NY citizens that worked within the construction, real estate market did. But not everyone. Don't analyze things from the point of view of a millennial or gen Z that is not looking back.
That's a very broad statement in regards to millennials and gen z. As a millennial, I remember the Clinton administration. And I know I'm not the only person under 40 who is politically aware- not only the current political climate but the past as well. It would be extremely short-sighted if two entire generations were only are aware of current politics. I remember Trump being a slime ball. I also remember his gaudy New York apartment. Anywho, generalizing people is not nice...
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
