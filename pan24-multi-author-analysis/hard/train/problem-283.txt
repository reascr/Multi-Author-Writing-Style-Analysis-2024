It is incredibly shocking I find that so many working class people see the Republicans as the better option mostly because Democrats are pro freedom when it comes to identity politics.
It's sad to me that Republicans push so many ideas that are super unpopular that the only way to save face with their voter base is to give them some form of plausible deniability. Why should anyone trust that Republicans would ever do the right thing and pass more legislation to keep Social Security and Medicare alive?
Interesting thought, since Social Security is funded by the payer/payee trust fund and taxes, the “fair tax” would prevent funds from going into SS thus killing it, right?
No amount of realistic tax hikes will allow us to make Social Security solvent indefinitely, so we will have to "take less money out".
It’s “sunsetting” because they don’t dare take social security away from retirees or people close to retirement. Their benefits will go on as scheduled. It’s just that they want to go after the benefits that we are paying into in order to receive later on. Those are what’s on the chopping block.
