Basically we’re still all arguing out the differences between behavioral addiction (porn, shopping, etc) and chemical addiction (drugs.) Prevalent theory says that they’re similar, although different. (For instance most chemical addictions have behavioral components going along with them that sometimes must be addressed in order to reduce addiction.).
The research isn’t final yet, but I’d be very surprised if, going forward, behaviors and drugs weren’t looped together more as both being addictive. Both ultimately are coping strategies that are difficult to quit, and have increasingly negative consequences. You’re right that withdrawal and tolerance don’t work the same with chemical and behavioral, but they’re both still likely addictions.
I’m arguing that for something to be an addiction it must produce physical withdrawl. If quitting is not a medical process, it’s just a compulsion or a habit.
Not getting a dopamine rush isn’t “withdrawl.” It is a “lack of joy.” It’s man’s natural state and we are all born capable of dealing with it. It it intellectually dishonest to call repeatedly seeking out pleasure an “addiction” in and of itself.
I just see a very pernicious abuse of how easy it is to confuse this with chemical addiction on the parts of politicians, businesses, and religions.
