I really like ranked choice voting, i believe portland passed a bill where next election they would be doing so, doesn’t apply to the rest of the state unfortunately.
A lot of people have no compassion for the houseless problem here, which seems largely in part because of a ruling in Idaho in 2018 that make it illegal to prevent people from camping if there were not shelter space (a shelter closed and the three people living there were fined for camping - they sued and won). Betsy Johnson and Drazan focused heavily on being firm they would take care of getting rid of them (without any actual plan other than ‘cracking down’). Johnson called them roaches. I knew quite a few people who absolutely wouldnt vote republican but liked the sound of Johnson in the debates and her harshness on the issue. It took all my effort to convince them that Tina was the only one that had actual solutions and that Johnson was siphoning more democratic votes away from Tina than she was votes from Drazan. And if they really didnt want a Republican governor then they needed to vote for Tina Kotek.. Not to mention Phil Knight donated to both Johnson and Drazan and we all know how anti union that guy is.
I'm in hard R rural Oregon and I think it's possible Johnson actually pulled more votes that would have gone for Drazan than for Kotek. I heard a lot of support for Johnson around here. I like to giggle that this might be what happened.
