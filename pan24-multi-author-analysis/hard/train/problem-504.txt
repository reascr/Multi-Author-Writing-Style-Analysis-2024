Measles has all the tricks. Infectious days before you show any symptoms at all? Check. Virus hangs around for hours after you breathe it out? Check. Virus can reach more than _100 feet_ away from someone contagious? Check.
Measles might just be a bad cold and body rash for you, if you're really lucky. But boy, does it have some effects if you're unlucky. It can cause encephalitis (brain inflammation) - including some up to _27 years_ after you get infected. It can blind and/or deafen you. It can so that you get reinfected by all the _other_ diseases you already had immunity to.
...unless you have a compromised immune system. Measles vaccine is a live vaccine so some of us can't take it, which leaves us completely vulnerable to measles and the assholes who don't vaccinate their kids.
Unfortunately when people refuse to vaccinate, they look mostly at the death rate/virulence of the virus and not long term side effects.
Third World countries know the value of vaccinations and clamour to get them because they can't afford to get sick, it's a literal matter of life and death.
