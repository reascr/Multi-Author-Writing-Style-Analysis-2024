The fact that it took one week to decide the house is a testimony to how unsteady the Republicanc's majority will be. This is a situation where every vote will matter. If Republicans want to pass anything, they can't afford to have more than four or five representatives step out of line.
You know the republicans are just going to make fools of themselves and we already didn't have the votes to pass major legislation in the senate anyway.
It’s better to let the ignorant public believe that the GOP controls the House, and that way they’ll own all the inaction leading into 2024.
I don't think the Republican-controlled House will be able to leverage its small majority as well as Pelosi did. I don't think Biden or his team feel threatened.
Tactically, it is a good position for Dems. Biden can point to all sorts of crazy stuff the House is doing, and the House will have to do the crazy stuff because their majority is too thin. The true believers will sink the whole thing if not sufficiently placated.
