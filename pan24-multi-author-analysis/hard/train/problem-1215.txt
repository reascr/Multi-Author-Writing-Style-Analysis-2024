I remember after some other mass shooting a longish time ago (maybe around 2013, I think it was after the Boston Marathon terrorist attack; this will come up a bit later here) a conservative former classmate of mine (we went to the same high school but this was after we graduated) posted a video on FB titled something like "teenager DESTROYS lawmaker's arguments for gun control." I watched the video. And the argument was basically "if we have gun control it will make it harder for me to go hunting with my dad.".
The point is that the arguments are nearly always of that variety. That notion of "well what about ME?".
Yeah. I carry concealed. I dread the day I have to pull my firearm and take a life. But at that point it’s him or me. I hope I never have to. Chance favors the prepared mind.
I absolutely agree. You see, my problem is this: I’m dreaming away, wishing that heroes, that they truly exist.
I don’t know who is strapped and who ain’t. Given the rise in mass shooting, people just popping off shit?
