Yup, they're quite good at doing things like offering all of their products for free or at a greatly reduced price for x amount of time. When it's time to start paying the users/company/government/organization is to entrenched with Microsoft software to possibly even think of switching to something else.
You compare what Microsoft offer to drugs, but you know drugs don't really offer anything to society but temporary pleasure to addicts, while Microsoft do really offer real world services, so again, so what if they profit from this eventually? What makes you think they won't go to Microsoft even without this aide eventually?
Money? What money? Your money? Microsoft didn't say they will give 100 mil of cash, they said it will be digital infrastructure. Maybe, if you send them 100 mil, then you can dictate build the opensource infrastructure you're suggesting. You want Microsoft to send 100mil and tell them to build opensource infrastructure? You really sure that's a smart thing to do if you're CEO of Microsoft?
You know that will cost Ukraine to do those yeah? Are you going to pay for those? Can you get others to pay for those?
When I ask for an alternative from you, if Microsoft withdraws their aide, what will you provide instead?
