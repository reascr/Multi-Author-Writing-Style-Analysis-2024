To be blunt, this makes this a much better deal for the US. Rather than spending our own lives and lots of money to fight Russia, risking a full-scale nuclear exchange, we are only spending some money, with minimal nuclear risk.
I’m honestly not sure, there’s a very good reason open conflict between nuclear powers has never been risked. Just doing some armchair geopolitics, I’d assume the goal would be to drive Russia out of Ukraine/Europe and probably wouldn’t entail invasion of Russia itself or deposing Putin or whatever. But again, with nukes you can’t know that they’re not gonna hit the button, which is (imo) why everyone’s so keen to keep the conflict framed as war between Russia and Ukraine, with western support.
I want to preface by saying I'm not knowledgeable in all of it but aren't we risking a full-scale nuclear war by supplying Ukraine with hardware? I'm honestly confused how we can basically be bankrolling and using Ukraine as a proxy and not be attacked by Russia for doing so.
Given Yuschenko and then Yanukovichs tenures it serves to further exemplify Russian and American involvement in Ukraine doesn't it? Not sure what the point of your question is.
