I had a professor in college who came from Estonia. He said in WWII when the Nazis took over Estonia the people were actually happy to be freed from Soviet oppression and when the Soviets returned to push the Nazis back many took up arms against them on the side of the Nazis because they'd rather die fighting the Soviets than living under their rule again.
And after a few years of Soviet occupation (1939-1941), the Russian regime managed to basically make Estonians hate Russians far more than the enemy they had despised for literal centuries.
So for most of Estonian history, the most hated nationality tended to be Germans (at least the local Baltic Germans).
Estonia before the 20th century had two major groups of people: Baltic German aristocracy and the Estonian farmers.
So yeah, from an Estonian perspective, there is not much difference between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. Both were genocidal regimes ruled by dictators. One of them just happened to be on the winning side of WWII and as a result faced no consequences for its atrocities. It even gained new territory where it could continue commiting atrocities.
