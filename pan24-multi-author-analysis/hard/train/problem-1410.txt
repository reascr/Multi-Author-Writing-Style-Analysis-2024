More alternative vehicles like E bikes and more fuel/energy efficient single occupant commuter vehicles.
We need to repair existing roads, and allocate more money to reduce the usage of existing roads especially when it comes to single occupant commuting in cars and also commercial vehicles. We need:
destigmatize the use of busses for commuting (and improve service times...I could go a lot into this as a person who didn't have a car for a while).
Even if you drive and will continue to drive your whole life, it's in your interest for public transportation to be better because it actually does reduce road congestion. You should vote for transit even if you love to drive, because you can spend more time driving and less time in bumper-to-bumper traffic.
Correct, the phenomenon is called induced demand. It will be better for a very short period of time then return to the previous equilibrium point. More people will arrive at the same speed as before, but no one person will arrive more quickly on the same journey after a couple years. When you consider how much these projects cost and what they do to the urban fabric, they just don't make sense.
