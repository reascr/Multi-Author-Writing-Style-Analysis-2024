Thank God, she won over that far-right “abortion should be illegal in all cases” extremist, and it looks like the voting rights and abortion rights ballot measures will both pass in Michigan as well!
I like it, but it's interesting to think about how independent ballot initiatives on abortion could end up being a blow to the democratic platform. Dems are running a ton of races on abortion because it's a popular issue, even among republicans. But what you're seeing with these independent ballot initiatives is that red states -- e.g. Kentucky & Kansas -- are voting to preserve abortion rights but still voting overwhelmingly for republican candidates.
It's a good thing for states to preserve abortion rights, don't get me wrong. And if this is how we get it, great. But if you're thinking purley about the game of politics, what these independent ballot measures seem to be doing is taking the unpopular Republican stance on abortion off the table. Republican voters can get what they want on abortion and still vote in the Republican candidate. That kinda undercuts the messaging of democratic candidates in these races, which means Dems may need to rethink their messaging.
