I bet the pro-DST sleep researchers were paid off by Corporations to argue that perma-DST is superior to perma-standard time.
I mean, we saw a rampant increase of productivity since the '70s. We could have saved energy by cutting labor hours for the same wages. This could promote more outdoor activity and 'traditional family values.' How would that profit corporations though.
Here's a thought for the corporations. Change your work hours in the summer. Go from 8 to 5 to 7 to 4. Then those consumers have that extra time to spend in the evening and it doesn't screw with those effected by time changes or those effected by year round DST where it won't be light out until 8:00 am.
Why should we lie about what the time is so that people can get an extra hour of daylight when we could just all decide to work from 8-4 instead? It's literally the exact same thing but it doesn't involve changing the clock and lying about what time noon is.
Changing the time in a clock obviously doesn't impact the planet. Fuckin duh. But it does impact how much light is left in the day when people are getting when there's only 3 hours of sunlight, 2 hours, 1 hour, etc.
