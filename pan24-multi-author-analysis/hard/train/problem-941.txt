Biden is a gun owner. You’d think he’d know what he is talking about. He wants us all running around with revolvers, I guess.
So get a revolver, maybe two, and/or a pump shotgun. Nothing is wrong with better a mental health system and red flag laws, but the vast majority of mass killers seemed perfectly sane until they began killing everyone in sight.
This makes perfect sense - it's the rate of fire that promotes mass shootings and what distinguishes a military grade weapon from a gun for sport or self-defense.
But I also think that looking at it objectively, that very thought, can be a part of the equation that leads to gun violence.
But when I look at it honestly, as someone who can be as objective as possible looking to find the solution to the problem of the gun violence and deaths...the math adds up that the vast number of guns, and the ease in which they are available, are the significant overwhelming factor.
It wouldn't solve the problem violence, but we'd probably have a lot lot less firearm deaths if we had much stricter gun control.
Logistically as well, going up to gun owners and trying to take away their guns is just... Well it wouldn't work out for anyone. Cats out of the bag, physically you can't take the guns away there'd be too much bloodshed. Instead implementing training courses, stiffer background checks, and even a pysch eval would go much further.
