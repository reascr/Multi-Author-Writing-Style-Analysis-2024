Probably the best Ukraine can currently hope for is what another user pointed out: Russia declaring a "Mission kill-only-the-Ukrainian-Nazis accomplished", allowing either for their retreat or easier recapture by Ukrainian troops while the Russian population doesn't make a fuzz about it all being for nothing.
It was probably inevitable that Russian troops eventually learn from their mistakes and change their doctrine to reflect reality. For me the worry is that the "smart survivors" will pass on their experience to a large amount of mobilized troops that may overwhelm Ukraine eventually just because of the sheer numbers they could muster. But that's still far in the future, if at all. And so far, it seems that for the time being, no large-scale mobilization, part 2 is going on.
Ukraine must do what it has done largely well so far: Be creative and outsmart Russian strategy, and I hope the western tanks and IFVs arriving soon will have an actual impact!
In fear of more weaponry like the Leopard II tanks, a quick last attack and Russiaâ€™s last great attempt? I am so proud of Ukraine and hope support from non western countries rises too.
