I will never forget Christie on Stephen Colbert's show a few months before the 2020 campaign and Colbert BEGGING him not to coach Trump for the debates.
It was really a fascinating thing the way Christie slipping and sliding around Colbert's questions, it sort of ended up with him implicitly saying Trump was terrible but letting a Democrat win the election was worse.
It's Christie who keeps displaying a lack of judgement by inserting himself in this situation like we'll forget the time he ran trump's doordash dressed as a fucking pokeball.
Conservatives like to think Christie is a tough no nonsense politician, but he's just another bootlickin piece of shit.
After four years of witnessing every way Trump was unfit to be president, Christie helped him with debate prep against Biden.
Still, Christie helped Trump prep for debate AND what did Trump give him? COVID. Christie literally caught COVID by anti-masking, superspreader rally holding Trump.
Christie knew the maniac he was dealing with and had already been pushed out of the administration because Jared held a grudge about his shitbag dag getting put in jail by Christie.
In a weird way that would be better than Trump. DeSantis doesn't have the mojo to start a cult. Maybe MAGA dies from starvation because with DeSantis it isn't getting its daily dose of batshit crazy in the same way.
My hope is for big Democratic gains in all three branches because Trump lost the nomination and split the Republican vote by either going third party or just trying to sabotage DeSantis. That could trickle down where Trump backed nominees end up challenging Republican nominees as third party candidates.
