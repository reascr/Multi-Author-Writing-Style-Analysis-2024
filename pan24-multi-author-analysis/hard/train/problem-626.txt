Let's see, Trump's Attorney General and FBI dug as hard as they could for two years, and found zero.
Congress was not needed for an investigation, Trump's DOJ investigated and found nothing. Do you really think a congressional committee will discover anything new at this point? The GOP is merely playing to the base.
Some large percentage of the country is somewhat displeased about the Republican overreach on abortion, and a larger percentage is concerned about issues such as inflation, jobs, and healthcare. One party seems serious about governing, and another one seems to want to sooth Trump's narcissistic injury from having been impeached twice by impeaching Biden three times, or more.
But I'm sure that if even Republicans haven't been able to prove anything despite their willingness to bend and break reality, a congressional committee will for sure impeach Hunter! /s.
Tucker Carlson and Rudy Giuliani had the laptop contents for months before the 2020 election and it was such a nothingburger that Tucker Carlson put out a statement saying that he thought Giuliani was offering him bullshit.
