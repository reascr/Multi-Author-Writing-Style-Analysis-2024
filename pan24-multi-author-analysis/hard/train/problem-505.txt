The further right wing they get, the more pro-Russian and anti-western they become. Conspiracy forums (all basically taken over by the alt-right) are all in now on the idea that the West is an immoral and degenerate empire allowing LGBTQ and transgender “groomers” to indoctrinate children, exploit them sexually and eliminate traditional notions of gender identity completely. All of this being led by a cabal of high ranking world and business leaders through a network of shady orgs, secret societies and international bodies of various kinds, with overtones or direct assertions of nefarious Jewish/Semitic involvement. To that extent they’re very much pro-Russia, as Russia has been the main driver of this propaganda for quite some time now and holds themselves out as the main (or only) defender against the West’s perceived threat/influence.
Anyone paying any attention for the last several years would regularly hear Russia's propaganda coming straight out of the mouths of Republican "leaders." I'm glad the Guardian published this. But, to anyone paying attention, this is not "news.".
There even is some truth to this statement. The kids of rich and/or powerful people have at least one superpower: their parents. Case in point, Fucker asking Hunter for a referral. I get why people are furious about this. Shit, I am. A lot of these rich assholes talk about meritocracy but we're honestly so far from it. It's disgusting.
Also, I have have never tuned into Fox. The only times I have heard his voice is some clips on the internet or other shows. But I still hear his disgusting voice when reading the quotes in the article. I need a shower now.
Unreal. I didn't think I could despise this guy any more. Of course he also betrays friends in public for his own good.
