“so nothing flew in, just lost ... but there is no time to deal with it, the main thing is to fulfill the plan for mobilization and legitimize the tricks of the departed.”.
- ”But we understand that the Russians will not admit the losses associated with the strikes on the planes. Because this is the undermining of the basis of the Russian nuclear triad. If we can destroy Russian strategic bombers with conventional drones, it means that Russian air defense is not working well and the Russian nuclear triad is vulnerable.”.
It massively depends on whether the attack was conducted with something like Tu-141s launched from Ukraine or something smaller launched more locally by Ukrainian Special Forces or partisans operating within Russia.
Russia keeps saying they’ve attacked Ukraine bc Ukraine refused to de-militarize itself, therefore, Russia will forcibly demilitarize it.
If the moments comes where Ukraine pushes Russia out of their country, he will simple stop sending his forces over the border and just say "Mission accomplished" while never losing a word about this.
With all the abandoned Russian gear getting fixed up and being used by the Ukranians maybe Russia should just attack itself a bit to slow down the militarization!
