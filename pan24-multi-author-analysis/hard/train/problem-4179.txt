If Russia is to be held accountable they will have to be invaded, defeated, and their resources used for spoils until the debt is paid off. Russia will not accept paying reparations for an offensive war that they lost without ever being in danger themselves.
The alternative to Russia paying reparations is the West does. It probably will happen that way, because no one trustable Russia not to mess this up or hold the money as leverage for whatever reasons.
Econmical and diplomatically speaking if we had to shell out more money than russia had the ability to pay, as the west id probably do it. Good way to really solidify a friend right there.
This is basically the only real answer. Russia will probably end up having all their over seas assests seized and have to pay the following at minimum.
The cost of us having to aid ukraine against an illegal war (remember before i hear "what about us" we have ALWAYS had a legal cause for war).
This aint the old days where we can force a re-build on a nation like Russia. While id say they wont use nukes over Ukraine, or even if they are being defeated in a military sense in their own nation, actually trying to force a rebuild may cause it.
Germany had a way to wage war and get away with it, russia wont at that point since i think anyone bordering them is either super poor woth nothing or protected by the us.
