Damn right we are successful in Texas! Have you been to a hotel with included breakfast here? TEXAS SHAPED WAFFLES. If that alone is not proof of how good we are then I don't know what is.
I’m not doubting the veracity of any data here. I’m saying the formula of “net new jobs for a given state” / “net new jobs of the country” is a bad and misleading way to portray this. So I’m literally doing as you suggested, calling out bad statistics when I see them.
As aside, this statistic is meaningless and cringey from a math perspective. Imagine California added 20k jobs but the country as whole lost 200k. Well then California created 20/-200 = -10% of jobs?
Here's some not weird math.... since California is <12% the nation's population, they have had job growth nearly double their per capita share.
Not to knock anything on California, because this is great news, but the answer to your question is likely to be mostly just math. California has right around 12% of the us population. It makes sense they would own a disproportionate share of job creation. Obviously 20% is bigger than 12%, but knowing nothing about where the numbers come from they could probably easily be explained by the massive shutdowns California had. Relative to a lot of states, they likely (again, I'm guessing, but it seems like a strong guess) lost a lot more jobs too leaving a larger deficit to recover.
