I support everyone's right to exhaust every legal avenue. If the Republican won by one vote, I'd support the Democrats' right to see if it can be legally overturned, too.
The point is, if there are legal avenues, it's everyone's right to explore them. The problem is not challenging the results of the election through established legal means, it's challenging the results of the election outside of those established legal avenues.
But if--and that's a big hypothetical "if", not something I actually believe happened--for example there were an unusually large discrepancy in the recount, that might be worth challenging. If there's evidence that vote-counters were openly partisan, that might be worth challenging. Hell, if there's evidence that illegal voter suppression caused a significant shift from polling, that might be worth challenging.
There needs to be an understanding and realization on the part of those perpetuating these challenges that they're doing harm to their electorate. They aren't sticking it to anybody but themselves really. We're all in the same in boat.
