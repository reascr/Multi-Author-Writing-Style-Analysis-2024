..... all the threats appear weak and feeble in the face of losing, and they keep losing more and more traction because they won't (can't?) back up their threats.
That's the crazy thing to me--all of their mightier than thou declarations would be so threatening if they were winning the war and crushing Ukraine.
Ukraine should take the exact same statement and just swap the countries and then trollface as Russian state media goes bananas with the “uKRaInE NAziS wANt tO DEsTrOY rUssiA11” rhetoric.
The real question I keep asking myself is if NATO just went “Enough of this, we are going to push you out of Ukraine” and started rolling across the border… what would Russia do? They barely have the ability to maintain a war against Ukraine… but against a US led coalition? And the nuclear question is pretty much solved on its own which is Russia wouldn’t sign up for self annihilation over Ukraine. And this Russian puppet fool? He’s already allowed his country to be occupied by Russia. It’s only a matter of time before he’s disposed of.
