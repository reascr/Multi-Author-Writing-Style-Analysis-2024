All of them mentioned how Russians simply used their conscripts as decoy - they would send them first to have them instantly killed by Ukrainians, which would allow them to discover the positions of these Ukrainians and direct attilery strikes at them. This is why Ukrainians and foreign volunteers had to learn guerrilla-like fighting in the first months of the war - you kill the Russian soldiers and run away asap before the missile comes. The conscripts are just free meat for the commanders to use.
I remember reading interviews with Polish volunteers that fought for Ukraine in the first months of the war.
So you were told "you're gonna support the war in other ways so the trained troops can massacre Ukrainians".
It's the trolley problem, except the two options are a) you go to jail for a few years or b) you participate in a war when people are being raped, tortured, and killed.
Well considering these mobilized are given the choice between prison and likely torture for refusing to serve, or go to war but be told their.
If mobilisation came knocking on my doors, I already did choose to either flee or, worst case, go to prison. I am not a killer to fight in a war of an insane oligarchic thief.
Look, it is a scary choice, but I've made it and I am ready to deal with its consequences. Prison, rape, torture. I would have laughed at myself few years ago, but now, these things seem so inconsequential - I will not be changed. I will not be made a killer. Even if the price is my freedom.
