Not like polls matter too much for Erdogan. In 2016, he declared a state of emergency after a "military coup failed to oust him from power," and he ran the country in that state for 2 years while he further consolidated power within the country.
No doubt that NATO is viewed unfavorably as Finland and Sweden have been hosting Kurdish refugees and political parties in exile, all of which Turkey designates as terrorists. And two things Turks stand united for. And that's against Kurds and Armenians.
Turkey's doing this for Turkey. Or rather Erdogan is doing it for Erdogan. Sweden has people he wants extradited and this is just about the only kind of leverage Turkey has.
Turkey would be making a binding commitment to send its own people to die for Sweden if it came to that.
While this is true, Sweden has already agreed to extradite several kurds to Turkey. Selling out our allies to a man who, several times, have violated international laws by conducting his own military "special operations" in both Syria and Iraq against kurds.
Sweden applied to join NATO out of fear of being influenced by the dictator in Russia, only to subject to the dictator in Turkey. The hipocracy is ridiculus. I have lost all faith in the Swedish government.
