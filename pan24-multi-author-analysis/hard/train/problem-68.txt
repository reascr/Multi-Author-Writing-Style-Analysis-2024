This is a story about a Republicans corruption. Again, what do Dems have to do with anything? I’m not saying Dems can’t be a corrupt, but this isn’t a story about that - save those comments for THAT article because they’re completely unrelated to this one….
Because this is a story about corruption and that isn't an exclusively Republican problem. All corruption should be stomped out. Fucking assholes selling out the public good for a pitance.
I don't discriminate between legal and illegal corruption, particularly when it is the corrupt in charge of making the laws that police themselves.
They are they same. I didn't realize Democrats weren't politicians. They are all politicians the vast majority are beholden to special interests. That is fucking corruption.
Hey look, yet another corrupt republican. Oh and he’s acting on behalf of “socialist Venezuela?” Can’t wait for r/conservative to conveniently ignore this latest example.
Did you see Bolton’s CNN Tapper comment, “Take it from a guy who knows coups…” followed by a mention of Venezuela early this year?
