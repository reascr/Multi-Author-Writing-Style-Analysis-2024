You would think defrauding Republican donors would get him booted, but not if the only option is to fill his vacancy with a Dem. They will drop support for him and support the next Republican candidate in his district instead.
And since he is a Republican in a crucial otherwise Democrat district, nothing will happen to him for 2 years.
Democrats tried to be more “inclusive” in their latest redistricting this year, and also majorly dropped the ball.
Step 1) move to a red district (preferably a new one after the census, or with a retiring or out of favor republican representing it).
Step 3) collect 174k/year for 2 years and potentially get to stay on the federal employee Healthcare plan. Which is basically an ACA gold plan, with the government covering 72% of the premium (I had trouble verifying this one, it may not apply to a 1 term member of the house).
Step 2) say anything you think will get people to vote for you. Literally anything. Tell them you jacked off on the pope if you think your district has that kink.
