Nah, there are still little pockets of it in rural Belgium, even with some young people. Though no young people really speak it as a first language, they'll just have really heavy Belge accents in French. There is a movement to revive the language, so it's a question to see how successful it is.
I wouldn't really call Belge French a dialect of French. It's too similar to mainline French, and is really more just a regional accent. Some people can have really heavy accents, like my grandparents, and there are a lot of local idiosyncrasies, but it's not much different than, say, a heavy Canadian English accent and a Southern US accent.
Walloon is a separate language. It is a descendent from Langue d'Oil, so a cousin to French. But it isn't a dialect, and is not mutually intelligible. Walloons are the dominant French-speakers in Belgium, and have lost most of their Walloon.
They speak dialects of French but you're right, the actual Wallonian languages are all pretty much extinct. Which as a Dutchy I'm a bit sad about, the low lands have such a huge diversity of dialects and languages and an entire group of those has just disappeared over the course of history.
