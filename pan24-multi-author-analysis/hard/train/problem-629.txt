To my understanding, a tank engine is specifically different from an engine that tows it's water tank behind on a tender (which usually also holds coal). Tank engines tend to be small and short ranged, they have limited capacity for water and coal on board so they're usually only used on short lines and for moving stuff around on the station area.
It's because a steam locomotive has two main parts: an external-combustion engine and a water tank. Earlier, static, steam trains often had an external water source - so the combination of engine and tank was a 'tank engine'.
There are some articulated South African tank-only locos that rival even big American tender locos. And they were also favoured on lines with turntables, as you can fit a TE on a turntable in one go - if you have a busy rail yard in a confined space it can be more economical to build water towers along the line than spend more time on the turntable (you see this a lot on the GWR line - turnaround time was at a premium in London so the line has more water towers than you'd expect for such a short line.).
2. Czechia, as well as Poland or Slovakia are NATO countries. If Russia attacks any of them, all NATO goes to war. All of the NATO air forces.
A stronger Russia would mean more of this. Follow that trend for years or decades, and future Czechia could realistically become a pro-Kremlin bus stop (this is now happening to Hungary, btw).
I wonder if this fellow is old enough to remember when Soviet tanks rolled into Prague in 1968 to quell any ideas the Czechs might have had about reducing their dependence on Moscow. I imagine anyone from that generation is none too fond of the Russians, and is happy to see them get their asses kicked by Ukraine.
