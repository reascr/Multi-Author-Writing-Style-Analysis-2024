Thing 1. It's a way of taxing people and depositing their tax dollars into the coffers of churches who are trying to indoctrinate students into a faith the individual tax payer may disagree with vehemently.
Thing 2. The reason private schools "seem" better than public schools is that they cherry-pick their student populations from the most affluent families. Those students almost exclusively come from 2-parent homes with virtually every advantage. Once you start taking students whose parents wouldn't normally have the means to send their kids to private school, you will find the test scores will start to equalize.
I'd say the high school you went to has skewed your view of what's realistically available for a lot of students and parents.
It's also way for middle class suburban parents to choose better or alternative schools that fit their child's needs who aren't rich or don't want to live in squalor to have their children be properly educated.
I think what people miss is that parents are going to send their kids where they think they will be safe and get a good education and restricting their choices to underperforming public schools or expensive private ones is unfair and counterproductive.
Not only that they're more than often managing students more than teaching, and on top of that even with higher pay teachers avoid those schools like the plague and the quality of education becomes worse and worse.
It sounds like you’re making a blanket statement that public schools can’t offer a quality education because they’re too busy catering to the poorest performers. So you aren’t saying that private schools are inherently superior, but you are concretely insisting that public schools are worse. Lol. And you’re just generalizing it about the entire nation, never mind that every institution is comprised of individual teachers with their own pedagogies.
