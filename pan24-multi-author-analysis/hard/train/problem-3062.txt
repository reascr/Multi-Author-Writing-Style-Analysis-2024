Heres a fact check with some sources you can read. In a case where some tied Biden to saying the Travel bans xenophobic, it was actually confused, as he called Trump Xenophobic the same day the bans were announced. If you can find anyone significant calling the covid travel bans themselves racist however, Id be more than happy to look at them.
Do keep in mind though, that if the common consensus is that Liberals wanted everyone locked in at home, they would've supported travel bans.
I recall at the time that the WHO was strongly against implementing any travel ban and no recollection from any liberal parties stating they are against that.
You said liberals literally begged him? Where and how did this begging come about other than saying how trump has mismanaged it and is xenophobic?
Your source doesn’t prove a single thing other than trying to clarify a tweet he posted on Trumps ban. Maybe maybe it indicates that he was sort of open to it (feels like a far stretch). But in no way we’re they begging him.
