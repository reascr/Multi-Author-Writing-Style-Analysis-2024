And while you need one (or usually: more than one) soldier to get the injured out of the battlefield, which might take minutes or maybe hours, the wounded soldier afterwards needs treatment by professional medics, still needs to be fed, to be housed, etc., Despite being of no use to the military any more.
Ekaterina Shulman recently quoted something like 17k cases of the Russian government paying widows the promised money for their husbands killed in the conflict, and that's naturally only the cases which were so obvious even the government couldn't deny payment, plus this number most likely doesn't include the losses from dnr, lnr, pmc Wagner etc.
And seeing how very bad Russian medical support is, far worse ratios than 1:4 or 1:3 dead:wounded can be expected.
Why do you bring up the 1.1m total military number? This includes strategic missile forces, border patrol, navy, etc - lots of people who don't matter in this war.
It's not a military it's a defense force..... We are a peaceful state that doesn't have a military. Ignore all the dead children.
This is one thing I hate about the post WWII world. Bullshit names for shit thats obviously the same thing.
Just fucking idiots lol. Like, it's all just stupid frat clowns bro jokes. Yet they think they're smart and funny. That's the really astonishing part about all of this.
