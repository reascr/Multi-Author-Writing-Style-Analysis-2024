There’s a case almost identical to that in the article. A woman went to her friends home and found her dead - bludgeoned to death and stuffed in a closet. The friend left the house immediately and called 911.
But her use of the phrase “I need help” during the 911 call was taken as a presumption of guilt, and she sat in jail for three months before someone else finally confessed to the crime.
My takeaway from this article is to definitively never call 911 if someone needs help because I might be too polite and end up charged and convicted of a crime I didn’t commit.
I don't know he was "rightfully convicted", but I'm not writing an article saying he was rightfully convicted (like the article above). I never even stated he was rightfully convicted. He might have been, neither of these things are possible to know. It is completely possible that he was rightfully convicted, and then let go due to this ridiculous bullshit being used here, and they let a criminal go, also just as possible that this journalist is correct, and he was innocent the entire time.
"She had once tried using Harpster’s methods against Russ Faria, a man wrongfully convicted of killing his wife." How do they know this man was wrongfully convicted? Just because he was re-tried and was found not guilty?? That says absolutely nothing about his true innocence or guilt. Being found guilty or not guilty in a court has more to do with convincing a jury than it does about actually being guilty or legitimately innocent of something.
They call him wrongfully convicted because he was convicted wrongly, not because they know for sure he’s innocent. You claim that wrongfully convicted = innocent in “common parlance,” but that interpretation seems specific to your parlance.
