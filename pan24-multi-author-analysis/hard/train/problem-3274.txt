"I'm gonna move away from the largest cultural and economic centers in the US/World because they expect me to to survive with 280 million dollars instead of 300 million dollars!".
But this is neither of those things. The proposed bill is to tax unrealized gains. Hell, even to tax assets weather they have gains or not.
Not to mention that a wealth tax is dumb as hell. Tax income. Not enough? Tax it some more. Newer, higher brackets. I like the Eisenhower rates, so long as it's adjusted for 70 years of inflation.
IMO the long term cap gains rate is too low. It should have higher brackets just like earned income.
And that can be fixed by raising the capital gains tax maximum rate with new higher brackets that are matched to earned income brackets.
Iâ€™d much rather see us go after the tax basis step-up at death and low cap gains rates and carried interest. I also think a lot of the exemptions on real estate are too much - fine for exemptions around primary residence, but the 1031 exchange and stuff makes real estate investing too lucrative and must be contributing to our current pricing issues in the space (though real estate investors will hate me for that / sorry).
