You mean the Germany that tried to kill every single Jew? Or the Europe that was complicit in that or actively helped? How about the rampant antisemitism in Europe and elsewhere.
Palestinians aren't being exterminated! And glad you think it's sufficient foR Jews to just "get by" in the US. Why can't people be ok with Jews having an actual country where they are safe. Rather than be a minority where their safety is at the discretion of others. Things can quickly change. Jews were briefly safe in Germany until it wasnt.
Judaism doesn't proselytize. It actively tries to dissuade people to convert. A major belief in judaism is free will and also the belief that one doesn't have to be jewish in order to reach "heaven", they just need to be a good person. Therefore, there is no need to "save" others by trying to make them Catholic or Muslim. This is not the same for those religions though, which can explain some of their various conquests.
But ok, we can use your source. Largest percentage still is directed at Jews. Despite being about 2% of the population. Still supports my argument that Jews aren't safe in the US.
I mean, in Israel the Jews don’t appear to be safe lol. But actively exterminating another people and making them unsafe isn’t right either.
