And if a protest doesn't turn violent on its own adding a few agent provocateurs to delegitimize the movement and justify use of force always does the trick.
Just because you disagree with the protestors doesn't mean you can or should discredit them for other actions and justify punishments like this. Standards must be applied across the board. I don't think any of those people would be too happy if Iranian police were punished for not doing their job and arresting women without hijabs in mass but that's the standard we're preaching so...
Love the "muh they protests were bad and did all these bad things" because I disagree with them but "we support Iranian protests even though they're breaking Iranian laws" because I agree with them or "we support the Indian trucker and farmer protests because they were breaking laws for what was right!".
That’s not the point. A bunch of the truckers got arrested too. The point is, do you think someone should have had their wages garnished because they donated money to a Black Lives Matter go fund me despite not physically participating in any of the violent protests?
“If this country doesn’t give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it. All right? And I could be speaking figuratively. I could be speaking literally. It’s a matter of interpretation,” - Hawk Newsome before buildings were burned.
So you do indeed believe that everyone that donated to the New York Black Lives Matter chapter should have their paychecks taken from them?
