It shows that Obamas treaty was actually pretty good. It was ended a couple years ago and Iran still isn't really close to a bomb. They had to give away a lot of materials.
I think it was a pretty successful negotiation for the US considering the Americans main leverage was threatening to start a 3rd war in the region after the US had already lost its 2 previous major wars in the region.
It was a negotiation and both sides had to make concessions, but Iran wasn't going to be allowed to biuld a bomb under the agreement in any future year.
If Trump didn't leave the agreement then Iran wouldn't be biulding a bomb right now, and they wouldn't have a bomb in 2025.
Iran still wasn't going to get the bomb after 10 years like the other redditor said. Yes, some of the restrictions had time limits, but not the most important restrictions that would actually allow Iran to build a bomb.
Yes, and according to Netanyahu back in the 1990s, Iran was 2 to 3 years away from developing a nuclear weapon. So can we assume that like Iran's phantom nukes, an Israeli attack will never eventuate?
You think we would stay out of it if Israel starts dropping bombs? Theyâ€™d be flying American jets dropping American bombs where American intelligence told them to drop them.
The bombs would be American, but you'd be surprised how many components of the F-16I, F-15I and F-35I are made in Israel. You'd be further surprised to learn that the IAF doesn't require American intelligence for almost all of its operations even beyond Israeli border conflicts (as evidenced by the so many strikes far away from home turf in the 20th century which were conducted thanks to Israeli intelligence alone).
