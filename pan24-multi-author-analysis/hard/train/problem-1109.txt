Switching parties doesnâ€™t really do much other than change the letter after her name on ballots. She could have stayed a Democrat and caucused with the Republicans, been removed from all her committee positions, or been cut from DNC donor lists and fundraising. McConnell could switch parties and become a Republican and not change any of his positions or views.
I believe that she negotiated with the GOP to switch as an independent that caucuses with the Republicans.
Their efforts would have been to win in Georgia though. Everything hinged on that. It was an insanely clever way to gain Senate control from the Democrats and make it a 49-51.
Warnock won and its no secret in Washinon that she was planning on switching to Independent. So, in efforts to keep her committee assignments, she had to keep her promise to be independent, but not caucas with the GOP.
I think she caususes with the Dems, but you know McConnell would give her whatever she wants in terms of committees to switch sides. Keeping a power sharing agreement in play would be huge for Republican obstruction.
