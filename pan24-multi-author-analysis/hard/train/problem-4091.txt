Yeah, but the military, such as it is, is pretty busy. Horseback invasion maybe could take significant territory. And then Putin can be King of the Riverlands, or whatever.
Putin is a dork. I don’t understand why he doesn’t chill out and just focus on creating a lot of infrastructure on the Eastern part of his already giant country. If he wants to take Ukraine does he really think he’s capable of defending all of his stretched thin territory?
Half the reason they invaded Ukraine when they did was because it no longer had a pro-Russian leader, and looked all set to push flat-out for NATO accession, after which they wouldn't be able to so much as spit on Ukrainian soil without risking WW3. It was a terrible strategic decision, but from their perspective, the alternative of an EU-aligned, NATO-joining Ukraine was even worse.
Chechnya, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, etc... the Baltics would be the hardest, because they actually joined NATO.
It's been obvious for decades that this was Putin's take on the matter, and he viewed it as only a matter of time before all those countries were fully returned to/puppeted within Russia's sphere of influence.
"Everything that used to be part of the Russian empire and then part of the Soviet Union is the territory of Russia's strategic interests," the academic added.
Referring to the ex-Soviet states, Sardaryan told his fellow guests on Russian state TV: "This is our land, our territory of strategic interests.".
