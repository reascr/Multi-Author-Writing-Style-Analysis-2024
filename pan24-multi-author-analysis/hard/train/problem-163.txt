At this point I don't give two shits what the Russian people want. I only care about what guarantees the safety of eastern europe and the world. If that means regime change, fine, if that means dismantling the Russian state and removing their nukes, that's cool too.
But if people in Russia mostly want to end up like North Korea, cut off from the world and laughed at, ok. Whatever.
We, in the west and on reddit, like to assume that the war is hugely unpopular in Russia because it makes us feel better to believe that. It's, unfortunately, just not true.
More to the point, the idea that the "nuke issue" can be "solved" by the CIA or Mossad is absurd and shows an utter misunderstanding of what the "nuke issue" is, as well as a highschool level understanding of the intelligence services. Beyond that if it were anywhere close to being within their ability to do so, it would have happened decades ago.
Keep in mind who has been bearing the brunt of the hardship, ethnic minority regions. Go to Moscow, or St Petersburg, and you really don't find many people who are strongly against the war.
I guess part of the problem is that the war is not, within Russia, unpopular. Even among Russians who will outright admit that starting it is wrong, something like 75% think they should keep fighting until they win.
