It’s slowly being codified as a law to ensure that generations to come will be brainwashed with this “scientific theory” of intelligent design/ creationism. It’s insane.
Honestly you can just guess… it’s all the dumb Bible Belt ones. This was 2014 before the theocracy really started to take over our country overtly.
I’m agreeing and also saying the government shouldn’t be stealing your money (in taxes) to pay teachers to brainwash your kids with Christian propaganda and tell them that Darwin was wrong.
That's not to say teaching creationism is OK, it's still a massive waste of time and resources, but it's not really going to do much harm to the vast majority of the kids who graduate from those schools.
As a pastor, I think teaching creationism in public schools is a terrible idea. I grew up in a conservative state and my science teachers always said stuff like "everyone is entitled to your relgious beliefs, but we are requiring you to learn the current scientific thoughy, just like we do in every other field. None of you have believe this, but you all have to know and understand it." I think thats a very reasonable approach.
