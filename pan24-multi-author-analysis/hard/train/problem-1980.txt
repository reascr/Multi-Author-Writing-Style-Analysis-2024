Yes. However, since everything he says is false, his claim that they'll have victory over Ukraine means they won't and Ukraine will prevail as the victor.
I believe that Russia (at this time) doesn't want to conquer all of Ukraine. They just want to fully capture and keep the areas that they illegally annexed. And Putin is content with losing a lot of men to accomplish this. If they can do that, Putin will call it a complete success. ( Of course he would probably come for the rest in a few more years) If Russia can simply hold out and make modest gains like they seem to be doing right now, then eventually Ukraine may be forced to surrender those areas just to stop the loss of life, both civilian and military that they are suffering right now.
It's a matter of who blinks first... Ukraine's manpower or Russias economy/will of the people to keep following Putin. Let's hope Putin blinks first.
There are reports of some dissention in Russia. whether it is true and how widespread it are the big questions right now. If it is true, however, I think Ukraine's main hope lies in being able to hold out long enough to let those seeds sprout and hope for an upheaval from within Russia itself. In doing so though... They will likely lose many more soldiers, no matter how good the equipment is that they are given.
He MAY have a point. Don't get me wrong... I am rooting for Ukraine. However. The fact of the matter is, Russia has a lot more potential soldiers than Ukraine and although the weapons they are using have proven outdated, they still have a lot of them. Even with a lot of men leaving the country, Russia has a lot of young men still to call on.
