If youve 'fled' from China and left relatives behind, all the government has to do is take away your family members' hukous, and life becomes immeasurably difficult. No 'official' status, so can't get a job, can't travel (let alone leave the country), can't go to school, etc. To a very real extent, you cease to exist in normally functioning society.
None of this is 'visible' to any of us... it almost all happens behind the scenes, especially given how insular Canadian Chinatowns in particular are.
Lots of nasty stuff they can pull, depending on what kind of a priority you are. That part is the same as any other major world power, to be frank. With China, the biggest thing is that YOU aren't really the focus... its more about setting the example for everyone else in the motherland that no-one can avoid the law by escaping.
Doing nothing is only a signal towards China that this is just fine and they can keep harassing Chinese and local nationals without consequences.
This was also the Chinese answer to Canada as to why the Chinese were detaining and questioning Chinese people in Canada.
Howâ€™s that case of espionage they were going to try with the Chinese person they found within the Canada ?utilities? (not certain company type) or was it a uni coming along?
