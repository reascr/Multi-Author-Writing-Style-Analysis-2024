Yes, but the last war they fought against each other was the opposite. The Soviet invasion of Manchuria was insanely one-sided, and as much as I hate Soviet autocracy, I admit their contribution to the Japanese unconditional surrender is severely understated. However, flash forward to today, and Russia would be astonishingly ill-equipped to fight Japan.
Russia is failing because they have built a military that is far better at looking good than actually being good.
To be fair, the USSR wasnt Russia and it had a lot more capabilities then Russia did. But by the 80s even the USSRs military was starting to suffer, but not nearly to this extent.
I think they were definitely a threat up until the late 70's/early 80's, that's the USSR but I mean... Russia appears to just be the USSR that lost ground. They seemed to stay pretty damn close if you compared equipment for quite awhile but at some point in the 80's the west left them in the dust and kept going. From there on Russia just needed the world to believe they still knew what they were doing. Which works until someone puts up a non-guerilla fight.
