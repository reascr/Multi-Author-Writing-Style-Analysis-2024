I’ve never seen this usage before in my nearly 50 years. Personally it looks weird and I’m with your parent poster. Yes I can figure it out. That doesn’t make it “everyone knows”.
I haven’t seen a number from Ukraine. Do you have an official source of one? And we were talking about the count of Ukrainian casualties here, not Russian, so maybe you were mixed up with that?
Allegedly, both sides will use propaganda, we probably won't know true death counts for Ukraine and Russia until long after the war. Fair to say Russia ironically getting their shit pushed in though.
Russia's figures are off by a factor of ten from everyone else. Everyone else is Ukraine's numbers +/-10%.
Yeah but then he goes on to say that every western intelligence service has their own estimate within 10% of the Ukrainean one. Does he think those services use satellites to count the dead or use Ukrainean front line reports and other indirect sources. Point is that we have no other direct source. Might as well use the Ukrainean numbers as a ballpark. And they wouldn't give accurate numbers on their own losses anyway so, the uncertainty is high there.
