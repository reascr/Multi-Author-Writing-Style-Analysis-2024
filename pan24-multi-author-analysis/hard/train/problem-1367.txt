We’ll need a major cultural shift for people that watch Fox News/republicans to get behind UBI because they’ll for sure label it welfare.
I believe UBI is a good thing and we’ll definitely need it as automation takes over, but I think it would just confuse things to talk about UBI as the same as social security and Medicare, mostly because it doesn’t exist yet and if it did republicans would already be trying to get rid of it lol.
Republicans use “entitlements” as a code word so they can talk about cutting social security but claim they were talking about cutting some other program. I guess people need to get them on the record describing which entitlement programs they want to cut and refuse to use that word when possible and make them be specific.
It’s a loaded word though and we probably need a better word or phrase. I think just calling them social security retirement and healthcare benefits would probably be easiest.
It isn’t UBI though because we payed into the program specifically for retirement or if we got disabled. I’m not sure how Medicare is funded but for ssi people paid into it expecting to be able to retire and had money taken from their paycheck for it.
Well Social Security is projected to run out of enough money to pay full benefits by 2035. So something has to be done. Raise retirement age? raise the maximum income level for Social Security deductions..but not the maximum benefit amount?.
If you read the Republican platform this is basically what they're looking at. They don't want to cut Social Security.
They don’t want to cut it, they want to privatize it. Then their people get a vast sum of money with very little to no oversight. Then, when it goes under, the people running it will shut it down and they’ll point to democratic efforts as to why it failed in the first place.
