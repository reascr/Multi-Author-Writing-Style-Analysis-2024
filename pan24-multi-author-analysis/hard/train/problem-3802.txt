Are you aware that healthcare, infrastructure and economy comes from taxing? Do you think those immigrant workers work without being taxed or what? And everything they consume are also taxed. Their tuition? Taxed. The butter they bought from stores? Taxed, Mama's tampons? Taxed. Wages are being suppressed not by accepting educated people, which Canada does, it's done by accepting people who work illegally.
of foreign workers as it’s hurting the economic opportunities of people already in Canada: FN, immigrants, descendants of imperialists alike. If we had the infrastructure, economy, and healthcare systems to support that many people, I would have nothing to say, but that’s not the case.
Just frustrating to me that the governments solution to a “labour crisis” is importing cheap labour rather than actually addressing root causes.
Regular immigration isn’t my issue, it’s the governments policy of bringing in tons on Temporary Foreign Workers to work low paying jobs. The standards for TFWs are much much lower than the standards for proper immigration. I probably should’ve focused on that a bit more in my posts, but I thought the first 2 conveyed that well enough. Importing cheap labour en masse absolutely does suppress wages.
