Not in Canada. Lottery winnings are not taxed. But if If my powerball ticket I bought across the border had hit for 2.1 billion I would have paid a bunch of tax to the IRS.
Many counties tax lottery winnings. The fact that this guy is from Gaza and not Israel is as irrelevant as if he was from Spain and won the lottery in Israel.
A Gazan won an Israeli lottery Surely this is a testament of how progressive and liberal Israel is How fortunate are the Gazans that Israel let's some of them in to work slavery jobs with slavery wages.
Gazaâ€™s Palestinians are oppressed by Hamas, and thousands of them go to Israel for work, with the Israeli approval, even if it costs a little in security for Israel.
And they chose Hamas to be their autonomy, so Israel kinda controls what goes in, because otherwise Israel would have to deal with much more advanced missiles.
I'm sure Israel would be more progressive if Palestinians did not elect terrorist groups like Hamas who want to take all aid money to launch rockets at innocent Israelis.
Not to mention the mass amount of destruction, horror and murder Israel does pretty much yearly in Gaza with impunity.
Regarding Gaza, you seriously are trying to absolve Israel of all blame? How was Gaza before Hamas rose to power?
And Gaza is controlled by Hamas a terror group... Not controlling what goes in and out makes Hamas a huge threat for security.
Israel made Gaza a prison, controlling EVERYTHING that goes in and out. Gazans can't leave Gaza without Israeli permission. That means if a Gazan wants to travel abroad, well too fucking bad he can't.
