Yeah, I've noticed this as well. It's a bit frustrating how I'm not sure if there's any brand I can trust, which is why I decided to pick by optical quality and price first, then configure the firewall to drop out packets and put them on their own VLAN.
Ubiquiti is definitely one of my top alternatives, I'm just concerned because it seems like a lot of buy-in. I think if I want the "full" experience I'd need to run the whole stack (say, the entire unifi stack, which I would probably need rack mounting space for).
Notably, as shown in both the article and list, brands like Hikvision are only advised against for "public safety" and "critical infrastructure", which makes me think it's less "there's a backdoor" and more like someone could take advantage of inner knowledge of the devices and cause other problems, or something. Good to know.
You make no sense. Is China America? So why should they have any surveillance in a foreign country? And the Chinese are strict about foreign companies in their country. At this point only a negligent country would not take precautions.
