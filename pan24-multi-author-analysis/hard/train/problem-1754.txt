Ever played Empire: Total War? Playing a campaign as Sweden has similar AI events, but perhaps a closer comparison to modern Russia.
Reject shitty offer. Steadily kick their asses while fighting off simultaneous unprovoked wars with Denmark, Courland, and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (it's must have been hard to be Swedish in the 18th century, everyone hates you). Russia eventually offers a peace treaty out of desperation, even giving up their demands for Ingria... for now.
Well if Russias demands are met, what makes you think they wouldnâ€™t send soldiers over to denazify other countries and then again ask them to end the suffering by meeting their demands?
Yeah, Russia could promise they wouldn't invade a now weaker Ukraine again (which, as part of any deal, wouldn't be allowed to join NATO) and take those regions, but given that they made a similar promise less than 30 years ago that they've already broken, why would anyone believe them?
I wonder if they understand what's going to happen if they get completely pushed out of Ukrainian and everyone works out their is no longer an army to protect Russia...
