The Gulf states aren’t interested in sharing their wealth or inviting Hamas into their backyard. Historically keeping Palestinians in a bad situation and blaming it entirely on Israel and the US has also been far more politically expedient for the neighboring Arab states.
Listen, I think Palestinians matter just as much as Israelis, but the fundamental problem is that Palestinians push the blame, and people like you push the blame on Israel, when in reality it's organizations like Hamas who cause terror and refuse to accept peace deals. Once the Palestinians finally accept that they're at fault, they should destroy or stop supporting Hamas and finally be able to live in peace.
That’s because we’re still trying to recover from the war that the Palestinians caused in our country.
The land is Palestinian.. you can try and force them to move to Jordan, you can try to move their capitol there, but you can't make people forget their history. The Israeli rhetoric online is just getting started, it's important for people to stand up for Palestine, no matter how many toadi bots downvote it.
The Arab states used to want to keep the Palestinian-Israeli conflict hot, but now they just don’t want to deal with a bunch of Iranian-brainwashed extremists. They use the Palestinians as labor and accept a relatively small number when they manage to sneak across borders, but that’s it.
Something tells me that Jordan has no interest in sharing their land with a Palestinian state, the last time they sort of tried they had to expel most of them.
More Palestinians live in Jordan than Palestine, because of decades of illegal occupations and settlements pushing them out of their own country. Now the Nationalist govt of Israel wants to move Palestine's capital out of Palestine... To Jordan... It's makes as much sense of Israel having their capitol in DC.
