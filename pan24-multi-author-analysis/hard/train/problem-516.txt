If they stop having AP courses, FL students will likely not make it into any competitive colleges/universities. He can look into any alternative he wants, likely won't have much clout with college admissions offices.
I'm hoping there is a voter backlash to all this, though it might take a few years to see it, with all the boomers moving in with their more conservative politics.
Is it just me or are all these old conservative voters gonna be dead in the next 20 years? I feel like they can’t be replaced fast enough to be equal to their hold now. And that’s a good thing if true.
True. But the democratic people aren’t the ones who moved lol. Trust me I’m with you when you say the democratic turnout wasn’t the best…but the last number shuffled around was about 300,000 new republicans signed up in the state…mixed in with good ol’ fashioned gerrymandering…it’s a lot less blue.
You’re right and wrong my man…you are right when you say people can’t rent or by here…people that actually stay in Florida can’t rent or buy due to wages being so shitty. But a person who’s making 2x’ what we make down here and got approved to work from home when Covid came settled here and are now living comfortably…those people tended to vote for Desantis. Covid also being down a lot of Republicans due to him keeping everything open. I’ve head too many times someone selling there house up north and getting a house double the size cash with money to spare…meanwhile a person who was born and raised in the state is struggling to pay rent with a decent job.
