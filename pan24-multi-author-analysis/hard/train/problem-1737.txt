Seems like you just have absolutely crystal clear messaging on what is and is not a target Ukraine/NATO will go after of Russia's. 1) Any unit on Ukrainian soil and 2) Any point of military attack onto Ukrainian soil.
Theres no reason why Russia should be bombing the western half of Ukraine taking out civillians and powerplants. The close proximity to Poland and the fact we've seen missiles strike this soil should've encouraged us to set this up.
They're probably going to need it more than ever if we have tanks being delivered too and attacked during the handover.
Also the main battle tanks? 12 from the UK and no other country wants to send any? We've let these guys down big time.
Its a warcrime this purely defensive equipment hasnt made its way into Ukraine yet, this system could save so many lives and everyones dragging their feet.
Hell myself I'm a supporter of setting up a safezone within Ukraine, manned by NATO which wouldnt require training Ukrainians.
Ehm with the Iris-T system and the Gepards, Germany is already one if not the top country that seriously support the security of Ukrainian airspace. A Patriot system will be coming soon too, along with one from the USA.
