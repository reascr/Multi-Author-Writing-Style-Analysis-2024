My girlfriend actually had to sign a paper stating that she was not in Scientology when joining her current job in Germany. Was pretty funny because she didn't even know what Scientology was, it's not that big of a topic here.
God, I didn't know, I never looked into her background or saw the show but hearing the basics made me think of some of the things I'd heard Scientology from the start.
In reality, Scientology will slowly brainwash its adherents - and here's the scary part - then teach them to do it to themselves. It's scary shit. It's done so very slowly while giving the member a HUGE sense of belonging which is hard to push away when you're vulnerable. That's what really happens.
Because it's not presented as such. You don't go to your first OT class and read a story about space aliens. Their whole concept is about cleansing yourself from negative energy, thereby allowing to do anything you put your mind to. When you put it that way, doesn't it sound a LOT like 99% of self-help stuff? That kind of description even overlaps with things like meditation and the likes.
