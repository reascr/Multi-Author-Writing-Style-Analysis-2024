Biden's continuation of Trump era policies regarding asylum seekers should be condemned. The fact that he was looking to Gitmo for displaced Haiti asylum seekers shouldn't be taken lightly. The fact that ICE falls under his direct purview yet continue to use the concentration camps is unforgivable.
It's vile regardless and shouldn't be defended by bringing up Obama or Bush. Biden's own implementation of Title 42 is insanely restrictive that almost no asylum seeker will be able to fall under it. The whole system needs an overhaul, but we need to stop cutting them slack when Biden has almost full control of ICE and isn't doing much of anything to slow their abuse down.
Lol asylum seeking isn't breaking the law, and you ignored the part where the administration is demanding things of Asylum Seekers that they aren't able to uphold most of the time.
There are also those who don't give themselves up at the border to claim asylum and actually enter the country illegally. Those are the ones who get expelled.
