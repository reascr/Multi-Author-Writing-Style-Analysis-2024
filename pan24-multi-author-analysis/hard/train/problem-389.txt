Every time Chinese officials are asked about Ukraine they inevitably bring up certain set talking points. 1) Western aggression/"expansionism" is the root of the conflict, 2) China values "territorial integrity" above all else, and 3) Taiwan is totally different.
I don't understand China's strategy here, they're buddying up with a country that could have no functioning military, no functioning economy, and a fuck ton of nukes - antagonizing western powers in the process.
China can either have Russia as a friendly/economically dependent neighbor that they can get cheap natural resources from and continue to be a thorn in the West's side (which Russia will be even with a diminished military), or they can have Russia as an unfriendly and destabilized neighbor with nukes.
If China is trying to present itself as an honest mediator in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, they have already exposed themselves as siding with their autocratic partner, Russia. Taken along with indications that China is getting ready to supply arms to Russia, anything that China says about the Russian invasion is merely their lame attempt to establish a narrative that they think would legitimize their condemnation of a proactive US response in Chinaâ€™s upcoming invasion of Taiwan.
