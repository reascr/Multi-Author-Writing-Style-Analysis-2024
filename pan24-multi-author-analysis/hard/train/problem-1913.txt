I think you are wrong about Garland. He's careful, but I don't believe he appointed a special prosecutor just to undercut him later. If Smith recommends charges and Garland refuses, that will be made public.
I think there will be charges in the stolen documents case and soon. And it's looking more and more like there will be a financial crime charges related to Jan 6. Whether they can pin the seditious conspiracy on Trump himself is a big question mark.
Holy fack, enough of these posts “ we think maybe possibly for sure in the future maybe we will charge trump “.
The guy literally called for the constitution to be removed and tried to overthrow the us government,,,,, but sure MAYBE works for me I guess ?
And even if he’s an ignorant dummy (that’s honestly how people defend it “it wasn’t a serious coup! It was just shits and giggles” etc.), even if we give that benefit of the doubt - the best case scenario is it was still gross negligence. If you’re operating a crane and do something incredibly negligent that kills a bunch of people then you get in serious trouble. Even if Trump destroyed democracy by accident it’s still worthy of treason because if you’re president you should respect the influence you have on people. It’s on you as president to be well informed of the facts that matter most and not promote dangerous lies.
