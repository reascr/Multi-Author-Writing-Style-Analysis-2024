Not showing up to a congressional subpoena isn't fascism. If you play by rules your opponent doesn't, you will lose. Especially when reason, hypocrisy and logic aren't things they care about.
The logic isn’t that I think the rules don’t matter. But allowing the Dems to sit for deposition after deposition as they get subpoena after subpoena makes it seem, to the casual observer of politics that there is, at the bare minimum the same stink on both parties and at worst that the Dems are MORE corrupt than the Republicans.
How about this.... the Democrats should say they won't honour any subpoenas until the Republicans pass legislation, that gets passed in the Senate without filibuster, that makes these congressional subpoenas enforceable with serious consequences for ignoring them. Then the Democrats will obey the subpoenas, and there will be teeth there next time the Democrats hold the House. Of course, the Republicans will never agree to do this...
The GOP is going to do anything and everything anyways. I really can’t see the reason to continue this “High Road” while we know it’s not going to do anything but more virtue signaling, all while the country continues to shit on anyone that isn’t in the 1%.
