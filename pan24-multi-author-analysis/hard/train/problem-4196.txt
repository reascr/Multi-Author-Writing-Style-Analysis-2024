His ideas are about the level of a 5 year old’s. Which isn’t surprising because he’s basically a 5 year old. But to think a grown man who was literally POTUS imagines a magic dome around the country (?????) would be the best way to stop nuclear weapons is just too much. What a fucking idiot.
Trump is just the epitome of what an idiot is. If he truly thinks that he wants to put an actual dome over the US, someone needs to tell him that that is just IMPOSSIBLE!
This is why there absolutely NEEDS to be an age cap on to who can be President. There's a minimum age. There needs to be a maximum age. Cap it at maybe 70. People don't want a senior citizen running the country. Same goes for Congress. Get the old people out (both Repubs and Dems). This is 2023, things are different now then they were in the 1940s or so. Need more modern and fresh ideas, and more people willing to accept change (gay and interracial marriages, the lgbtq+ community etc), people who want and believe that climate change and global warming are real, that everyone in the US NEEDS socialized medicine like a majority of the planet. Raise the minimum wage across the country that needs it to $15/hour.
Wondering if someone told him about the show "Under the Dome" and he thought "I love it, it's a big beautiful dome. It's so UUGE! We should make that.".
Yes. Sadly, it's worse with the added context that he said this WHILE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. Imagine hearing this and thinking, "Yeah, that's the guy I want to elect!".
