Containing by half measures is indeed not possible but half measures do help lowering peak demand on hospitals.
Just have people work from home and close non essential places like schools and some factories would have slowed down the spread considerably.
Another way would be to geographically stagger the opening. Impossible to do in a democratic country but I could see it happen in China where they open provinces one by one, focusing doctors and equipment of the entire country to soften the blow, then when the peak has passed, move it all to the next province. It would have taken a full year probably so quite an undertaking.
White lung is nothing mysterious. It's can be caused by many pathogens like pneumococcus and plain old influenza.
Covid is already endemic, just like the flu. There's absolutely no point trying to isolate a population from it unless you want them to build no defenses against it whatsoever, in which case you risk ending up in the same position America was when Columbus arrived.
