Here's one video of her on camera saying she just left the White House where a planning for January 6 objection just happened and that "the election won't be stolen by Joe Biden and Democrats and Trump won by a landslide".
As a public figure and a congresswoman she incited the insurrection at the Capitol. She is responsible for the damage and the deaths that day. She should be in jail or at the very least be forced to resign.
We are currently experiencing the biggest underreaction by Americans to what happened on January 6. It was planned and incited by a former president, many members of congress along with white supremacist terrorist groups.
You'd have to prove that she actually helped plan the attack in concrete ways with the intention of sabotaging Congress.
He can't arrest her just because you don't like her. And something like seditious conspiracy has a very high bar that "saying the election was rigged" or whatever don't even come close to satisfying.
Doesnt have much impact when their base is too stupid to realize they’re getting fleeced and voting against their own interests. They’re going to eat this shit up and think she’s doing Gods work or something.
