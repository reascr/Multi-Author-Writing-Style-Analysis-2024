I doubt anyone would join them in a war on Iran other than the US and I'm even more doubtful that the US would have boots on the ground.
If the US joins the war they could do SEAD/DEAD if they had to and then they would have no problem flying mid altitude in Iran.
If Iran suddenly had the ability to nuke Israel or say, a US carrier in Persian Gulf, the world as we know it would likely end.
Also this, again, is all a hypothetical as Israel and Iran frequently threaten each other with war, strikes or destruction.
Israel does not threaten unprovoked destruction of /war with Iran. They have said they will strike Iran’s nuke sites if needed to keep Iran from following through on its basically daily threats to outright destroy Israel. Israel has no beef with Iran other than Iran’s constant threatening to destroy Israel and Iran’s support of groups that are engaged in terrorism against Israel in Lebanon, and within Israel itself. If those threats from Iran were to stop, Israel would just ignore Iran.
