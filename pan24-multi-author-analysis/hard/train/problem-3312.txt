While they would only technically be able to export to countries that are under similar pressures, this could really shake up pharmaceutical pricing.
I wonder if this is a ploy to start stealing pharma patents. If imports are prevented, or other issues arise that prevent access, Russia can use this to argue for the TRIPS compulsory license or some other exemption allowing them to manufacture patented medicines themselves without violation of WTO.

Yeah, like this probably isn't Putins direct fault, but is more likely a fault of management in Russia's internal pharmaceutical industry along with I'm sure the vast sanctions against Russia not helping the problem.
I see Putin still needs to shill reasons as to why the average Russian needs to pay more for sugar pills that his pharma oligarch friends are manufacturing domestically after stealing all the legitimate medicine for themselves.
