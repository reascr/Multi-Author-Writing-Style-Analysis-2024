And all the conspiracy theorists are going to be crowing about it like, "This one report with low confidence in its own results means everything we've ever said is true!".
Do you think it's unimportant that organizations that peddle lies and conspiracy theories every day, theories that cause a lot of harm by fomenting hate, are suddenly going to have more traction?
What other legitimate concerns do you make up conspiracy theories for? You probably still say Trump was working with the Russians. Or Hunter Biden’s laptop was fake.
It’s crazy that people care more about their perceived political adversaries being right about something than the cause of a global pandemic that killed millions.
This is 100% in the DOE’s wheelhouse they are saying based on their intel it probably came from a lab. They can’t 100% prove it because that would require CCP participation. Thus the confidence in any conclusion will be low because it’s essentially based on circumstancial evidence and the fact that the OG strain had a spike protein shape similar to other virus that are manipulated for gain of function research.
Correct it is unimportant. They have no impact on anything. The lab leak isn’t a conspiracy theory anyway. I’m sorry the truth made you lose points in your red team vs blue team political football match you base your entire personality on. I guess you should have been a little more open minded and used some critical thinking before labeling everything a “conspiracy theory”.
It was never conspiracy theorist who suggested it. I was always a VERY plausible theory put fourth by credible people from day 1. But many dogmatic leftists associated it with Trump, so it was immediately mischaracterized as a conspiracy theory.
