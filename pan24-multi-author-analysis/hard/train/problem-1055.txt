Even independent artists need to understand the difference between needs and wants before arguing for more money. Most of them are paying upwards of $2,000 per month just to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. These are the people who constantly complain about 'needing' more money when in reality they just need to learn how to spend less. But spending less isn't as sexy as getting more, so very few people actually consider it.
Not really. It's excruciatingly difficult to maintain the facade of intellectual property and gets harder as time goes on.
Reality is we need more NOW and it's hard to adjust the system to shorten the life-span of a copyright without hurting the whole process.
E-books seem to rip off the author by selling at much lower prices, but they can also eliminate the paper-pushers and their advertising dollars.
I recently purchased my first e-book from one of the big sellers after a long boycott. (My original e-books were locked after their DRM was orphaned.) That started my boycott.
