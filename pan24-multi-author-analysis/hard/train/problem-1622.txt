Good thing the have been building artificial islands around it for years packed full of ASM’s and SAM’s. They are unlikely to make the same mistakes the Russians did in Ukraine.
They have been anticipating our response. There is a reason it’s an admiral saying this. He knows Taiwan will be invaded and the Chinese have been building artificial islands around it for quite a while now to ensure that they have plenty of SAM’s and and anti ship missiles. They already have their defensive measures in place for when they seize Taiwan.
He means an invasion into Taiwan. That's been "the" conflict scenario being prepared for a long time in the USA's navy. He's been conditioned to treat this as very real and imminent, which probably will help if it ever does happen, but it probably won't. China got hella spooked by the comradery that Ukraine received both from other governments and private corporations/entities, in particular the ability for private firms to voluntarily withdraw their business slice and beyond government sanctions. It's a facet of "free trade capitalism" that they didn't have on their radar, and they don't know how to surmount of they ever did attempt an invasion of Taiwan.
No. This guy's job has been to think about an invasion into Taiwan for the last 50 years, and this is what insulated military minds look like. It probably won't happen, but if it did china could only "win" that engagement by nuking several support structures Taiwan relies on, primarily operated by the USA. He thinks that fascist states are rational, and will realize that can't win without nuking the USA preemptively, so they will do that.
Basically, the only way they can win that engagement and sustain it is with nuclear arms, and this guy is convinced it will happen, when it probably won't.
