We have state and national things. state flowers and animals and even the national bird. Yeah it's dumb and just pandering but it isn't like having a national "thing" is entirely alien.
Personally I would say that the national gun of America should either be the classic 1911 or the M1 garand. Because of their history. Something a bit more special than the Honda civic of rifles.
Yes, AR-15s are American. Other countries produce knock-offs, but the OG was made by Colt. That said, it's not an iconic American gun. It's claim to fame is that it looks like an iconic American gun, but an AR-15 is not a M16.
National gun is silly but if you want American gun you should go with something that looks like a cowboy in an old Western had in his holster.
If you really want to stick it to the libs, wouldn't it be smarter to make like a really dumb gun, like a squirt gun, as the national gun of America? That way when they secede from the union, they can have the AR-15 be their national gun and laugh at us libs for only having a squirt gun as national gun.
