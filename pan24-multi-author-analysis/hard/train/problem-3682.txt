I feel like, and hope, that the vast majority of those capable of believing this bullshit are the people that wouldn't want anything good for black people.
and I've done so much for The Blacks, people can't even Imagine, they say, "President Trump is Incredibly Good for African Americans," can you believe it? they never said that about Obama. he doesn't even know what he is, and not only that, he wouldn't even take the Presidential Test, don't forget, I took it many many times and Aced it perfectly every time, they said nobody ever gets a Score like that, nobody gets it in Order, nobody gets it Perfect, and I said well I'm just that good, and people know it. The Blacks know it, I'm up over 90 Percent with them, because they want Law and Order, and that's what I'm in favor of very strongly, we need to protect our people, and you'll all be protected, Seperately But Equally, which is something I came up with the other day, nobody had ever heard it before, they say, "it's incredible, you're like a Super Genius," but we all knew that already, and I'm not a Doctor but I'm like a person that has a good you know what.
