Remember when General Khalifa Haftar, with the support of Wagner group, Egypt, UAE and even France, tried to over throw the elected UN recognised government of Libya and started another civil war? Whatever happened there?
“Despite widespread reports of the fighters’ extremist links, the report says the U.S. military found no evidence to suggest the mercenaries were affiliated with the Islamic State extremist group or al-Qaida. It says they were “very likely” motivated by generous financial packages rather than ideology or politics.”.
Your source says they were “very likely” motivated by generous financial packages rather than ideology or politics.”.
It's clear that's Bashagha, hafter and dbeibeh (western libya government) all want to gain the power for the long term but if you looked to each sides you will find hafter and Bashagha decided to not use armed forces to decide who gain the power and do you know what is the only other option exactly democratic elections.
There is no democracy in libya thats a fact but under the current situation with militias controlling the capital I don't think having elected government that's could bring stability to libya won't be an easy task at all in the other hand the Sharing of power between between Bashagha and hafter is the best opportunity libya had to achieve that.
So I really don't know how militias is any good for democratic process they are literally the main obstacle to Libya stability and Peaceful transfer of power.
Anyway I was clear with you that this militias isn't anything better than Wagner they even could be more dangerous after the war end also i was clear about the fact that's there is no pro-democracy in libya.
Any way I don't want to enter I unless argument I was just try to explain that's what happened In libya isn't a war between good and evil that's is really Ridiculous.
