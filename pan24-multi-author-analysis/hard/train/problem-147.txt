You can fault conservatives for a whole lot, but the companies making lots of money with as little regulation as possible is a liberal idea. It's called neo-liberal for a reason.
I never said it's the liberal agenda in a sense that the Democrats are fighting to keep the current neo-liberal system in place. The Democrats aren't even fully liberal across the spectrum. I'm arguing from a philosophical perspective, not an American centric political one.
A view outside of the US centered perspective on what's liberalism, is the fact that in the EU Liberal parties are considered centre-right of the political spectrum and much more clear about their support and belief in the neo-liberal economic theory, as they don't incorporate elements of socialism within their party, as socialist parties in Europe are not considered evil.
Stems from the same core philosophy. All liberal parties have been on-board with it for decades. Liberals actually believe in the liberal side of it, conservatives only when it suits them.
and somehow phrase as if that's the liberals agenda when it's the conservative's. So their argument is a lie. There is a differ nce between something being a liberal idea and being the linerals idea.
Lineral just means without restriction. But for political grouping liberals are socialy liberal while libertarians are economically liberal.
