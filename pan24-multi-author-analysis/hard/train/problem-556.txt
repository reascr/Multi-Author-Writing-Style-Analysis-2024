The fact they aren't important States is the whole point. It gives every candidate a shot. If the first State was California, or New York, only billionaires could run. The whole point of the first four is low population States, in different parts of the US, spaced a week apart, to give time to narrow and scale campaigns. Although I am glad they ditched Iowa.
You answered your own question. The way the Primary season starts is with four low population States one week apart, with each State in a different part of the Country, and different demographics.
It goes Midwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast. They have NV and SC for diversity. They just need to rotate it. Although if Michigan is first, that should suffice, but rotating every election would still probably be better.
TLDR: Michigan will be taking Iowaâ€™s spot as the first Midwest state to hold a presidential primary. It is yet to be seen if it will be the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th primary overall, although it is ensured to be one of the first four.
