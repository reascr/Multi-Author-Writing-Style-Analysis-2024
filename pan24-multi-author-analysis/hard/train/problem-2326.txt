The other 25% are conditioned to think the only people working min wage jobs should be high school age students that can't work anywhere or are mad that increases the min wage would invalidate the small amount more than the min that they make.
Minimum wages are probably only relevant for a small segment (e.g., high school kids over the summer - employer knows that availability is for a limited time, so the cost of training will be spread over fewer weeks and wouldn't hire unless the worker works at low wages).
The federal minimum wage is too low until you look at the education and skill sets required for minimum wage jobs then things get skewed. There’s a general consensus that higher education and advanced skills equate to higher earnings. There’s also the plausibility that automation can be employed in certain situations where it becomes the cheaper alternative to hiring people. For example McDonald’s kiosks don’t call out sick and don’t require lunch breaks. Kiosks don’t unionize and can be repaired or replaced with minimum down time.
Actually demonstrably true. How much does a family doctor earn? Why do they earn as much as they do, is it because of their education and skill set?
Maybe in the future you’ll learn to put some thought into your post instead of just some off the cuff reactionary remark.
