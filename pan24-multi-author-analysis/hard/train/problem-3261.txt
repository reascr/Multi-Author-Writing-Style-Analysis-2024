But in this case, if the lawyers don't behave it'll probably backfire on them. If another search warrant gets issued and the DoJ finds more classified/government docs, the lawyers who swore under penalty of perjury that all materials had been returned will have to explain themselves.
So are they making it so that the lawyers can be charged if a warrant is issued and other things turn up after a DOJ search?
Well if the DOJ and FBI weren’t going to pursue warrants for all his properties before, they sure as hell ought to now.
This is the no better than the usual response from police of “we investigated ourselves and found no evidence of wrong doing.” I actually think the FBI was really smart to not take up the offer to observe the search. A few agents wouldn’t be able to observe everything that was going on and it would have led to more claims from Trump that they planted evidence.
We are going to hire a firm to search these properties, and then we are going to secretly give them an extra $50k to “not find anything.”.
