However, don't be fooled that h better health care and mental health care are going to stop mass shootings. Just don't.
Statistically, increasing firearms availability increases the number of firearms deaths, murders, mass shootings. We know this factually by the decrease in mass shootings during the 10 year assault weapons ban.
Yes. For all the sympathetic souls above who are saying, "gun control and health care" are the solutions, yes, both would be nice.
Gun control and red flag laws are nice and all, but I don't think it strikes at the true heart of the problem, and at best is just an easily digestible action the opposition can push. Take away the assault rifles and leave the constant hate pressure, you're just going to see more vehicular attacks, stabbings, bombings, etc.
Why would any single-shot kill or mass murder by gunshots be a surprise to anyone given the utterly unfettered and nationwide access to firearms and ammunition? The only surprise would be the one that happens in a prison or an airline cabin.
