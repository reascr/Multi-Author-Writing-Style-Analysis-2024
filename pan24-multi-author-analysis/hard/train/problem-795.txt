Estonia, which is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), is considering the possibility of effectively blocking the passage of Russian ships through the Baltic Sea. Estonia's introduction of a so-called contiguous zone, which can be up to 12 nautical miles from the 12-mile territorial sea, allows the country to conduct searches in the Gulf of Finland on military ships and civilian vessels to monitor compliance with Estonian law.
Currently, the Gulf of Finland within this zone is designed to leave a three-mile wide "corridor" for free navigation. And formally, Estonia will simply close this "corridor" by declaring it an adjacent zone. In fact, this simply means a sea blockade of one of the most powerful ports of the Russian Federation, Saint Petersburg, and all others in the Leningrad Oblast, as well as a blockade of the Baltic Fleet of the Russian Federation.
The only way to enforce a naval blockade is by sinking ships, which is a really bad idea - same reason why NATO could never establish a no-fly zone over ukraine.
If Russia assists their cargo ships with military ships then it's up to a NATO country to force the blockade. I don't think that will happens. USA has shown zero interest in direct escalation.
