Well, they blew up the old pipeline (ya know, the one repaid an hundredfold by UE billions over the years) but the NS2 is still untouched (ya know, the one that's actually not repaid by UE billions) since Putin offered to sell gas through it to Germany.
The Russian reasoning - my guess - would be to undercut any possible power brokers seeking to displace Putin and offer the resumption of natural gas supply to Europe.
\- Sabotaged by U.S., to prevent Europe from purchasing from Russia through the pipelines again, thereby minimizing potential Russian influence over EU and/or to increase dependence on US supplies of gas (and oil) (or other sources where US might have a hand in play).
Russia wouldn't do it because they're the main suppliers of the oil and their economy would be hurt even more, unless what another user said where Putin sabotaged the pipeline to keep the oiligarchs in line, which I think is plausible.
Considering that Ukraine has been getting fucked by Russia in some shape or form, even back when planning for such a sabotage would have started, I'd say it would benefit Ukraine by any scale, but whether the pipeline destruction would hurt Russia depends on what lens you look at it with. Personally I don't think Ukraine are responsible, it'd put them below my top 5 candidates, but it's not 0% chance.
