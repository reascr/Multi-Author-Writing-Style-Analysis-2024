Sony is the one acting in bad faith here, and they have already made more gamers "lose out" than this Microsoft/Activision deal ever could.
Well I remember when Shenmue 3, Soulcalibur 3, and Dead or Alive Extreme 3 all were NOT released on any Xbox platform. Those were deals made by Sony to keep games from Xbox players. Is that the kind of thing you are looking for? And don't forget how Sony blocked cross-play on a multitude of games like Minecraft, rocket league, etc. before they finally relented.
To me, Sony has been working for decades to keep games (and gamers) from other consoles. The fact that they are now mad that Microsoft is buying up game developers to counteract this long standing model of Sony exclusivity is almost laughable, and I hope it doesn't ruin Microsoft's purchase of Activision. I will bet Microsoft won't be as heavy handed with exclusive titles as Sony has been since the 1990s.
Sony doesn't really buy other studios to make their games exclusive, they just make good exclusive games. Their commitment to quality first party games is very strong.
