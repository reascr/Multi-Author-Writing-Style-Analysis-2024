I know few people would agree with how I see things in the U.S., but looking at Haiti crumbling into this abyss makes me disappointed in the United States. Sending hundreds of billions of dollars worth of weapons and tanks into Ukraine to help fight their war with Russia, and welcoming with open arms their people into our country, but a country on our doorstep is not our problem. We send those fleeing that horrible situation right back into the waters. Rounding them up with men on horses as if they were cattle. I just don't understand how we allow this.
I'll tell you what I don't want the United States to do and that is to send the refugee who fled back. Otherwise, send every refugee admitted from Ukraine back.
Unfortunately the U.S. deputy ambassador recently told the U.N. Security Council that Haiti must address its continued insecurity challenges. It doesn't look like there is much interest in helping Haiti.
Well put that on a Hallmark card I doubt anyone would disagree with the deep and insightful advice that Haiti needs "a good leader.".
This. Look at an areal map of Hispaniola. An island divided in two sides rather randomly. Yet you can see without any lines roughly where Haiti and the DRâ€™s borders are.
