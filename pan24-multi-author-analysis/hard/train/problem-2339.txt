It doesn’t matter if 32k is under-reported. The ratio of COVID deaths is 2:1 R.. That ratio is the same no matter what the total is. And there is no evidence to suggest that the after-COVID deaths you reference would skew Republican.
If 32,000 people in the state died of COVID, this would mean that 20,000 of those deaths would have been Republican and 10,000 Democrat.
Well the number that you really want is the margin between D and R COVID deaths. Assuming your “60/70% Republicans” quote is accurate and that all the non-Republican deaths were all Democrats, the margin of lost votes would be 20-40% of those deaths.
If the margin of votes in the election was 17,000, adding those 32,000 COVID deaths back into the mix likely wouldn’t change the outcome and Lake would still have lost the election.
Political affiliation is correlated with COVID deaths somewhat less than 2:1 R. nationwide. This takes into account that Republicans skew older, more likely to be anti-vax, etc.
Older people were the most at risk of Covid, they also tend to lean Republican. Republican voters were also more likely to ignore Covid safety guidelines due to Republican politicians downplaying Covid.
