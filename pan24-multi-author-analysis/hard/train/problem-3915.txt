They put margarine and non-dairy spreads through the same bullshit. Margarine had to be sold undyed at one point so it wasn't the same color as butter. It came in a pouch with a dye pellet you had to pop and knead in.
NO ONE thinks soy milk is milk, it is precisely the reason they are buying it. And most brands are enriched to equal the macro profile of dairy milk. Others not so much, but soy generally is. It is generally label readers that buy these products. And milk is a processed food anyway, and enriched also.
"Milk" is a generic category. It can refer to color, texture and function. It is used as a noun, and a verb, in ways that does not involve the lactation of animals. This is how we use language in myriad ways. It's not a special exception for terms that only benefit big corporations.
But another part of it is the inevitable decline of literacy and the nuances of language people took for granted in previous generations, that now seems to be of no interest to people.
If misguided lawmakers accept however campaign donors think we should use language, it will only accelerate our descent into illiteracy. Command of language is the difference between always being told what to think, and never truly being captains of our destiny, and knowing what to think from the evidence of our senses and having the ability to express it verbally to others, thereby making our own fortunes. Literacy is as American as apple pie. Don't let ideologues steal it from you.
