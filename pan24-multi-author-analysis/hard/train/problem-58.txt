I thought Russia was recruiting in Africa, turns out they’re holding African students studying in Russia hostage with threats of cancelling scholarships/debt trapping to force them to fight in a war.
And Russia is not much better look at that article, it is unreasonable to side with a country trying to get some of its black students involved a war they have nothing to do about.
Yes and I said that it is still unreasonable to side with them anyways, particularly Russia. This article is but one of the reasons why. Better to stay neutral or pick no sides when it’s clear multiple countries are willing to exploit them, even if the levels of exploitation are different.
They were mad about Ukraine/Poland giving them a hard time to cross the border at the start of the war but won’t say a peep about this I guarantee it.
They have plenty sure but Ukraine also has quite a good bit and they didn't want them to sell it cheaper to the Europeans. Puts a damper on the whole monopoly pricing. I disagree that it is about projecting military influence. Ultimately though there were many many factors that went into this invasion. No particular one thing.
To be fair the 3-4 other times they seized territory it didn't really piss anyone off aside from mild sanctions. I imagine they thought the world would wag their finger and Ukraine would capitulate in a week and everyone would have moved on while they quietly genocided the entire culture and sold off all the resources. I could easily see how they thought it would be a winning move. They didn't account for the Ukrainians will to fight nor the West's response. Also, I don't think it's about having resources they already have a shit ton of, it's about not having a neighbor friendly to Europe who can sell to them instead of Russia.
They did have a profit motive. All the oil and gas under Crimea and in the black sea. Granted it was pretty obvious after the first month that they would never control all those resources.
