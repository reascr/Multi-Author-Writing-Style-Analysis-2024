Your final statement is the logical point. It’s very probable & would sense from a geopolitical perspective given Israel’s geographical location, relations with neighbours & Russia’s relations with countries in the region. Israel appears to be protecting their own interests which make sense, while still providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
Your example isn’t great….Israel technically did help (Ukraine up) with humanitarian aid. As for dirty hands, they could face annihilation from their neighbours. As for any excuses Israel have made, they’re very plausible so there’s nothing to suggest they’re lying other than raw emotions.
Not necessarily, you state that they’re lying as Israel is already supplying SA? That’s fine, they didn’t deny that. They stated that they don’t have the capacity which is very possible & there’s no reason to doubt it realistically.
As far as a air defenses though I believe them when they say they don’t have the capacity, they aren’t the US with limitless resources to play with.
