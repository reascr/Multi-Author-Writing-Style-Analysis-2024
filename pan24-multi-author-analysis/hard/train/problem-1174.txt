The reason Trump avoided culpability during the Mueller probe is wholly due to the presidential powers he wielded at the time and Bill Barr's obstruction on his behalf.
That’s because Trump relied heavily on the powers of the presidency to stymie former Special Counsel Bob Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, using every advantage of incumbency to thwart Mueller’s team of prosecutors and downplay their findings. Citizen Trump will have far fewer tools at his disposal to avoid criminal charges.
Former President Donald Trump already faced down one hard-driving special counsel investigation without catching a criminal charge.
But his best moves from that tumultuous episode in U.S. history won’t work against new Special Counsel Jack Smith.
Smith will lead investigations into the removal of highly-sensitive government documents taken to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, and also into Trump’s attempts to reverse his defeat in the 2020 election and the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021.
