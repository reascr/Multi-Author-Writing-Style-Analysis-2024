Such a method of voting encourages and fosters extremism both logistically and psychologically/socially.
Our voting methodology is a primary foundation of democracy. Expecting much to change without changing that is folly.
The two best alternatives are and and have chapters across the nation looking for people who want to help. If anyone is looking for something to get involved in - there you go. :/.
This is not correct. Democrats voted for the authorization resolution to go into Iraq was a way to delay the war. The Bush administration wanted to go in and didn't need permission from Democrats. So the Democrats agreed to a bi-partisans resolution provided the administration gave UN inspectors time to go into Iraq. The hope was Saddam would cooperate and the UN Security council could talk the bush administration off the ledge.
When Bush was President the nation went through 2 recessions, started 2 Wars, the annual deficit hit new records, and the nation suffered the largest terrorist attack in history. Today Republicans just pretend Bush was individually stupid and doesn't represent the party.
