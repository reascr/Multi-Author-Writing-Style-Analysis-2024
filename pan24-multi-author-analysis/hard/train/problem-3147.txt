I hope this renews the focus on helping to repair a tattered and destroyed nation where the people are often bereft of any hope. The infrastructure is in ruins, the population are bedraggled and life has lost all meaning. But enough about the UK, I wish our Ukrainian friends all the best.
I see you are actually from Ukraine, so my comment is not aimed at you. I am not supporting Russia, my comment is simply highlighting that the UK government are shameful, liars, proven time and time again, including during the pandemic but more importantly during the invasion of Iraq.
The hard left of the Labour party are kind of Putin's useful idiots in Britain (they're not pro-Putin but they are pro making daisy chains and singing about friendship while tanks roll across Ukraine's border), but they've been pretty roundly purged after their idiotic stop the war stunt at the beginning of the invasion. Jeremy Corbyn is one of the longest serving anti-NATO politicians in the UK if not the longest serving. I absolutely shudder to think what the UK's response to the invasion would have been were he making the decisions.
I mean, this is clapping following the UK being the most steadfast ally of Ukraine over the last 9 years. The country has really been putting it's money where its mouth is in terms of providing real support, with vastly less hand-wringing than most of Western Europe.
Same here. It was really reassuring to see Starmer devote all six of his questions in PMQ's today to backing Ukraine and the UK's support for it. Clearly a very conscious effort to show voters that Labour is no-longer the Corbyn anti-NATO party.
Labour is the party of anti-NATO Kremlin stooges. They try to project disinformation about Russian defectors donating the conservatives, highlighting that they're Russian donors without mentioning they're defectors.
