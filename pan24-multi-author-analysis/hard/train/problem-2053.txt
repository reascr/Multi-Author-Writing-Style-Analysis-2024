The ironic part is that this ruling, if implemented, would appear to result in school funding increases in primarily rural, small town and republican parts of the state - not in Democratic areas like Philadelphia.
Nationally, local property taxes account for nearly half of public school funding, creating inherent inequality between wealthy communities that are replete with high-value properties, and poor ones, where properties are worth less. State and federal funding is supposed to help level the playing field, but it is often insufficient to make up the difference. And even if the funding were equal, advocates argue, students in poor communities often require more resources for things like special-education teachers and English language learning. It is why, for example, the federal government allocates extra dollars to schools that educate high concentrations of students in poverty.
It will also help urban school districts, like ones in Philadelphia, because those are usually also underfunded compared to their more affluent suburban counterparts. Something many don't realize is that northern school districts are quite segregated compared to their southern counterparts who were forced to make countywide school districts.
The southern schools are also segregated. They just split them into different buildings within those county districts. Or create new towns just to pull it off. Louisiana is the textbook case of this nonsense.
