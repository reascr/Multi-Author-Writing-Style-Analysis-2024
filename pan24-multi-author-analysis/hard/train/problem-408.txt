Instead of the fear of overpopulation, we should focus on the overconsumption of the planetâ€™s resources by the wealthiest among us.
If it's about overpopulation and not consumption, then by virtue of that it's still about consumption rather than the population. Like I said, wer currently can't sustain our current 8b. It doesn't matter where the population overall eventually levels because currently we consume too much to get there anyway.
Overpopulation by specific countries in the traditional sense is a myth. In developed countries, populations are often stable or even dropping. Just like our population boomed during the industrial revolution, the same thing is happening to the population of many less developed countries going through their own industrial revolutions today. The global population is predicted to eventually level out. It's much more about overconsumption than it is overpopulation.
Its much more about overpopulation than about consumption. Yes you are right, it should theoretically level out in the future.
