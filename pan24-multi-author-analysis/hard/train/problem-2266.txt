Below are the sequence of events in chronological order following the lawful search warrant to recover classified materials from Mar-A-Lago. The Department of Justice is investigating Trump for mishandling hundreds of classified documents.
3. Special Master Judge Dearie - A Reagan appointed judge from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He also served as a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) from 2012 to 2019. Judge Dearie is known as a very fair judge and is historically respected by both Republicans and Democrats. Trump's team and the DoJ provided Judge Cannon with a shortlist of judges to be the Special Master, however they only agreed on Judge Dearie.^ Judge Dearie has questioned the authority of District Court Judge Cannon and is demanding to see evidence of Trump's outlandish allegations such as the FBI planting evidence.^.
I recommend reading the judicial decision handed down by the Appeals Court, pay particular attention to pages 20 and 21. The 11^th Circuit said that District Judge Cannon was completely wrong and that no one, including a former President, is above the law.^.
11th circuit really stopped short of calling Trump appointed judge Cannon illiterate in law. The judge should vacate the bench tbh not that it will happen but that would be the moral thing to do here.
I suppose she could be arrested for something, but the judge that hears that case is going to throw it out. She could be impeached by the House and upon conviction in the Senate removed from the job. Odds of that are zero.
