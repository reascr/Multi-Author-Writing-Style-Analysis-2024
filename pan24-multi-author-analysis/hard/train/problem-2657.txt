I feel you... but I can't help but think about when Sarah Pallin couldn't answer a underhand, floating, softball pitch of a question like,"What periodicals do you like to read?".
Yes. That’s why you ask the question like ‘you’ve come out hard against the Biden administration for their actions, why is your response to the trump administration different?’.
Conservative: Without a second thought bashes Biden for these actions (be prepared, there’s a good chance their comment may be unintelligible, unhinged or sprinkled with schoolyard ad hom about democrats).
You to a conservative: Did you hear that Biden let three other Chinese balloons enter US airspace and did nothing about it? We, as citizens, weren’t even informed!
Exactly. When someone tells me that Biden may have broken the law, my reaction is to say that he should be investigated and punished if that is the case. I don’t find the accusation that Biden broke the law as a personal affront to my entire world view. I simply don’t identify with politicians that personally.
Sometimes it is nice that conservatives live in their own news bubbles and won’t hear a story like this. It can set up such a fun conversation with conservatives.
