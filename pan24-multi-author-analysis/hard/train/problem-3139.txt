no clue, it is so odd. as soon as they stopped the zero covered policy. everything went to hell, outside of forcing people to quarantine, people still distance themselves and wear masks so not sure something else is going on.
My family in China almost all got infected, they all think it's COVID and have COVID like symptoms probably a new strain and their vaccines are not effective, it's all fucked up.
Mm yes because no one in the west contracted covid, spread it to others, or were hospitalised or died after taking their dose, doses, 3rd to 5th booster of our vaccines.
A new disease at that spread rate would’ve been detected in the west by now in all likelihood… because people would have similar symptoms, no Covid 19, and then theyd discover a novel virus, so far not the case so no reason to think it is.
2) Infecting hundreds of millions of people is going to give the virus a chance to generate hundreds of new variants, one or more of which could spread more easily and/or be more lethal than present variants.
With the number of people they have being infected, I think it's a safe bet that they'll have a higher total number of deaths than anywhere else. They just won't tell anyone.
