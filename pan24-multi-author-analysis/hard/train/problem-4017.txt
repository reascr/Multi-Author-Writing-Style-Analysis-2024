Because republicans once again voted against the working class. Despite saying they care constantly. Democrats fucked up too. But the narrative is putting all the blame on them when the republicans could have voted for the sick days.
Sure. That’s a different issue. Republicans could have gotten the sick leave passed. They came out in numbers against it. Both sides fucked up, but the republicans are the reason the sick days didn’t pass. Period.
Biden made a mistake. That mistake could have been fixed by republicans voting for the sick leave bill. They refused because they’re evil. They’re at fault.
People are going to blame who they want to blame. Everyone involved in this has some blame which is true in every strike that happens. The workers asked for things they knew they wouldn’t get to add leverage, the railways didn’t give things the workers deserve. The government forced a deal because not having a deal would hurt even more people than forcing a deal does. Not to mention most of the unions had agreed to this deal, so not like this is screwing over all the workers.
If the strike would've presented worse problems, perhaps the bosses should've given their workers rights to prevent it.
You are looking it as a black and white issue, just because rejecting the strike hurts union workers, doesn't mean it is a bad outcome for the country as a whole. Sometimes the government has to make tough decisions, sacrificing the needs of some to keep the country as a whole from going into turmoil.
