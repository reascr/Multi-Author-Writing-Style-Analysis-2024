>Throughout her career, Wagenknecht has argued in favor of a closer relationship with Russia; in 1992, she penned an essay praising Stalinist Russia, a view she said in 2017 she no longer espoused. In the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Wagenknecht was a prominent defender of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, arguing on February 20, 2022 that while the United States was trying to "conjure up" an invasion of Ukraine, “Russia has in fact no interest to march into Ukraine.” After Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Wagenknecht admitted that her judgment had been wrong.

-Wagenknecht opposed sanctions against Russia over the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and, in a speech in September 2022, accused the German government of "launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier".
As for Wagenknecht, the impression I get from reading her wiki page it looks like her stances attract better reactions from far right politicians and parties than from her own party.
Wagenknecht used to be a big fish in her party but she has fallen out of grace since she turned towards the far right, including being pro-Putin, antivax, doing all sorts of right wing culture war stuff, in large parts against her own party.
