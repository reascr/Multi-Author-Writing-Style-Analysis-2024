Why would the police not help if someone is being assaulted? It doesn't matter what the reason for the assault is, the police have to step in, even if there was a morally justifiable reason for assaulting that person like them pouring milk first, cereal second.
That's not true. Turkey was demanding more extraditions, insisting that Sweden had already agreed to that, but they were not fundamentally opposed. That only came after the approval of the Quran burning.
Why do you want to burn the Quran anyways? What will that accomplish? If you want to burn it cuz you hate Muslims, then you're a bigoted islamophobe, and not any different than an anti semite.
If you want to burn it cuz you hate fundamental Islam or radicalized Islam, then you're burning the holy book of millions and millions of Muslims that are neither of those two things.
people burn the quran because the muslim world have a certain sizable portion that views their religion so much more serious and more dangerously.
Well yes, but there are plenty of other people who have burned the Koran for no other reason than angering Muslims. I meant the action more broadly. But yeah, the guy who did this was clearly a ruzzian asset.
