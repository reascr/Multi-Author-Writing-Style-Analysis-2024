Naw let them continue. Brazil already fined him $4 million this week. Anything attached to Trump people fails anyways and Brazilians are too smart for idiot American right wing nuts. They will keep on failing and alienating more people and countries. It’s a good look.
Live in Cali baby and I have nothing to do with Brazil except for a few trips there. What I should of said is that most people WORLD WIDE are smarter than American Right Wing Nut jobs. A forest mushroom is smarter than them. A dead tree filled with grubs is smarter than them. A rock is smarter than them. I could go on for a while here but you get my point now I assume.
You have a point there. It’s all on a case by case basis and it comes down to the judge assigned to the case. I’ll look it up tomorrow on his docket when I’m at work. I’m curious why he was allowed to travel. The guy is very dangerous.
He probably got permission to leave for this case. Usually you have to give your passport to US District Court that you’re indicted in as part of the proceedings. That’s how we do it at the court I work in. I work for the courts. His attorney probably filed a motion to allow him to travel for this. Once he’s back, he has to turn in his passport.
