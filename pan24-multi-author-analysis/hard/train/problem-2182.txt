Nowadays a ton of religious people don’t go to worship in groups, even Christians. In the East much religious activity is just continued funeral services after people die, or throwing a coin at a shrine for good vibes.
You said “you don’t say” as if it was obvious. Yet it’s an observed trend over centuries that people in the west do this constantly. When people say religion is bad, 90% of the time you can tell they are only talking about Christianity.
Wow I’ve had to say this to a lot of people. Not surprising at all though, people in the west have been treating all religions as Christianity throughout the past few centuries or so.
it's almost as if, and hear me out here, that in the west, Christianity is the predominant faith. you fight the enemy closer to home, first. worry about the rest later.
The death of Jesus was supposed to put an end to that ritualized behavior. Over the centuries though, the message of Jesus has been so warped that most people don't even know that he killed a fucking dragon when he was 12.
The biblical Jesus didn't die to absolve people of sin; he died, canonically, so that people wouldn't have to do the batshit ridiculous rituals that absolution of sin involved before. Make a transgression against Talmudic law? Congrats! now you have to cut the head off a chicken, swing it in circles above your head, and recite prayer for the sin to be absolved.
