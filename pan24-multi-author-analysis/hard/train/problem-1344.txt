Sunk and punched a hole into it so bad it wasn't a guarantee the ship would be repaired. I see they half assed the repair again. Though with Russia it's probably more of a quarter ass or one eighth ass at this point.
And all the things that make them safer are shit that Russia probably sucks big ass at. Procedure. Attention to detail. Discipline, being "On Job". Training.
Aircraft carriers are extremely fire prone, historically. They're basically a giant fuel and munitions warehouse that floats on water and happens to carry planes.
That aircraft carrier is nothing but a floating dock anyway. Did Xzibit set this up? Yo dog I heard you like floating docks so I put a floating dock on your floating dock.
All their shit is self-immolating. They’re doing more environmental damage than damage to their enemies. Their military is more of an environmental war machine than anything else.
You laugh, but it might just happen! Not because they’re afraid of the military threat that piece of shit represents, but the long-term environmental impact of it getting anywhere near your own country’s aquatic ecosystem. That aircraft carrier is nothing more than a floating superfund site.
I would really hope that they have specialized maintenance crews for their only aircraft carrier. it's not like there's another piece of equipment they can transfer that knowledge to.
There's a single road that runs about 60 miles from the Finland border for hundreds of miles of nothingness.
I bet Putin is loving that they'll now have hundreds of miles of NATO border that follows the ONLY ROAD to their entire fleet.
