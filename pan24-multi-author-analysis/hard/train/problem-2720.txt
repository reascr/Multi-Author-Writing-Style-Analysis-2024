NATO hasn't even started yet. The large-scale delivery of weapons that's allowed Ukraine to take on a country many times its size is deliberately being held back by NATO.
One thing I like to remind people of - NATO has spent its entire existence preparing for war with Russia. Every single conflict, every military action, every training drill, every strike and mobilization they've ever done - it has _all_ been practice for Russia. There is no opponent on earth they are better prepared for.
That part might be the scariest, tbh - Nukes are the only game Russia has in a conflict with NATO. They're virtually guaranteed to use them, because it's the only thing that would be even moderately effective - assuming Russia's nukes still even work.
NATO fighting Russia at this point would be more like watching an anthill get obliterated by a precision missile from five hundred miles away - laser-targeted and absolutely nothing left.
Especially given Russia's performance in Ukraine, I think it stands without question - a NATO conflict against Russia might be the single most overwhelmingly one-sided battle in history. The Russians might as well be using spears and slings for all the effectiveness they'll have. Short of launching their nukes, there is nothing at all Russia can do against NATO. Nothing.
