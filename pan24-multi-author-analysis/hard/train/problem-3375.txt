At this rate, even if the Russians aren't making much with the cap, it will at least give Russia significant leverage over Indian politics and economics.
So while yes more of what india is producing is from Russia, most of that appears to be being used domestically and it is certainly not acting as sanction buster.
India buys crude oil from Russia at a discount, refines it into petroleum, now making it an Indian product and not a Russian product, and then countries like the US and Israel buy it.
In March 2022, India reported receiving Russian crude at a 22% (as high as 27% for some companies) discount. In May, that became a 30% discount. In November, that became a 40% discount. This is prior to the price cap being instated which likely gives Asian nations an even greater bargaining leverage.
With the price cap in place, this gives India greater bargaining power which they then use to negotiating better discounts. So even without their active participation, they're benefiting from it. Russia loses which is why they've been reacting so harshly against the price cap.
