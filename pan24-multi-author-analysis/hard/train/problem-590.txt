ISW recently said the ceasefire would disproportionately benefit Russia. So Russia did what Russia does, try to gaslight Ukraine to get an advantage and if Ukraine rejects they get propaganda material.
It's the usual Russian propaganda strategy, where they don't even pretend to say the truth. Instead, they drown their audience in absurd, mutually containing statements (like these ones about ceasefire), to create an impression that truth does not exist â€” at which point, anything becomes believable.
Because they claim they abided by the unilaterally-declared cease-fire, and are already using this to accuse Ukraine of being the baddies as a pretext for their next wave of mobilization.
Setting aside how absurd and nonsensical it is for the aggressor to call a ceasefire anyway, Russia never intended anything to actually cease. They wanted to make a statement about cease fire, and then gaslight people about Ukraine refusing to agree to the unilateral cease fire. That's it. It was a super bad faith statement from the start, but now they will play the angle that "we tried to have a ceasefire and big meanie Ukraine keeps defending themselves!".
Ah, right. I missed the bit about "unilateral truce". Then again, that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron! I suspect that the fact Kyiv rejected it have me the impression that they were being asked to participate.
