The other consideration - he may be crazy, but how much of the Russian high command is? Since he's effectively destroyed the Russian armed forces and exposed them as ineffective, do the generals really want to basically provoke the whole world (or even just NATO) into attacking them? The reason that the Ukrainians don't retaliate deep into Russia, and the reason thee West doesn't give them thousand-mile reach missiles, is the fear of provoking this response. Once Russia uses its nuclear arsenal, what does the West have to lose? Are the generals willing to commit suicide just because he is?
(Similar to - the Ukrainians basically degenerated the Donbas to a stalemate before this war, and didn't contest Crimea, since they didn't want to provoke the Russians into backing the separatists with even more firepower. Now, all bets are off - Ukraine won't stop until it recaptures all its territory.).
This is not for them. There's a lot of Russian YouTubers and Telegrams who discuss the reality of what's happening on the front that's aimed at the Russian speaking population and it's negative towards RF.
It's hard to go from a semi open internet to just internet pro Russia with open discussion to shut your mouth and shove the propaganda into your throat. Once the cat got out the bag with the internet it's pretty much out there. North Korea is having a somewhat easier time with the cat still in the bag.
