Eh, the major variants now don't seem to be too terrible. Western vaccination rates were pretty good but most people haven't kept up with boosters and infections still seem to be manageable.
By quitting the bad plan with no exit plan, there will be a surge of infections because they cracked down on ANY exposure and don't have better vaccination rates.
The problem isn't the availability of a vaccine or the ability of that vaccine in reducing deaths. The problem is there is a sizable elderly portion of the country that doesn't want to be vaccinated.
There's a very clear tradeoff I've already outlined. Open now in best case scenario where everyone is 100% vaccinated with best vaccines and you still lose 40k people.
The CCP: Why should we spend money on vaccines for people who won't live long? Also, we have a population problem. This will get rid of the old and sick who are taking up space and using resources while contributing nothing to the country. As an added bonus, the younger generation will inherit and they always spend like crazy, so the money gets back into circulation faster! How can we lose?
