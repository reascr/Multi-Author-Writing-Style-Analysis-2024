"Something about the way he never stops crying and openly identifies as a Nazi has really struck a chord with the GOP rank and file.".
Right. Sure. But in general the training data of ChatGPT is - on average - a LOT smarter than what people get from News Corp. The bar is so low, any LLM that’s actually trained on large volumes of human intelligence - however imperfect - will mop the floor with the idiocy and intentional deception of Tucker Carlson and his ilk any day of the week.
You may be on to something here. Just as Fox News exploited the market niche for reactionary views, there will clearly be a need for a GOP GPT trained on Tucker Carlson monologues and Trump tweets.
Seems like in order to survive, the right wing will have to develop their own AI trained solely on their beliefs, excluding the Enlightenment.
The only way for reactionaries to hold on would be to make their own walled AI gardens trained on more limited data, and the economic disincentives to working with an AI that doesn’t understand basic reality will be huge. Or is this just wishful thinking on my part?
