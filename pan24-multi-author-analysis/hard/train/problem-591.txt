I feel sorry for the people who have to pay for Texas voting for morons. If Texas wasn't part of the Union, everyone there would be dead because of their idiotic votes.
Eh there are so many people who don't vote in Texas (someone further up said only 10m of the 30m voted in the last election). If they're of the age to vote and choose not to, it's as bad as voting against their interests.
Honestly, I'm beginning to feel like those people deserve it if they voted for him and his ilk. If they keep electing morons to office, they ought to keep feeling the consequences of those actions.
Historically been shown to be the best way to get idiots to vote for you. Same way the Nazis got power (by blaming all of their post-ww1 problems on Jews). The idiots ate that shit up while the smart people were packing their bags.
That's just a byproduct of the "got mine, fuck you" attitude. Unless it's not a tax cut for the rich, or "bigger military," Republicans aren't into "the gubment" spending "their" money on it. Even if their electrical grid fails once in a while. They never make that connection.
