Excuse me, but is your country already running on renewables-only? If not, please be quiet. Starting a war was Putin‘s/Russia‘s decision, not Europe’s.
Blaming Europe for russia attacking people shows a remarkable ability on your part to twist anything to suit your viewpoint.
The eu uses trade as a means to avoid war, it has been doing that successfully in Western Europe and slowly bringing in the countries on the east side that are willing. It was naive in hindsight to think russia would put peace and prosperity for it's people ahead of warmongering but that doesn't mean Europe is to blame.
The hope was that making Russia dependent on Europe for money they desperately need, in exchange for oil Europe needs, they wouldn't be stupid enough to attack Europe's new friend Ukraine.
It turned out we were wrong, but people are vindictive, if you think you can strongarm us, we'd rather cripple ourselves and pay more for oil from elsewhere than keep cooperating with you Russia. So Russia gets way less of the recource money, and Europe spends more on the gain of their recources.
If I attack, I need to attack 2 countries, and supply chains break down and I can't keep producing product A for who knows how long? It's a risk. If I try to attack and gain control over 1 country, the other will stop sending their recources, so we now have control over one recource but lack the other completely.
