The law errs on the side of the person that will be made homeless. Chalk this up to landlords being absolute scum so the rest of us can't have nice things. Without the law protecting the one that doesn't own the property, the landlord could rock up and cry "squatter" to get people evicted without due process.
If you ask me there should be licencing requirements for being a landlord and breaching the law resulting in confiscation of property.
Not really. Verbal contracts exist. There's also the concept of extending tenant protections to long-term guests so shitty landlords can't loophole it that way. Again, it all comes down to protecting tenants because they hold very little power in the relationship without the state backing them up. We wouldn't need these protections if slumlords didn't slumlord.
That said, when both sides have proof of residence, such claims should be expedited through the courts. It sucks for the innocent homeowners but we should all be blaming slumlords for being the reason why these laws need to be in place at all.
What is the origin of squatters having the right to essentially steal someone’s home? I’m not sympathizing with Russian oligarchs by any stretch but it’s always seemed like a weird thing that I could just sneak into a house and the owner couldn’t kick me out.
