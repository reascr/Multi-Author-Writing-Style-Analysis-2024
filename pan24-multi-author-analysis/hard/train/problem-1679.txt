Marjorie Taylor Greene attended and spoke this year. Can't remember if she went on before or after Fuentes started a "Pu-tin Pu-tin" chant and said it was cool to be compared to Hitler.
People thinking this is a “a-HA” moment against Trump are probably the same people who had no clue of who Fuentes was until this headline.
To be fair, if you've ever watched Nick Fuentes speak when he's not doing his "show" it's almost entirely obvious he's at least bicurious. Given that he's a far right, repressed Catholic I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of his extremist rhetoric comes from his own self loathing and inability to accept that it's okay to be gay.
He does this with all extremist supporters. Remember his Proud Boys stand down and stand by moment? It followed shortly after he said he "didn't know much about them besides the fact they like the great things he's done for the country.".
Yeah. If you were a real manly man, then the only people tough enough to have sex with you would be lumberjacks, cowboys, and especially sailors. A real man would need to cover themselves in seamen to be satisfied.
