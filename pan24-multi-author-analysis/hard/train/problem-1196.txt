The Senate sets its own rules. It takes 51 votes to change the cloture requirement. And again, they’ve done it recently.
I’m talking about the requirement for 60 votes to force a vote, and the existence of the 2-track system allowing the Senate to move on to other matters rather than having to vote on an issue before moving on to another issue.
If they want to filibuster that’s fine, make them stand there and read Dr. Seuss and actually be in any way accountable. It’s absurd that they just decided to completely break the Senate because they were lazy, and now they stick to it because “if we eliminate the filibuster rule it’ll come back to bite us when the GOP is in the majority.”.
Get rid of the filibuster, gerrymandering, and make voter suppression of "eligible voters" a mandatory 5 year penalty and Republicans will never win another election. Their edge is manipulation of the vote after manipulation of their stupid ass followers.
And not voting gives the same result as voting for conservative candidates (which is why they've spent billions disinfranchising the vote).
