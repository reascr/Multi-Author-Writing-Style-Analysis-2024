In 2009 Democrats created a team that was supposed to have the resources to do this. It was supposed to have 242 examiners by 2012 but by 2014 it only had 96. The IRS also lost a whole whack of its talent during this time because Republicans .
This is part of it, but the bigger issue is Republicans. Republicans do not want a group at the IRS going after the ultra-wealthy. And, they don't want it because the ultrawealthy pay them to not want it.
They are making it clear they want this included in this year's budget. So while yes this particular bill will never get passed, parts of this bill may be incorporated into the budget bill.
Ultimately, the super-wealthy pay Republicans too much money in return for preventing the IRS from ever having full resources to go after them.
Because an IRS that cannot afford to pursue wealthy people with expensive lawyers will only be able to pursue poor people without.
The IRS goes after the poor because it doesn't have the resources to go after the rich, who can afford armies of accountants and lawyers.
And if I remember right the funding that was recently passed for them was to help retain positions after retirements and cuts and not adding tens of thousands of new auditors as the right wing media says.
Also, did I read somewhere that most of this “new” funding is basically to get back to where we were 20 years ago as well as planning for retirements and replacement workers?
