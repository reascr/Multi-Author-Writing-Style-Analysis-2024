The difference: Israel's allies are starting to lose sympathy, and the other countries have string allies that are scary to the UN. I'm not saying any of them are good. It is that the UN can get away with condemning Israel right now.
Israel doesn't want peace, they want war and death. Iran wants to give it to them. It sure seems it would be best to stop encouraging this on both sides.
But the rest of the world (USA) could stop giving billions in weapons to Israel. Weaponiszing Israel and Saudi Arabia is going to create a gigantic war with Iran. You don't start handing out weapons to people who hate others without expecting them to be used.
But Israel provoking the people around them doesn't make them safer, it only makes the others more angry. Much like the USA bombing weddings and children to get terrorists makes more terrorists, Israel occupying another country and destroying homes there makes people really hate Israel.
I tend to side with Palestine overall because of Israel's continuous expansion, but it's also a fact that Israel is surrounded by people who would destroy them if they got a chance to do so.
