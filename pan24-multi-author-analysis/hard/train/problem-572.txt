They weren't affected by this. They created the problem out of racism (Ronald Reagan pushed California to end free college to keep blacks out after Civil Rights) & made it impossible to get good jobs without a degree that required decades of interest payments to Uncle Sam. That revenue was, like most neo-con/lib laws/policies, designed to transfer wealth from the young to the old and poor to the rich.
So called "student debt" schemes are just another racketeering method from the wealthy boomers and oligarchs dragging away all wealth from the younger working class.
Pretty sure average US people in their 40 don't have a million dollars for a 2 bedroom home either. Esp not on a red state min wage. The housing market is now as batshit insane as education or healthcare in america. It's tearing at society, at that point.
Trashy. How much are those people told to pay in %age of their income to multi-billionaire banksters as "student debts" ?
Now for the interesting fact: the 10% of borrowers with over the $50k line hold 40% of all student debt.
90% of student loan borrowers owe $50k or less (see note 1 below for an interesting fact about the remaining 10%).
Of the remaining 10% who need the $20k forgiveness, DoEd estimated 80% took pell grants and qualify.
