Selectively banning flights has never helped anyone avoid any COVID infection wave or even dampen the impact.
Flights from the UK for example have 10% infection rate and there are a lot more of them than from China plus there is more of a risk of an immune escape variant among them because they have already been exposed to various variants unlike China.
But 50 planes of 400 people/plane from other countries with 5% infection rate making up 1000 infected travelers is ok?
Why are other countries bending backwards to accommodate passengers from any country that has given up control of the virus?
Which country is still trying to control the virus at this point? Hasn't just about every place ditched all internal restrictions and lets the virus spread freely?
It is not in the virus' interest to become more deadly than previous strains. Mutants are naturally selected for their ability to spread, not to kill. If a new variant were able to cause severe illness and kill more quickly than before, it would have little time to infect others before the patient becomes isolated in a hospital and dies. In a world with COVID variants which cause mild symptoms minimally affecting the patient, there is no way that this deadly variant can compete. There is a reason past epidemics and pandemics eventually fizzled out or faded into the background: killing people doesn't help a virus spread.
