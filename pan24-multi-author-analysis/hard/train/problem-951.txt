In large part, yes, when that chaos is occurring so close to your own country. The US concern back in the early 20th century was primarily through the lens of WWI and environs, so fears of Germany using Haiti the way the USSR would eventually use Cuba. Another concern then and now is that when things go terribly wrong in Haiti, Haitians have an understandable tendency to fo and flee… generally to the US.
Well then good news, because no one wants to go in there either, just turn the migrant boats back to shore and let them rot in the bed they’ve made. In the time since the last foreign occupiers left Haiti, in the time since the last of the awful French debt was paid, a lot of countries pulled themselves up from as bad or worse situations than Haiti.
But yes, Haiti has been in turmoil since it declared independence, which was an act that flagrantly disobeyed the European slave trade based world order and left them with a debt that's been called the greatest exploitative heist in world history. This debt was not paid off until 1952 and in a lot of ways the nation is still paying for it.
Which countries? I'm really intrigued on this-- offer a country that has gone through worse than Haiti but made far more progress and I'll be happy to compare for you since you seem to be really bad at understanding history.
Hey bud, I notice you've given up on Haiti to pursue folksy truisms now about "humanity's track record"-- not surprising since Haiti is a subject that's way out of your depth.
