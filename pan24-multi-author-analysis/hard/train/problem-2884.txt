They’ve already overruled a previous lower court ruling trying to block the forgiveness. It could have just been to avoid hurting republicans in the midterms, but we shall see soon. How many different reasons can rich people come up with to block it?
Giving it to rich people? My guy, there's an income cap of $125,000. That means no one above middle class is getting any relief, and the biggest relief is going to Pell Grant students who have to be poor to receive in the first place.
Additionally, the US government gives billions in handouts to farmers and oil companies every single day, as well as the forgiveness of PPP loans. Why would you not be upset about that, but mad that the government is actually trying to directly help the people?
This is probably the most unjust action I’ve seen our government do in decades. People need to pay off their debt.
Lastly, people need to pay off their debt? You never heard or seen how the rich specifically abuse tax loopholes or bankruptcy? Don't make me laugh.
This is a predatory system that was backed by the government and this is the first step in the right direction. Maybe if we can destroy the predatory college loan scam system. We can actually look at opening some trade schools.
