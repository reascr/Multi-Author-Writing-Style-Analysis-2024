I shudder to think how Russia CURRENTLY IS doing in Ukraine, given that even their initial soldiers were so crappy. (not exactly shuddering, and I oppose the war in Ukraine).
You might be right and I also don’t think Russia’s concept is good or fitting specifically the Ukraine war. I was just commenting on the difference on concepts.
As far as I understand western top-notch tanks are very expensive, complicated and take long to build and deliver (Abrahams, Leopard-2, Challenger…). So these tanks exist in lower numbers, but are highly effective. Russia’s top-tanks are cheaper, faster to build but obviously less capable and advanced but exist in much more numbers. As such Russia just has lots of these and their concept is to overrun an enemy with sheer numbers.
Also Russia’s T-90 and T-72 are operated by 3 people while the Abrahams and Leo need 4 persons. Still not saying it’s better on the Russian side and again just pointing out differences.
Is it ? I’m not an expert so I’m genuinely interested but can these tanks really be repaired on the field by the crew themselves? Also the extra pair of eyes looking for danger would likely only apply to inside the turret / cabin. Also I assume the loader job is the most tiring one. Are jobs rotated with the gunner ?
