Yes, Russia would just sit there and die. That makes sense. I think you’ve forgotten a small detail there. At the end of the day all other forms of warfare are irrelevant when compared to nukes.
It would be the end of whoever tried to destroy them as well. That’s why there is no “special spanking operation”. The destruction is mutually assured for a reason. The United States has exactly no advantage over Russia (assuming that Russia has time to get its mobile missile launchers running and subs out to sea during the escalation phase). Nuclear weapons are the only weapons that truly matter in an all out war and Russia has plenty.
What was shown with the polish incident is that the West is more willing to fight Russia more than ever. So Medvedev does the other Russian foreign policy move of trying to frame the West as warmongers while Russia is invading its own neighbor.
I mean Russia did bomb a dam and try to say it was Ukraine, launching a Ukrainian missile at Poland to try and break friendly relations is well within their power.
They invade another nation and use the threat of nukes to get there way, yet apparently the west is worse for considering the integrity of there security alliance if a Russian missile did hit its territory.
