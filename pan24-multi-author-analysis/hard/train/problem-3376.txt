Society also needs to accept that forcing women to carry a fetus to term and birthing it does not add positive value to the community. Every child forced to be born into a family that didn't want it, couldn't afford it, or lost their mother because of it suffers mental, physical, and/or sexual abuse. We cannot say we value the life of the fetus if society doesn't give a damn what life that fetus will live. There's already an overabundance of unwanted and heavily abused children in the world and adding extra burden to that system does not show love or compassion for the lives of children. Anyone who argues for pro-birth without even attempting to fix the broken system that fails those unwanted children being forcefully birthed are not compassionate or god fearing people. They're abusive monsters who only care about their personal agendas instead of the consequences suffered by innocents at the hands of their choice to force laws against abortion.
In conclusion: fuck every pro-birth moron who only cares about their own agenda and not the innocents who suffer because of anti-abortion laws.
If it's not out of the womb and capable of being viable outside the womb it's not a living breathing person. People can try and disagree with that based on their personal feelings but to move forward as a society we need to accept that the life of the living, breathing woman carrying the fetus has more value then that of a fetus.
and lets not forget their willingness to let the mother Die even if the fetus is no longer viable, or if she's an underage rape victim of 10 who isn't even built properly to push another human out of her body and will likely die or be cripled by it. (of course Christofasit like to ignore those as even being real things that happen).
