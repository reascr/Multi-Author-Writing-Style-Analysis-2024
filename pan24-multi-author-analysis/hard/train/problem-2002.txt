If we had things in place like Single Payer/Universal Health care as an example, you could do away with some of the programs because you'd still have support otherwise in place for those who need it. Since we live in a country of billionaires and their synchophants who couldn't develop empathy if it was grown in a lab, though, we don't, ergo the need for the patchwork of programs. I'd love to see a politician actually tackle the issues of food, clothing, and shelter as an actual health and safety issue instead of a talking point that they're not really concerned with - when billionaires are able to bring along yachts to act as landing pads, I think we have enough cash to go around.
a)Because , and if you don't want people stuck in the same quagmire, they need valid assistance instead of the veneer.
b)I'm against the means testing as well, but that's not a justification to remove the other programs.
As long as it's coupled with other assistance programs instead of switching one for the other, yes. Most of the time, people try the "well-with-universal-income-we-can-remove-the-other-programs!" argument which only exacerbates the problem; universal income has to be in addition to other programs in place to truly be effective.
Iirc, when a universal income was being debated during the last round of presidential primaries, the logic behind it was it saves money. All of the applications and bureaucracy behind our current welfare system are very expensive. Guaranteed income to everyone is much more efficient.
