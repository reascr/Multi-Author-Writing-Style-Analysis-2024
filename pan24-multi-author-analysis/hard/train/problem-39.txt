Areas of california have average salaries of 85k, which is far above an average wage, and have some of the largest teacher shortages in the country.
Things I've taught during the service included : physical fitness, personal finance, land navigation, sexual assault awareness, diversity and inclusion, counter intelligence and travel safety, intelligence reporting, intro to digital networks, map reading, radio communications, riflemanship, satellite system maintance, vehicle maintainence, motor cycle safety, and leadership.
Two teachers in california in sf, san diego, or la would be an upper middle class household. The issue would be establishing and getting housing, there are programs for that, but programs arent always easy to navigate. Most of the teachers I knew the last couple years had amazing places though because of housing benefits from the city, the ones who didnt just didnt get through the program beuracracy.
>It doesn’t mean they’ll make good teachers but they are probably a little more qualified than a homeless person off the street.
Actually, the only group out of those that working as a teacher, with the pay, disrespect and angry parent bullshit they have to put up with, would be the homeless. Seems a win-win as far as Politics of the Stupid is concerned.
