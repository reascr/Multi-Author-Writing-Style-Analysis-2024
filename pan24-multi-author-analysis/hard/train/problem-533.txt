There is an argument to be made that basic standards for holding office should be implemented. We live in a modern society - professionals must meet a minimum standard to secure a job or practice.
Trump is a symptom of not only low standards but no standards. Assessing a candidate, be it state, local or federal, before one can run for office should not be a pearl clutching notion, imo.
First, IMHO, American politics are a game for most every elected seat in government. If both major paries can put that concept aside and take an educational/professional roll call perhaps some of the fools elected who lack the basic education needed to understand how the government functions, at least at the Federal level, basic economics, etc., (and consider this a big nod to the former whatever you choose to call him) to be considered for office.
Of course, I am not suggesting every candidate be an Ivy Leaguer, but I truly don't think the Former POTUS really understood the three branches of our government. In a way, that's a very sad commentary on one student's lack of education (and I am in no way referring to any educator's efforts). I believe that man thought of it as a personal gain of "power"-- that he could have things his way, hire his friends and family to join in...and he had his grip on that office and kept expressing his direction to those would still listen to him to tragedy of January 6.
Yes, I agree that most persons in political roles do spend the remainder of their terms in office preparing for the next election. I am 100% for election reform: to take money, lobbiests (sorry folks, but find work elsewhere), media overkill...the list of all the operatives that work against the majority of American citizens to not only, realistically, have the chance to vote for an individual they want to represent them in office, but also pay that forward with the ideal that any citizen who meets very basic qualifications could run for office.
