This is Russia in an nutshell for over a century. It is always the bully with the glass jaw. It's only strenh is its numbers and even then its phyrric with them either burning their capital or wasting 1/3 of their youths and hoping the opposite end runs out of bullets.
We truly gave them a chance, we appeased maybe a little too much, but we cut the devil before it turned into Hitler 2.0. True, at the cost of Ukrainian blood, but that's also on Europe.
I was told Poland was going to invade Ukraine like it did 100 years ago, and Russia is here to save Ukraine from Poland.
- And the fact that for 9 years Ukrainians have been hammering at the peaceful cities of Donbass, killing both the old and the young, does this not count? +1, -6.
Now that Peskov suggested the collapse was air-defense related, the previously-ignorant masses now realize it wasnâ€™t faulty construction but war-related, and most likely, Russian-caused. And specifically, men who know construction or military, post what had to be the cause.
