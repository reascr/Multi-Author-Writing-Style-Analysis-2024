that's the point of this communication. The next Ukrainian (offensive) move that makes sense is to take back Crimea through a southern offensive. The fewer Russian assets are located on the peninsula, the better. Give them as many reasons as possible to withdraw.
If the Russians are really planning an offensive then it's just much better to sit behind your defenses and let them rush across the open fields instead of attacking yourself.
If a russian building hoarding ammunition stands in the way of our new missiles, we could ignore it's deep in russian territory and housing conscripts again.
I bet you this is because we made conditions for new missles- we told Ukraine you get the missles only if you dont to use them against targets inside Russia.
Are we expecting Russia to start WW3 just because the West deliveries long range weapons that can strike military targets in Russia?
Does anyone seriously think Russia will start attacking NATO countries just because Ukraine used long range weapons against Russian targets?
I understand that many in the West fear a Russian escalation, but I think given the fact that Russia has invaded Ukraine and committed a long list of war crimes, it should be fully expected and normalised that Ukraine can strike military targets in Russia.
I think Ukraine should be fullyenabled (by Western weapon supplies) to attack targets like ammo depots, railway junctions and stations, military airports and barracks deep within Russia.
