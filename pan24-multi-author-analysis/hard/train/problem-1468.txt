We know it by the definition of an element. To phrase it as simply as possible, each element is essentially defined by the number of protons it has. The first element on the periodic table has 1 proton, the second has 2 protons, etc. A couple other properties (e.g., number of neutrons) change to accommodate this number of protons, but basically that's what defines an element. If you took hydrogen and added 1 proton to it (then corrected the number of electrons and neutrons), it becomes a helium atom. All the Renaissance alchemists who wanted to synthesize gold were unwittingly aiming to arrive at an atom with the correct number of protons (and neutrons and electrons to stabilize it).
We have produced elements beyond 100 protons and observed that they stopped being stable long ago, hence these are not naturally occurring. We also know that it becomes increasingly difficult to make the higher numbered elements, and the artificially created elements expire within fractions of a second. This means eventually we will be unable to make any further elements. The physics of what makes up an atom will no longer be possible; We'll have exhausted the possibilities for new atoms. People have made calculations around this limit as well.
uses would be pretty limited, right? maybe you could put it in a diamond anvil cell and get neat readings with it, but i can't think of anything other than testing for properties that it could be used for.
