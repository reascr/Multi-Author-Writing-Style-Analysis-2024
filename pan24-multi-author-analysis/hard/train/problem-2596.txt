Quickly, he had his security detail surreptitiously go to other supermarkets in the area to check, to confirm that this was actually a propaganda plot, that the store had been over-stocked with goods to make America look good.
A similar story is told about the soviet union. In 1989 Boris Yeltson visited America, and toured part of the city to see "real americans living their lives".
At first he was incredulous about all the cars and people in good clothing, but he assumed they were simply stuffing the town with people with cars to make it look good.
After realizing how plentiful things really were in the US, and how well the average American lived at the time, it killed his spirit for the USSR, and ultimately led to his spiraling out the party 2 years later. It was said that he told his fellow travelers "If the people in the Soviet Union saw this store, there would be a revolution.".
This. The United States is monstrously rich. Itâ€™s just all the money goes to billionaires. There is no trickle down. There is only the pyramid scheme that is our economy. Congress acts same day when the rich are in danger. They take decades when the rest of the country is. Our representatives are bought and paid for.
