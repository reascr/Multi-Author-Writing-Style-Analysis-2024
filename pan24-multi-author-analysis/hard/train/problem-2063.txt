Yeah, I mean, in fairness to German leaders, this truly has completely fucked Russia's economy. They miscalculated how much the state of Russia's economy would matter to Putin.
And also in fairness to Germany, the Russian leader they were negotiating with probably did not realize himself how badly this war would fuck Russia's economy either. Putin seemed to truly believe he would sweep over Ukraine with only short-term economic consequences. It's obvious at this point that he never thought his army would be getting bogged down in an attritional war of annihilation and that Russia would be dealing with epic, unprecedented Western sanctions for an entire year straight at the same time. If he'd known this would be the outcome, he probably wouldn't have invaded.
Less a question of riches and more one of motivation. Germany's memory of the world wars is still fresher than most countries, and they have very little stomach for anything liable to start a repeat of the carnage. Before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine there is just no way the voters would have tolerated cutting back on Russian fossil fuel imports.
A mild winter has enabled countries to tap less gas from stocks that were built up in anticipation of cuts in supplies from Russia, Europe's main pre-war supplier.
Wagner's Prigozhyn explains why he is unable to take Bakhmut - a line of defence every 10 meters, hundreds of lines of defence across the city. Russians lack armoured vehicles and equipment.
Firstly, Russian troops aren't being "trained to fight". There simply isn't enough time or quality instruction. The stories of "training" are ludicrous - a few rounds and that's it. That isn't "training". That's not even "exercise". It's theatre.
