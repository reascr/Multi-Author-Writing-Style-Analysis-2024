I can’t imagine anyone the Rs would put up would be tolerable, so I will vote dem, for sure. However, I want someone other than Biden to run. Not sure who that should be, but Biden is too old and very unpopular. (I’ve been relatively happy with him as potus, but would like him to retire after 1 term, as he stated he would do before running in 2020. ).
Same. Biden was not my choice in the primary but he's been doing a better job than I hoped so I'm not going to go disrespecting his eligibility to do the job now.
Biden still isn't my pick to run in 2024, I'd rather have a senator, but they all need to stay where they are.
Biden isn’t going to resign unless he’s elected and an unexpected health issue comes up. But even if he did resign it wouldn’t impact the house or senate majority since the new president gets to appoint a VP. If the Senate is held by the GOP and they refuse to confirm a VP then the office sits vacant and the speaker of the House is next in line should something happen to Harris, but they are still in the House until that happens.
You don't get to have 2 hats, if Biden resigns the VP becomes president, but then someone else needs to become VP (which would probably be speaker of the house), and someone else needs to be speaker of the house.
Resigning isn't an option once he's in, since succession could mess with either the senate, or the house majorities.
