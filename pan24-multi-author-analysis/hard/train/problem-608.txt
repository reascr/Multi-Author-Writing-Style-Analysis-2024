I live in the Seattle area, where there are a LOT of Teslas. Most people who bought them aren’t going to buy another, they all were just waiting for their Porsche or BMW to be released as an EV, and that’s happening as we speak.
Also many Black Americans communities have a strong sense of culture and tradition going back to African traditions, since many can’t pin down their families exact origins, African American sums their identity up well.
It's much more complex than "descended from," they were forming their own culture alongside other African groups as a unique identity with a unique language and culture.
From my experience in talking to them it is about having a cultural attachment to their roots in being slaves without the skin colour aspect. There are Black people in America that do not share that heritage of slavery (even though of course they are subject to the same racism). It is therefore a more cultural distinction these days which makes racists calling Musk an African American even more evil as it tries to erase that culture built from the ruins of being enslaved. This is of course not universal as no culture is a monolith.
