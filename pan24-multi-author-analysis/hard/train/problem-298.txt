I had an argument with somebody that was vehement that Putin would have gone down as the greatest statesman of our times if he hadn't attack Ukraine because he made Russia a world power again and.... that's absolutely objectively not true.
Still so many people, even those that don't like him, hold on to this fake narrative of Putin pulling Russia out of the mud and bringing him to lead the earth when all those stories about Russia's greatness have been thoroughly been proven lies.
But we should all be wary of any narrative that paints the Russians as so fundamentally corrupt and inept they can't fight their way out of a paper bag, which is a popular sentiment I see on these front page posts.
This war is a test for greater future conflicts. It's giving us a sense of how impactful modern tactics and weapons are. If Ukraine can really keep Russia at bay for years, or hopefully push them out of Ukraine, then I'll eat my words on Russia's threat.
"I really, honestly wouldn't put it past them to start supporting Russia out of spite and blackmail".
When Trump blackmailed Zelensky, he was willing to help Russia, by refusing to help Ukraine. We focused on the ask, but there was a threat.
