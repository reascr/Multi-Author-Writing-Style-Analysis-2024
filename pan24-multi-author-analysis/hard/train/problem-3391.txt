One of the questions I'm looking forward to being answered when his returns are released is whether he really did get a tax break for burying her on his golf course.
I appreciate you. It's exhausting reading breathless post after breathless post about conclusive evidence of crimes, when in fact the bar for actual conviction would be very much higher.
But I don't think we have enough information to conclude much from her testimony alone, unfortunately.
I'm speaking to all the comments that believe there is somehow clear evidence of criminality from her testimony, which there isn't. I think a lot of people are reading the title and running with it, so I'm just providing context. I want him held accountable as much as anyone else.
Knowing Meadows and his ilk - yes it's quite possibly nefarious and/or criminal in nature, and the broader circumstances make it very suspicious. Also, Hutchinson's testimony could be corroborated if investigated further (which it should be).
In a later deposition, Hutchinson told the committee she continued to be riddled with guilt after not being entirely truthful to the committee in her first deposition.
