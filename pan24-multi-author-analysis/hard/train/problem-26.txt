Legalize weed, forgive student debt, codify roe v wade and gay marriage. That’s all you need to do You have the senate, and you might even have the house.
To do a lot of what you want, we’d need to get rid of the filibuster. We still have 2 senators that oppose that. So at best we’d have 49 votes to get rid of the filibuster which fails.
The last two can't happen, because the votes simply do not exist to scrap the filibuster rule. It will happen at some point, and I have no doubt about that. But it's not going to happen in this Congress or the next one. And considering the awful, awful 2024 Senate map, probably not in the 119th Congress either.
Without getting rid of the filibuster, we likely can’t do most of what you list because I doubt we’ll find around 10 republicans that want those things.
And hopefully there are a handful of republican representatives that aren't full on fascist and will vote with dems on some bills. Hopefully.
Not even close. Removing the electoral college would take an ammendment to the constitution, which requires much much more than a bare minimum majority in the senate.
