Sinema is polling at 11%. Not a chance in hell she will get any campaign support to run with 11% numbers.
That is what she is playing for now, because she won't get any campaign support when polling at 11%.
Polls mean less than nothing anymore, I couldn't give less of a fuck what one says, midterms and the last 7 or 8 year have shown us that. That's not even mentioning the shitshow in the house rn trying to pass that sales tax shit, you can quote me on this next election it's gonna be a blue tidal wave after the national embarrassment that is the GOP house tosses away independent and moderate voters.
The fail rate on signatures collected by paid canvassers (and Sinema's likely going to have to rely on a lot more of them than party volunteers) is higher - which knocked a bunch of MI-GOP gubernatorial candidates out of the running last year.
Sinema has very low approvals, needs to collect more signatures to get on the ballot, and increased partisanship makes it harder for third parties to act as spoilers.
