Boy I dunno, Russia absolutely gets off on murdering people around the world, but would they really want a diplomatic row with India, who has remained sort of neutral despite intense pressure from the west? I'm torn between, yes, Putin's government does insanely stupid shit relentlessly... and thinking, Putin desperately needs India and neutral countries to trade with, he's not stupid enough to piss off India.
edit: but then again every single international murder he's committed has had blowback and damage to Russia's interests many times the perceived worth of the murder/sending a message. Putin has been an insanely stupid human for decades, none of this, the war in Ukraine, further murders, etc, should surprise any of us, Putin outed himself as a drooling fool long ago.
Whereas this is undoubtedly true, it's worth remembering that less than 12 months ago the great analysts of Reddit were assuring us that the oligarchs ran Putin and all we had to do was pressurise them and they'd depose him.
