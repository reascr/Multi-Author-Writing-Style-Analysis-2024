Of course, that calls into question what hypothetical war the US could possibly find itself in where stingers of all things are a relevant contribution to their air dominance plans. Like, if a US soldier actually has to fire a stinger, someone fucked up. In realpolitik terms, it really only has the singular use case of providing it to other countries where a given faction is unable to establish air dominance.
Unless both the entire US Air Force and Navy got wiped out, you still wouldn't be using a stinger as a US draftee. In modern US doctrine, it's not the job of the infantry to establish air dominance.
This is not how the US MILITARY fights wars. However arm someone not US military to fight the war instead of sending our military is very much a part of how the US fights wars. such such we need the equipment not only are military needs, but also the equipment we don't need but someone else ew are arming needs.
It wouldn't be burdensome to strap a pair of emergency stingers, or some more up to date equivalent, to one vehicle in a platoon. Just in case.
