Many countries already have such restrictions. Americans can’t buy land or a house in Mexico. You can get a very long term lease (99yrs) but you can’t own it.
Absolutely. You should be a permanent resident or citizen to buy real estate in the USA. I don’t think investment companies foreign or even American should be competing to buy up single family housing units in any market in the USA.
The American people should have access to their own country’s housing market. They shouldn’t be bidding against some foreign investors to buy a home to live in.
Well no because then it would be a foreign enterprise which is banned from purchasing residential property. The only way they could start up a Canadian company is if they got a visa for immigration.
The Canadian law permits refugees and those with permanent resident status to buy. So it's not really "immigrants" they're banning; it's foreigners who reside outside of Canada and people on work-type visas who aren't confirmed to be staying long term.
