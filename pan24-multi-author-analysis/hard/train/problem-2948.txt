The bigger problem if you ask me is how selectively this is being enforced. A few years ago the police themselves did it by slowing down traffic and there were no consequences. More recently farmers did it and nobody intervened. But now climate protesters are doing it and suddenly the police are called into action.
These people are protesting policy leading to climate change. The theoretical hazard of obstructing emergency vehicles is next to nothing in this part of The Hague (many parallel roads).
Your comment about emergency vehicles being let through is a little odd, because it’s not an issue of an emergency vehicle that finds it’s way to the blockade. Only a sociopath would not step aside for an ambulance that is right in front of them. The issue is the clogging of travel arteries. That ambulance that is 50 cars deep in that gridlock isn’t getting through that blockade, certainly not timely… and that ignores the needs of all of the other travelers that could have equally urgent needs.
After all, highways and cars going down at high speed in them are quite literally impeding that everybody else can have a nice peaceful stroll in that area. By such a logic (which is as selfish and one-sided as yours), highways should never be built.
