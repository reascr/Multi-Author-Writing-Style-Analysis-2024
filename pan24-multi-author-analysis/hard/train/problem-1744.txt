You are missing the nuance. Russia claims things are false flags when they do something on purpose.
Why now, false flag? Mistake or intentional, or Russia used foreign rockets without their identification markers. Time to see where these missiles were from.
I was reading the missile in question was a s300 missile that could of been shot at a Russian missile but missed and landed in Poland. This is very strange statement as this hasn't happened before with the numerous missile attacks from Russia and none have landed before but the same goes with Ukraine air defence system.
Considering this was an "accident," I suppose an appropriate response might be a no-fly zone that shoots down any Russian missile or aircraft that comes too close to NATO borders...which conveniently covers a wide swath of Ukraine.
Seems they are pointing to the idea that it is possibly a part of a missile, or a missile that was hit by AA and went off course, or it might even just straight up be an anti air missile from Ukraine.
Seems the people on CNN with defense contacts are really stepping away from the idea that this was just a straight up Russian Missile.
