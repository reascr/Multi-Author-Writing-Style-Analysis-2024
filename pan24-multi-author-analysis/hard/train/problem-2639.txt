A single 15A 120V circuit is enough to fill any PHEV battery in 10hr (overnight) charge. Even an old non-upgraded 100A service can handle that. No one I know with a PHEV needed to do electrical upgrades.
There's a lot of time for infrastructure upgrades between now and 2040 or whenever they switch to EVs.
Canada's at 7% EV sales in 2022, and there's huge waitlists for EVs (and automakers all have big plans to increase production).
It's not that hard to believe that Canada could go from 7% EV sales to 100% in the next 13 years, particularly given the rapid pace of technological improvements that we've seen for EVs over the past 13 years.
So they probably aren't the type of people to buy brand new cars, so they won't be directly affected by the mandate, even when it hits 100% new EV sales in 2035.
For sure, but the people who can't afford $25k for a car generally aren't the ones buying new cars in the first place (regardless of whether it's gas or EV), so the mandate doesn't affect them. Instead they typically buy used cars (for cheaper).
Cars are an elastic good, as a change in price will cause buyers to check out more affordable competitors. It would be better to add a $5000 tax on ICE vehicles. It would bring prices in line with EV counterparts but doesn't outright ban ICE.
