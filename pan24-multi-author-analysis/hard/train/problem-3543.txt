"If you want to understand what Russia has done here, come to Ukraine and you will see it with your own eyes. After that, you will tell us how to end this war, who started it and when we can end it," Zelenskyy said.
Only 25% are in favour of continuing the war, whilst 55% want peace talks, a massive change in comparison with July.
“We are discussing with the management of Ukrenergo the placement of three power plant ships with a total capacity of 300 megawatts near Odesa.".
Re. "Russia launches 'empty' missiles to wear out Ukrainian air defense" I can imagine this may prove useful to throw decoys into the bunch to increase the probability missiles with legitimate warheads get through, but... Warhead aside, the actual missiles themselves can't be cheap. Considering Russia's economy is in shambles while there is no sign of the world's funding of Ukraine not subsiding — I can't imagine this could possibly yield a net-positive for Russia, economically-speaking.
Problematic for sure, but of course this is still Russian depletion too - and Ukraine has fantastic supplies for replenishment, whereas Russia has a sanctions-squeezed military industrial complex and buggered supply lines.
