If they just leave and accept the ultimate defeat, every ounce of leverage they have is gone and things actually get even worse.
That would make things quite complicated for him all over the world, people are just having a tough time understanding that concept.
Of course it would be complicated. You can't just annex a country where people have expectations of democracy. If they remain under subjugation, they will resist. If you grant them democracy, they will want independence. If you exterminate them, you run into a host of problems, not least the moral resistance of your own forces. The people won't just forget that you bombed their hospitals and schools.
Sponsoring a coup would have worked. But an invasion just seems unwinnable, even if Russia won every battle.
And his forces are weak and demoralized. People have fled by the hundreds of thousands to avoid conscription. I think a credible narrative of righteousness is important for troop morale. Russian propaganda is not that great. It's heavy handed and obvious. Compare that to Iraq 2002, the propaganda on Americans was very effective.
