Because he won. That's all that matters to the GOP. Honesty and integrity obviously don't and haven't for quite some time. Why are we surprised by this??
Meh. I don’t think so. It sets a precedent and Republicans have bent over backwards to do literally the opposite whenever possible. If a “friendly” Republican was more palatable, there would be no Margarine Taylor Greene or Lauren Boebert. Neither are particularly friendly to McCarthy and cause him more trouble than he’d like. Hell, the same could be said for any of the “Freedom” caucus that have been implicated in the January 6th investigations.
They can’t comment on it because the erosion of objective truth is their end goal. There’s a reason the Republicans are so aligned with Russia and a good chunk of that is their admiration for Putin’s internal propaganda and disinformation campaigns.
There is no “good” Republican as it is impossible to be a member of the party and not, in some way, support the attacks on democracy and objective reality.
