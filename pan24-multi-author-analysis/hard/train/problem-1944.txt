Yet voters are so convinced they are harmless, they vote GOP without any concern that the government they take for granted will persist. Yet we are so dangerously close to Fascism under GOP rule, where the 'action' they'll need to perform for their base is harming marginalized groups.
This is the thing most people don't understand, the GOP has painted itself in a corner by the Dems going to far to the right to meet them, that their only political message is, as you say.
The shittiest people seem to filter to the front of the line in the GOP, then trick enablers into thinking they're incredibly smart and slick and dynamic.
This New Yorker article from the summer predicted it's going to be a bloodbath between him and Trump if he runs for President. Also, his college baseball teammates say he's a huge a-hole. If guys you hung out with, threw a ball around with, dipped and chewed gum with hate you, that is saying a lot. It's pretty easy not to hate a guy you sit around with mainlining nicotine and scratching your balls.
When your college baseball teammates tell The New Yorker that you were an asshole, well, that is saying something.
He's a meathead baseball player who married a television news arm candy woman, nothing cultured or intellectual about the guy. Plenty of book smart people are also assholes.
