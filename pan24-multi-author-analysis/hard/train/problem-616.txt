Yes agreed. They are essentially the SS from Nazi Germany in the sense that they are a parallel organization to the army deliberately put in place by their dictator to keep the army in check.
There is historical precedent for this in Russia itself with the NKVD divisions in World War II, and elsewhere - the SS on the other side of the same conflict were set up to give Hitler armed forces outside the normal military hierarchy which he distrusted.
Wagner is already under his control - technically the whole thing is illegal under Russian law which means he can prosecute its leaders at any time. The reason this power struggle is happening isn't because Wagner threatens Putin, but because its competing for resources with the military.
It's a power struggle between the Russian military and Wagner, vying for resources and fame. Wagner was winning when the Russian military couldn't. Now the Russian military is starving Wagner to curtail all supplies and glory for themselves.
Of course Wagner is not a true private military group and is just another arm of the Russian state but that is the pretence they are trying to keep up.
Or private militaries apparently. A private military should not need to rely on a national one for its logistics, it defeats the entire point.
