"LGBTQ people need to stop being themselves and hide from society to protect our children from their pedophilia! But not my gay nephew Alex, he has a big heart and would never practice pedophilia.".
Well said, it's the same kind of thought process for all the hypocritical positions Conservatives take:
Anyway, what I meant was that conservatives seem to have a thing where the signifiers of politics are the politics. If you wear a certain hat, dress a certain way, then you're probably on that "team.".
Yeah this is the funniest response I see online - "aren't you guys supposed to be into this?" as if they've caught the left being hypocrites, because they don't understand that signifiers and signified are separate things.
They seem to think that if left politics are pro drag queens reading to kids that the left must be pro any person in drag doing any thing, because visually they look the same.
The reason to care about the Drag is he actively aligns him self with a party that attacks drag shows and trans people regularly. It's hypocrisy not the actual drag that is upsetting.
