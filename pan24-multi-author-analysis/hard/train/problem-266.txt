Yeah, I mean, as long as I’m not responsible and I don’t have to personally do anything, I’m weirdly ok with it. I’ll be dead before it gets too much worse, so why worry?
Politicians are all making money and in bed with some business or another. Even if it seems like a positive change, there’s always ulterior motives that are making someone rich. Everything is a compromise.
It’s more about giving the poor scientists recognition for their research. Just pretend that we care so they feel like their work is worth it. Maybe one day they’ll use their skill to do something to help mankind instead of just researching temperatures and comparing them. But if they get discouraged from doing science because we all don’t care about their “alarms” they’ll never do something useful. So just pretend to care. We don’t have to make any changes; it’s too late. Just pretend to care. For the scientists.
When are scientists not raising an alarm?? Not that this isn’t an issue, but my entire life I’ve been reading headlines like this and it doesn’t seem to have changed anything.
