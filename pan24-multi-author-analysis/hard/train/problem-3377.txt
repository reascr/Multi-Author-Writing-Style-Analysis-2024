The idea that the police fought this and will probably appeal it tells you all you need to know about this department's mentality.
I understand what you are saying but I feel like if there were as many as you claim there to be we would see changes happening more quickly rather than at a snails pace. If a majority of police officers wanted police accountability then they would be in a position of power and could use their majority to enact change. It is nice to see that they have started to charge police officers when they finally kill someone with their brutality. I wish more steps were taken to identify problem officers who have multiple reports against them.
In this context the police is the department, or more specifically those who chose to fight this rather than acquiesce. I tried to make that clear when I said "this department's mentality.".
Good. Half the battle in a wrongful or improper traffic stop is an evidentiary matter. For the people who cry, don’t argue save it for court. There needs to be evidence to allow a trier of fact to understand the events or else it’s just a civilian’s testimony against law enforcements.
