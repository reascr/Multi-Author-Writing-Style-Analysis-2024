There is so much time off and away from Washinon for legislators. She can work her vacation in on those periods of time off. That would of course cut into her fundraising junkets.
Yeah no. I have zero sympathy for her. Especially when she is anti worker and anti family. To say nothing of her opinion about citizens of Central American countries like Costa Rica.
Yes - Costa Rica is amazing, but theres a dark side that many people dont see until you have an extended stay. My mother has lived there for a while, and so has a good friend and his partner. All three of them have had violent home invasions. My mother was tied up and held at gunpoint. Theres a reason why metal bars over the windows are the standard construction method. Yeah its an amazing place - lets not get too carried away though, the crime and violence is on another level.
Also - infrastructure modern?? Lol cmon man theres barely roads in many places, theres no address system - you cant even get a package delivered from the US without going through a lot of trouble.
Just had to say something as I love CR a lot but dont like seeing people get so weirdly hyperbolic about it.
