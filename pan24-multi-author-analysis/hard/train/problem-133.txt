It’s not a loan from North Korea, it’s from a SOUTH KOREAN conglomerate (weapons and ship/car company) that was given permission from both countries to work in North Korea. While I still think this should have been disclosed this article is extremely misleading in saying Trump got a loan.
I think the fact that he hid this loan for his reporting before taking over the white house is the bigger scandal than who the loan was with imo. I'm not sure how much leverage Kim can have over a company that has only "ties" to the country and is based in SK. And as such how directly this loan connects to NK.
While I'm ready to see trump in jail over this (and the many other revelations soon to be discovered from his taxes), the company was Daewoo and their ties to NK are just that they were the only company allowed to do business in NK in the 90s.
Dude, the company is Daewoo, a SOUTH KOREAN company who’s only links to NK is that they were once the only allowed private company to operate for a brief period in NK in the 90s. This is such a reach it’s ridiculous. Fucking morons.
