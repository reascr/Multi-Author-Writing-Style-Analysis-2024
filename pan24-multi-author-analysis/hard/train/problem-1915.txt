There likely is not the political will there to do such a thing (if Moldova were able to agree to it...which seems unlikely since there are enough Russian coalition assets there that would do everything in Moscow's power to stop it).
I'm really sorry for Moldova, they are in a very particular situation... Russia's at their doorstep, not in EU, not in NATO, not a big army, not rich country, can't have foreign military on their soil by constitution, basically a perfect prey.
in the hypothetical scenario where NATO, at the request of Moldova, mobilizes to protect Moldova's territory. Would russia respond to it as tho it is an act of war and also mobilize ?
A country can consider whatever they want as an act of war. The problem is the response. Even tho you know it's a bluff, what if russia uses their nuclear card?
Russia knows the consequences to the nuclear card very well and they won't use it only if mainland Russia is threatened. NATO would mobilize instantly and you wouldn't see or hear much from Russia's military in or out of Russia. They'd be fucked beyond comprehension.
