Maybe they shouldn’t have played that card because once that’s the established narrative for domestic propaganda, there’s really no reason for NATO countries not to just send a shit ton of weapons.
For me, if NATO just reversed what they said, it just forces Russia to end their narrative, as they would therefore be accusing their own allies of being involved in the war too, which is something they wouldn't want.
But it does serve to underscore the original point: if the USA entered the Ukraine war for real it would flatten Russia's military precisely due to these alliances and logistics.
If the west supplying equipment and machinery to Ukraine is direct involvement resulting in Russia fighting NATO.
"The west is prolonging the war by providing weapons, more people are dying because of the west and NATO is risking nuclear war by helping Ukraine.".
They create an argument, a dialogue or doubt where there shouldn't be any and the more it gets talked about, the more relevant it somehow becomes, until even sensible people are starting to debate the nuances of something which has none.
