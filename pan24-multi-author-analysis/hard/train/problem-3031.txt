Can someone explain to me what someone in Iran is expecting from people in the West? We have absolutely 0 sway in what happens in Iran. That country is one of the most heavily sanctioned and isolated in the world. It's allies are most non-government terrorist groups and fellow pariah countries that couldnt care less. What is the expectation here?
The nuclear issue is frankly quite separate, and the mention of it is precisely why the less involved we are the better for the Iranian. Starlink satellites are not covert and don't move the needle much in terms of western interference. Propaganda news much less so. Ah well, agree to disagree.
I just don't agree. As I said, neither helping Iranian dissidents get uncensored Internet nor providing Farsi-language news with an American slant can be termed "keeping your hands clean," yet both are valuable and frankly relatively innocuous services. Same with "keeping your hands clean" while Iran gets nukes. The US should absolutely try to do what it can short of bombing Natanz to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, even though unfortunately that seems an inevitability now. Even believing as I do that Iran primarily wants the bomb to defend itself and prevent other countries interfering in its military operations, not trying to stop another notoriously unstable country in a volatile region with a history of genocidal rhetoric towards Israel and an extremely hawkish and regionally powerful military from getting a nuke, knowing it going nuclear will set off a nuclear arms race with Saudi Arabia, would be extremely misguided.
