Let's completely ignore the fact that Germany decimated political activists, intellectuals (including teachers), and all other things that stimulated progress in society, not to mention that they and the Red Army significantly reduced the population and eliminated cultures that helped bring diversity to Poland. All of this followed by 40 years of oppression and...you're surprised about the way things are today? And this is just during/after WWII, not to mention the devastation that the Triple Partition brought to the Polish population (i.e., lots of people from the other Empires moved around - including to what is now Poland today - and they weren't exactly the most inclusive folks).
I'm gay, I spent a lot of time this past summer in Poland with my wife who has a dark complexion, and neither one of us had issues. The Polish government on the other hand is a piece of shit and not at all representative of the population.
Oh, by the way Kowalski and Warcho≈Ç belong to the bunch of dumbest, most reactionary and disliked politicians in Poland. About half of the society laughs at them and almost all of their tweets are turned into memes at this point - just so you know, that posting their tweets is about as non-representative of the public opinion as it gets.
