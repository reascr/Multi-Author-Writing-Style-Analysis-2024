The same borders which did not include an independent Palestine, yes, kind of. Those were the ceasefire lines from the war, not the designated boundaries from the 1940s. It's complicated. Gaza and the West Bank were a part of Egypt and Jordan, respectively.
There were no borders of Palestine in 1967. Does he want Egypt to give the Sinai to a new Palestine? Does he want to give the West Bank back to Jordan, because they had it before the 1967 war?
I wouldnt say Palestinian people in general agree it. If you ask Palestinians in the West bank most of them will say they only agree to peace if there isnt an Israel anymore.
Just noting that isreal agreed to the 1967 border lines a few times in its past in the name of peace, and has always been rejected by the palestinians or the surrounding countries.
Israel also offered the golan heights to syria for peace treaty along with the west bank and gaza and even agreed to cut Jerusalem again for the palestinians at one time.
Syria always canceled or declined at the last minute, and with changes to isreal government and after the second intifada and syria pretty transparently supported hezbollah, it kinda killed any more talks.
