Very good point. Russia's posturing, complaints, and actions seem to be done with the distorted view that they will prevent a scenario that is guaranteed if Russia uses nukes.
Direct conflict isnâ€™t really an option due to MAD, but in countries that are not nuclear powers, all of the major superpowers are involved.
The reason for this is that there has to be a response to any nation using nuclear weapons, or else others will use them in future conflicts. And since any response from NATO attacking Russia could include them launching the nukes, it is possible that the US might try a decapitation strike to prevent that. The threat of mutually assured destruction has prevented nuclear exchange so far, so hopefully the threat is still enough this time. But with Putin facing death if he doesn't use them, he could gamble that NATO won't risk missiles flying.
A full NATO response could be anything from a full economic embargo to direct military action. Russia has already shown that its air defenses are all but useless with the drone attacks on their airbase recently. Direct military action could include a full nuclear strike on Russia as well, though unlikely.
Russia will not use nuclear weapons unless they are faced with an existential threat. They have full control on when hostilities cease and thus have no cause or basis for their use. Indeed, their use would manifest the very existential threat they seek to avoid.
This is a professional doing their job to prevent military escalation. Europe is walking the middle ground between a loss of Ukraine to a corrupt mafia state and full European military engagement. As Russia gets closer to capitulation, they could try to drag Europe down with them, making Stoltenberg's role all that more critical.
