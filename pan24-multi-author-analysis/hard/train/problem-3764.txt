I agree 100%, but there's always an armchair general who pops in to say "Nukes have an expiration date and require a lot of complicated maintenance. Do you really think their nukes still work when they can't outfit a proper infantry unit?".
Wow. You are really underestimating the complexity of the problem. Our patriot batteries aren’t even 100% against current missiles. And they are the envy of the world. They are a combination of multiple satellites, ground stations… they are complex and require highly trained personnel. Faster missile less time to react, harder to track, harder to hit. I don’t know how to explain that more simply, and I don’t think it should be that hard of a concept to grasp. No one is claiming these things are unstoppable, just much harder to stop.
You can plot an intercept course, but are you fast enough to catch the missile? Is it easier to hit a target that is going 20MPH or 60MPH? Why would a faster baseball be harder to hit for the batter?
A very fast baseball is harder to hit for a human. A camera, computer and robotic arm can hit every baseball every time no matter how slow or fast.
If you are 100 miles away driving on a highway at a constant rate of 100 miles per hour, I know exactly where you will be at any instant so I can intercept you even in a vehicle traveling just 10 miles per hour.
