I'm in the "organized religion is almost always bad" camp. Lots of people use it as an excuse to hate others. But more importantly to me, if your morality is "be nice because God said so" and not "be nice because duh", then you're a shitty person and no amount of religion is going to change that. Just be a decent person because it's the decent and simple thing to do.
Religion doesn't "make" anyone do anything, but it can certainly be a convenient excuse for doing nearly anything. I much prefer "other people are just like you, so treat them like you want them to treat you.".
. He spews kremlin bullshit about NATO and Ukraine instigating the war and that the poor russians had no choice but to murder and torture civilians by the thousands.
He also tried to white-wash a famous for calling for the destruction of Ukraine and the purging of its citizens.
On a less direct note, that softly implied that Ukraine should consider forfeiting its territories to Putin.
Would have been more genuine if he didn't parrot russian propaganda during the first months of the invasion and put the blame on Ukraine. This is little more than a PR stunt.
