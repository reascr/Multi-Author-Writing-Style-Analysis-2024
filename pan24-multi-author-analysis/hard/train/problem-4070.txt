There are very few democrats anywhere in Boise, even the North End is fricken Maga crazy. And as you go into the foothills it gets even worse. Anyone with even a little bit of money in Boise is a staunch republican. It’s pretty crazy.
It’s completely insane to me! My aunt and uncle have lived in Boise since 1992. I’ve been visiting here regularly my whole life. I keep forgetting that as progressive as the capital is, the rest of the state is still very MAGA minded. Guess Idaho is joining the South in their anti-women agenda.
I am in Boise right now and feel like they should definitely be on the FBI watch list. I literally felt like I was reading propaganda for the 4th Reich. It’s fucking terrifying you can “report a CRT incident” for them to investigate. As nice as it was that the President bantered with Republicans last night, they have shown us who they are. WE NEED TO BELIEVE THEM!
I guess I’ve not run into many of them just because my aunt and the friends of hers she’s introduced me to over the years are all super liberal. The social circle her and my uncle in are blue as you can get as well as the business he works with in the nonprofit sector are also very liberal. So I just haven’t spent as much time outside that group to meet the crazies.
