Jeffries won a plurality of votes on the first ballot, as all 212 House Democrats in attendance voted for him, while 203 Republicans voted for McCarthy. The other 19 GOP votes were split between McCarthy, Biggs, and other Republicans.
McCarthy faced a challenge from far-right former House Freedom Caucus chair Andy Biggs as well as Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.
Seven years after he was first poised to become Speaker, and four since he became the Republican floor leader, it appears Kevin McCarthy still does not know how to count votes.
The best part about this is the Insurrection Caucus members are totally seeing through this blatant vote-buying from McCarthy with a healthy dose of skepticism.
'Oh really? You're able to give all of us ALL the committee assignments we all want? You'll understand if we don't believe you, so we're going to need some insurance that allows us to tie up business if you end up trying to fuck us over.'.
True. But I really don't know who else in the republican party, that is actually qualified, would really want the job right now given how in disarray the party is. It seems like a good way to end one's political career come the next election. I'm not even sure if McCarthy could have managed it if there had been a red wave, but he's wanted the position for a long while now, so I guess he felt this was his chance, with no consideration of if he could do the job.
