Now for the topic at hand, I would agree that it remains to be seen if the mayor of the main hosting city can influence the IOC in any meaningful way, though it does sets the tone.
She still got a 6.5 points lead on her rival Rachida Dati, and that's in terms of direct popular vote. You can say she is hated by the people all you want, it will not make it true.
Yes, I am aware of that particularity. She, like previous Paris mayors, has been elected through representatives...who were themselves elected by direct popular vote. The city of Paris is a democracy.
Am a Parisian, can confirm. Paris mostly likes Anne Hidalgo. The majority of people who don't like her are specifically rich Parisians and people who live in the suburbs of Paris (who are typically not rich, just to show that it's not necessarily one socioeconomic group). But people in the suburbs don't get to vote for the mayor (if they did, it's possible she would not win).
To give some context: that mayor can't do a thing about, and certainly will not even if she could. She's simply a power-hungry neoliberal who tries everything to get some attention because she wants more power. The only reason why she's saying is to increase her popularity by saying something popular and not controversial. In 2022, she tried to become president but got less than 2% of the votes despite representing the party that ruled from 2012 to 2017. She's absolutely hated outside of Paris intra muros and this is only an attempt by her to change this but she's completely delusional about her chances.
