Gotta look at the details. The majority also favored a private healthcare system. What people want is for the government to provide healthcare to other people; they don't want to commit to a single payer system where they lose their perks. Of course, a government system that only provides healthcare to the poor, sick, and elderly is bound to fail.
Because for healthcare to work, you need to have the young and healthy paying into the pot. Someone else here said "well the government can just cover the loses," which is true, but at that point the government is subsidizing private insurance by spending trillions a year to cover the unprofitable parts of the population while letting private insurance cover all the profitable people.
Third, reducing the funding that the health insurance companies have to lobby against universal healthcare could help in the long run, not that the cat isn't completely out of the bag in terms of the American public being robbed, enslaved, gaslit, and socially murdered without recourse by our abusive, financially diversified ruling kleptocrat class.
What the majority of commenters don't realize is the definition of "universal healthcare" in this context is the government ensuring everyone has health insurance to get care. And the rest of the data behind the headline shows most Americans still prefer the private system we have over a public one. Meaning the universal healthcare supported by the survey is the current public+private hybrid system we have now.
Plenty of candidates are there for some form of universal healthcare (just not the unpopular idea of single payer in particular).
Health insurance companies use a fraction of the premiums we pay them to lobby against universal healthcare that would save us tens to hundreds of thousands of lives and half a trillion dollars every year.
