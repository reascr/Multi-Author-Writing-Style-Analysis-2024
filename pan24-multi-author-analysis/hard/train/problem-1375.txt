I see, sorry I didn't consider your personal story, also thank you for sharing, and I wish you had better help available. I do think US veterans have it much much better, even if not enough and not as much as you deserve.
Edit: And yes Russians do kill some soldiers when they are exchanged in PoW swap, as famously one was executed with a hammer and posted in the media as an example.
Maybe if Russia occassionally used flanking manuevers or something, rather than sending ten frontal assault waves until Germans ran out of bullets, they'd have millions of more men alive. Are you aware that when it came to Poland, Russia was proud to work with the Nazi's to murder and deport people? It's like Russians literally had to be forced at gunpoint by the Nazi's to fight the Nazi's.
Are you aware the Russians were primarily responsible for defeating Nazi Germany? They suffered enormous casualties, but it did work in WW2. Times are different though, and that mentality is not going to work in high tech warfare.
