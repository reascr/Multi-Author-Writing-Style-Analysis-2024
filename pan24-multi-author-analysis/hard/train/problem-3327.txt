What? You mean the timeline of: Russia annexes Crimea in 2014, Trump runs in 2015 and wins, starts fucking with Ukraine's gov. by threatening to withhold aid and getting impeached over it, the whole trump tower moscow thing, and praising Putin, Xi, and Un, threatening to pull out of NATO, and generally being a twat trying to stay in power illegally until finally getting the boot in 2021, prompting the Russians to have to rethink their angle of attack raises your suspicions?
The point I was making is that the warmongering mentality isn't unique to Putin but that there are many people in positions of power who would try to continue or even try to escalate the war further.
I don't doubt that Putin would like to attack America, but he can want to do something all he wants, if he isn't able to it doesn't matter what he wants.
In an attack that happened because they were angry at prior U.S. military intervention in the middle east. Which is why being an interventionist force makes us less safe, not more.
Considering our involvement in WW2 led to hundreds of thousands of American deaths, and the aftermath led to us establishing ourselves as the world police and creating an American hegemony, I'd say we'd have been better off. There was no way Hitler was going to win the war, even without American intervention. He never would have been able to conquer the Soviet Union, and Hitler would have thrown every single German citizen at the Soviet Union if he had to, because he vehemently hated Communism, he would have exhausted himself attempting to destroy them.
