She is a creation of a society where a huge percentage don't have a passport, don't understand other cultures, and have never been invaded or had the threat of invasion. They may have been attacked, but it was people like her screamed appeasement and isolationism as a policy to the Third Reich. Would the US be the dominant superpower now if they had followed her policies in 1940.
I didn't say I didn't know how the second amendment could be changed. It's just ironic that children are way way statistically safer at their schools growing up in a "Pariah State". Purely an observation.
Let's not forget that we even have countries in Nato, who are actually in dispute over a similar situation to Ukraine/Russia who are treaty obligated to protect each other, but hate each other.
And assume Russia will respond to western military alliance/presence in Ukraine the same way we'd respect Mexico's sovereign right to invite Russia in next door to us if they decided to (you know darn well we would stop it at all costs). If you refuse to look at it from the enemy's perspective and offer them an outcome we would accept in their shoes, you are seeking war, not peace.
