Her restaurant was so fucking stupid. I went there at the behest of an ex and was served by none other than Mama Boebert, future January 6, 2021 insurrectionist and mother to Lauren Opal Boebert. She was...quite unpleasant. The restaurant was dingy and vaguely sticky, like an old diner. The decor was a combination of cowboy guns and Hobby Lobby shit. The food was mediocre pub fare. My ex excitedly asked one of the people with us what he thought when we left. He was Russian. He paused for a second, then said "it was...violently American.".
I.e.: The January 6th commission having to wrap things up before the next Congressional session is fallout part 1 of electing her over a Democrat.
It makes sense when you're talking about politics at a federal level because having a political majority of federal level will guarantee that your party will make policy even if your direct representative can't tell the difference between a horse and a fence post.
Yes but more deeply because they want a red congress not a blue Congress. They're willing to take morons over losing the majority.
