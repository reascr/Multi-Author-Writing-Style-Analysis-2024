Nowadays, to have any sort of meaningful wealth in Russia you need to be a creature of the state. Half your assets are considered state property. (If not Putin’s himself, although I’m not sure he sees much of a difference.) You act in its interests and it tells you what it expects of you, and dipping a toe into Russian politics is entirely off limits unless you’re directed to.
People still have outdated views on the oligarchy as if it was shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when it did indeed hold much political power, but that isn’t really the case anymore as you said.
With Russia's economy controlled by oligarchs, all of whom are effectively Putin's capos, there isn't any viable political opposition that can emerge short of a popular revolution or the death/assassination of the boss.
It’s right to target and sanction wealthy oligarchs but don’t expect that to have any effect on Putins hold over Russia.
Don't do anything for the heads of state or Russian oligarchs but incentivise the average people to simply leave. Psychological impact of that as well, offer to bail out the people so Putin doesn't have the manpower to throw into the meat grinder.
I am the opinion we should do the exact opposite. Offer automatic work visas for anyone who applies maybe as extreme as a relocation stipend to leave Russia. It would cut down on their workforce and deplete their recruitment numbers.
What is some average Joe immigrant from Russia going to do? Feed back information to Putin on where their nearest McDonald's is or when the next townhall meeting is taking place? Because that's about all they'd be able to do. I'm not worried.
