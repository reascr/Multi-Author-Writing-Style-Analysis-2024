Republicans would've been worse, but in the context of a pro labor president, he sided against them. These are just facts.
I don't think McConnell's corporate overlords would be pleased with destroying the biggest holiday of the year over 7 unpaid sick days. My personal take is that Biden wasn't having his arm twisted by republicans, they agreed.
Biden didn't fuck over rail workers, their union negotiators did that. Biden weighed 115,000 jobs against 750,000 jobs and the health risks of over 100 million people and told Congress they should help as many people as they could. The House of Representatives did what they could. They passed the original deal with a second bill that would amend the deal immediately upon passage that would grant the sick days the unions wanted. The Senate passed the original deal, but it failed to break the filibuster on the sick leave bill in a 52-43 vote. The options Biden had were to veto the original deal (which passed 80-15, so a veto would have been entirely symbolic and cost Biden political capital he doesn't have) or sign it to make it law.
