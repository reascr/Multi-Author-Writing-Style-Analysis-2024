In the states it’s mostly NIAC but they have a fair amount of influence in Canada and parts of Europe even though their govts don’t get along on paper.
The Hong Kong protests were pretty much doomed from the start considering they had the entire mainland stacked against them. The Iran protests are nationwide and nothing the government’s tried so far has rly been able to stop or even contain them.
The guy directly below this comment talking about how this movement has supposedly been “squashed” when Iran literally saw a resurgence in protest activity today?
I think, in part, the Administration is trying to distance itself as much as possible from the protests so the Iranian government doesn't have more material to claim "the US is attempting another coup See Shah Biden said 'Iran?'" Mossad and the CIA are certainly embedded in Iran and involved in some way, but it's obvious that the CIA (and US as an extension) can't openly involve themselves.
I think it's safe to assume that the CIA, MI5, and Mossad are present in Iran, I wonder what they're up to? As much as I'd love to see regime change it would be counter-productive to stage another coup directly. Iranians need to claim this win themselves in order for it to be legitimate. But they could really use some help, and I really wish The West could give a lot more attention to it, and whatever support is right for the circumstances. The US and Iran had a great relationship up until the British convinced us to stage the coup, and I'd love for that to be restored along with the Democracy they once had.
It would be so amazing for Iran to return to the Democracy it pursued before the coup. I'd love to see the great relationship that existed between the US and Iran pre-coup return.
