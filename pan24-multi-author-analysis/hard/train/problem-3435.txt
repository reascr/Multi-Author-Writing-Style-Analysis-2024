A kid in Missouri can't drive a car but they can carry a loaded AR-15 around in public? Without any kind of permit or license? Do they even need parental permission to buy a gun?
The parents would have to buy the gun for the child. Doesn’t really matter though as you need to be 18 to purchase ammunition. The real purpose of children being allowed to carry a rifle is for hunting purposes in rural areas. The city of St. Louis is unfortunately caught between a rock and a hard place in this argument.
I’ve got no real issue with 16-17 year olds hunting by themselves. Sometimes, in rural places, it’s a necessary food source and parents have jobs. A 14-15 year old with an a ar15 is a whole different thing. Unfortunately there isn’t really a legal distinction between the two. That is the dumb part.
This article makes is seem as though police officers would be powerless to do anything about a child openly carrying a rifle. Would it not still fall within the scope of reasonable suspicion for any officer to stop and question a child with a rifle? At the very least it is reasonable to suspect that one of two things could be amiss. Either a crime has just been committed in the area, or the rifle is stolen, since children can’t buy rifles. It would be perfectly reasonable then for the police officer to call the child’s parents. If any person is going to walk around with a rifle they should be prepared to answer a few questions if stopped by the police. Including, who are you? Where are you coming from? Where are you going? And why do you have a rifle?
