Isnt that exactly what the IOC did some years back ? I was under the impression that Russian athletes were only allowed to compete as independents,was this rule removed ?
Also on another note the russian state promotes and enables their athletes to use doping in all international competitions...
How is making it easier for Russian athletes to represent countries other than Russia pandering to Russia. It does the opposite. Unless your a reddit neckbeard who thinks Russian athletes are personally responsible for the invasion of ukraine.
Of course the average Russian gets the blame as well, they are collectively identified as the invader, innocent or not. Comes with the perks of invading a country as a collective.
You just explained radicalization, and objectively speaking they would hate ISIS. A member of ISIS is not a Muslim, but a fanatic. They would hate the organization, not the religion, what if they were followers of islam themselves?
Does it make it right? To a certain extent, if it leads to actual victimization(harm, apartheid) that's different.
So yeah, if a country invaded your country this second, and a loved one died due actions of said country.
