A person who believed their mail-in ballot might have been lost or destroyed or late could vote by provisional ballot in person, but they need to specifically use a provisional ballot so the elections board knows to look for their mail-in ballot and only count one. And of course they can only vote in one place.
Widely and immediately condemned by elections officials everywhere because of the probability of misunderstanding.
You have to go a couple of articles further to figure out how this guy, and the other named defendants and uncharged persons, managed to vote twice.
But I nia very interesting to keep seeing these arrests of people who voted twice or who voted with a dead spouse's info are seemingly on one side... But this is part of the conspiracy too I'm sure.
That was one of my favorite conspiracy theories. Apparently, Hillary was smart enough to be able to get 3 million illegal immigrants to vote, but was so stupid that she had them all vote in safe blue California instead of in swing states.
Get three million illegals to vote in safe Blue California > campaign in Michigan , Wisconsin , Pennsylvania.
