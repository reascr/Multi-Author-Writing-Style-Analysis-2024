I was going to say, shouldn’t Donald Trump be investigated for his involvement long before Republicans even think about Fauci?? Dude denied and lied to the public for months about the situation and continuously casted doubt upon his own federal agency’s actions. That damage is irrefutable.
I don’t understand what Republicans are trying to investigate Fauci for? He did his job? Everything was transparent on the end of the CDC within reason - once again, Trump eventually allowed states to just stop reporting COVID to the federal government and did not create a collaborative environment. Also, the fact that COVID-19 is still here and well nearly three years later is crazy. Yet Republicans are wondering if the one person who advocated for safety is to blame? Yeah, no.
Nope. He will be thanked for 50 years of public service by being pilloried in front of Republican committee panels treating him like a war criminal.
The fact Republicans maligned this man despite a lifetime of public service when he could have made 10x what he was making in the private sector is just a testament to how craven and dishonest they are.
It’s ridiculous that those morons are going to try to tarnish the legacy and career of one of the most decorated public health officials in modern American history.
What a disgrace. American education system has failed us and there are too many idiots who think their opinions and “research” should count for anything at all in the public square.
Lest we forget, this is what Don did at the beginning of this whole fiasco. This is just from February 2020:
He has read, conducted, published more peer-reviewed research than these morons could hope to collectively read (still less understand) in their entire lifetime. But sure, just because the traitor fake doctor, Rand Paul, said some stupid buzzwords, they believe they understand more about virology, infectious diseases, and population biology than the man who has been in the thick of it for the last fifty years.
