Why? The war started as a civil war when the Houthi Militia broke their agreements with the coalition government they were a part of and mobilized their soldiers. KSA only gets involved after the Houthi Militia, backed by Iran, overthrows the legitimate government and attacks KSA.
An Iranian controlled Yemeni state would present significant problems for the KSA's military as if Iran wanted to attack they could much more easily through Yemen.
If the Houthi’s win, Iran will cream their pants and put the entire region, not localized to Yemen, at much higher instability. Would you rather have Journalist-murdering Saudis or public executions for protestors Iran? Additionally, the Houthi’s are just as fucking guilty as the Saudis for starving the country. They are the entire reason Yemen is in a civil war in the first place.
That is not at all why KSA got involved in the civil war in Yemen. The war starts with the Iranian backed Houthi Militia withdrawing from the coalition government and attacking the military. KSA had treaties with the legitimate government and was drawn into the war. At this point the Houthi Militia have attacked KSA multiple times.
The Houthi Militia started the war. They steal most of the aid KSA lets through. They absolutely are responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of children. Their slogan is "Allah is Greater, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam". While there are no good guys fighting in this conflict the Houthi are the most responsible for the conflict having started it.
Can we all take a second to remember this was the Yemeni Civil War and that the Houthi Militia started it and they steal most of the aid? It seems like too many people just want yo blame the guys who got drawn into the war and do not include those that started the civil war. Everyone fighting in this is an asshole and we should not overlook the sides that started the war.
