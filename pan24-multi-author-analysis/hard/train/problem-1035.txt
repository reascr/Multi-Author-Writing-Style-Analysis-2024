Poland is the first country who claimed the missile was Russian. Still seems like the most obvious answer.
No, for enforcing the world order that does not allow for genocide -- which is what we are already dealing with. Your whole "all this war? for what?" is really misguided. We are already in this situation. And if things get out of control, it is squarely the fault of Russia who is constantly threatening to use nukes.
Russian state media constantly talks about striking NATO -- even hitting them first, nuking London etc. Don't you think this kind of belligerence will breed misunderstandings?
Also if Russia attacks Poland, it is not Ukraine's fault at all, in fact all of the blame for all of this belongs solely to Russia.
Uh, but Russia is responsible for the missile strike on Poland. If it was Ukrainian Air Defense missile that hit, they wouldn't have had to fire it if Russia wasn't bombing them.
Didn't they just say "Russian-made" and aren't many of the weapons that Ukraine is and has been using Russian-made?
NATO lying about the source doesn't make sense. Even if it was Russia that accidentally hit Poland, that doesn't force any action. Official response could be the same regardless.
