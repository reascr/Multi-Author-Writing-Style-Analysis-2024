Cannabis got the public on its side beginning with medicinal usage. Harder chemicals like heroin or cocaine would need to get the public on their side, I'm not aware of many medicinal usages that could be administered by the individual using. So, you'd have to convince the public another way.
States get away with legal cannabis because the federal government doesn't really care to enforce the illegality, (Do dispensary raids happen anymore?), But it's still federally illegal & the DEA could still crack down if they were so inclined.
States can also legalize or criminalize things. So, if you want weed legalized in your area, you need to look at your state government. Local elections generally mean more than federal when it comes to your everyday life.
Full decriminalization of it at the federal level requires congress. The steps Biden took were literally the first steps towards it and the first steps towards government funded research into it which is only a good thing.
A president does not have the ability to legalize or criminalize anything. That's the job of the legislative branch.
