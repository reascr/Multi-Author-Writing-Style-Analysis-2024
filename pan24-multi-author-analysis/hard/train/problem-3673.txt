So far as I understand it, their argument is quite literally that they're not attacking Ukraine. They're defending Russia. Just so happens that Russia is whatever they claim it is, and wherever they think enough Russians exist. So East Ukraine and Crimea (which just totally conveniently sits on huge oil and gas deposits, carry on) isn't actually Ukraine. Its Russia. And the evil Ukrainians were trying to kill them all.
From what I can tell, the Russian argument at the moment is straight up denying they want the "rest" of Ukraine. Its all presented them as defending Russian territory and Ukraine aggressing.
I'm all for Ukraine doing whatever it needs to do in order to reclaim it's rightful territory and beat the fuck out of Russia's military. Attacking their power grid sounds like great retaliation on paper, but it wouldn't be beneficial to Ukraine. There are other ways to fight back, potentially uniting the Russian people against you is not it. Sorry. Paint a broad brush somewhere else.
Youre making a very broad assumption based on one criticism I made. I'm not going to blindly sit here and suggest an abrasive and knee jerk reaction such as attack Russia's power grid.
Edit: and to add, Ukraine has absolutely made it a point not to attack civilian targets. Hence the impressive and effective method of attacking Russia's airbases. If you're going to sit here and say Ukraine is doing it all wrong and they need to start attacking civilian targets, then youre fucking insane.
Russia is going to collectively punish Ukrainian civilians whether or not Ukraine bombs Russia's airfields, so why the hell not?
...and shortly after Russian forces unleashed a massive missile barrage in Ukraine that struck homes and buildings and killed civilians.
Russia would have fired missiles regardless, so Kyiv may as well attack Russian air bases. They should attack more Russian air bases, and power infrastructure.
