It sounds like a right turn to me. If someone wants to die because of mental issues, getting themselves in front of medical professionals and having to go through a process of eliminating every option of treatment sounds better than the alternative.
I have always been in favor of voluntary euthanasia for chronic medical conditions but that this has gotten any level of support makes me seriously reconsider even supporting that.
Dementia patients should have access to euthanasia, however I can’t support that if it would eventually lead to killing other people that don’t have to die, which it seems is the case due to the support for euthanasia for depression.
Right now, it seems that some of the people choosing assisted death are doing so because they don’t have access to financially prohibitive alternatives.
People like you are why I can’t support euthanasia even for chronic illnesses which deserve to have it available. We’ll quickly slide into you nightmarish fantasy.
Insane to me that most people in this thread are supportive. If this had been offered to me 5 years ago I would be dead. I am now very happy with how things are going. I had been treatment resistant for 12 years in and out of treatment centers, so wouldn’t be surprised if I passed their requirements. I am sure there are many many people like me who would’ve taken the option at one point but are recoverable. We do not deserve to die due to these dystopian policies.
