The funny part is that kind of tactic may have worked in the old days when you fought eye to eye with your enemy, but nowadays their swarms of men.csn be taken out at range.
2) NATO responds with nukes, which is unlikely and then we all lose and no one is alive to claim who really won or lost.
NATO has already said the use of a tactical weapon would not generate a nuclear response from them. It would illicit a full conventional confrontation which they would then learn about what fighting NATO actually is.
The reason they say NATO and always say they are fighting NATO directly. Is to try and save face with their people. In their view it's incredibly embarrassing if Russia is losing to just Ukraine. Even Ukrain backed by NATO weapons is too embarrassing. It's why they have constantly said NATO is directly fighting and providing far more than weapons and Intel.
1) NATO responds conventionally which we now know would be incredibly one sided for NATO. NATO wins.
It's not just NATO. There's a bunch of non-NATO states sending support to Ukraine. We made the mistake of looking the other way in 2014. Very few people are on your side now because you've reminded us all why appeasement is a bad idea. You just don't know when to fucking stop, do you?
