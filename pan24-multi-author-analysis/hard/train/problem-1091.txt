The dictionary translation of war is indeed 戦争 (sensou), which are two kanjis that mean battle and conflict respectively. If a Japanese person were to say "war has begun", she would say "戦争が始まる". However, each individual kanji does have a meaning and sometimes it is totemic of that word, and 戦 (pronounced ikusa when used alone) is one of those kanji. Composite words that is associated with war will often have 戦 as a part of its component kanji. For example, a tank is a 戦車 (sensha, lit. war car or battle car); strategy is 戦略 (senryaku, lit. war abbreviation); battle is 戦闘 (sentou, lit. war duel); a naval battle is 海戦 (kaisen, lit. sea war). A Japanese speaker would innately understand that when used alone, the kanji 戦 means war.
Contextually, in Chinese and in Japanese, 戦 would be understood, on its own, to mean war. If someone came up to me and asked in English, what does 戦 mean, the closest concept in English is war.
It is cherry-picking to say 戦 means battle: this is not how the language works. 戦/戰 is a contextual word: it attaches the context of war into whatever this word is attached to. 内戦, C. Neizhan/J. Naisen), meaning civil war, is the word nei/nai meaning inside, attached to 戦, which gives the whole "word" the context of war.
I wish to second this take. Translating 戦 as "war" is exactly how any native speaker would understand it to be.
戦争 can be thought of almost as the formal word to use for war. I do not think anyone would see "戦" though and think of battle, fight, or match as in a game. 戦 immediately brings war to mind, contextually.
