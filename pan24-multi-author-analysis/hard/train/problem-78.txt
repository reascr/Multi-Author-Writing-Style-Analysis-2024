Ah, soft power in action. It's not loud and doesn't make idiots feel strong at home, but so much of the US's naval policy is to be without doing.
It's not that the US is there, but that it can be there. Such a public presence let's Russia know that the United States sits on Russia's border of naval influence and reminds Russia that the US can penetrate in with relative impunity.
The point of my comment was that if the US tried to get legalistic in attempting to cross warships into the Black Sea, Russia could try the same regardless of the argument's merits. They both should absolutely be denied.
Even if the US could go in, it probably would not be a good idea since any direct confrontation between the US and Russia is dangerous.
Technically nobody’s at war, so Russia could argue the same thing. Declaring war just isn’t done anymore. That being said, the US is definitely an ally of Ukraine.
The world -including Turkey- recognizes russia and ukraine are at war. This results in the same effect, regardless of if russia views it as a war or not. In fact since ukraine, a fighting party, has outright called it war with evidence to prove it is, that means russia is at war.
