Actually, the timing also kinda fits, because we are expecting weather to become much colder in the next couple of days, and the change is supposed to be very sudden. The temperature is hovering around -1c to +5c right now, but in just two days from now the forecast shows that it will go down to -17c, so the ground might finally harden and fighting will definitely accelerate when it happens.
The strikes on Russian bases and weapon/ammo warehouses seem to happen almost daily now, which is great to see. Most of them are happening in the occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia oblast, it might have something to do with the next planned offensive by our forces, which a lot of our officials have been openly talking about recently. I’m not sure why they are even talking about our planned offensives, I guess either you can’t hide it anyway, or they are trying to mislead Russia by talking about it, which also might be the case, it wouldn’t be the first time that it happens during this war.
"Russia no longer poses a military threat to the world, it's just a fiction, the only issue left is a nuclear arsenal and an uncontrolled regime that will make the whole world realize the need to denuclearize Russia.".
"Then we will see more liberation of territories and the task of the final defeat of the Russian Federation. This will happen throughout Ukraine from Crimea to Donbas," -he said.
This is how Ukraine did it. They bled and died and fought at Euromaiden, to kick Yanukovych out. Now they're still fighting.
