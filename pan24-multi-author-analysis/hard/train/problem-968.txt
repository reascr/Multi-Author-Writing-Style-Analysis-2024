That allows isreal to operate in syria. If russia sell their best anti-aircraft missiles to syria, it would potentially restrict isreal operations ability, which will create defense capability to isreal.
But not directly supporting ukraine with weapons, russia agreed not to provide isreal enemies with the latest weaponry.
The threat Russia imposes on Israel via Syria is the reason Israel is not supplying weapons to Ukraine.
Israel providing weapons to ukraine would be a huge escalation of the war, which would make it a middle eastern one as well.
Destroy that cooperation (by supplying Ukraine weapons to kill Russians) then Russo-Israeli war in Syria may erupt.
The russians siding with Iran on this would mean either mean direct fighting between Israel and russia, or Israel being forced to attack shipments in Lebanon itself (which means war with Hezbollah).
Iran (Israelâ€™s nemesis) is active in Syria which Israel wants to bomb, so they give heads up to Russian air defense as to not make misunderstandings.
