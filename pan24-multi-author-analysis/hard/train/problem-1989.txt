In the past when states do this they lose their delegates. This happened to Michigan and Florida in the 08 election. New Hampshire is far smaller than them.
What state would drag us left on economic issues? Maybe Colorado, which is likely to get a public option for health care. I’ve lived in blue states like California and it’s economic policies were pretty regressive (hence the fleeing of the middle class), maybe some New England state?
If the rationale is "minority state", deep-red South Carolina still loses in every racial demographic to purple Georgia or blue Maryland, and all the other states are blown away by deep-blue Hawaii.
If you're only trying to pick a state with a high percentage of black people, Maryland and Delaware have a higher black demographic, and are states that Democrats actually compete in. Georgia has a higher black demographic than S. Carolina and is more competitive for Democrats than S. Carolina is.
If this is the game we're playing, Colorado is still better at diversity than south fucking Carolina and can bring the country to a better place.
