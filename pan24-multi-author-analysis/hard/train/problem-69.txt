Everybody in the 60's 70's mouthed the love peace and flowers, money is the root of all evil stuff..... until they got some. The same people became the neoliberals. Their excuse? "We were mugged by reality man!".
Yep. Biden and Harris had a chance to take a step towards actual police reform and instead we got a watered down executive order and them wanting to reward law enforcement with even more funding while asking for no legitimate change in return.
Thoughts and prayers are nice. But talk is cheap. We want real reform. At this point it's a matter of public safety and ignoring it is just negligence. And it's pissing me off. Hollow words and half assed actions are fucking insulting.
Without accountability there's no repercussions for officers that refuse to adhere to training. And without raising the hiring standards you're just going to end up with more and more Derek Chauvins. Training alone can't fix this.
Biden & Harris think throwing money at the problem will solve it, but training has its limits. It's not magic. It can't fix a broken system.
