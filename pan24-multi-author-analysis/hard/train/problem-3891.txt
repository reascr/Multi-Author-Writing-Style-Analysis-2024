Or do you think they're corrupt, can't be trusted, and justice must be dealt out outside the bounds of law?
Second, sheriffs are elected officials, but they’re bound by the same laws as everyone else. They aren’t constitutional scholars and they don’t get to decide what is or isn’t constitutional. If think a law is unconstitutional they need to take it up with the elected officials who make the laws, or they need to go through the courts like anyone else.
If you believe a law is unconstitutional, as an elected official you have the sworn obligation not to enforce it. The onus is on the legislature to sue you to enforce it and prove it is constitutional.
They do have more authority when theyre UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION. They're elected officials that swore an oath to the Constitution. Use your head lmao its funny when anti gun tyrants think they have more authority than the Constitution.
Lmao its funny when all these anti gun tyrants are uneducated about this matter and hate guns. You do realize guns help save tens of thousands of girls from rape by bigger stronger men every year in the US alone right? And that includes your daughter, wife, and mother. It helps save tons of other people too. Plain and simple.
