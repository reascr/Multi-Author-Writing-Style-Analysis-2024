"Fight for $15" started in 2012. Eleven years later, the purchasing power of $15 in 2012 is equivalent to $19.39 in 2023.
I'm not sure how you can think someone making $10/hr in 2010 should have the same buying power as someone making $10/hr in 2023. Just in inflation alone you're talking +/-30% for those years. That's like telling someone , hey you should be able to survive on 30% less pay in 2023 than I did in 2010. It doesn't make any sense.
This has nothing to do with wage increases in Seattle and more to do with inflation over the years and you tying it to wage increases instead of reality.
What makes you think companies will just give up those profits if minimum wage is increased rather then charge the customer who now have more money even more.
The fact that minimum wage is not increased regularly makes is harder, because corporations are addicted to low wages. If it increased regularly, they would factor in the cost increase instead of throwing a tantrum about a massive coat increase where they threaten layoffs.
