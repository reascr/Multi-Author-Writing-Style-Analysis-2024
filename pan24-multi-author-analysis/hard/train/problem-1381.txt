The Bayraktar operators refused to send a drone out to see the damage, as weather conditions would require it to be low, exposing it. Neptune operators had to wait. They observed on radar that other ships immediately rushed. Later, that a tugboat left Crimea—bullseye.
> "There is no rosy picture regarding Avdiivka, Donetsk, Bakhmut; but there is nothing critically dire either. Despite the frost, the Armed Forces of Ukraine keeps Bakhmut in two sets of thermal clothing. We are engaged with the enemy infantry, which pointlessly marches forward and dies. Our anti-aircraft guns have worked relentlessly and repelled their efforts to accumulate manpower near Bakhmut. So, 150-200 less occupiers in the Bakhmut direction.".
Heh. Ukraine ran RUs nuclear bombers out of their bases with weapons made from monkey shit and sticks relative to modern hardware.
I have a question regarding these Patriot missile systems: it says it could take months to train the Ukrainians on how to use them. But at the same time I’ve seen people in here saying they’ve probably been training them in secret before announcing this. Is it likely these Patriot systems could be on the ground soon manned by the Ukrainians?
If i read correctly, there was some article about ukrainian troops completing their training soon at a german base. That would mean they started training months ago i suppose?
