"According to the Hindu outfit, students who believe in the Sanatan Hindu religion and culture are being forcefully asked to bring Christmas trees and dress up as Santa Claus.".
I'm not saying that it's true. But if it is true, that's coercion. As a follower of Christ, I'm completely against anyone being forced to participate in Christmas that doesn't want to.
As someone who doesn’t celebrate Christmas, i disagree with it being forced on anyone. I didn’t like my office asking me to put up Christmas stuff on my cubicle either. It has a secular meaning to a lot of people and that’s great, but it is still a holiday that not everyone celebrates, and since it’s associated with a particular religion, parents have the right to decide if their kid should dress as Santa.
If you’re a Christian family, sure, but my point is it’s totally legitimate to celebrate Christmas from a secular/non religious, even atheist stance.
Most of Western Europe is atheist/agnostic but we all celebrate Christmas as a cultural tradition and midwinter festival, more so than to celebrate Jesus.
But we are not celebrating midwinter - we celebrate CHRISTmas because we live in majority CHRISTian countries.
2) Christmas isn’t even a Christian festival, midwinter festivals have existed in cultures around the world well before Christianity as a way to uplift spirits during the depressing mid winter months. Christianity asserted that Jesus was born in December as a way to hijack what was already a time of festivities.
