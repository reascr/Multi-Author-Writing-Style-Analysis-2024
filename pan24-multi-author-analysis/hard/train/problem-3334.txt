Technically, yeah. The West is largely responsible for total, historical CO2 emissions (by virtue of being richest and first to have the new technology). So, technically yes.
That's true. By that point it's just "fucking cold as shit" and that's that. I hate going inside afterwards because my glasses fog up. And breathing in the warm air seems like it's burning the inside of your nose for a few minutes.
Jet streams (which do shift, they've not static), warm or cold fronts in other areas. Warm and cold fronts push each other around. And it can depend on if the cold/warm air is wet or dry.
Fun fact: Their coldest recorded temp was -71 C, back in 1924. Ok, maybe not a fun fact for them. I don't want to even imagine what that felt like. I've been in -35 C and that was unpleasant enough.
But to be fair, -62 C isn't insane for Siberia. Their average is already -50 C. This just happens to be the coldest in 20 years, which is a short period in terms of weather.
That’s -80.86 ° F. I live in Montana and so far this winter it’s gotten down to -42°F. I can’t even imagine twice as cold as that and most people can’t even imagine -42°F.
Always amazes me that people can live in such extreme cold. Like as of this post, it’s -51 F (-41 C) real temp, but “feels like” -67 F (-55 C).
