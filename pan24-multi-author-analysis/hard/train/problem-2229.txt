That’s exactly how you steal stuff. Slowly, take your time don’t rush, stay at the scene of the crime as long as you need to. Then strike and steal a razor-thin advantage on some of the races on ballots.
Right… but again, only on the specific races where they lost, not the entire ballot, because they won some races. Those races the GOP won, those weren’t stolen… just the ones where democrats won … from the same ballots.
But her election was totally cool...totally not stolen or fraudulent, but all the other ones that Republicans didn't were were stolen.. Even when a governor's race broke GOP and the Senate vote went Democrat like Nevada, or in her own state why the Governor got way more votes than Herschel Walker...clearly a complex system of switching who they really voted for....you know except in her race..
Pretty sure MTG would have been bounced out of the House and Dems wouldn't be facing an expensive runoff election in December if they could have switched the vote how they wanted it.
