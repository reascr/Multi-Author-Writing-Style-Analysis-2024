Tell me how many of those universities truly matter? Cause I am certain that the top 100-1000 universities contribute far more Papers than the rest of the 24000 that exist on Earth. The fact that much of this information is digitised means that it would be far easier to make this information accesible, Now I do aknowledge that you most certainly can't become a PhD Student without mentorship this I concede that Universities should still exist. But I do believe that the Monopoly of Scientific knowledge that Universities have should be broken.
We should find a replacement to the University system. Having a bunch of institutions have monopoly over scientific knowledge is dangerous, Because that means targeting of these institutions alone could cause damage to a nations scientific research.
It's not a "monopoly", it's not like institutions everywhere are clamouring to do science but can't because universities have locked it down; this is the edge of human knowledge, it's the edge of our capacities, we haven't anywhere else to do be doing it science outside of corporate labs.
It's not a monopoly you dolt it's a repository. Look, you can walk on to virtually any campus in the world and just go their libraries. Science is not a for-profit endeavour, though obviously being a capitalist society makes that complicated.
Do you have any idea how many universities we have, how digitized is basically all information, and how difficult it would be to achieve PhD-level expertise without long-term mentorship?
