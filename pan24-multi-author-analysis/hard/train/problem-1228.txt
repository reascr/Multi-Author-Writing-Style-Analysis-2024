Yep, I liked him in the primary. He was out by the time my state came around so I voted for Biden. As time has gone on I’ve started to dislike Yang, and don’t see that changing in the near future.
I liked what Yang said back in 2019-2020, but it just appears that he’s a grifter like so many others. Even looking at his history, he seems to have that sort of makeup.
Everything he does is a cash grab. Running this third party is no different, and the vote splitting is actually harmful to the party whose agenda he allegedly most closely aligns with.
He is creating a third party with agendas separate from the other two parties and he’s pushing rank choice voting, which eliminates the stranglehold of a two party system.
Not necessarily. Those safety nets are dependent on that person not working. If they get a job they no longer qualify. A UBI would encourage at least part time work to offset any discrepancy between what they are currently getting (which is not more than $1k for most adults receiving assistance) and increase their mental health as they are actively returning to the workforce.
Except it doesn’t if implemented properly. Nixon tried to do the same thing with the family assistance plan, which likely would have been instituted had he not Watergated himself.
Most safety net programs give less than $1k a month and it’s taken away if you work. A UBI would give people a ground floor to stand on and a chance to supplement that with their own income.
Not true. Look into what is getting VAT. It’s mostly big business transactions regular people don’t make.
