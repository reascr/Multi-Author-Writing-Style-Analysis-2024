I wonder how they will get passed the states that are trying to make it illegal to cross state lines to get an abortion.
How do you square this argument with the Texas abortion bounty system? It seems clear that the GOP is willing to pursue avenues that can be turned against them (as Newsom is attempting with the CA version of this law re: guns). That, to me, indicates some level of confidence that the court system will work to enforce the results they want and hinder the ones they do not.
That doesn't address the crux of my point though, which is that they do not seem overly concerned about employing tactics that their enemies can also employ; that speaks to their confidence in the courts to arbitrate in their favor.
If the law causes a chilling effect on abortion seekers, why would an identical gun-targeted law not cause a chilling effect on gun seekers?
There was already a case that was largely blocked because of standing issues, so it's working as intended: reduce abortions with an unenforcible law, but it keeps people scared enough to get the outcome you want.
Unless there is a federal law that bans abortions, or a vote in Congress that specifically bans abortions in the DoD, the DoD is still within it's rights as an organization to allow it's members to get abortions.
