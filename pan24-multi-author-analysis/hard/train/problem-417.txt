It’s the number in a Ukrainian tank battalion, per Biden, anyways. A US Combined Arms Battalion has three armored companies of 14 tanks each.
\60 western tanks might not sound like much, but that should probably be enough to outfit two whole combined arms brigades w/ mostly western equipment. (note: Ukraine currently has \15 mechanized + motor rifle brigades). Assuming that they spread out the abrams + leopards into 2 tank batallions of \31-32 tanks each – each of which can be attached to + provide support for an infantry brigade, whether in addition to other formations of Ukrainian tanks, or by themselves.
Damn, Zelensky needs to say "I ask my western friends for just one more battalion of tanks" and after they agree, he should reveal that the number of tanks in a Ukrainian tank battalion has been changed to a comically high number.
And 2 battalions should be enough to equip 2 full combined arms mechanized brigades, if I have my numbers right – and that's definitely enough to make a difference, wherever Ukraine decides to push next.
