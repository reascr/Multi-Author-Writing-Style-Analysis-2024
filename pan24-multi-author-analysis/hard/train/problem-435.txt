Corruption? Nazis? Looks like your swallowing those conservative talking points. Guess who else has corruption and Nazis? We do! And so does Russia. This isn't about Ukraine, this is about beating down Russia. Ukraine chose democracy in 2014 and has gone into the wests sphere of influence. Ignoring them now sends a message to the whole world, especially Europe, that the US is not your ally.
Sending aid to Ukraine has been the best thing to NATO in a long time. Lay off the geopolitics if you can't see the big picture. There is a east vs west split happening in the world, and we want Ukraine in the west.
Because they all involve giving Russia some of Ukraine territory. It just gives him time to re arm to take another bite of Ukraine in a year or two. They won't stop until Ukraine is completely under Russian control and it's "the ukraine" again. Then they'll go on to take another countey; they're already talking about taking Belarus next.
Lol if you think giving Russia Ukrainian territory would stop one fucking dollar from going to Raytheon. In fact, it would give them reason to send more money there, because "what about when Russia tries to take more of Ukraine?".
P.P.S. Arm the fuck out of Ukraine. France saved our ass against the British. We saved Frances ass against the Germans. Now all four of us will save Ukraines ass. Democracies stick together, otherwise Xi and Putin will eat our lunches.
Let it be known: IT TOOK DESANTIS FIVE DAYS TO MAKE A SINGLE COMMENT ABOUT PUTINâ€™s INVASION. This tool needs five days to figure out invading and murdering is bad?
