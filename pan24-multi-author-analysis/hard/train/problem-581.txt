Its not like the countries that are aiding Ukraine are doing it out of moral values and not for self interest. All countries aiding Ukraine are getting something out of It, its good for Europe to weaken Russia because Russia is a threat for the security of Europe, and its also interesting for the US to weaken Russia economically. But for Brazil? There nothing we gain from It.
There is nothing for Brazil in doing it, we would just burn our relations with Russia which supplies Brazil with fertilizers, and Brazil cannot survive without those fertilizers.
The second one is the fact that Brazil in particular is fairly dependent on certain Russian products, specially fertilizer. Sending anything to Ukraine would do nothing other than increase food prices (if not cause famine for a period of time) for straight up no gain whatsoever, political or otherwise. (comment from another user).
The actual reason is twofold. One is the simple fact that this war "matters" a lot less to places like Latin America or Africa than it does for Europe. Just like there are several other active conflicts worldwide right now that "the west" doesn't give a shit about.
