the real question is why does any country think they have the right to dump because it's "international waters".
all the crap that humans dump into the ocean is going to come back to us Brazil needs to take ownership and properly dispose of the vessel.
But Brazil is doing what it can, the company abandoned the ship and Brazil’s Navy is keeping it where it is.
People here seem to blaming Brazil for the mess when it’s dealing with a mess created by a foreign company.
No it's not enough reason, it's a legal conflict between Brazil and the buyer. I fully agree that Brazil is in the right on this. Brazil does not have a legal conflict with France. There is a completed sale, payment has been made and goods delivered. France is completely out of the equation. The current situation is that the buyer does not want to take delivery and this is now causing the risk of pollution. Now it's the question what Brazil can do. One option would be to clean up and bill the owner through the courts. Another would be to somehow force the buyer to fulfill its duties as owner of the ship. Neither of these include france. You also would not demand the yard that build the ship to pay for the removal, even though they owned the ship at some point in time.
Let's say I buy a car from you. Later I sell it, but the new owner just leaves it to rott in my driveway. Is it alright with you if I dump it on your driveway?
Of course not. This is a porblem between Brazil and the new buyer. I just really don't understand what role France plays in this, they were the former owner and that's it?
