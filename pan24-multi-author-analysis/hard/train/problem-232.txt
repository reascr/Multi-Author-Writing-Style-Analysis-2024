Kadyrov's deputy, Major General & Commander of Chechen Akhmat special forces, war criminal Apti Alaudinov has been poisoned through a letter soaked in toxin. He is hospitalized in Moscow along with two others from his entourage.
Failed Russian assault with tanks in the Svatovo area. Use of mines, Ukrainians on the defensive there.
Ukraine has spent months digging in and turning the frontline into a series of fortresses. Attacking is very hard and requires a 3:1 numerical advantage as well as modern weapons, good leadership and training in combined arms tactics. If you take away these factors attacks can quickly become suicidal for the attacker in 21st century warfare. Russia has a lot of manpower but this isnâ€™t the Victorian Era when you could win wars just by throwing mass infantry at the enemy until they surrendered.
You have to weigh those 20 lives against all the other Ukrainian POWs you won't be able to exchange later because you don't have as many Russians willing to surrender anymore.
I guess it depends how many Ukrainian lives are saved from not needing to fight due to Russian forces being more likely to surrender. Hard number to quantify though.
