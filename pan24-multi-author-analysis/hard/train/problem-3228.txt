Finland and Swedens geographies makes it much easier to defend if both nations are together, the strategic depth is vastly improved. A large contribution of Sweden being in nato is the strategic depth it provides for countries on the eastern side of the Baltic sea.
One individuals provocation is halting a Nato process... It's unimaginable that this will be allowed to cause so much trouble, larger parties in nato need to call Erdogan out for this bulshittery.
So once again. Erdogan is playing games, Sweden is in reality not the part that he want to negotiate with, it's the US and other larger European partners that need to mediate in this issue. Sweden just got between the ironsights.
It's basically malicious intent to accept Finland and to let Sweden out, it's a bad strategic scenario for Sweden and Finland as well as a really bad blow to NATOs "open door policy".
There's no good reasons to tie ourselves to Sweden and it is quite telling that it's all the old anti-nato pro-russia politicians screaming the loudest how we shouldn't join without Sweden.
