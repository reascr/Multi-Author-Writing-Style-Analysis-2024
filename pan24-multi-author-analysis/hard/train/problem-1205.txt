Be careful you'll anger the Pete for America crowd that insists he can do no wrong. The guy could have taken a job anywhere with his resume and chose the company that puts profits over people in every situation. His meager actions on cracking down on airlines and now throwing the rail workers under the bus. Sure he'll be going on Fox or something soon to get his "slams" so people can forget how undeserving he was of his DOT appointment. His supporters will still argue he's a progressive though.
He's not a pro-labor president then. Fucking simple as that. Man, I was proud of my vote for Biden a month ago. Now I'm not so sure. Good job Biden. You're alienating a large majority of the people who voted for you for political and economical optics.
But you don't actually look - you're upset about a failure of the democrats on a particular issue, but completely ignoring that what the republicans offer on that issue is even worse.
But what's your strategy - refuse to participate, and hand victory to those would would make things even drastically worse?
But living in a state where the party in power has an explicit platform of keeping the population poor and unhealthy, even to the point of refusing free federal money redistributed from taxes collected on the citizens of other states...
Only a checked-out idiot would persist in claiming there's no practical difference - becuase while the "better" side is still very disappointing, the practical difference is night and day, in more than a few cases literally life or death.
