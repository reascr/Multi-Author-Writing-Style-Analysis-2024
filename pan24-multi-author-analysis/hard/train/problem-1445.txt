The other kind, however, is the sort that loudly screams for shooting down activists, have delusional fantasies about race wars, and considers every minority community to be foreigners and outcasts that must be subjugated to the will of the majority.
Their racism is more...well, it trends more towards sniffs of disapproval, privately mocking african-americans and making digs about the usual topics. But they're polite enough, generally won't do anything too radical, and are capable of being made to see reason.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
