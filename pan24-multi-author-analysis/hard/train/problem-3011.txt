Or even precedent from most of the history of the country. There are letters written by DAs or AGs in the 19th century saying that they couldn't (not wouldn't) charge anyone for ending a pregnancy before quickening.
It won't put much into the economy, most people who will actually be helped by this live paycheck to paycheck. The money that they would have been paying on the loans was instead going to other things they needed. So, when this goes through, it's not going to add money to the economy. Or not as much as so many people think. Because what's going to happen is that some will just not have to pay anything to their loans (that's not new money into the economy for most of them, because they have been spending what they would have been paying on their loans), while a lot of people will just be paying a lower amount on their loans. The people at the higher end of the scale are going to be the ones who start putting money into the economy, and that's likely to be a much smaller amount than will be leaving the economy because people are paying on their student loans again.
you know it does not take a whole study to figure out just in general helping clear student loans can help the poorer borrowers, not even including inflation and gas prices.
The amount of annual student loan repayments are such a drop in the bucket of total consumer spending, it's not going to be noticeable to the economy.
