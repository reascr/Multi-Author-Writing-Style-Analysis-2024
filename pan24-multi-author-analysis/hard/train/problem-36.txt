It's well documented that Russia has been sending them to the front regardless of stated policy but here you are parroting the Kremlin"s official stance. So that's cool.
That would be impressive... Considering conscripts did not even participate in the fights (minus several attempts to forcibly make them sign the contracts, which was a pretty big scandal). They are not even a significant part of Russian army (100-140 thousand people scattered across bases all over the country).
IIRC the genius who tried to pass that was hit hard by the backlash specifically because it made Russian army look bad. Not to mention conscripts are of little use but a lot of trouble. Somehow I seriously doubt this was intended by the command - get 600 more people for a reputation hit that bad.
Conscripts are not the mobilised ones, it’s the mandatory 1-year ones who never even see combat (only in case of a defensive war and martial law, which is not the case). Worst they can do is shout profanities from the opposite side of the border. Somehow, according to Reddit and Twitter, it’s supposed to indicate they are the only ones left.
Seriously, I am amazed how people take every single piece of news as evidence that “Russia is doomed to fall any moment now!”. Well, Russia has been doomed to fall any moment for 22 years now. It’s kinda their thing.
