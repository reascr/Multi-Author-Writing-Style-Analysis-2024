I think that India could catch up to China in 2050, especially if the world continues to block China from certain high-tech manufacturing sectors, but there is no chance that India would catch up to the USA. The defence industry in the USA is simply too big, and too well funded: the USA spends around a quarter of India's GDP on defence per year.
It is unfortunate that India has not gone more towards American defense industry considering it's the largest not to mention the most advanced. But working with the Americans Military industrial complex comes with a lot of conditions and limitations which India might find unacceptable.
India needs to develop an indigenous defence manufacturing sector and fast. Considering the next decade, it will have close regional tensions with China flexing it's military in the region.
We can expect France and Israel to become a bigger part of Indian defence. As far as smooth and quick manufacturing is concerned Indian government is looking to boost its local defense industry with Joint Ventures annd Technology transfers.
They have been trying to replicate it with France right now both with Rafael Fighter Jets and Submarines. India has along way to go but also has a young and relatively well educated population. If the put the right policy and right support it can create a strong indigenous defence industry within the next decade.
