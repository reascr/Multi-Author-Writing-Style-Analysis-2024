I missed the part that said they had to base their diets around meat. I did reach the part in the bill that pushes for nutritional education and heathy diet coaching. But that was not mentioned in the posted article. It’s almost like they have agenda they want to promote.
The only thing you listed that actually has health benefits is chicken and only white meat chicken is healthy for human consumption and only if it is grilled and trimmed. I mean 50 years of medical research has shown what is healthy and unhealthy. Seems like the people trying to pass this law are the only ones that care about what is being consumed, not just providing something for consumption. Just because you do not like the GOP doesn’t mean Mac and cheese and fried chicken are now healthy options to fish and veggies.
If you read the article and compare to what nutritionist say is a healthy diet, the foods cut all cause heart disease and inflammation. The foods left are all heart healthy and help maintain healthy weight. White bread is terrible for you. Whole grain is better and covered. The bill does not restrict “fresh meat”. It restricts the types of meats and allows for healthy meats such as salmon. If you remove the political parties from the article, it actually only allows healthy foods to be purchase which also helps with medical cost in the long run. Why is this bad? The poor are the most unhealthy in America. Restricting the use of food stamps to only healthy foods is a good thing.
Unhealthy food is better than no food. Kids gotta eat. Healthy food is more expensive. I’m not sure what meat alternatives or fresh produce is available in Iowa.
Do you see fresh meat on that list? I see canned tuna and salmon. There are some canned beans and shredded cheese so that part seems to be wrong.
