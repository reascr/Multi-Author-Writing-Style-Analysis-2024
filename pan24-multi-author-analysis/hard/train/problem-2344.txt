This war rages on because Russia canâ€™t walk away with zero gain, despite them being entitled to jack shit.
Any bargaining you think might be productive will only add fuel to the Russian fire. They will be back and hungrier than ever, and all your ideas of productive peace talks will be pointless. Ukraine knows this, so they cannot realistically even consider peace talks.
Those are Ukrainian demands, now let's try to meet in the middle, peace deals require bargaining after all, don't they?
But since balance of power is the goal, the Ukrainians should say so, and the West should set about planning to arm Ukraine to the teeth and beyond.
From the looks of it, the very best they are hoping for is balance of power: kicking Russia out of their territory and then arming to the teeth to dissuade Russia from continuing the war.
There are four ways for wars to end: truce, balance of power, elimination of the core issue, and convergence of values.
Elimination of the cause is when for whatever reason the thing they were fighting about goes away. An example is the end of American conflict with North Vietnam when the North conquered the South in 1975. After that what did the US have to argue with Vietnam about?
