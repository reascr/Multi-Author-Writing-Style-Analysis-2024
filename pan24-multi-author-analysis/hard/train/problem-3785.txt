Anytime you hear “records” it’s only the past 100 years. Like that’s a reasonable sample size to extrapolate from. We’ve been on a warming trend since the end of the little ice age, no reason to think it won’t stop barring catastrophe. The medieval warm period was much hotter than it is now.
It was warmer than it is now during the medieval warm period. People grew grapes in England and the ice caps receded enough for the Vikings to cross into Canada and grow crops in Greenland. This period led to a boom in agriculture and civilization known as the high Middle Ages, during which the great gothic cathedrals were built. This period of growth was ended by the little ice age and the second great bubonic plague. I’m not a climate denier or anything, I just think it’s important for people to understand that warmer doesn’t necessarily mean worse. The thing that makes rising temperatures bad this time is that we have used modern technology to sustain an unnaturally high population, many living in places people shouldn’t be living in that can’t take these climate fluctuations.
Moreover, the reason why anthropogenic global warming is a cause for concern is the rate of warming—the earth has been much warmer in the past when you go back at least millions of years, but the warming period were over tens of thousands of years, not the decades as we are currently experiencing. This makes ecological adjustment to temperature fluxes significantly more difficult and disastrous.
This is easily proven incorrect: . Today is significantly warmer than the medieval warm period, which was regionalized to primarily Europe anyways.
