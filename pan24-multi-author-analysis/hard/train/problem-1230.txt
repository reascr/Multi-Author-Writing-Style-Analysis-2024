Putin met with a panel of "aggrieved military widows" earlier during the war in Ukraine, and I believe it was later shown that most were state crisis actors.
Now we’re seeing Russia use the Makiivka barracks strike and support from a Putin aligned “widow’s group” as grounds for full mobilization.
And we ask our President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin to allow the Russian Army to conduct a large-scale mobilization that will meet the situation that has developed on our borders. In Russia, there are tens of millions of men of military age who we have to rely on and to engage the enemy. But what can our men do, sitting at home, without capable command, supplies and uniforms? Mobilization is what will give them a chance to survive.
We ask our President, our Supreme Commander-in-Chief to prohibit the exit of men of military age out from Russia. And we have every moral right to do so: our husbands died defending these men too, but who will protect us if they run away?
...our husbands died protecting these men, but who will protect us if they (conscripted, fleeing Russians) run away?".
