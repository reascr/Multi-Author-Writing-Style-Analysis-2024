The mistake gardeners make growing onions is only planting sweet ("Vidalia") onion. Those are tasty but need to be used within a couple of months of harvest.
If you're growing for long term storage you need to be growing a storage onion, usually a yellow variety like Copra.
Onion is one of the things I never thought of growing in the garden because I could get them cheaply and in large quantities.
I can buy a kg of half rotten locally farm grown onions for $1.5 ... (even the ones that look ok, still smell rotten.. usually won't last more than 2-3 days).
Lately I've pretty much given up on using onions in cooking, I will mostly eat a small one raw with a little salt or sliced in a salad, and that's it. Given the current prices, it doesn't make much sense. Peppers and garlic saved the day for me, don't really miss onions.
Let them increase the price as much as they want, I'll just stop buying it. They can stick their onions somewhere.
I can buy a kg of standard sized supermarket onions from one of the two chains in my city for either $0.8 or $1.2 ...
I went from 3 tiny grocery store onions to close to 100 absolutely gargantuan ones. I just let them grow and do their thing. Oh, and they've survived the 115F summer and 30F winters where's we are. They just keep plugging along and dividing and popping out seeds.
