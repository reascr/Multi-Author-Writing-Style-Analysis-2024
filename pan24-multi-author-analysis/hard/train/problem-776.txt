There’s a great line from the YouTube series “The Alt-Right Playbook.” Essentially, the creator says that, fundamentally, fascists aren’t authoritarians, monarchist, socialists, democracy advocates or anything else. They’re “Whatever puts them in power-ists.” Fascists will absolutely use democracy to elevate themselves to power if they can. But because their chosen model of government is designed to benefit a handful of people while the rest suffer, and no one is allowed to improve their position, authoritarianism is the only way they can maintain their power. Hence the above story.
This will blow up in their face, as usual. The last two elections for Republicans have been pathetic, embarrassing affairs. Millennial’s and Gen Z turn out more and more every election, and both generations a vastly, overwhelmingly, Dem/Prog/Lefty. That’s two generations of voters who hate the Republican Party and their policies. Gen Z is even more Left-leaning than Millennials, if you can believe it. Republicans offer nothing of value to what is now the largest voting bloc in America, and it shows. All this and similar policies will do is galvanize young people against Republicans more and more.
If you vote for Republicans you get republican policies. Kansans should reevaluate who they vote for, but they won't, because Americans are not very bright.
