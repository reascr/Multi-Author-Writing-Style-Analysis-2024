Just remember that this Republican was willing to spend $95 million on this political stunt, but then will turn around and bemoan the national debt and vote against helping people with healthcare, housing or childcare because the state or the Federal Government can't afford it....
This is right out of the democrat playbook: Complain about something using faulty logic, pass a bill that does nothing that would even fix said complaint in the first place, allocate absurdly large amounts of taxpayer money, and then blatantly steal it all in front of the American public. Then blame the other side for what you did and laugh that your base is so incomprehensibly stupid that they’ll actually go along with it and then keep voting to let you steal more of their money.
Seriously - tell me how on EARTH can you blame the previous republican governor who spent $6 million putting up a wall for the $95 million of taxpayer money that democrats just stole?
Likely either good ol fashioned funneling of taxpayer dollars to private donors, or a way to say, "look I tried to do something about the border but then those damn Democrats tore the wall down!".
Let’s just call it like it is. The Biden Admin doesn’t give a fuck about the border. I say let’s stop talking about it, it won’t change. The only thing that will is the amount of unaccompanied minors, drugs, cartel members, Covid positive, sex trafficed people will continue to pour in. It won’t be until big cities like NY, LA DC get sick of it will there ever be a change.
