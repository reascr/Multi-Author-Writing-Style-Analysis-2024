I agree with you, it’s not ethical to take dirty money. But - it’s also not why Switzerland is rich.
Switzerland was rich way before banking became a thing there. It had one of the earliest industrialisation in Europe. Banking only represents 9% of the GDP which is on par with other countries like the UK or the US. The real financial havens like Luxembourg strike at 30% but it doesn't bother anybody becasue it already is in the EU and they have control over it, unlike in Switzerland that bothers them.
Your last sentence isn't true anymore. Siince 2015 alot changed when Obama made pressure. US citizens for example don't have access to bank secrecy anymore. Same for EU countries, banks opened up alot since then. And in the subject of this war there is way more Oligarch money stacked in London than in Switzerland, it has been the go to business place for them.
They just enjoy making money off the money they are holding…classic Switzerland. Money over human lives was their motto and continues to be their motto.
