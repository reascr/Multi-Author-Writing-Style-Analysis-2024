Last year they were in a phase of getting slaughtered charging into cities with not enough infantry and lacking air superiority.
Then Russia was in a phase of being attacked by artillery with superior range, losing their ammunition depots and supply lines and pushed out of territory they couldnâ€™t defend.
If the Russian army ran out of shells or barrels the war is effectively going to be over pretty soon and the best Russia can hope for is a long stale mate before collapsing.
Russia is preparing a large offensive for late winter/spring, and they're probably saving whatever ammo they have left for this moment. It's going to be a very tough time for both sides and Ukrainians are going to need every bit of help western countries can offer.
The thing with Ukraine is they have the whole western world suppling them. And if they said they really need more ammo or supplies urgently, they would get it.
Ukraine really needs to do more behind the lines activity and plant explosive devices in the big ammo dumps in Russia. Preferably simultaneously so that Russia can't respond after the first by tightening security on the others.
