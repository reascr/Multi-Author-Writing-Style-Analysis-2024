Goncharenko predicted that the GOP congressional base aligned with former President Trump that has urged cuts to Ukraine aid will be less influential than previously thought following Tuesdayâ€™s election.
It's been largely bipartisan so far, but influential Republicans have spoken against further aid to Ukraine. Such as MTG, J.D. Vance, Rand Paul, and Tucker Carlson, while Trump has been quiet. Tucker Carlson in particular has been recently trying to re-frame the Russo-Ukraine War as 'Christian vs woke' (ironic given Ukraine is anything but) which heavily implies he's beyond an isolationist, he's pro-Russia. These people can certainly whip most of the Republicans to block all further Ukraine aid if they won big in the House.
The less 'ultra MAGA' Republicans are very pro-Ukraine though, especially in the Senate, where they support sending even more weaponry to Ukraine like ATACMS.
During the last Republican presidency from 2016-2020 there were separate annual plans to supply military assets to Ukraine. Before this invasion, Ukraine had roughly 2 billion dollars worth of anti-missile systems, coast guard gun boats and missile launchers from America. From 2016 to 2018, Congress was a Republican majority.
