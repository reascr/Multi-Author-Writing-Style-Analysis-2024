Deep down everyone knew that russians were incompetent even before the war, so I don't think anything changed that much...
This war showed how incompetent, ineffective and arrogant Russian forces were when they are put up with a challenge on a sudden notice. Now with Russia gone as one of the three world powers in the world (USA, Russia and China) a spot is left to which plenty of countries are racing for. Sooner or later China would be gone too as their butts are asking to be spanked with Indian batons during the border skirmishes and also to be bonked with Japanese and South Korean Navies. In the near future when two seats would be empty (I am being optimistic), countries would like to fill it. And any two other countries which would fill it would form a new world order. This is my opinion, if you feel something is wrong, please do mention it.
I get it why you don't like USA as a superpower but keep in mind the condition of the mindset when Kargil and Bangladesh Liberation happened. Ministers were different, mentality were different. Pakistan played the victim card then but can't play it now. People know what Pakistan is left as of today.
India was never an ally of China, only business partners. Only Russia and USA were common between us and China, nobody else.
This has NOTHING to do with Russia-Ukraine. You guys are so consumed by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, you even look at unrelated news from that lens.
Ukraine and Russia are supposed to iron out their differences diplomatically, are they? Like India did with Pakistan and China, right?
