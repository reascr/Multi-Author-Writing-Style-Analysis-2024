At the end of the day, they tow the party line. If they don't, they get shunned, ostracized, kick out of the village and forced to survive in the woods alone. That's it. The fear of their own mob turning on them.
Edit: "Shunning is a dangerous practice used by cults. Those who are kicked out of authoritarian religious organizations are cut off from their entire social universe.".
True. I find it insane that these people would let Israel use European Jewish tragedy to shield itself from criticism. A criticism against Israel isn’t antisemitism just as a criticism against China isn’t racism.
Being anti Israel and anti Zionist doesn’t make you an antisemite though. You can be against the Zionist state without being against Jewish people, I mean there’s plenty of Jews who dont support Israel and are anti Zionist as well.
To call decisions, policies, and/or practices of the State of Israel into question is not de facto anti-semitism, in my humble opinion. There is no state in the world that is above being called to account, whether by its own citizens or the citizens of another country. Anti-semitism moves beyond mere questioning and calling to account, and is motivated by baseless hatred.
Even if one agrees that certain statements made by Ilhan Omar about the State of Israel are of legitimate concern, her removal from the Foreign Affairs Committee smacks of racism and partisan "witch-hunt" tactics, being fueled by a male Speaker against a fellow member of the House who is a woman belonging to both an ethnic and religious minority in our country.
Ilhan Omar has been forcibly removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee for statements which she has made about the State of Israel, while Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) believes in "Jewish Space Laser" conspiracies, yet continues to sit on the Oversight and Homeland Security Committees...
