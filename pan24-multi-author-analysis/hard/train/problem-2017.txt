It’s concerning to me that a good amount of people don’t consider that event to be such a big deal. Luckily most of us see it as it was; an attempted terrorist attack & coup. We can’t punish JUST trump. ALL officials involved MUST be punished, to a far greater degree than the insurrectionists. Start here. Start actually punishing corruption. It’s literally in every branch and division of government especially including law enforcement, and every large corporation as well. We will pay severely if we don’t start cleaning up.
You’re right. It was a historic event that will be talked about in history books (if we make it that far.).
But see that’s the thing. That was literally the focus of the Jan 6 hearings: To show you it was never about that one speech. The deniers and those just simply not paying enough attention are and always will be too focused on the speech itself, which was merely the final moments of a months long effort.
But that’s what right-wing news outlets do best: Cherry pick moments and events and show them out of context as a roundabout way of “proving” some nonexistent point so that you’re constantly distracted from the truth they can pretend they’re giving you. Never a need to do the research they’re telling you needs to be done because you’ve seen it all….
