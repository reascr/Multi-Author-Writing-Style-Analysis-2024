US military "We have been undertaking red flag exercises to prepare for forms of attack that the enemy might come up with in the future".
If Pfizer or any other pharma company wants to be fully prepared for future variants of covid, then they would do this by looking at potential mutation routes the virus might take, and then try and work out potential vaccine solutions.
So a Pfizer employee said they were looking at trying to mutate covid in a lab setting to preemptively create vaccines for potential variants.
And the right is using that to lie and claim that Pfizer is, what, intentionally infecting people with covid variants to make money off vaccine sales?
They lied to the public, theyre profiting off the vaccine, but more importantly a high positioned worker just admitted theyre contemplating mutating the virus. That alone should warrant some type of investigation. Not too mention the questionable measures taken during their climical trials. Im not saying they should be charged with anything, but at the very least an investigation could be warranted. Why would you be against a company who previously have been nefarious to be investigated, also why arent you being skeptical at all?
