So a decades old plane used for transport and surveillance is threatening their active duty fighter jets?
Yeah, just like the last time the U.S. complained about an overly aggressive fighter pilot harassing U.S. reconnaissance airplanes in international airspace back in January of 2001. The Chinese ignored initial U.S. complaints about Chinese fighter pilot Wang Wei's (really) reckless behavior. The lack of any action on China's part arguably is what led to him crashing into another U.S. reconnaissance plane on 1 April 2001.
Wang Wei's fighter was destroyed and his body was never found. The U.S. was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby PRC military airfield. In order to expeditiously get their own 24 crew members back the U.S. found it necessary to give a 'non-apology' apology stating that they were sorry about the death of Wang Wei and that they were sorry about not getting permission to land at their military airport. The PRC has in it's possession the flight data from both aircraft but refuse to release either. To this day they celebrate Wang Wei as a national hero.
