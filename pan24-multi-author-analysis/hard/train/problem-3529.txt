Illinois (and other states) has passed significant legislation to restrict 2nd Amendment rights in the wake of the Heller and now the Bruen decisions. What steps need to be taken to promote an explicit Constitutional right in your state?
What do you have to say about the state violating what are supposed to be Constitutionally protected rights of U.S. citizens? There has been a Supreme Court decision in very recent times that also forbids the banning of guns that are in common use. Semi-automatic (NOT machine guns) firearms have been in common use for over 100 years.
The CDC for years estimated between 50,000-2,000,000 defensive gun uses per year. There are roughly 35,000 gun deaths per year. Subtract suicides, negligent deaths and police homicides, there is 12,000 some odd gun killings per year (which includes gang violence). 0.0003135% of all guns in the United States are used to commit a non gang related murder.
That statistic you're looking at is all gun deaths. 60 percent of those in the US are suicides. You look at homicides and the US isn't even in the top 10 and homicides are the only statistic worth looking at.
Having a gun actually doubles your risk of being a victim of homicide so your protection argument doesn't hold water. I protect my family by not having a gun in my house.
