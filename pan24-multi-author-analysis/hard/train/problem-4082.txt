Nobody is invading the US for a long-ass time and I'm not an electric substation so no fascists have tried to shoot me yet so I'm not going to sit over here and say "I put my 21/hr job on the line so I'm gonna sit in judgement over people who don't want to be shot." I've had a gun pointed at me once during a mugging and once the adrenaline letdown kicks in its bad.
I've always been politically engaged, always called out violations for worker safety or violations of minority or disability rights at work even if it paints a target on your back.
You're essentializing ethnicity and hating people basically for where they were born. You're as fascist as the mentality driving Putin to ethnically cleanse Ukraine.
Yeah, and the Russians are actively proving that their monsters for what they’re doing in Ukraine. I’m just saying that tactically speaking, sending them back is only going to add to the radicalization of Russians. It’s not the “responsibility” of any country to accept the refugees, but it’d be a nice hit the Russian economy.
