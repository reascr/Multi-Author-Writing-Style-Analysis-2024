This was the opinion of trumps council who said they need to be impeached first, but as far as I’m aware they’re basing this entirely on the fact that impeachment exists so de facto that must be what is used. It’s unlikely we test this anytime soon, but I can’t see anything anywhere that says sitting presidents can’t be prosecuted.
If the incarceration lasts longer than their time in office it would de facto take it away, but by incarcerating them you aren’t literally removing them from it but are instead letting the VP take over until they are able to take over again once out of prison.
There’s no way a small handful of documents found in secured locations where Biden conducted legitimate business as VP, and then proper return procedure followed and initiated by Biden himself, would ever rise to gross negligence or malicious intent.
If Biden swears he has no more classified documents at his home(s), signs an affidavit saying as much, and then someone notices a classified document in his home(s), then yes, he should absolutely have a routine search warrant executed, same as Trump did (enough with this pussy-ass 'raid' bullshit).
People that I work with who parrot the right-wing talking heads are already saying that what Biden did was illegal because he was only a VP at the time, and what trump did was perfectly fine because he was president and could declassify anything he wanted to.
