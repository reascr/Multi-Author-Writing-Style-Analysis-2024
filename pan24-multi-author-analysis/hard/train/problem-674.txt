Don't worry, bro We're at the stage where everything is going to be just fine with just a little simple human cooperation.
In October, a large outbreak occurred on a mink fur farm in Spain. Researchers who described the outbreak in a paper published last month believe that wild birds initially transmitted H5N1 to the mink farm, but once there, it spread from mink to mink.
H5N1 is responsible for the culling of several mink farms because H5N1 appears to have mutated to facilitate mammal to mammal transmission, still awaiting final confirmation. It's also suspected in some other mammal species suffering disease such as seals.
H5N1 has a nasty CFR in excess of 50%. However, this is based on a very small sample size with cases from a variety of locations with differing levels of health care. It only includes people sick enough to go to the hospital, not asymptomatic or people mildly infected. The bottom line is it has the potential to be very deadly, but as we saw with COVID, there's alot of factors and variables that determine mortality.
Also, viruses are known to trade mobility for mortality, so if it did jump, it's possible it could lose some lethality in order to allow a farther spread. Again, another variable.
