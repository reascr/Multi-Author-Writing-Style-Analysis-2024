"Democratic Representative Dan Goldman said he wrote on Sunday to McCarthy, Representative Elise Stefanik, the Republican conference chairwoman, and Dan Conston, head of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a House Republican fundraising group, about a New York Times report that they were aware of Santos' fabrications before the November election.".
But yeah. Restoring order to the corruption of a government is hard. Simply pushing the ruling parties out tends to leave a nasty power vacuum that can quickly get filled by the even more corrupt. (You can't break any laws if there are no laws to break! <taps forehead>).

I am all for a good ol' fashioned revolution! However, it needs to have a factual basis and not rooted in the lies of one or two people.
If he doesn't get removed for all of the lies then apparently you don't have to tell even a sliver of truth to run pur country. Syaing the quiet part out loud is a terrible precedent.
