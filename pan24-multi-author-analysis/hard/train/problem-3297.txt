Look, I despise Buttigieg BECAUSE OF HIS NEOLIBERAL POLITICS but this kind of an attack is just right wing whataboutism. It's typical Republican disinformation, taking something entirely out of context. It will also backfire with reasonable people - who don't tend to be Republicans, anyway - because they'll see right through it.
Nah, you don't always need to talk about Republicans when criticizing the Democrats. Still, I expected you... I've had enough liberals jump down my throat for supporting Bernie in '16 and '20. The Neoliberals are a corrupt disgrace through dark money, at best a couple steps up from the Republicans. I'm a Leftist. What are you?
Thanks for the clarification. I had thought it was the formation of the Democratic Leadership Party (DLC) in 1988, but I suppose it may have been earlier.
Also, Reagan's (I know, a Republican) morality politics ignited the culture wars, a move away from issues regarding inequality, and also led to a shift away from Presidential accountability. There's a lot there to digest I think. Here we are polarized intensely. I wish we could agree on basic material rights for the 99% in this society.
We don't have a Party for the people. The Democrats stopped caring about being even slightly Leftist starting with Bill Clinton.
