It's too early to make any conclusions about this current virus period. I'd also be willing to wager that based on the trajectory of this outbreak among birds, and then mammals, is Mother Nature's doing, not humans.
It does not mean that this current stain is modified in any way. This mutation has long been present and studied. If it was a modified virus, why mess around trying to get it for ferrets, when you can modify it for people.
“Disease experts have raised the idea that the virus would need to change for it to be conducive to human transmission.”.
As viruses get more transmissible, they tend to become more mild. This could bring the lethality down a bit.
Even if the disease becomes a bit more mild, it will still be very rough on people. I believe people will take it more seriously than Covid. Mask mandates will be strict. Vaccine mandates will be strict. Lockdowns might even see more enforcement.
Call me optimistic, but I don't think it would be as bad as you are describing. It would be bad. But, there are a few things that make me think we can avoid a mega bad calamity.
During Covid, a ton of the deniers were hearing the stories about Covid being mild. They were getting Covid, and getting mildly sick. That won't be happening if we get a real outbreak of this flu. Everyone is gonna know multiple people who die. People's friends will not be saying that they had the disease and it was nothing. They are going to be saying they nearly died.
