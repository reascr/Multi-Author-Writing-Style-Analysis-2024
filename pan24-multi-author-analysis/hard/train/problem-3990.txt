Even if true, they weren't the first ones to import deadly nerve gas components. In 1992 an Israeli jet crashed in the Netherlands with 50 gallons of Sarin precursor on board.
No, of course not. Israel did not intend to be caught intentionally importing nerve gas precursors, but sometimes airplanes crash. And that can be inconvenient. And yes, if you think Hezbollah is evil because they are trying to import chemical weapons, then pot - meet kettle.
Maybe because these weapons will only be used against Israel, and maybe also because Hezbollah are taken here as defenders of Lebanon and not as terrorists.
In Lebanon the Shia sees them as defenders, not others, you are right. However, if you re-read my comment, I said "Hezbollah are taken here as defenders of Lebanon", as in Reddit, where people know nothing about the region. Obviously Lebanese, who live in Lebanon, will know better.
True, but there are always exceptions. In general, it's the Shia that support Hezbollah blindly (or by fear, need, etc.). Still, I was talking about Reddit, not Lebanese citizens, and I agree with your observation about Reddit in this regard.
