The peace process existed before and the last time Cyprus rejected the referendum, the Turkish Cypriot side actually passed it.
They certainly will make a deal… which could be finally letting Turkey to join EU… small price to pay for huge political pain in the backside (which is Occupied Cyprus).
It does cost Turkey quite a lot of money to “support” Occupied Cyprus… and I have a feeling that Turkey will have issues with spending money on anything other than rebuilding main land.
IMO this is delusional, it's not like Turkeys government is going to pull out whatever stationed troops they have in Cyprus, or stop spending "time and money" there. There is no "positive" side effect to the earthquake except that it has brought the people of Greece and Turkey closer despite the differences the governments have with each other. Ultimately nothing has really changed on the Cyprus situation, Cyprus/Greece and Turkey still have to come to an agreement/understanding and until then the status quo will probably continue.
Turkey probably would like to lose Northern Cyprus in a way that doesn't make them lose face, but reunification isn't popular in Cyprus because Northern Cyprus is a mess and full of transplants, and it would harm the southern portion economically to try to fix it.
It's an extreme example, but there aren't many examples of land borders being shared in these kinds of disputes. There likely are a few in the former soviet areas of Eurasia, but I'm not educated enough to speak on it.
