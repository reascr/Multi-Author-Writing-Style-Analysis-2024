I'm not sure we had "absolutely nothing to worry about", the force that "we" would have faced in the 80's is very different to the force the Ukrainians are facing. Unlike the main NATO powers the Russian army is very much a conscription based army with a fraction of the "career" soldiers we have. As Russia couldn't use the conscripts for their "special operation" they are very much hamstrung and lack the manpower they need to effectively use what they have.
When it all went wrong and Russia doubled down rather than give up and back out again they ran into the problem of the makeup of the Russian armed forces being based round the conscripts and the lack of them for the "special operation". It's a major stumbling block for them and has directly been the cause of some major loses. It's also as I understand it why Putin has been so desperate to label the conquered parts as "Russia", it then allows them to be defended with the full conscript bolstered army rather than merely the career army backed up with mercenaries. Even there however the mechanisms for calling up the reserve have all atrophied and fallen into neglect.
That's also not mentioning of course just how much their remaining armed forces have atrophied since the fall of the USSR. Had they come storming across the Fulda Gap they would have thrown everything at us including their air power. All of which was much more impressive during the 80's.
My guess is in the 80s things where more even. But they are basically still there while anybody else now is 40s past this point.
