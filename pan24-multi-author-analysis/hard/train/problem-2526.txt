Immunized against current strains, the real danger of having 700 million new infections is that is creates a viral playground to breed new strains; strains for which we have no way of knowing how effective our current vaccines will work.
But if we use the real numbers of a 70% effective vaccine, across a 50% vaccinated population, with an average mortality rate between 2 and 3%, then our estimate for potential dead goes higher.
Even with a 99.99% effective vaccine being given to 99.99% of that country, we're still talking about another catastrophic outbreak that will result in tens of millions of deaths.
China has 1.4 billion people in it. Even at a mortality rate of 0.01%, that'd still lead to 14 million dead. 14, being a double digit number starting with a "1," is in the "10's" group.
That will also lead to hundreds of new variants developing. It's only a matter of time before all of our vaccines for COVID become essentially worthless, at that rate.
There are no “delayed” effects to the covid vaccines beyond the standard 6 weeks in trials. Only some extremely rare adverse reactions that happen in this time.
