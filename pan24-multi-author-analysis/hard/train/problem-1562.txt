And yes we finally relented because Ukraine needs to tanks, and unlike the Germans that sucked from Putin's gas tits the last decade, we wanted to act quickly. We agreed to send more equipment over just to force Germany's hand on this.
The US has literally provided more military equipment than everyone else combined. We have sent 47B, compared to 51B for the entire fucking EU. Maybe Germany can pick up the slack on tanks, since their tanks aren't the logistical nightmare that US tanks are?
I'm sick of that attitude. I am American, and I am glad we are helping Ukraine as much as we are, and wish we would help more. But why should European aid be contingent on the US sending aid? Can't Europe handle wiping their own asses without the US there to coddle them?
Don't you make your aid contingent on other nations as well also by your very exolanation? Also to ukraines disadvantage? Everyone played the same game here, let's not pretend otherwise. We should all be embarrassed it took us this long, germans as well as americans. We both could have done that months ago. Lets be cheerful for whats comming instead finally.
