There is no difference between a 1% receiver vs an 80% receiver. They are defined exactly the same way - both partial receivers. The amount of cuts doesn't matter.
> At the same time, nothing in the proposed rule restricted persons who are not otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms from making their own firearms without markings solely for personal use, nor did the proposed rule require individuals to mark PMFs when they occasionally acquire them for a personal collection, or sell or transfer them from a personal collection to unlicensed in-State residents in accordance with Federal, State, and local law. Further, the NPRM would not require FFLs to accept any PMFs, or to mark PMFs themselves, or to provide services to place identification marks on PMFs. Licensees would be able to arrange for individuals who wish to transfer PMFs to licensees to have them marked by another licensee before accepting them, provided they are properly marked in accordance with the proposed rule.
No, they just say a partial receiver is a partial receiver. The fact it's a receiver - a purpose built product to create to gun is the focus.
Please point out in the Federal Code where it says anything that gets near a gun is a firearm if it is "purpose built". Congress did not at any time give the President sweeping authority to write regulations of his own accord because he just feels so strongly about it.
