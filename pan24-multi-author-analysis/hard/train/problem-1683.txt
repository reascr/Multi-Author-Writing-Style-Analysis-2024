They likely want it to spread to the west, they openly treat the west as their enemy and since their zero covid policy was a disaster that blew up in their faces spreading the new variant to their enemies to further divide and destabilize would give them the opportunity to scape goat the new strain on the west and claim it started with the west... again, like they did with the first round.
If it spreads to America again the rich and corporations will do exactly what they ended up doing last time and saying "fuck the workforce, let them die so long as we keep raking in the profits", sacrificing the working class to appease the rich was even supported by the politicians and that will undoubtedly cause even greater turmoil given financial and medical situations for most Americans. I could easily see China trying to turn their bad situation into a means of damaging the west, and then blaming the west for it even starting.
Wonder if they are hoping to spread it to the west in hopes of dividing and destabilizing, weaponizing a pandemic is 100% something I could see China doing, especially after their thinly veiled attempt at total domestic control with their "zero covid policy" failed.
Just imagine, a Disconnected world in chaos, suffering from, worrying about, and debilitated by pandemics while china is free to do whatever it pleases without rousing any attention at all.
The worst part is, china gets zero accountability and take no responsibility for the lives lost and damages done.
