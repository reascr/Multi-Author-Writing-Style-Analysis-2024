Maybe it's just me, but having your systems cut out for a country going through an active invasion because you're too busy making an ass of yourself on twitter should have bigger consequences then "Telsa sells fewer cars.".
This. Actively have been in the market for a new EV for the last 6m and am holding out until the Ionic 6 hits next year. I had wanted a model 3 for years but have zero interest in supporting that company now. It would be like buying a MyPillow. Musk's problem is that his new "base" can't afford his product...
As someone who owns a Tesla, I couldn't recommend it even if not for Musk. The car itself is good, excellent even, but a worse customer service with complete disregard for consumer rights laws you have to look far after. Blatant warranty issues regularly have to be dragged to court, where they will still refuse to heed the outcome, forcing you to further waste money on it. Their endgame is to make it more expensive to drag them to court over every little bit than to just give up.
