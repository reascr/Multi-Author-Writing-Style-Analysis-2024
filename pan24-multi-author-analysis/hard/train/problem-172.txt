Some progressive dems need to start running on overhauling the federal justice system and Supreme Court. Expand it to 21 members, make congress fill the court within a timely manner or else all benefits and pay for the congress people will be docked until they confirm somebody, bring back the filibuster, and rotate decisions between random 7 justices for each case.
That should leave us with more judges confirmed by both parties (yes, I know strongly partisan judges like Thomas or Alito had 80+ senate votes, so this isnâ€™t a sure thing) and a far less partisan court system.
Great, Now Roberts is gonna have to go and whine about how the American People don't view the Supreme Court as a fair organization, and is losing credibility and standing in the eyes of the citizens.
Don't get me wrong, I think that's also an ugly thing for a sitting Justice to be doing, but it's neither surprising nor as offensively brazen a display of bias and partiality as this is.
Let the ABA disbar them. Nothing in the Constitution says they need an active license to practice law, and even if there's an argument it did....take a guess who is seeing that case?
Yeah, he could be stripped of his ability to practice law in every jurisdiction he has a license to practice in and it still wouldn't matter. He would still be a Supreme Court Justice.
