Also, for the folks unaware and all “war is terrible”: the russian war machine made the spectacularly sound decision to place live ammunitions right next to the bunker 😑.
Still no warm feelings for Russian soldiers, but let's be honest, they have half a dozen of possible ways of action, and _all_ of them are incredibly bad.
They're people and yes war leads humans to do truly despicable things and there are definitely many scumbags amongst the ranks of the Russian Army (Ukraine also has their share) but cheering on the deaths of soldiers is just weird.
You can have basic empathy towards Russian soldiers though and accept them as people and not just pawns of Putin cheering on their deaths like a game because they didn't just abandon their home and family.
EDIT: To the Russian propaganda trolls still spouting the "they're just innocent sons/fathers who don't have a choice": They can surrender. A lot of Russians have already surrendered. It went fine and they were used in a trade for people that the Russians kidnapped.
