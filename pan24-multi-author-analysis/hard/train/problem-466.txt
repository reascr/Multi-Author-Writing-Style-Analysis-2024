I've always wondered what is the actual deal with people who would rather own a dangerous wild beast than a normal pet like a dog, cat, or rabbit. Is it a mental health thing, or what?
Again, I'm not trying to pass judgment or insult anyone, but I would like to better understand how someone with clarity of mind can come to a rational decision to pay money to let a deadly wild animal live with them at home.
Didn’t know it’s anthropomorphism to say that keeping intelligent wild animals is usually bad for the animals’ well-being. Is it also humanizing animals to point out that owning something that can kill you and taking risk that kind of risk with it is also shitty for the animal? If it kills you, it’ll almost certainly be destroyed, and it’ll be entirely your fault. But no one should care about that whatsoever, right? Because according to you caring about the well-being of animals is the same as pretending they’re human.
It was always clear to me that she was one of those people who cared more about animals than humans. A good thing for her big cats…not so much for her husband.
