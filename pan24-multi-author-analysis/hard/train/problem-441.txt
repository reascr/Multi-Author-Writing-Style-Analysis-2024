They are doing alot India is getting rich off it, not just from the cheap oil but rolled steel as well, at least Russia is not getting their full international market value.
That’s crude steel but The Russians are undercutting local more advanced steels and seems India is buying all that Russia can supply and then exporting it ….
It’s a rehash from last year’s negotiations in Munich before the Russian Invasion which Ukraine rejected and suggested that it be allowed to join NATO or it might consider Nuclear Rearmament.
\- NATO should stop expanding, this is where the "cold war" mentality comes in, but it also means that Russia should stop seeking westward expansion due to its flat geography, which gives it few natural protections against the west.
It’s right in line with Russia’s early justifications for this war — that a Ukraine aligned with the west poses a threat and as such, an invasion of Ukraine is legitimate (implying that Ukraine doesn’t have its own sovereign right to decide its own alignments). That’s terribly imperialistic on its own, but we also know it’s BS because it’s simply Russian imperialism, nationalism, supremacism, and expansionism that underlies their invasion of Ukraine.
It’s another way of saying that nations shouldn’t have a sovereign right to decide how to best maintain their own security interests (usually aligning themselves with military blocs like NATO in order to develop a balance of power).
Because their realpolitik perspective is that it is a reasonable security concern to want to have a vassal state as a buffer for their borders against “western aligned” powers.
