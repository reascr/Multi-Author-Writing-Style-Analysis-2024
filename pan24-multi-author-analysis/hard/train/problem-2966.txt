My workplace moved all our Ukraine based coworkers and families out after bombs dropped near our Ukraine office building. You can hear explosions going on in the background during calls. (yeah you are getting bombed, but you still gotta show up for work. ffs. At least they moved people out in the end.).
Reminds me of something. Whole lot of "Canadians" early in WWI and WWII showed up with weird accents more commonly associated with US states along the border. Canadian recruiters didn't exactly discriminate, and if you spoke English and said you were Canadian you were Canadian enough for their purposes.
I can tell you first hand that the way Canadians speak to and view other Canadians is different than the way Americans speak to and view other Americans. The way many of us view priorities in life is also quite different - I found when in the US there was a lot of "yolo" mentality and focus on self success, whereas in Canada there is a clear underlying theme of helping each other as well as ourselves.
