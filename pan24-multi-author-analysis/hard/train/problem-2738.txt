I'm old enough to know it was 2008, it was always 2008, the GOP didn't rebrand it from 2007. The market collapse was in twenty-oh-eight. Their lie is that Obama was somehow president then, because idiots think "elected in 2008" means "president in 2008". Trump was not president in 2016, nor was Biden in 2020.
Joe Biden has been a better President than we even deserve. A lot of the criticism against him doesn't hold up under actual scrutiny. I hope come 2024 more Republicans are up for debating because faced with actual facts they'll get destroyed.
The issue I see with most younger politicians is they are a lot more extreme which frankly doesn't help anyone. We need more moderate leaders that can at least attempt to represent most Americans, in my opinion.
I imagine the qualifier is to avoid alienating “moderate” Republicans who they hope will vote for them. (I’m not sure if those voters exist, but I understand the logic.).
Uhh. Biden blocked the sick time not the republicans he could implement an executive order tomorrow to fix it. Massive quitting happening right now and they can't keep up with hiring over it. Good luck.
