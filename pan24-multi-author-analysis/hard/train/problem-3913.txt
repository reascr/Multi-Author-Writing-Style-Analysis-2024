It's beneficial for the west to keep Putin alive in my opinion. So taking it into consideration you don't want to ostracize these doctors and meddle in any way. Let them keep him alive for as long as they can.
Putin is simply running Russia and her potential into the ground, which is very important and beneficial for NATO. Longer he is in the position, weaker Russia becomes.
Same was with Hitler, allies could take him down, but deemed his being alive better for war effort and making decisive defeat of the Germany closer.
Also you need to take into account that Russia is becoming weaker due to how Putin is conducting the war, which is very beneficial for the NATO.
No war in over 100 years has ended because the head of state dies, what makes you so sure this one would be any different when its clear most higher ups in Russia want that war.
Now isn’t the time to see Russia have a leadership transition as that person may or may not be worse and could escalate the issue as they would be an unknown. Most global leadership is familiar with Putin and his habits anyway, why throw a wild card into the game?
You’re thinking like a fool if you believe Russia with Putin at the helm is worse than a failed Russian state with a power vacuum. Like the other person commented, it would be a very bad idea for the country with the most nukes and a corruption problem to collapse. Everyone prefers a stable Russia with a rational actor in charge who understands mutually assured destruction and won’t challenge the status quo.
