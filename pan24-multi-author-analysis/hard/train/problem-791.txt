In my suburb I would say more than 50 percent of the homes in 2020-mid 2022 went to Wall Street backed firms. The for sale sign would go up and be gone in a day or two, often without the listing ever being published. Then it would immediately be put up for rent.
Or we could just treat single family housing as what it is, housing, and not as an investment asset class.
The only way to address the housing crisis is to build more housing and address the rent-seeking. More supply comes from destroying the artificial controls of the market, specifically the restrictive zoning policies. Eliminate it, or at the very least make it less restrictive. To address rent-seeking, replace property tax with land value tax. Most economists agree that LVT is the most efficient tax (due to lack of deadweight loss), will help remedy the housing crisis by encouraging more development, and will likely decrease the wealth disparity seen in the US.
Not sure what you’re trying to say here… LVT disincentivizes using it as an investment. It was quite literally made because someone thought that landlords were the real enemy of the people. Hell, the book that proposed it was probably one of the most influential pieces in modern political history.
