Probably somewhere where you could reasonably expect the majority of weapons to be moved in 1 sweep. (that way there's no time for criminals to stockpile weapons in between buybacks) iirc the buyback in Australia saw 60% participation. So... line is 0.6/person I guess. Well below the US. (And that's assuming we have the same level of participation, we absolutely 100% would not get as much participation, people here fucking love their guns).
However, Swedish style gun laws, which seem to stress the idea of "1-gun-per-person" and responsible gun ownership even in schools at young ages seems to me like something that could very easily be slotted into the US and would be a much more responsible alternative that would also help to change American gun culture from "I could kill 27 people in this mall more deader than anything that's ever died, and I'll wear a shirt that not only explicitly reminds you of that fact but also makes you feel pretty sure it might happen" to "this is my rifle. I shoot at targets sometimes and keep it at home for self defense." The most important part, however would be a full on "mental wellness" reform that makes psychopathic bullied kids and brain-rotted old hicks actually want to go to therapy.
It's also important to note that a European style of gun control would never work in the US because we literally have more guns than cars. Even if we did some large-scale gun buyback program, all we'd be doing is turning law abiding citizens into a free payday for any person with even mild criminal tendencies. The US has roughly 120 firearms per 100 citizens. Banning guns just isn't a thing you could feasibly do here.
It doesn't legal guns have very little effect on that. And gun crime is unlikely to go down massively until after decades. Also, confiscations are illegal in most countries.
