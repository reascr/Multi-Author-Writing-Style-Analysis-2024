Luckily it hasn't been a closed country in a long time, so folks with brains, other opinions and options have been able to move out.
Putin didn't rise to power, because of a coup. Russians chose him again and again. The majority still choose him and if it wasn't Putin it'd be some other "strongman". Many Russians are assholes in general, but especially when we're talking about the superiority complex they feel toward states, that used to be under Russian rule.
I don't mean to refute this because I'm honestly not very knowledgeable about Russian life, but I have to believe that many people living in Russia are oppressed or brainwashed by the ideology put forth by the government. I can't really blame the people for not knowing any better.
Perhaps the athletes should leave Russia and move to a better country? It's not a ploy to punish them, but an action to punish the government. There were a lot of great Germans who fled Germany during the Nazi regime. Perhaps it's time Russians flee their oppressors as well.
