Imagine if Biden decided not to run in 2024 and we were able to rally behind a young, progressive Democrat, then we could possibly get 8 more years of filling spots.
Imagine if Biden decided to run in 2024 and we were able to rally behind a young, progressive Democrat in 2028 and get 12 more years of filling spots.
Me, under Biden as he outpaces Trump: "This is what democracy looks like. The system is working exactly as it should and tbh he needs to double his pace.".
Me, under Trump: "This is a travesty and the result of a broken system. Trump is unhinged and is literally destroying the judicial branch with this psychopath speedrun of our nation's judges.".
This. And not only the District Court vacancies in the blue and purple states, but also the red states. Dems have focused on appointing District Court judges in easy-to-fill blue states so far because the GQP can block red state nominees by abusing the blue slip, which requires both Senators from the state to agree on a judicial nominee. As you can expect this intransigence to continue, Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin needs to consider abolishing blue slips for District Court nominees and pack the red state courts with Democratic judges. Considering the lawlessness and corruption of Trump appointees (just look at his appointees at the 5th Circuit!), these worthless hacks need to be put in the minority to stop them from fucking up the judicial branch even more.
