Lol. You can draw a direct line from McConnell’s reign during the Obama presidency to our current political shitshow.
I mean, McConnell has been extremely firm about stopping bidens progress/democrats progress so the bipartisanship is news, especially in light of the house debacle.
They worked together on the infrastructure bill, signaling the Republicans in senate being willing to work with Biden rather than obstruct. This is in contrast to what's going on in the race for Speaker which is the GOP unwilling to compromise.
>“He’s a man of his word. When he gives you his word, you can take it to the bank, you can count on it, and he’s willing to find common ground to get things done for the country. So thank you, Mitch. Thank you,” Biden said.
Well, Biden is white, so "bipartisanship," is back on the table. They can get back to working with Democrats while putting in their nasty legislation to make sure government breaks or remains ineffective and Democrats can go back to touting "bipartisanship.".
