I think it absolutely should. Because guns pose an increased risk to suicide. I don't know if you've ever been suicidal, but it usually looks like not having a lot of will to do anything at all and a feeling that anything is better than living another moment. If you need to swallow a lot of pills and agonizingly poison yourself to death or you need to rig up a way to hang yourself, you are less likely to do it. But if you own a gun, access to death is considerably lowered. The end result is that people that own guns and people that live with people that own guns are significantly more likely to die by suicide than people who do not.
Pointing out that suicide by gun is more lethal than many other forms of attempted suicide is not blaming it on the gun, it's just acknowledging reality. Red flag laws that allow for the removal of a firearm from someone who is suicidal is an example of common sense regulation that has saved lives.
Suicide by gunshot is still a gun death. Many other forms of attempted suicide are much less lethal. This is why in general men attempt suicide less often than women but are more likely to kill themselves.
