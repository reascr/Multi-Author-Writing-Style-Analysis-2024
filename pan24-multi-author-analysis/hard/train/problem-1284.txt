was arrested with four days of the FBI finding out about her leak. She was charged within nine days. And sat in jail without bail for over a year until her sentencing.
Don't let any bullshitters tell you "these things take time" or "you have to build a perfect case" or "you can't arrest him yet because he has the right to a speedy trial". The law is fast and effective...when it wants to be.
What you're saying is that he is being treated differently for political reasons. I'm saying the same thing.
It’s true. Most laws are to control the working class. I always felt that way but what opened my mind up more is when I was hanging out with this rich kid I met for a couple of months. He had a flashy car and he was driving us into the city. He parked illegally in a spot that said $250 fine. I pointed the fine out and he just said, that’s how much it cost to get good parking and left his car there. Most laws have massive fines attached to them and any law where a fine is associated is only there for the working class. Any elite sees those fines as the cost of business, those fines are the equivalent of paying $5 for them. It’s no sweat.
