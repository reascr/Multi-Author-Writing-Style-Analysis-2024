Even then - this would be an entirely different story had China simply been like "yo, we lost control of a stadium-sized balloon, and it's coming your way.".
It could be. The issue is. The US and Europe are together the 800lb gorilla in the world. But they still for economic reasons do business with bad actors. Europe only this month weaned off Russian oil - a year after Russia attacked Ukraine. Economics should only be w concern insofar as you need to manage resources to meet human needs. If you are meeting your own human needs while allowing another to fundamentally violate human needs, there is no net benefit there. Would you light a person on fire to keep a family warm?
How is demanding bilateral equal trade agreements imperialist? Why should china get to demand special treatment on what would otherwise be an open market?
We are in a situation where china is repeatedly sabre rattling in the Pacific snd using it's incumbency to demand concessions. These are not the actions of a good partner. And that's what I would really like here.
