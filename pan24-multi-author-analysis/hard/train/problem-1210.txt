'Asked to explain where liberal Christians fit into his theoretical Christian society, Wilson said they would be excluded from holding office, later noting similar prohibitions in early American Colonial settlements such as the Massachusetts Bay Colony. When it was pointed out that Puritans executed Boston Quakers, Wilson said he would not “defend” the hanging of Quakers, but then argued it was important to understand the context of the time.'.
Duh. Idaho is really angry about the influx of Californians into the area, thinking it’s going to be blue Californians and it’s like “Nah man: It’s a red wave.”.
As someone who (unfortunately) lives right on the border of Washinon/Idaho I can tell you most people are really pissed about all of these people from out of state moving here.
I live in Seattle and I've been to Idaho exactly one time, saw a gaggle of people in Confederate flag bathing suits at the water park and I said "this is not the state for me!".
Truly. I love that Idaho does not have any trauma one hospitals so anytime something major happens over there they got to ship their nonsense citizens over to WA.
