This has always been the case with Tesla, it's been a ponzi scheme cloaked in a legitimate buisness for years. Elon and Tesla have been lying about FSD for years, claiming it's 'safe now' and will be 'fully ready' next year, claiming that if you buy a car now it will drive itself around and you'll make your money back, pretending they've reinvented the trucking buisness and making it cheaper than rail. They call it Full Self Driving, even though it can't drive itself in many situations, and even when it can, you need to be behind the wheel because it's fucking dangerous. They've been getting people on this for years, because people buy the car because Elon keeps promising the software will be upgradeable to FSD 'within a year' for the past what, 7 years?
Because the entire buisness is built on lies. There's nothing wrong with having a tech demo and staging parts of it because the software isn't finished yet. There is something wrong with staging a tech demo when the people writing that shit don't actually know how to implement the stuff you're promising.
Software companies usually stage demos, they get the funding/grant/investors they need and then proceed to pocket half of it while delivering a broken product anyway.
Usually it's okay because you stage demos that have "a few bugs," and when you get the funding/grant/investors you need you can fund people to bring everything up to the level of what was promised.
I'm positive the engineers knew it wasn't ready, but Musk left things vague and let people assume it's ready and safe for use.
They might have very well assumed that Musk would say "we have a long way to go, but we did do this after a lot of trial and error.".
Yes. But the video says it’s done by the software and that the driver isn’t doing anything. That’s a straight up lie, according to the dev. That’s not normal at all.
