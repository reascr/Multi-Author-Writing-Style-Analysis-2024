Republicans are too dense to grasp the fact (or do not care) that Capitalism is mostly a Fiefdom with the Earl in his castle and the Serfs tilling the fields.
They are also too dense to grasp that Socialism ( which in their ignorance they insist is Communism) is actually Humanitarianism where society looks after its own whilst permitting each to profit according to his or her own skills and abilities.
When describing that socialism will actually mean more control over your work day and a claim to the money you boss makes off your work, it is more popular than the common American imagining of "socialism" of your taxes go up and maybe you get some more services, but maybe not and it all goes to the army and Congress's dumbest nephews' contracting firms.
Those public goods are technically socialist in nature, but when people are talking about capitalism and socialism, they are exempting all the things that everyone agrees government should provide. Both socialists and capitalists agree on those things, so it is pointless to include them in the debate. The conversation is only really over the parts where the two sides disagree. It is sort of like how you would assume a pacifist would still want to defend himself if attacked, even though that isnâ€™t really pacifism.
When you say you are a supporter of capitalism, that means you support a system where most goods are private.
When you say you are a supporter of socialism, that means you support a system where most goods are public.
i never understood why so many american Think that socialisme is bad... How could something who has for goal to mprove Social right is a bad thing ? Just sound very self centered.
