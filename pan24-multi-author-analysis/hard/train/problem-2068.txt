I'm not sure if Putin understands how surface to air missile defence systems work? I can guarantee he will be 'knocking down' some patriot missiles, that's sort of the point...
Right, so every one of his missiles a patriot takes out he'll count as a win cause it blew up a patriot missile as well?
Wait, that actually makes it easier for the Patriot missiles to do their job. If he aims Russian missiles at the launchers they donâ€™t even need to do any advanced maneuvering.
If Russia had the capacity to shoot down Ukrainian missiles, they would have already used it. So for the most literal definition of "knock down U.S. Patriot Missiles" it can be inferred that they don't have the capability.
HIMARS are surface to surface, so if they can't destroy them with missiles, they have no chance at destroying the patriot which is specifically designed to shoot other missiles down.
It looks like the patriot missile systems radar can be up to 10km away from the firing unit itself, then the actual command unit can be in a 3rd location. I didn't realise it was all split up. Good idea though.
If they could work it out, I'm sure they could swarm it somehow right? It must have something to combat that?
That would mean Russia would have to work out its location - something they haven't been good at so far. Slow, disjointed intelligence makes it pretty tricky to lock down a mobile target.
