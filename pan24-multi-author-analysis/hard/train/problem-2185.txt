"Don't blame Republicans" - if Republicans hadn't vetoed the earlier bill, Biden wouldn't be faced with his current choices of either hurting railroad workers or hurting millions of people.
So after Republicans voted against or filibustered the bill, the "casual observer" should blame... Joe Biden (because of course).
What this picture critically omits, however, is that it was Biden’s White House that originally set last week’s events in motion.”.
“Faced with these facts, it’s quite easy to see how a casual observer might conclude that the only obstacle to paid sick time for more than one hundred thousand railworkers is the obstinacy of congressional Republicans.
While I agree that the decision ultimately harmed the rail workers, it was the conservative that perpetuated the actual harm.
So, in reality, it was conservatives working to prevent the rail workers from getting their benefits, while they sit back and force the rail workers back to the lines.
“Even with the genuine threat of a nationwide rail strike, Republicans and (very likely) many Democrats as well could well have refused to give any ground — thus compelling workers to go on strike. This underscores another important truth in all of this, which is that Biden and the Democrats could simply have refrained from doing anything at all and instead hammered away at the message that the railway companies’ refusal to grant basic dignity to workers was risking a disruptive shutdown only weeks before Christmas.”.
