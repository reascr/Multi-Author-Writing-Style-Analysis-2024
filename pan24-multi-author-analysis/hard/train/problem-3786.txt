Your democrats aren't really left wing by any standards, while they are far better than the alternative I don't understand why you have so little power over who actually becomes president and what policies get prioritized.
We stop letting people repeat the "both sides are the same" horseshit, the "democrats don't do anything when they have power" bullshit, and all the other disinformation meant to suppress left wing voter participation.
but hey, you want to feel superior so you'll go ahead and spread the anti-voter-participation reich wing disinformation so you can claim to be above it all.
keep enabling the neofascists with your trolling bro, i'm sure that will help you enjoy watching them kill women and minorities.
we get it, you like the neofascists and enjoy shitting on their opponents and pretend they're the same to enable your side.
the "they're not leftists" crap is just propaganda to get fools like you to buy into it and not vote. so piss off with your neofascist-enabling disinformation.
