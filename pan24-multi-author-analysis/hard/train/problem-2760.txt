Problem is every time the virus infected another person, there is a possibility the virus mutate to another variant which can goes either way whether becoming more dangerous or milder. So now imagine 1 billion people in China having it. It is a 1 billion permutation there.
When the two numbers are "1" and "millions", that does not take a genius . . Also does not really contain any information at all to say the number is somewhere in between those extremes.
Should the US be involved in fighting terrorism abroad? Obviously yes. Should the US use drones for that? Well, yes, why not? Will there be instances of bad missions? Obviously yes, have to break eggs to make omelette. You can then quibble about the details, the quantity and quality, and the whole. But just saying that Obama did drone strikes should not qualify as a "real controversy".
Sure, then argue that or similar as a scandal, instead of just vague "drone strikes". But if Trump did the same or worse, then it is hardly a good pick as an Obama criticism in this context.
But you picked a real criticism of Trump and a manufactured criticism of Obama. Why not use either McDonalds diet (manufactured controversy) for Trump or drone strikes (real controversy) for Obama. Otherwise it's a easily dismissable statement.
