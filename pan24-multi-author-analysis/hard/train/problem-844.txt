McConnel said when it came to their mid term election that it was the quality of the candidate and in fact that too was proven during the midterm election with their failure to win a good number of seats in both the house and senate. It wasn't only abortion but Trumps involvement and poor choices that caused the Republican Party great losses. Hell the Democratic Party donated large sums of money to the most repulsive Trump candidates during their primaries so the Democrats would have a greater chance to win during the general election. However to this day McCarthy felt he needed Trump's endorsement regardless of the losing position Trump has put them in. Hell he went down to Mar-A-Largo after he condemned him on the floor of the House because reality set in in regards to how powerful Trump remained after Jan6. They can't win with Trump but they are unable to survive politically without him.
The Party didn’t pick Trump the Extreme Right Wing did. If the Party had it their way Trump wouldn’t exist. Hell, the base hates most of their leaders that’s why the call them Rhinos.
It’s his base with their power to primary people that made that possible. Gerrymandering helped to make this possible.
The Party Elite never wanted Trump in the first place. But it's the base that has a stranglehold on the Republican Party and they hate the Party Elite to include McConnel. They weren't able to convict him after impeachment because they knew full well they themselves would have suffered for it and some actually did. Those who voted to impeach or convict have either retired or have been voted out for the most part.
It is understood until you see they acquitted Trump on the second impeachment. He literally tried to overthrow the Republic and they stood by letting him off.
