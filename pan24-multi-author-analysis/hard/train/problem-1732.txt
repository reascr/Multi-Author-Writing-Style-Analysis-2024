I mean... It'd benefit the community as a whole if they actually prosecuted those gun laws when criminals get caught with firearms.
Yeah but take a look at how many mass shootings have happened in Australia since they implemented gun control laws and other gun control related measures.
Exactly! Sure some people might be able to get illegal firearms but itâ€™s way riskier to try that and the government and law enforcement can just crack down harder on that.
Yeah - I'm sure there's some gun smuggling going on, but these guys sound like crackpots rather than organised crime so I doubt they'd have access. Overall probably more profitable to focus on smuggling drugs rather than guns anyway if you're that way inclined.
Details haven't been released yet, but - contrary to what a lot of Americans seem to think - guns are not completely unavailable here. You just need to have a (lawful) reason to have one and get a license. Given where this happened (middle-of-nowhere), guns floating around is not all that surprising - but they're probably not the sorts of guns Americans go around doing their massacres with, as those are restricted.
They literally ran a story not long ago about cops getting dangerous firearms off the street and one of the guns shown on the table was quite literally a nerf gun, complete with exposed nerf darts. You can't make this up.
