No one is immune to propaganda, but if you know what propaganda is you can at least take a stance against it.
Are you saying the right is how they are because of propaganda alone? Sure there are irrationalist sheeps but there are much more "rational" reasons. Yes those reasons are utterly selfish and partisan but they are still rational, in the sense that it's humanly understandable. An SKn supporting NK is irrational to the extreme. It's not even like someone believing in tarot or shamanism for personal benefit. There is no benefit.
I mean, just to name a couple... the whole Halloween incident, the president's recent (supposed but probably true) swearing against Biden and generally making a fool of ourselves overseas, losing our position in UNHRC for the first time in history, the usual continuous exposures of politicians' shady activities, NK keep firing missiles lest we forget about them (which somehow triggers old people like my mum with minor war panic). Socially people are just becoming bitter, hateful, and just selfish in general, and of course, there's the usual economic panic, although these are apparently global patterns.
What part of "everyone hates it" do people not understand? If you don't believe in me fine but what is left there for N.Korea propagandize anyway? Did you know that even, no, especially the youth, the teenagers, are right leaning these days? They have differing opinions, but zero people dreams about what "N.Korea has to give" because they _only_ have a history of taking away from us. Even propaganda needs at least a somewhat plausible basis. They have none.
Nobody is. There are nutters everywhere. The issue is, how many people are nutty enough to follow captain poopless and would it pose a threat to the country as a whole.
