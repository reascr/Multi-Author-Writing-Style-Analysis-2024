There is very clear goal and end point. Goal is to get Russia out of Ukraine and it will end once that is achieved. Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan USA is not attacking. They are helping Ukraine to defend.
This is not complicated war with internal conflicts. This is very clear war where Russia is invading Ukraine and USA is helping Ukraine to defend.
Is the U.S. motive really to help the Ukrainian people though? I think that may be how we perceive it as citizens, but I don't think that's why we're funding the war.
The U.S. has lately been more open about urging Ukraine and Russia to come to the negotiating table. Some in the government and military are saying now is the time to do that, others are saying not yet because Ukraine has momentum.
How can you say it's not complicated? It's VERY complicated, and there is no clear outcome. We can pretend the clear outcome is for Ukraine to push Russia back to its borders until they retreat and end the invasion, but that outcome is highly unlikely.
Either way, assuming Russia will just retreat and everything goes back to normal is not possible. Russia and Ukraine have both suffered massive casualties, and huge population losses from people getting the hell out of the countries.
