Peruvian here, for those to understand the sheer stupidity of his coup, he did it without support of the armed forces, by not talking with key supporters, and in the middle of the day, while congress was in session.
The fujimori I was talking about is Alberto Fujimori, expresident of Peru from 1990 to 2000, who did a self coup in 1992 doing something similar as to what Castillo tried to do, but better and more organized.
The Peruvian congress is controlled by right wing loyalists of the previous dictator Fujimori, and they have been trying to impeach Castillo since the day he won.
The parties in the congress who impeached Castillo are supporters of the previous dictator Fujimori and his family, and Castillo has been a target for impeachment (which in Peru doesn't require cause) since he won the election.
The fact that we supported Castillo's impeachment do not change the fact that congress is absolutely fucked, which is why I assume changes in approval will be very limited even after the successful impeachment.
Yeah, the CIA convinced him to dissolve the congress, and then somehow had the ability and resources to get virtually the entire peruvian congress to vote to impeach.
this dictatorial power-grab gave the peruvian government all the reason it or anyone should ever need to exercize its impeachment powers. as apparently he's a wackjob populist wannabe dictator.
