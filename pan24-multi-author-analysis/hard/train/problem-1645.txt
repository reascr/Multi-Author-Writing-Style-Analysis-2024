Yes, so what? China is no threat to me and it’s other countries problem if they can’t build their own facilities for chips, nobody restricted USA for example to have such sites in California or any other state.
China will take Taiwan sooner or later, best everyone could do years before was not to let 1 company have basically monopoly over industry. If anyone in government really cared about national security they wouldn’t let own and worldwide military rely on small island that is Chinese land and especially while knowing that China is eager for unification of its lands.
That happened in 1949, and yes while many ethnically identify as Chinese, most don't consider themselves to be under the control of Beijing, hence they call themselves "Chinese" instead of Taiwanese so as t avoid disrupting an already unstable political environment.
Taiwan claims to be Chinese so as to avoid pissing off china. it is called Strategic Ambiguity, and it has been the go to policy regarding the Taiwan question for decades now.
Sure in the same way that the Nagorno Karabakh region is 95% ethnically Armenian yet the region is still Azerbaijani.
