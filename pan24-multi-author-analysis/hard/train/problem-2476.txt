I do think though, that we need to be honest about the state of our union. We aren’t a democracy, justice is only for the rich, and about half of our Congress is populated with traitors who committed sedition openly and on the record. I’d like us to dispense with the Pollyanna idea that “we better be careful or else America won’t make it!” We haven’t made it. The system called America is a failure. In my opinion we should be honest about why we failed so those after us can build something better.
The experiment is already over. We Americans’ perpetual optimism fools us into always thinking we still have “one more chance.” The fact remains our system has been defeated by racists, religious fundamentalists, and the resigned apathy of the ignorant.
You also say that we have the best constitution but you say the problem is that the government can bypass the constitution, which seems a pretty major flaw in the constitution.
The problem with our government is they are bypassing the constitution and exceeding their given powers.
Judging the past by today's ac and heat, grocery stores and internet luxuries standards is the biggest problem people try to judge by.
No country had ever created what the framers put together. A free society that offered social and economic mobility.
