Yea I remember that when you had to wait around and try getting on a website that would be booked up in seconds every time there were openings, and you had to look in all the cities near you too because they did a shit job getting the vaccines to where the demand was.
Moderna is going add this vaccine to their patient assistance program, so you can fill out a bunch of paperwork and jump through hoops in the hopes they decide you're poor enough to qualify for assistance in paying for it.
I'm not sure what you're even talking about in the context of Moderna offering free vaccines to those who are uninsured. Obviously in this scenario it doesn't "raise the cost of Healthcare for everyone" when the uninsured are now getting vaccines for free when they would have been $130.
But again, what they did makes healthcare more affordable for the uninsured. Those of us who have insurance will barely feel this change. The insurance pays a lot of the cost and we have jobs to fulfill the rest.
Those without insurance are simply left behind by society without this. This makes them have access to vaccines.
Shit job getting the vaccine to demand. You mean everywhere? They did a shit job of getting the vaccines everywhere? Personally I had multiple routes to access a vaccine. 3 in walking distance actually and thatâ€™s aside from the ones offered by my job.
