The debt is money America owes to itself and thats not a bad thing. Its mostly treasury bonds that Americans have purchased for investment either for retirement or to buy a home or anything really. Its safe and its secure. But the GOP doesn't want that money safe and secure in government bonds where they can't get at it. They want it dumped into the markets propping up the corporations they own so they can use it to profit off of. By threatening to default they will collapse the bond market. So where's all that money going to go? Into the stock markets, exactly where they want it.
That is why all these right-wing financial "experts" in the media scream and holler about the debt. Because they want that money so they can gamble it away and pay themselves huge fat dividends and bonuses. The whole "debt crisis" is a scam being perpetrated by the wealthiest to gobble up trillions of dollars of American's invested wealth.
Greedy suburbanites have bankrupted so many rich people and billionaires by taxing them into oblivion to fund their lifestyles.
Considering the wealthy in America have put up with being bullied and discriminated and threatened for the past 30 years that sounds fair.
That's why we don't consult you, we vote in Republicans like Romney and DeSantis that will plunder the program for us. We're tired of paying for the lazy who refuse to save.
Ok i will say you do provide a convincing argument. It's for social stability, and that's a fair point. I don't really know how I'd argue against that.
