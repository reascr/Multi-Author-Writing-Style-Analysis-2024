He strikes me as a guy who I can have disagreements with but still respect. I personally don’t think originalism is the proper interpretive method for the Constitution, but I understand why Gorsuch does and I don’t think he’s inherently bad for the country the way Thomas and Alito and Barrett are.
And he also seems to actually be an originalist, which, again while I disagree with I can at least respect that he has a view and intelligently argues for it.
I totally agree with you there, which is why I would never agree with originalism myself. Just saying, I'd have more respect for a judge who claimed to be an originalist and stood by those principles, instead of being a total hypocrite.
This is exactly what I don't like about it. Like, in concept there's no problem with a judge trying to in honest interpret documents as written and meant at the time. They might be wrong sometimes, but as long as they're well educated, intelligent, and doing the best the can I would accept that. But what we're seeing isn't that. Like with the recent voting rights act ruling saying racism isn't a big deal anymore, if SCOTUS were really originalists that wouldn't matter, because the law wasn't written to expire. Or with the Interstate Commerce Clause, there is absolutely no way they believe it was originally intended to govern things which aren't commerce and do not leave the home. You're absolutely right, their form of Orginalism is just a means to justify enforcing their narrow beliefs on the country.
