This whole article is full of bullshit. They are doing street value math the same way they do in America where they price it the most expensive smallest quantity sold then multiply it by what they seized. There's no total listed but it doesn't look like half a billion 100 keys maybe. Then they say it's enough coke to service the market for 30 years clearly lying about the market size. No one is shipping cocaine to get an roi in 30 years like it's some kind of cocaine mortgage lmao.
Well, the cocaine was adrift, I don't think they assumed it was destined for New Zealand. I think they were explicity pointing out that it was way too much cocaine to be headed to Australia or New Zealand.
"At a media conference this afternoon, Coster added: "We believe there was enough cocaine to service the Australian market for about one year, and was enough cocaine to service the New Zealand market for 30 years."".
Yes. Why would you only measure unrealized net profits? If they were going to sell at a loss would you say the company _gained_ money when the truck fell?
