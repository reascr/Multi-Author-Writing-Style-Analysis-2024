We dispute that congress lacks the authority and do not accept the argument that states can refute someone's human rights on a whim.
When another more substantive bill comes, Republicans will come up with every excuse they can to deny the rights it will protect. Whether this bill becomes law or not.
If this law helps codify that, cool. I'm sure the red states will join up in a lawsuit to challenge it, but that's better than citizens having to challenge 28 different states and their legalese justification. As hypocritical as the SC is, it would be absolutely insane to strike down Roe with the justification it wasn't a right established by Congress, and then strike down a right established by Congress.
States should not have the right to determine - against the US - that it gets to treat people unequally. Without going down the rabbit hole of history here about all the mistakes, the thing that matters most is the issue of federal taxes, and it should have been argued this way years ago. If a married couple or parents enjoy a tax benefit, it is federal level discrimination to not allow any 2 adults the choice of marriage. Love and religion have nothing to do with federal taxes.
