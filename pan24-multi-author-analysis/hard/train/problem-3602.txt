It's a PITA to balance the grid when everyone has their own micro production and that's going to get worse. I'm just waiting for regulation to come that says that if you want to be grid connected then you are mandated to allow the power company to remotely turn your solar cells off for grid balance reasons.
Hey we will install and service your solar panels, you just keep paying us the monthly utility bill you were paying the electric company. (Meanwhile, they will also receive all of the money from the electric company buying electricity from those solar panels on your property, even as you continue paying them, but they wonâ€™t tell you that outside of the very fine print.).
And yeah. It's fairly common for people to move into their old family home to look after their elderly parents.
I think it's often due to a family owning the land for several generations. Tokyo might be far bigger than you're imagining it to be though. While you're not going to find a little house with a garden next to one of the major train stations, you don't have to go far to find very residential areas with houses dotted between smaller apartment buildings.
From videos I've watched most residential single-family homes in Tokyo have small footprints since land is so expensive, so placement would need to be creative since roof space is also limited.
