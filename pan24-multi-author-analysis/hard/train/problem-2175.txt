Why do the Russians need so many foreign fighters? With a population of over 145M citizens, you’d think they could resource their own soldiers. Or, do they simply want others to die so Russians don’t have to?
Putin made sure, that Russians will die out in a few decades. Low birthrate, too many old people, most young men are dead or drunk. Russia has no future.
There's no loyalty to Russia. There's some fanboying going around, yes, but that's about it. Russia and China, however, have showed their support towards Serbia on the question of Kosovo, and now Serbia needs to act neutral if they want to retain those UN vetos.
Serbia has also never backed up Russia in this war as as far as I know, they have actually done the opposite thing and condemned the war in several UN resolutions and have joined the EU sanctions on Belarus for their role in supporting Russia in the war. The only “support” they have offered Russia is not placing sanctions on them, however this does not necessarily mean that it is because they support them in the war, rather you also have to take into account the Serbian energy industry which is solely dependent on Russia and Russian gas.
How is the country starting shit? You people seriously need to read past the headlines. The article says Russia is recruiting Serbian citizens and it says that the Serbian president and defence minister are urging the citizens to not go and fight as it is against the constitution and will result in legal repercussions. How do you then conclude that Serbia is the one starting shit when the Serbian government officials and representatives of the state are urging the citizens to say no to the recruitment and not go to fight?
