Ahh yesâ€¦ Freedom of speech = denying the holocaust, an extremely well documented and tragic event that stripped millions of people from families, lives, and the world altogether. Freedom of speech does not equal hate speech, they are two very VERY different things.
Freedom of speech is very straight forward. You are advocating for censorship. Look at history for how societies that censor vs those that allow free communication fare.
You mean freedom of speech, the essential part of a free society to be able to express your own opinion without government interference? That "freeze peach"? Because you're a complete nincompoop if you think it should up to some government bureaucracy to decide who is or isn't allowed to speak their mind.
It's a slippery slope when you let a government decide what defines hate speech and is therefore not within the "boundaries" of freedom of speech. Sure you might trust your current elected representatives to judge with perfect integrity and without bias what shouldn't be allowed to be expressed by someone, but what if let's say someone like Trump, Boris Johnson, Orban or Meloni got into power and was able to judge what speech is illigal. I think it's a dangerous precedent.
Such a childish and dangerous way you view the rights of others. What gives you the authority to decide who is and isn't a Fascist. Who in government do you trust completely to make that judgement? Don't you see how that precedent could be used against you, or someone you listen to?
