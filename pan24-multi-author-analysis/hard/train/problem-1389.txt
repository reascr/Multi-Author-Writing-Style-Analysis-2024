Any new variants will need to have one of those two or some combination of them, otherwise it would simply fail to outcompete existing variants.
The problem is that it's very hard to accurately assess which part of the competitive edge of a new variant is due to increased transmission and which part is due to immune evasion. The only way to accurately test this is by following a large group of people with no prior exposure to covid-19 or its vaccines and seeing which variants grow at which rate in this group. But finding such a group would be a monumental challenge at this point.
So titles like "most transmissible yet" are a bit inaccurate, because it implies that the new variant is more transmissible than the previous, while in reality a large part of the competitive edge is due to evading preexisting immunity. If all the "most transmissible yet" claims were due to each variant actually being more transmissible, then the current version would be the most contagious virus we've ever known by some margin. And while covid-19 is very contagious, it's not that.
The data seems mixed on immune system effects, but I can’t help but think it’s the effect of Covid. It’s the only factor that’s really changed. And now we’re just supposed to live like this? It’s really fucking depressing.
I have a young child who brings home all manner of colds and viruses. Last winter, I would get mildly sick when he did, but it wasn’t a big deal. We got Covid for the first time over the summer. Since then, he’s sick every few weeks, and I have been absolutely walloped. I had a double ear infection for the first time since I myself was a toddler. I also spent all of Christmas break sidelined with a terrible cough.
Anecdotally I spent my entire Christmas/new years time off sick from a cold. That wasn’t fun at all.
I had covid last year and it wasn't fun but honestly RSV was the fucking worst. 4 days of just 'no thank you' and then a week or so of mild 'ugh'.
