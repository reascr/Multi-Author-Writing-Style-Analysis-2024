In 5000 years future scientists will look back at the ruins of our civilization and scorn us for have the legal age at 18 when their legal age is 358.
The point is the age of consent is an arbitrary number. Some people aren't emotionally ready at 18 and some aren't emotionally ready at 30. A blanket age of consent is archaic and that problem will be solved in the far future. Just tacking on underage to everything to provoke an emotional reaction is pointless.
You could invent any ridiculous argument to make any side of any conversation look batshit crazy. The point is 18 is too young. Extrapolate whatever information you want but that's the base argument. The age of voting isn't an argument for the age of sex because it's supposed to be a logical choice. If you can't choose to put harmful drugs in your system until 21 how can you choose to put a potentially harmful partner in your system at 18? I'm not saying 21 is the right age either but 18 certainly isn't.
No, your argument in that comment was not that 18 is too young. Your argument was that any age can be too young and that it should be judged differently for each individual. According to that argument, someone arbitrarily judged to be old enough at 28 could be charged with statutory rape for having consensual sex with someone arbitrarily judged to be too young at age 28.
So in your “utopia” two 28 year olds could have consensual sex and one of them could be charged with statutory rape? That doesn’t sound arbitrary at all. /s.
