Also it seems to be that while the Russian military is of course engaging the Ukrainians, they seem to be focused on killing civilians more so than military.
I think you’re right. If it’s 1:1 then ukraine has Been suffering he’s only for pushing Russia back, which wouldn’t be sustainable whatsoever.
Under that kind of interpretation, it’s better to let Russia attack Ukraine and tell Ukraine that they won’t get a missile system if they can’t restrain themselves from shooting into Russia.
Yes, because Russia is afraid of NATO attacking it right now... NATO won't even let Ukraine launch missiles over the Russian border in fear of retaliation, but they're going to launch a full scale invasion of Russia once they see that Russia is running low on cruise missiles.
If we accept that Russia was able to invade Ukraine because Ukraine does not have nukes, wouldn’t Russia want to avoid any possible scenario where that logic could be used against them? Between that and the fact that international inspections occur, I’d assume that Russia is not even touching what they’ve allocated for nukes, even just as a way of maintaining an exit strategy for the war.
