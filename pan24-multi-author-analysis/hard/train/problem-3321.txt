Quit your bullshit, man, you and I both know that isn't what I said. Bad faith accusations of antisemitism in response to drawing conclusions from the policies in place in Israel tell a lot about how you clearly know you're lying.
I think rational humans will question why there are so many comments about Israel who outright lie or grossly exaggerate about whatâ€™s actually going on in the country. I only see claims of genocide, apartheid, and assassinations on Reddit for example.
Israel gets disproportionately criticized on Reddit which is why a lot people try to counter that by comparing it to other countries. There are many countries that do far worse things but you rarely see them discussed on Reddit at the same level as Israel. Why is that?
Why do you do this? Do you honestly think rational humans will say. A yes, somewhere else something happened, so that justifies Israel to violate the human rights of others.
Whenever there is any criticism of Israel, it doesn't matter if discussion is about apartheid over Palestinians, governmet sponsored assassination of a journalist, corruption of political figures, or LGBT rights.
Response is always the same. People are coming out of the woodwork to point out everything wrong under the sun, hoping that discussion will shift from Israel to something else.
