Very weird that this happens when the entire vote process and transportation for Szekelys in Romania is organized not by Hungarian elections officials but, I kid you not, the fucking ruling party itself.
In Orban's case though it is to get all the votes that he can from them and by sheer accident any vote against him will be lost along the way to Hungary:
What you say is true, but ignores the reality that Orbán's party effectively rules the country and what he wills, happens. If he decides on a law, it will get instituted within a day thanks to the emergency powers from COVID extended into emergency war powers. If he tells those in EU parliament to veto, his party's representatives are in a majority.
Orbán has deluded himself thinking that Hungary is a rising power that can play both the West and "new pole of power" against each other. He is a fool. Gömbösi tried that in WW2 and it ended up as turning us from an ally to the Nazis to becoming another occupied country by them, then later by the Soviets. All Orbán has become is Putin's last, still-functioning tool to disrupt the EU.
That's why both Trump and Putin (and now, Orban) can't be grounded in reality. Their own people would reject them if they were.
