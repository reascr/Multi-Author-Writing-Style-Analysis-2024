Other than the cost of their UAVs, the specs of their UAVs are just mid (not high like the US, Israel, Turkey... and not low like the Saudis).
The Iranian drones are effective because they're disposable and cheaper to send out for one way trips than they are to shoot down.
The IRGC has developed even cheaper drones to overwhelm AA defenses and allow the more important aerial assets to get through. It is a test of who will have more here.
It may be mid but it has its own perks. Gasoline engine means it has long range on top of a 50KG warhead for less than 50,000 USD is something to be concerned about.
The sources are Ukrainian so they would have propaganda. The majority of these drones probably did get shot down but that is kind of the point as to why they are so cheap.
So yeah, a swarm of basic drones against a bunch of soft targets in a low tech country… not that surprising that it’s ‘effective’.
Iran's strategy when it comes to using those UAVs, is overwhelm AA defenses via drone swarm (alongside ballistic missiles).
