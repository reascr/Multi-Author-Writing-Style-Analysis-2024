I have yet to find any left wing Spaniard that supports Russia. How could you? They are not only attacking Ukraine for their own benefit, but Russia is a far right wing country at the moment.
I think it is eaither a radicalized nutjob like you said, or some kind of russian attack/sabotage in a NATO country.
Strictly speaking, people stilll haven't come to terms that russia=/=communism and that being anti-imperialism, anti-USA and pro-russia can act as separate positions; you don't have to be pro-USA if you are anti-russia and viceversa but people don't seem to grasp this, much less consider it. And this affects both sides.
However, the situation now is a bit paradoxical. In theory, everyone supports Ukraine. In reality, I have met left wing people who defend things like saying that Ukraine is not a democracy; while also meeting some right wing people defending Trump as "he also did great good things you know" and criticizing the invasion while also defending that Putin was a great leader until the invasion.
In the US at least, it seems that the far right gravitates towards supporting Russia not due to any thorough analysis of actual Russian foreign policy, but just because they want to oppose any policy positions generally agreed upon by nearly anyone marginally less right-wing than them. While support of Ukraine remains a non-partisan issue for most Americans, regardless of the greatly differing opinions on the elected representatives administering that support, as those on the far right tend to only listen to information and conspiracy theories tossed around online echo chambers, Russian propaganda unfortunately still gets through to them.
