In a couple years, having a Florida high school on your college admission is going to put you at a serious disadvantage if you’re applying to anything that isn’t a state university or JC.
True, that would be the earliest point where they are able to see it because they'll be seeing high school and college graduates from Florida unable to do anything but low paying service jobs. But I think they won't care until they realize there is no retirement plan under desantis leadership besides having enough money already or dying.
Maybe the plan is to make the new generations so stupid they can be convinced that the old Republican voter demographic dying off is all Biden's fault so they keep voting for him?
I read an interesting theory about it. The plan might be to turn most of Florida into a resort / tourism hot spot. Their economy will depend on a handful of rich people living there and money coming in from out of state visitors. Ordinary Florida residents will be forced to do service jobs to take care of guests because they aren't qualified for anything else. Florida "education" will regress to your only realistic option being family trade. Some people will be born and raised to learn how to work at a fast food or hotel chain. If internet is monopolized and becomes expensive, families will probably stop getting it. Within just a few generations you'll have a population of dumb and ignorant people that rival that of the 1800s.
