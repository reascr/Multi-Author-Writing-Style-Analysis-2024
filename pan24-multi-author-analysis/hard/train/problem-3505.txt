And a friendship with Palin from when she was in the state legislature and Palin was Governor. I don't think Palin ended up running any negative ads against her either in the special or the general.
Looking at explicit votes for Palin (vs. Peltola/Blank) from Begich supporters it changed from 50.28% of voters in the special election to 66.8% in the general.
In the second tabulation round, the total republican votes were higher than 50%, but only 67% of Begich voters listed Palin as their second choice.
Yes but in a regular election it would be between her and Palin and those that listed her second would likely have just voted for her.
I do wonder how many Begich voters put Peltola as their second choice though, given that Palin abandoned the last elected office she held in Alaska.
11% of Begich's (R) voters decided they'd rather have Peltola (D) as their second choice rather than a Trump-backed Republican.
Thankfully many who voted for the 2nd republican listed Peltola second instead of a Republican 1-2 vote.
