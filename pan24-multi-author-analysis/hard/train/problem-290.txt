Donald Trump was a hate filled gollum and Ava Andrew Cuomo instituted policies that killed thousands of elderly people in nursing homes out of political convince.
It’s absolutely in good faith. Our political establishment is killing us and the Democrats being less evil than the Republicans doesn’t give them absolution. I’ll never vote for either major party or participate in their nonsense game of monied interests and pandering. The Democratic Party does not represent the working class and I will not be coerced into voting for my preferred abuser.
The Democratic party takes hand outs from the wealthy and connected too, and inequality is also an act of violence. But this was just killing as a means to an end. Mafia level shit from the highest office in the land.
Same party that rallies around "law and order, family and 'Christian' values, 'pro-life,' and 'government is the problem'.".
Yup. And at the time (2010-2017) Dr. Christine Grady (Dr. Fauci’s wife) was Commissioner on the President's Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. And Dr. Fauci was well into his research on the subject.
