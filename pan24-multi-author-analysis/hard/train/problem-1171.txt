There's a lot of regional rivalry in the area, but both nations are culturally conflict adverse- even their skirmishes in Aksai Chin have a "no firearms" rule, so when things get heated they beat each other up physically/ throw rocks at each other. The only times guns were used were as warning shots in 2020 in over 50 years (both sides claiming the other side started first, what most likely happened is one side mistook the other side as firing a shot).
But you're right- all of the 1900's China was getting wrecked from wars and unrest, and that made them very reluctant to engage in further conflict.
For all the shit China does, maybe that made them re-think just a bit about being in conflicts, or maybe not, since it’s within their own borders.
China is already dealing with financial problems and civil unrest at home, the last thing they want is possible nuclear war.
Nuking Ukraine makes all of that far far worse and would force a NATO response and would cause further NATO enlargement, something China wants to avoid as it could lead to war with the West, which could in turn lead to M.A.D.
A, help Ukraine with NATO which China against, lose partnership with Russia which give China no benefit but the long border will risk China in danger then;.
In case somebody doesn’t know, China has a agreement with Ukraine to protect them and give military support even send troops to help Ukraine defence only when Ukraine is under nuclear attack.
It was signed after Soviet ended, Ukraine give up nuclear power and delivered all nuclear weapons to Russia. In 2013 when Xi first takes lead in China he promised to Ukraine again. The agreement clearly mentioned Ukrainian have their right to choose their life, leader, socialist or capitalist, friendship with whatever west or east, as long as Ukraine doesn’t invade another country China will keep it’s words to secure Ukraine safe from nuke.
