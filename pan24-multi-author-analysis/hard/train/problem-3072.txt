This is so distasteful. “If they don’t like it here they can leave”. Come on man, the west is a diaspora of different cultures, races and ethnicities. Western ideology is intended to be welcoming and democratic.
Then due to lapse in judgment a potentially dangerous racist terrorist is released and does what racist terrorists do, commit acts of violence. I’m not condoning aggressive protests or counter aggression from police forces. But saying the whole “well if you don’t like it then leave thing” is kinda gross imo..
Again I really don’t want to condone violence whatsoever from any side in this issue. But there are systemic issues that led to this. A judge released this man (for whatever reason) when he was on trial for committing heinous violence (with a sword essentially for that matter) prior to his trial for that offense. He took that opportunity to hurt people. So don’t just say go home if you don’t like it here. The west is built on the movement AND settlement of various groups of people. They have a right to be angry, and it feels like you think they shouldn’t be angry….
I get that they're pissed. It still doesn't justify attacking police. As for the release of the perpetrator for the earlier attack - it unfortunately happens in many countries where sentencing is relatively lax. France isn't only country where violent offenders (even repeat offenders) have gotten what seem like light sentences.
As tragic as this is, legal system doesn't get all terrorists even if they're right in front of them.
In 2017 in France a guy who had plans to kill officers was let go due to lack of evidence. He later killed a police officer. Here's some information about that case:
