Right, but it averaged out to 5k/day over that period, it seems. So, NYC could handle that influx then, it can handle it now. They should really try building more housing, though...
Demand with less housing available. I’m talking about rent not house buying. These corporations are buying because it’s good business knowing the demand is there. More people, more demand raise prices.
Federal government throw money you mean mess up the rental market some more. You think citizens will be happy, biden starts giving section 8 vouchers to asylum seekers, while Americans are struggling to pay rent and can’t find housing? Pls tell me you missed the whole concept of inflation the past year?
Temporary visas is different from many just coming across, many are underage. And if a state relies heavily on slave labor, that state needs a reckoning for undermining American workers.
I live in a state that heavily relies on undocumented workers. Construction, tourism, hospitality/service, landscaping, agriculture. Our economy would not survive without them.
It is related though. If you shut down or greatly restrict the asylum process indefinitely or permanently how do you think migrants will respond? They’ll just try crossing the border illegally.
