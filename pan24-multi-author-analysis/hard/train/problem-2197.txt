Is that why he called them dangerous... Multiple times, and hasn't spoken well about them... really ever? Really seems like coddling and defending when you openly call them fascists.
First off, the proxy war is between liberal democracy and far-right fascism. Not just the US vs Russia. Sign me up.
If it takes a $4M missile to prevent a hit on a residential block in Kyiv, so be it. We can afford to wear down the Fascist Bloc economically with our more nimble & sturdy economies, and adapt our strategy with our more nimble & sturdy civil society. Even dumb-ass Trump America has failed to create the disorder, recession and panic of China’s zero-covid policies. And Russia’s mass conscription campaign is potentially a crippling political development sending them down the path of a failed imperialist war a la Vietnam or Afghanistan.
As for procurement, yea that sounds crap and potentially corrupt but we do have elected oversight and a free media to root out the worst abuses, unlike the Russian / Chinese / Hungarian / etc side. You can bet for every $1M Russia spends on a missile, the same amount or more disappears into yachts and blow.
In Ukraine they shoot down $10-20k drones and $100k-1m dollar missiles with $4 million dollar missiles.
But its an extremely unpopular discussion right now, Our military leadership only sees dollar signs and wants to get rid of perfectly functional equipment for ridiculously expensive and problematic systems. As an example we will probably be giving Ukraine our A-10s to invest further in F-35s which the military is already looking for its replacement. ...And defense contractors and the U.S. are focused on selling F-35s to other countries even though they have serious issues...Because money.
