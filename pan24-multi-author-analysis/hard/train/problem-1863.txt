Usually the transaction occurs because the child isn't allowed to buy beer. It's not like adults aren't allowed to buy condoms just because they become free for young adults.
The joke doesn't hold up to a real life scenario because French corner stores aren't handing out condoms to 14 year old skids. However, I thought it was pretty clear it was a joke, based on just the headline and not a sociopolitical projection of the near future of French suburbs. Seems I was wrong.
The joke is: kids sometimes pay shady adults to buy beer for them, the adults don't actually pay for the beer. The kids pay beer+incentive to the adult. So the joke is: now, the kids can just give the adult condoms and the cost of beer, and the adult gets free condoms, everyone walks away a winner.
Friend A: Oh that's interesting, so your father tell you that: "Hey champ, grab this bill of 10$ and go buy a condom for me so tonight I can fuck your mother".
Friend B: Yeah, and your that bastard thief whose father doesn't trust him to give him money to buy condoms...
Friend A: You are that bastard thief whose father doesn't bother to ask him to go to the store and buy razors.
