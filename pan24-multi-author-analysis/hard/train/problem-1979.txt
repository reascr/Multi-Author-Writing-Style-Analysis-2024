Horseshit, look around. Western Europe has a stronger middle-class than we do, and northern Europe is kicking everybody's ass. And that's not even comparing poverty stats. Wouldn't you say Europe struggled with WWII?
Fuuuuuuuck that, no that's obviously not okay. The only reason it's not realistic is that instead of better wages and benefits, the capital class is just extracting better profits and dividends. What is it you think the stock market actually measures? It's not the health of the actual economy or the state of the labor market or anything like that. It's a measure of how fucked over the producers are out of their cut.
You also have to be careful not to overstate the role of automation here. Historically and even today, manufacturing jobs are being outsourced faster than they are being automated, and automated industries have so far not led to reduced labor hours in that sector, just increased output.
While your argument does make sense, I'm not sure labor hours would be reduced, instead of gutting few laborers jobs outright, and then relying on the smaller size workforce to make up for it with increased productivity due to automation.
