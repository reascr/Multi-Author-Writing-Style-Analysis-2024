I can't imagine it'll do anything but help their economies. They just don't want Biden to have a political win, and they want to keep people as desperate as possible.
The first is they want to deny Biden a "win". Student debt relief is an easy issue to court the younger voters, since it's a prominent issue that disproportionately affects them. If the relief gets denied, then they can run ads where that gets listed as a "broken Biden promise" despite their obstruction being the cause of it.
It is incredibly transparent why certain people don't want this to go through, and hopefully they don't succeed. This is a good first step to tackling the inherent problems with student loan debt, and fully tackling the issue would be one hell of a reelection promise.
Whatever legal or economic reasons they list to block the debt relief, those are not the real reasons. There are two real reasons Republicans don't want this to pass.
This one point is the core of all frustrations I have with conservatives. Like, how do you not see that you're fighting for the elites, which you will never, ever be, and that the party plays on your emotions to get what they want, which has nothing to do with your own interests?
