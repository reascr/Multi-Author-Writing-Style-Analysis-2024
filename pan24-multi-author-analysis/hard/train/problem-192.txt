They started immigrating in larger numbers in the 1800’s with with the full consent of the rulers of the land, which was the Ottomans.
Jews immigrated to Palestine in increasing numbers in the 1900's, without the consent of the people living there. Some of the European Jews had a colonization mindset.
Jews immigrated to Palestine for a variety of reasons. In some cases, it was to flee discrimination and persecution. Though it should be noted that the discrimination ranged from outright being killed to simply not being fully accepted as integrated members of their European societies. Plenty of Jews who immigrated were wealthy and bought up land when they arrived. So it definitely wasn't a "refugee" situation where the Jews were all arriving with no clothes on their back.
