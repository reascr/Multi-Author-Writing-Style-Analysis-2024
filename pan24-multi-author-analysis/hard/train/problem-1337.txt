My friend is an Air Traffic Controller. They have some crazy strict guidelines for how long they are allowed to work. If i remember correctly they are required to take 30 min breaks every two hours and canâ€™t work more than 10h shift without taking at least a 9h break. I know trains are not airplanes, but a well rested operator is crucial in both fields.
I did both the railroad and the airlines. I'm an engineer / rocket engineer now (Specifically a specialized systems engineer but no one knows what that means). I make more than I did at either. Granted I might now have made more at the airlines but I've been making a lot more for 15 years now so I'm good. Oh, I get weekends off too.
So after that weekend they get the next day off, a bonus on the next check, and the wheels keep turning.
Yes, there are weekends where I have to be the bad guy and say we're working until it's done...but I've been on the other side too.
We've managed to make plenty of profit. The amount of ridiculous excess greed in the US has gotten bad. I refuse to allow the people that work for me to feel like they've been taken advantage of.
This is why I compensate my employees for any additional effort put in, on top of keeping a competitive wage.
In return, when I ask for the extra help to push through on stuff, I get it. No questions asked, and turnover is very low.
