This is my concern too. Without the Democrats asserting their considerable leverage in all of this, then the "compromise" Speaker will undoubtedly be much farther to the right of McCarthy. Democrats could positively prevent that, and get major concessions from McCarthy for doing so. Why aren't they? They need to brush up on parlimentary strategy.
Particularly if they could get some concessions from him. McCarthy was willing to allow the Speaker to be recalled if any 5 House members vote to do so. If he were Speaker, and beholden to Democratic votes to put (and keep) him in that role, that could be a serious win for Democrats.
If the outcome genuinely starts to look inevitably like the Speakership will go to some MAGA moron who's far to the right of McCarthy, then why wouldn't the Democrats want to help put McCarthy into that leadership role instead?
Given we had 4 years of a traitor President who 99% of the Republican House caucus supported and voted with, I’d say it’s a matter of when, not if, McCarthy becomes speaker.
We're seeing a lot of discussion about whether the Dems should either stop voting or vote for McCarthy to end this shitshow, as though they have some sort of responsibility to the Republicans to vote their way.
You'd never hear that even mentioned if the situation were reversed, you'd actually hear the media say that the Democrats need to "suck it up" and vote for a Republican as a compromise.
