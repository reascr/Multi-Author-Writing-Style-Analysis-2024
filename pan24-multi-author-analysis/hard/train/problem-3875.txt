Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who leaked information about U.S. surveillance programs, swore an oath of allegiance to Russia and has collected his Russian passport, his lawyer told state media on Friday.
It’s unclear whether Snowden swore the oath of allegiance at the same time as he was granted a passport, but the two are common procedures when foreigners become Russian citizens. The text includes swearing “to protect the freedom and independence of the Russian Federation, to be loyal to Russia, to respect its culture, history and traditions,” and to promise to “perform the duties of a citizen of the Russian Federation for the good of the state and society.”.
the article's headline seems like obvious clickbait that makes it sound as if snowden just randomly pledged allegiance to russia just because he loves russia and putin so very very much, when really it seems like he just did it as part of the normal process of obtaining russian citizenship out of pure self preservation.
yes, and seemingly obviously done to prevent any possibility of extradition to the US, which is just a no brainer move to make - if i had to choose between jail in the US for the rest of my life or swearing allegiance to russia, id swear allegiance to russia in a heartbeat.
