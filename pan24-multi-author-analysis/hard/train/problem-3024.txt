Since he knows who he sold what to he is quite useful in an effort to buy the somewhat more functional weapons back. Since it does not seem like anyone will do legitimate business with Russia he is extremely useful. The people who purchased the weapons can probably get away with selling the weapons back under the excuse that they never knew the weapons were stolen and when the rightful owners offered to BUY them back how could they say no?
(thinks for a moment about the fact that nobody would sell them a new gun to replace the one that was stolen).
"hey I got arrested for stealing your gun and if you bail me out I will tell you who I sold it to so you can buy it back.".
Yeah. The world can thank this mustachioed fuck for fueling the conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, rebellions in Congo, and Angola. So many died and shit is still a mess. The world can thank him for ensuring the African continent is awash with weapons. Obviously he isnâ€™t the only arms trafficking scum to operate there but there is no doubt as to the damage he is directly responsible for on the African continent. I hope this guy gets to join the other ruzzian felons on the frontline.
