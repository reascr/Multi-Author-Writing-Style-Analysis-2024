There are ways to punish lawyers and their clients who act in bad faith, like contempt of court charges for failing to comply with orders from the court. The client can also received default judgments and/or have to pay the legal fees for the other party. It's not as common for lawyers to suffer consequences, but for gross negligence and incompetence they can be disbarred, and a lot lawyers avoid working on frivolous lawsuits because it's just a waste of time that doesn't net them that much profit and could harm their reputation.
It doesnâ€™t always turn out the way the complainant wants, but there are plenty of examples of attorneys being punished for that kind of conduct.
Of course, when it counts in court, you don't present any kind of case at all. But it doesn't matter. You've already grifted your supporters for a ton of cash.
The way it works is you go on social media or OAN (because this stuff is even beneath Fox now, for the most part) and talk about all the evidence and proof you have. Everything is going to be exposed!
