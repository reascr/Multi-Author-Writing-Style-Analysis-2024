The reason that Taiwan is important is more because of their location. Japan and Korea contain the North China sea, the Ryukyu islands contain the East China Sea, and Indonesia and Malaysia contain the South China Sea and the Straight of Malacca.
All of them are US Allies. Right in the center of all of that is Taiwan; which protects the biggest water gap in the China Seas. This defensive perimeter effectively contains China militarily within its waters. Subs canâ€™t pass though Non-international water into the Pacific with this perimeter.
It becomes a significantly larger problem containing China without any of these key locations. With them, China could be effectively blockaded. Without Taiwan, it becomes virtually impossible. If China is able to escape this perimeter in any meaningful way, the risk is the capability of medium/short range missile strikes directly on US soil from submarines.
That being said, being surround by US-aligned or rival countries helps keep Chinese nuclear submarine assets bottled up in their immediate coastal waters. The gaps between Japan, Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, Philippines, etc. are choke points that the USN and their allies can set up sonar nets or sub patrols to detect and track the movement of the PLAN's nuclear sub fleet. The only sound course their subs can take is through the Java Sea, which again is a restricted stretch of water where they have to dodge any USN sub patrol that awaits them.
