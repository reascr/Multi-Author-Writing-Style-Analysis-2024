It’s fully backed by the constitution. Only way to declare it illegal is to fix the whole issue with the electoral college in the first place.
Only the US has an electoral college. In other countries, elections are decided by popular vote. Rural areas in Canada and Australia are doing just fine.
I'm comparing California to the nation as a whole. Obviously you can pick out specific states like Wyoming that have more representation, simply because each state has to get at least one vote.
Each state should send a single elector, who presents the number of votes each candidate got in that state. One person, one vote.
It’s not as a vote it’s self is different than any other vote. It’s more of a concentrated areas. I think the above person gave the examples of California, New York, Texas, and somewhere else. So let’s say I’m running a national election for president. I could easily see a world where candidates make promises for economic aid package. Is it fever only those areas in order to carry the vote. And there’s a natural disaster in North Dakota. Why are you even sign off on a FEMA a package so you’re gonna lose any votes up there but when it hits a population center can you make sure they get money up the butt. I just woke up. I’m trying to piece it together. does that make sense?
