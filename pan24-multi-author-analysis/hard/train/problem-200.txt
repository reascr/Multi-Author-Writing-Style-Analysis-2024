You mean like how Steve Bannon has never denied being 5 lizards in a skin suit that loves to smell Donald Trump's farts. I mean people are saying it, so it must be true.
What you do is make a big deal out of true, but pointless, stuff. Then link it to scandalous or illegal made up stuff. Put of bunch of hacked stuff on a random computer. Some of the content is true and verifiable. Insist it’s hunters laptop (unproven and probably bullshit). Insert a bunch of fake incriminating stuff. The dick pics are great, because it makes it seem like private stuff on a personal computer. And we know it’s impossible for people’s data (especially celebrities and other high profile people) to be hacked and exposed /s. So must all be hunters stuff and it’s so incriminating for…. His dad, who didn’t do anything illegal and possibly wasn’t even involved at all in any of the alleged activity. But, oh why the cover-up and all that…. Because it’s all slanderous staged BS.
These also seem to be falsehoods. Do you have anything other than the right wing fascist press telling us this? Are you aware of the laptop you're referring to is much accessed and altered copy of a hard drive purported to be from a laptop Biden once owned.
I'd lose my lunch. Every time I see her I get the impression she's just TFG in an ill fitting skin suit. I'm pretty sure naked pictures would include the necessary zippers, girdles and harnesses necessary to hold the elder Trump in.
Nah, it's just a manufactured right wing smear and fear campaign and it's been obvious from the start. The only "people" who care about this are right wing crazies and their dupes.
That part is right wing propaganda. Wingnut talking heads have said they have the documents to prove shady business dealings but refuse to show it. Meanwhile they're obsessed with dick pics.
