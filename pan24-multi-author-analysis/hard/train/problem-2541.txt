Those were not installed by Putin, but by the propaganda machine. It’s Nazi Germany level, for real, with all the independent sources of info locked out, so most people don’t know any better than to believe it.
I’m the biggest Putin opponent you can find having left Russia right after the war broke out, but it’s pretty obvious, if you follow his logic - it doesn’t matter how flawed it is, he still thinks this way - then nuclear strike in Ukraine would also do the same thing (i.e. end war and thus prevent loss of lives from both sides). Now the difference is that US would have won the war anyways with additional casualties, while Russia is on path to lose the war, so this is not the same situation.
He believes NATO wouldn’t be ballsy enough and wouldn’t risk getting involved directly in the conflict as this could quickly spiral into the nuclear war.
Why he hasn’t done that is somewhat obvious: once he strikes, there would be 0 support from China or India.
Why do you think India and China, who each have their own goals on the globe, remain neutral, maybe slightly pro-russian in a passive way, in this conflict despite the risk of the global devastation by a crazy neighbor? Because in talks with their leaders Putin shows level of sanity enough for them to remain neutral, which means no global devastation on the table.
In the same way, why do you think each time Putin gets into conflict with Turkiye he's forced to back off? Because Turkiye doesn't care for Putin's bullshit. They know that Putin is all talk.
