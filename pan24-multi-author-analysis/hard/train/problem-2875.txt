Depends on if it was a repurposed s300 being used to hit a ground target or if it was a kalibr missile. If the debris is an s300 then debris alone won't tell you who it came from. There's also a very real possibility that it was fired by Russia but in the interest of de-escalation, this is the story being told. It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to publicly state Russia fired a cruise missile killing Polish citizens if they don't want to escalate because of it.
I also wouldn't past western governments if they really believed it was an accident on the Russian part, to say it was Ukraine Anti-missile fire to keep things from heating up more.
Would also explain why both sides deny it's theirs; Russians have a missile shot down, because it was, and Ukraine have a missile that shot down a Russian one, but failed to detonate. Result being the Russian missile is thrown off course, and explodes in Poland.
Volodymyr Zelensky has "no doubt" that a missile which landed in Poland and killed two people was fired by Russia.
Speaking to reporters, Mr Zelensky said: "I have no doubt that this is not our missile. I believe that this was a Russian missile, based on our military reports.".
The incident is still under investigation, but Polish President Andrzej Duda asserted earlier today: "Ukraine's defence was launching their missiles in various directions and it is highly probable that one of these missiles unfortunately fell on Polish territory.".
There was no suggestion that this was a deliberate attack, said Nato Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg.
