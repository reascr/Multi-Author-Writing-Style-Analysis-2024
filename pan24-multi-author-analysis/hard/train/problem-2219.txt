But even more damning than the public outrage is perhaps that even leading Swedish experts on primate behaviour have come out and condemned the park’s handling of its chimpanzees and the entire situation. Saying that the zookeepers had a lacking relationship with its chimpanzees. That the chimpanzees had no trust in the keepers, which made the situation way worse. And that killing them was completely unnecessary. The experts also say that it would be nearly impossible for the zoo to keep its remaining chimpanzees now, since the chimpanzees have been deeply traumatised by the event and have lost all trust in their keepers. Before this event, the zoo was also part of a research project on the cognition of great apes together with Lund University – one of Sweden’s leading universities – but the university has now decided to suspend that cooperation.
The more news that are coming out about the Furuvik Zoo, the worse it looks. I highly doubt that they will able to keep their remaining chimpanzees after this.
PS: Your point about a human life being more important than that of a Chimp I would dispute such a charge.
There are many humans off the top of my head that I would gladly sacrifice over the life of any Chimp….
It’s immaterial to you if the facts prove me right because you’re simply unwilling to accept them, regardless.
The sky is red by the way, if you say otherwise you're unwilling to accept "the facts", after all my word is enough to claim something as fact, as you have.
