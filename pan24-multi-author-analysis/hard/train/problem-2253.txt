Flynn prevented the US from retaking Raqqa at Turkeys bequest. This allowed for many key ISIS leaders to escape. Not sure how betraying your country as a unregistered foreign agent serving in a cabinet doesn’t warrant a court martial/jail if not death….
Wouldn't you want to find out about possible illegal or unnecessary dangerous actions that these military members were forced to take part in?
There are no orders when you are retired so no risk. And former military people are actually GREAT! to hear their valid criticism related to military because they are the ones the closest to the issues they are bringing to light.
No, if they are retired then it should be totally acceptable. The whole reason against wanting military people to speak out against the POTUS is so that you don't have to worry about them not following a order because of political reasons.
Frankly, I’m not sure I could respect any military leader who DIDN’T take a critical view of trump. Whether they publish it in a paper or just hold those views…doesn’t matter to me.
