Itâ€™s the same as if a man or woman were born without an arm, they would still be genetically man or woman despite the failure of a limb to develop.
What about people born appearing 100% female, complete with the bits, but are genetically males? Who can they have sex with without sinning? According to the bible, are they men or women? Are Christian hardliners going to be happy with 100% female looking (from birth) males marrying women? Something tells me they won't.
Was God wrong when he made these people this way? Is their very existence sinful? Typically, hardliners and far right will get extremely angry when you point this out because its impossible to square these facts with their narrow worldview. They get even madder when you ponder which bathroom these people should use. "well, if they look like a guy they should use the mens bathroom" - then you point out by their logic that trans people should use the "wrong" bathroom and they meltdown.
The most hilarious thing to me is that many of these "testosterone insensitive males" are indistinguishable from XX females, and many of them never find out. The consequence is that thousands of bigots have been in a gay marriage their entire lives and are banging men regularly with no clue.
So when bigots and religious hardliners tell you transsexuals and gays are "not natural" you can point out that God made some people that way. And that some conservative/religious men are in gay marriages and having gay sex their entire lives without knowing.
