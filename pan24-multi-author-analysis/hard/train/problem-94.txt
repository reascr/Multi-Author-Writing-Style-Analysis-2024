It may vary by state, but I think you gain more by supporting gay marriage than opposing it. They don't have to go out of their way to support it, but they shouldn't oppose it. Conservative politicians could use gay marriage as a bargaining chip to get support for something they care about.
It doesn't force a conservative State to issue gay marriage licenses, it just forces them to accept those already made in progressive States.
I think this will have a negative impact overall, it feels like they're teeing up a republican judiciary to make a "States' rights" argument against gay marriage. Especially after a Justice.
This isn't the big win that everyone thinks it is. The goal was to codify the right to same sex marriage in every state, and that's not the Respect for Marriage Act does:
This is great news for marriage equality. But remember, 36 Republicans, 70% of the Senate GOP, voted No on marriage equality, on interracial marriage and same sex marriage, in 2022!
It's over 10 years old at this point but here's a showing how popular support for interracial marriage took about 40 years to climb from about 10% to 50% from 1955 to 1995, while support of same-sex marriage went from \20% in 1985 to majority approval in 2011.
The big difference being that with regard to interracial marriage, full legal access was granted in 1967, back when not even 25% of the population supported it. It took until years after majority approval for gay marriage to be legal throughout the country.
