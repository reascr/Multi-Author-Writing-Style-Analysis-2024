I suspect (with no evidence whatsoever) that Feinstein would have endorsed a non-Porter in her retirement announcement and Porter needed to beat that to the punch.
I suspect (with no evidence whatsoever) that Feinstein would have endorsed a non-Porter in her retirement announcement and then promptly forgot she retired and announced she was running again.
Porter jumping in early indicates to me that they believe Feinstein was going to run again , and declaring early might be a shot to Feinstein that she will be challenged strongly in a primary and should retire.
Not sure why you are getting so excited. It was an honest question. She is my representative and honestly I’ve never heard of here proposing any substantive legislation or catalyzing any important debate (since the early 00’s).
I don’t think Feinstein believes she is done. She’s delusional and suffers from dementia at the very least, and obviously has a huge ego.
I don’t really care about chairing a caucus that doesn’t do much, but the Steering committee is an important qualification for leadership.
