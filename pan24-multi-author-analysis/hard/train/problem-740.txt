The US, for all of its flaws, aims to stabilize the region. Someone has to be the adult in the room. Nuclear weapons are rightfully only utilized as deterrent. There is a reason the US makes no threats. The threat is implied, and nuclear weapons won't be necessary.
Yep, that's the status quo, and yet still NK pushes it at times. It's been a while since NK did something dastardly, but the threat exists.
It’s also really weird when they make threats like this, the world knows that within two minutes of them crossing that line, they become North Krater. Their “threats” are entirely dependent on mainly the US being mentally stable and not doing anything to the unstable manchild having a tantrum, them getting lots of foreign aid (mostly food), then rinse and repeat when that food runs low. It’s a bizarre dinner bell to fire a missile into the ocean. But that’s how they do, I guess.
That and honestly, I really do think they feel like a jealous child with the world being focused on Russia invading Ukraine and not paying attention to North Korea.
