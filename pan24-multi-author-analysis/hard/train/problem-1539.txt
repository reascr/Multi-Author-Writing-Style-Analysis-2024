0. Israelâ€™s parliament is a shit-show of so many sectors and parties, the new parliament has 10 parties and the last one had 13 parties. It is very hard to form a coalition in this political environment and for the last some years we had elections almost every six months.
1. He made a strategic mistake by not lowering the minimum percentage for parties to enter parliament, which made Meretz (left wing party) and Balad (Arabic Democratic Party) not enter the parliament.
However, as the poster above noted some leftwing parties refused to merge and some even split, while a lot of traditionally leftwing voters strategically voted for Lapid's center party, causing some parties to not make it past the threshold and all the votes they got to be wasted, giving the pro-Netanyahu bloc a significant advantage.

Israel's political system has multiple parties which means the progressive votes get split between candidates and Netanyahu has always been elected with a minority of votes. He's never had a majority of votes.
