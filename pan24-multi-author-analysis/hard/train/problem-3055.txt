They're nothing alike. Falun Gong was suppressed by Jiang because it was nearly a religious movement, and Jiang was terrified of religion.
A foundational belief of Falun Gong is that the CPC is illegitimate, so it's not a surprise they got suppressed. I'm not shedding any tears, it was an insanely racist cult. Li Hongzhi is not an idiot, he knows he can't actually levitate, he's just making this stuff up to build a following in order to influence Chinese politics.
This speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese governance. The ones with true power, like Jiang, don't need to hold office. Jiang stacked the party with loyalists so he could be certain he would be able to continue influencing politics despite being formally retired. Xi needs a third term because he lacks a clique he can continue to influence upon retirement.
Falun Gong is China's version of QAnon. China's solution was heavy-handed, but most Chinese would argue it was necessary to prevent the unrest we in the US have to deal with due to our political cult, QAnon.
The problem with China is that, especially since the last 4 to 5 years, and particularly worse since COVID, is that "politics are of the highest importance". Every decision made are fundamentally "Party First". In October they even stated clearly that . Trade agreements and whole markets can be shut off at notice if they are against the will of the party (or Xi).
