Either by returning it to the states, via a law passed by Congress, or an amendment to the Constitution.
More to the point, there is an amendment already limiting the governments' say on what a person can do with her own body. The 9th Amendment is pretty clear on the subject: no new laws at the expense of existing rights.
If what I said about the 10th Amendment isn't true, what law (federal, state, or local) makes it legal for you to eat breakfast?
If the equal protection of law clause of the 14th Amendment doesn't mean laws can't be written that affect only some citizens, explain what you think it means.
If the rights and immunities clause of Article IV doesn't mean a citizen's rights extend beyond the borders of her state, explain what you think it means.
Add to that the universality of law clause from Article IV, and the nondiscriminiation clause of the 14th Amendment, and you get a clear case for why you canâ€™t write laws that affect some citizens and not others.
The person I responded to said there needs to be an explicit amendment in the Constitution saying that people have a right to abortion, but that isn't how individual rights are discussed in the Constitution. The Constitution limits what the government can do with respect to people's rights, not defines what is or isn't acceptable for individuals. Again, consider the 10th Amendment: if it doesn't say "unless there's a law saying otherwise, it's legal," what gives you the right to be posting inane comments on Reddit?
