He wasn’t “questioning” whether it was real or not. He claimed that the families were crisis actors and spurred threats of violence, swatting, and actual attempts on their lives because of his rhetoric. He was sued for damages, and the court found that he knew what he was saying was false.
I hope you realize that ideologically, Putin and his followers are much closer to the GOP. Right wingers love to project fascism onto the left but never care to take a hard look at what GOP candidates are actually saying.
You’re side-stepping the question. What actual political beliefs do leftists share with fascists? And why is that at all relevant to the failure of economic systems that aren’t doing much worse than capitalist America? You don’t just get to say “they don’t like freedom” without specifying the specific policy.

Free speech is enshrined into the Constitution, alas courts always interpret the laws on speech in favour of prosecution.
