If congress would provide some laws, we wouldn't need over a century of case law that comes up with these contrivances.
It's not like the concept isn't a necessity. Congress has refused to take action, and it's hard to imagine a functional economy if businesses didn't have things like 4th and 5th amendment rights. And it's hard to imagine customers being very happy if their purchase history, patient records, etc were completely open to any governmental entity on a whim rather than generally being gated behind a warrant. I don't want the local evangelical DA to have my purchase records from the local sex shop without an cause so they can try to turn my life upside down because they don't agree with my lifestyle.
There are plenty of businesses that have data that you want to be private that are unavoidable in everyday life, such as a bank, a doctor's office, a psychologist, a pharmacy, etc etc. Your dealings with them are largely predicated on the knowledge that your data is protected from unwanted and unwarranted intrusion at some level, backed by law and contract, and if they did not protect that data you would go elsewhere.
Explicit legislation that does not say the business has a right to protection against government search and seizure, just that they have to take care to protect data. Without 4th amendment protections, the cops could still show up and take records regardless of the laws that govern how a doctor's office secures and shares your data(that's the whole point of the 4th amendment in the first place).
The 4th amendment doesn't prevent you from releasing information in your possession if you choose to do so, it prevents the government from (illegally) seizing that information when you don't want it released.
