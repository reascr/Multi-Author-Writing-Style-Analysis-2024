They suspended involvement in November. Terminating their membership now. They're feeling some sense of security from a partner to continue pushing Russia out of their lives.
If this is so predictable, why do the Russians keep cooperating? Because they have no other choice. The Russians need some sort of victory to salvage the reputation of their leader. They canâ€™t simply go on the defensive themselves, it would look like an admission of defeat.
Most people here disagreed with me, arguing that Ukraine ought to keep up the momentum and keep conducting offensives until the last Russian soldier ran for the border.
Not to mention how highly motivated Ukrainians are, and experienced with warfare, and even that isn't mentioning that any resistance would be receiving western support.
Russians remain proud of invading Ukraine and committing horrific war crimes, incapable of learning from their history of brutal violence against neighboring countries.
"We can say without a drop of exaggeration that Vladimir Putin took upon himself a historical responsibility by deciding not to leave the resolution of the Ukrainian question to future generations.".
