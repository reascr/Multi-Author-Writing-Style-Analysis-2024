Honestly, I would have no problem with this being part of a field trip, but it's inappropriate for taxpayer funded schools to be hosting religious ceremonies. With this ruling, every religion has a legal argument for coming to schools and proselytizing under the guise of pedagogy.
Religion is an aspect of culture. Indigenous ceremonies are religious ceremonies and to say otherwise is extremely disrespectful and belittles their deep spiritual significance.
My general position is that religion should be kept out of schools. If instead of a smudging ceremony, it was a catholic priest baptizing kids at school, then I'd be just as outraged as most of you all would certainly be.
if a Christian group wanted to come into a school and, say perform a baptism while kids watched and then cleanse the classroom of demons by waving around some incense as a demonstration Iâ€™d tell them to get fucked.
If they had some Christian ceremony where kids were forced to participate people would be up in arms. This seems no different.
See, this is where we differ. Because you're seeing a bunch of children being forced to engage in MaGiC sPeLLs and I see an acknowledgement of another culture's hokum, as opposed to Christian (or Jewish) hokum.
