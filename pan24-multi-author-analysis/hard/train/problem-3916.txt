These subsidized lunch programs for all are a very poor use of public dollars. The vast majority of families can afford to feed their children no problem which means most of the money spent on this program isn't going to those who need it. I'm significantly more in favour of taking all of the money the lunch program costs and to just straight give it to the bottom 20% income earning families. Nearly all social programs should be income based to ensure it goes to those that actually need the supports, not buying lunch for wealthy people's kids.
Tax the rich with a progressive tax and fund universal free lunch at school so that there is no means testing or admin costs to sort out which kids are “needy.”.
I was asking the above poster what his point was re: groceries being cheaper a few years ago. How does that change the fact that kids were going hungry then and are more likely to go hungry now, as you pointed out.
I can’t think of a BETTER use of public dollars than r make sure kids don’t go hungry while they’re in school, regardless of the circumstances of their parents wealth.
