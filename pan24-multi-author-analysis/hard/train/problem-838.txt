The fact that this is in the same subheading as trans people sends a pretty clear message of where Republicans' minds are at.
I've read the bill. The part about non-human identity is a single bullet point. The bill is mainly about tormenting trans people.
They are going to attack schools who seek to be kind to trans kids. The message is not the whole litter boxes bullshit. The message is Republicans want trans kids dead rather than alive. Republicans are trying to extirpate trans people from the earth. It is horrible.
Oh damn, yeah, that's pretty bad. Seems like it was from the Opie and Anthony Show in 2005 and resurfaced last year. I can't recall ever having heard anything similar on his podcast though it's not like he took live calls (or that I listened to every episode). I more remember him always saying that nobody should take anything he says seriously because he's an idiot. I was okay with that explanation for a while, but then he started to really give a huge platform to fuckheads like Alex Jones and I lost interest in listening. I don't know how bad he's gotten since going to Spotify (and full Republican). If he's doing shit like in that bondo clip, then fuck him.
He doesn't really act like an expert in any subjects unrelated to MMA or comedy, he just has a huge fucking audience which he sometimes exposes to phony experts.
