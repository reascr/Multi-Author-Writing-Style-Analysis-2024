If a Republican ripple takes away control in either the House of Senate that is still essentially a wave because absolutely nothing will get done for the next 2 years and then voter apathy will get worse and like every other damn election Democratic voters will get disenfranchised.
the fear is that if the republicans win, they're going to keep their maga extremism rolling, de-legitimizing the democratic election system, pushing laws through to the SC which has been stacked in their favor, and ultimately using that combination of election-disruption and bypassing congress via the SC to gain authoritarian power, a la ww2 Germany.
Revoke the publics access to politics through voter suppression and ultimately by making opposition parties illegal- again by calling them violent extremists groups.
the cherry on top is that because they're using , even if the dems win theres fear that the midterms will be used as a to incentivize further political violence and extremism.
Separate everyone into groups, crown one group as "the pure bloods"Assign economic/societal blame on the groups that arent "pure bloods", thus 'othering' and demonizing them.
