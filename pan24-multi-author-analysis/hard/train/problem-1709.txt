British military intelligence believes the conditions of the battlefield are quickly turning against the Russians’ favor, as forecasts of warmer weather in the Donbas mean snows will melt and the ground will soften, making the swift movement of troops and heavy vehicles near impossible.
Those conditions are likely to be at their worst “with extremely muddy conditions, over mid-to-late March,” according to the latest intelligence assessment.
So on the anniversary of the start of the invasion, in which its forces became bogged down in mud, Russia will start another offensive in which it will be bogged down in mud.
Add in that Ukrain would have to do (artillery) strikes on Russian soil, and any miss will be used by Russia to start a media circus.
But yea, we really should use this as an opportunity to buy fresh new, state-of-the-art weapons to bully Russia with.
We all thought the Russian military was super strong before this war; Ukraine was no different, and the Russian generals knew this. Its just that they fatally miscalculated the actual effects of that thought on their enemy. And here we are.
It is not deranged to think every single person in the russian chain of command thought intimidation would be enough to win; when you know (or think) you have arguably one of the best propaganda machines on the planet, you're biased to think everyone thinks about you the way you think they do.
But Ukraine troops did reacted decently at the first Russian incursion that first day of the war early in the morning. They didn't let Russia use that airpoirt near Kyiv to get tanks and supplies near the capital; and Moscow probably didn't expected that, and thus rushed a plan b attack, that failed and led to farmers having tanks.
