It's just gonna be a matter of whether they can get their people to march in lockstep, and I'm really hoping that the midterm results mean the party's fracturing into sane Republicans and MAGAs.
And I suspect this will make republicans say “Okay, we'll work with you on xxxx, xxxx & xxxx, but we want concessions on abortion, social security, and climate change.”.
This way Dems can say "We made good faith efforts on bills X, Y, and Z and Republicans wouldn't even come to the negotiating table" going into 2024.
This isn't naivety on Biden's part. I'm pretty sure he's well aware of what he's in for with a Republican house. This is his way of making it public that he's willing to work with Republicans, while knowing full well they won't do a damn thing to compromise.
What you are failing to mention about Obama and his presidency, was the absolute, sheer stubbornness of the Republicans to work with him on anything. They wanted him to fail, utterly and completely, period. And most of that was racism, plain and simple- we a had very well educated, very well spoken man who could have gotten a lot of great things done, but since his is black, the Republicans absolutely could not allow him to accomplish anything. I agree that what President Biden has accomplished is what should have been done during the Obama terms, but the racists would have eaten the Republicans alive if they had worked with him. And far too many billionaires and millionaires are not afraid to let their racism be on full display.
