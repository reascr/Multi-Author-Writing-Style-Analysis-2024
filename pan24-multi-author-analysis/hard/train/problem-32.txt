Tbf, historically speaking, Czechoslovakia were in the same situation during the advent of World War II when Allies(UK and France) dictated the peace terms about the issue of Sudetenland with Germany without Czechoslovakia's intervention or consultation on the peace terms.
So them stating this didn't came out of the blue, it's just something to remind the West/Allied Nations.
Their inability to do so was made clear in March, but that doesn't mean they aren't too dumb to try with any non-NATO country. Ukraine is certainly the bastion against Russian expansion in the long term.
At present the west have said that they intend to continue supporting Ukraine’s efforts to fight Russian aggression inside of Ukraine.
The reality is, there is a lot of support for Ukraine in its battle against Russian troops inside of Ukraine.
Ukraines fight is also helping to protect the west from Russian aggression, and the other countries realise this. That’s part of the reason why Ukraine is receiving support.
Pretty ballsy to say that when it's the West that's funding Ukraine. There would be no peace talks to have if Ukraine didn't have western military equipment support and Russia steamrolled through.
The wise thing for Russia to do, would be to wide draw their troops, if they fail to do that then Ukraine will force them out.
Although being shot dead or blown up, is another potential fait that the Russians choose if they don’t want to move.. Getting out of Ukraine would seem to be the wiser choice.
