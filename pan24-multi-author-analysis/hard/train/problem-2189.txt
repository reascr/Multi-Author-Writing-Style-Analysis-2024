Are you sure? They are setting the age of consent to be 16, and generally what that means is that it is legal for anyone to have sex with someone 16+ if they consent. I know nothing on Japanese law, but many states in USA have the age of consent being 16 which means it is legal for 16 year olds to have consensual sex with people of any age.
(Also, technically some US states have a minimum age of consent of 13, but that has a maximum age gap, like the proposed Japanese reform).
Japan, like most other places that have age of consent laws take this into consideration and have "Romeo and Juliet" laws that make the 18 and 17 year old scenario legal.
No prefecture has an age of consent below 16 so practically it is already illegal to have sex with anyone below 16 (or 18 depending on where you are) everywhere in Japan.
Well, technically the age of consent was already 16 to 18; but this was set at the prefectural level. What this change will do is shut down the marriage loophole that some prefectures have (and exists in some US states too).
This is actually the loophole that the Japanese reform would close; no prefecture has the age of consent below 16, but exceptions can exist in the case of marriage or engagement. This change to the national law does away with that.
