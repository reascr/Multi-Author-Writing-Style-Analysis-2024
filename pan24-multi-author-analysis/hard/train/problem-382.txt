Of course, these days it's a campaign of terror, because Russia has no chance at winning in any other scenario. The public is against them and they are outmatched militarily. For Russia to win, they must outlast Ukraine and Western military aid. For Russia to hold any ground in Ukraine, they must be so terrible to dissenters that the entire population is effectively silenced or utterly destroyed.
Yeah yeah, Russia is inept and corrupt, but Ukraine would have been a real goldmine for Russias economy, short and long term.
Ultimately what Putin wants is for Ukraine to not exist, or to be so crippled as to have to rely on Russia as a puppet state once again. A free, successful, democratic, independent Ukraine is something he cannot abide.
You should understand that for Russia, Ukraine has no right to exist on it's own as a sovereign country. We all heard the speech from putin where he was ranting about seeing ukraine as a "part of russia" etc.
We can and will make your lives worse - it's as much a message for Russians as it is for Ukrainians.
