We've lost so many, and rarely does it create positive change or produce a new law or an important shift in public perception.
Roughly 40% of the homeless youth in the US are some flavor of LGBT. They need our help. Trans folks in unsupportive families and bigoted areas have a sky high rate of suicide attempts - they're not doing it because they're trans, they're doing it because society treats trans folks like shit.
Meanwhile the social norm when a gay kid or adult (much large demographic) comes out they are met with hatred, violence and/or homelessness. Conservative families/environment are often quick to ostracize their own blood at the first hint of gay. This is nothing new.
It's not new. It's the continuation of old rhetoric that claims gay people can't have kids of their own (because "it was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!") so they can only proliferate by grooming children to "become" gay. They have often tried to smear the entire LGBTQ community by associating them with the organization NAMBLA and claiming that part of the "gay agenda" is to remove the age of consent.
I used to do community theater and the amount of conservatives who'd come out to do shows/audition who would vote against LGBT rights astonished me considering 90% of the stuff being performed was created by gay people.
