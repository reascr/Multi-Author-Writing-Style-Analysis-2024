This is exactly what happened in the province of Alberta in Canada. The province's main conservative party had been in power for 44 consecutive years without any interruption until 2015 when the NDP (New Democratic Party, Canada's main-stream left-wing party) won the election because the conservatives had fucked shit up so much.
The NDP did the best they could trying to fix the shit the conservatives spent nearly half a decade breaking, and when they couldn't get it all fixed in one term, people got mad at them and voted the conservatives back in 4 years later in 2019 and the conservatives have been working diligently on breaking shit again since then.
Even if they commit hard on fixing the shit the Tories broke, people will just get mad that they can't fix everything in one term then vote the Tories back into power.
The current speaker of the House of Commons was Labour, so hardly helps the original person's point that it's gerrymandering in favour of the party in power.
But even if Labour are the lesser of two evils, they shouldn't be let off the hook completely, especially not with Starmer's Tory-and-Leave-voter-pandering move to the right after the Corbyn era smacking of "New Labour: The Next Generation".
As I said, some here might not remember much about what Labour was like the last time they were in power (especially given that the Reddit demographic tends to skew younger). And I suspect many others are so desparate to be rid of the current Tory regime that they want to believe Labour are the undisputed "good guys" who can save them.
And then the Tories will blame all the current problems on Labour, and Labour will waffle around and not commit hard enough to actually get anything done, so that the Tories are right back in a few years.
