The virus mutated. The delta version was worth worrying about. The omicron version is like the flu. If you wouldn’t give a fuck about getting the flu, you shouldn’t give a fuck about getting Covid at this point. If it mutates back into a dangerous form then people will react accordingly. Don’t downvote facts unless you want to provide evidence to the contrary. It is common knowledge that the virus mutated to become more contagious and less severe, which was a net positive for humanity. If you still think Covid is the same Covid we were dealing with in April 2020 then you are simply misinformed and susceptible to the fear mongering you see in this very headline.
Covid won the war on covid and because no one has any idea what to do to both stop it while keeping everything exactly the same... Well at that point it just keeps crumbling.
I think there's the additional angle of, Covid isn't going to be eradicated. There's always going to be a possibility of a new coronavirus, just like there's a possibility of some new turbo flu.
