Fact: Russia was already at the time decreasing their outflows in natural gas - which you say makes no sense because it hurts them.
Letâ€™s assume the typical pro-rus argument of forcing Germany to sever oil ties with Russia and have them import US natural gas.
counterpoint for the sake of argument: Russia blew up the pipeline in order to punish Germany, hoping the pain of losing access to gas would force them to stop supporting Ukraine in order to keep NS2.
One last time: Now in a hypothetical scenario where Germany desperately needs gas they will need to approve Nord Stream 2 and grovel to Putin to turn it on. And because there is now only one pipe Russia can turn it off again with semi-credible claims of technical issues whenever they want to create instant leverage in the future and that's only possible because there is no longer any back-stop.
Because there is only one nation in the world whose purposes were served by destroying Nord Stream 1 but only one pipeline of Nord Stream 2: Russia.
And the day after the invasion, they made good on that threat when the Germans canceled Nord Stream 2 project.
But that would be Putin admitting defeat on the issue so that was never going to happen. If the Germans wanted cheap Russian gas it would have to flow through Nord Stream 2 pipeline B because there were now no other possible option.
Russia had already shut down Nord Stream 1 a month earlier with false claims of technical issues to try to pressure Germany into approving Nord Stream 2. They lost nothing by blowing up a pipeline they had already shut down to try to create leverage.
