The balloons were at 80,000+ ft but seems they are now "maneuvering" at 60,000 ft -- which is still well above the CF-18's gun range.
They don't need balloons for that. A balloon can only carry a limited payload, which by definition must be disposable.
Edit: looking at the video, it looks like it was a pressurized type balloon, rather than a zero pressure aerostat.
If it's a pressurized balloon, then yes. If it's an aerostat/zero pressure type balloon, no. You can poke holes in it, but the gas will escape very, very slowly.
Balloons like this are actually really hard to shoot down. The contents inside the envelope are pretty much at the same pressure as the atmosphere so they don’t just pop.
Years ago, a research balloon out of Saskatchewan failed to terminate its mission (they’re built with a heating wire that cuts them wide open). When the balloon got out over the Atlantic, the Canadian government sent a pair of CF-18s after it. The two jets unloaded their Vulcan Cannons into the balloon. And nothing happened. Eventually, the balloon came down on its own in Sweden.
