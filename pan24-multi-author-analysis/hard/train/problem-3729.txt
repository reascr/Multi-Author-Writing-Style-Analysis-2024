“Whataboutism” is not just a general word for “vaguely supportive of something Russia said.” Whataboutism is deflecting blame for something by pointing out that other people did the same thing or something worse. Citing the fact that France has sponsored violent acts before is not whataboutism when the subject we’re talking about is France potentially sponsoring another violent act.
Edit: If the folks downvoting would like to explain why it’s whataboutism to talk about France in a thread about France, I’m all ears.
Not that I really believe France did this, but that’s just not the right word. Whataboutism would be something like “France tried to kill this guy, so it’s hypocritical to criticize Russia for assassinating people.”.
In and of itself I wouldn't find the French attempting to assassinate a Russian militia member to be that hard to believe, but this.
Of course the french didn’t want to kill anyone, they wanted the boat to not disturb their nuclear tests, they did not want the publicity of doing domestic terrorism in an allied country.
On the design of the sinking. They blew up a first small bomb where they knew nobody would get hurt so that the crew panics and leave the boat. The second bomb, larger, was designed to do the actual sinking. What they didn’t anticipate was for someone to go back in the ship to get some personal belongings at the same time the second bomb blew up.
