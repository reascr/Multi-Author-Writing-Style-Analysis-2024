Businesses don't give two shits about what the landscape will look like in 50 years. Sustainability would require them to give up some profits in the short term, which is unacceptable for most. Just look at the fishing industry!
Much of the fire losses in the US are due to irresponsible management and a lack of natural fire cycles, I assume Canada has similar issues. Still doesn't negate the damage we're doing by cutting old-growth forests.
Replenishing doesn't bring forests back. It merely brings back some trees. There is no biodiversity, and it takes decades, sometimes even centuries, for forests to gain back their native fauna and flora.
Yes I agree completely, but bulldozing virgin forest should stop asap. We need to start using the same land to produce timber instead of harvesting from new land. This isn't the case.
Not really. We replace pretty much everything that gets cut down. Much of the Boreal forest is untouched. Most of the trees that get cut are softwoods and take very short time periods to replace through replanting.
