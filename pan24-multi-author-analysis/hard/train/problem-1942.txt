In fact, those very same PR agencies were also hired to convince everyone that not only do cigarettes NOT cause hear disease and cancer, but they're actually GOOD for you.
Random aside, I believe smoking could actually be a lot healthier (read: it wouldn't be healthy). But for some reason, tobacco naturally attracts radiation to its leaves (that can be washed off with certain chemical baths but is too expensive to do) and they also shove cigarettes full of other, ancillary chemicals that directly make it worse when smoked (but burns faster and is 'easier' to smoke it). It would still be 'bad,' but its impact could be so much less if we actually took the time and resources to make an unhealthy product less damaging. But, you know, profits. Again.
You know, I probably could have phrased it better. These assholes knew what they were doing, and almost everyone involved knew it was pollution to some degree. Though I guess they absolutely did pretend it was anything but.
Not really. Developed nations needs to be replacing their aging population. Otherwise it could lead to a debt cycle meltdown as emerging economies which are reliant on e porting goods for rich countries struggle as those rich countries growth slows due to declining populations. Japan is an exception right now and can somehow sustain its debt but the US would be concerning as land, and housing make up a lot of wealth and are relatively plentiful.
