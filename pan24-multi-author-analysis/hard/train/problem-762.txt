Russia is the guy that brags about how he could buy your house out from under you but then the waiter comes to him and says "Sir, there's a problem with your card.".
Heh. Had a game like that with my tween nephew last summer. We were playing Mortal Kombat 11 and to give him a chance I was mostly playing characters I don't know very well. Then he started talking shit. I switched over to my main next round and stomped him into the ground over and over.
Next time one of them did something to me I turned around and started punching him to ground. It was basically that scene from "A Christmas Story." It was in front of Principal's office, so he came out. He was getting ready to write me and the other kid up.
Something similar happened to me as well. Bullies would do all sorts of things to me. I was told to "use words" and one teacher even had the nerve to tell me that she'd spoken to one of the bullies and he was "going to apologize" to me after school. She literally set me up for a beating, and I still got in trouble for fighting.
I got attacked from behind by another girl on 6th grade. I went to the principal once I got her off of me, and we both got suspended, though I didnâ€™t do anything or even know why the girl attacked me. My mom made it a really fun vacation day.
