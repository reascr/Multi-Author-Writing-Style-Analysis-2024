The judge cannot ban the drug, he can only override the FDA approval. The FDA can simply immediately re-authorize the drug, potentially with aid from an executive order if they want some extra protection. This would force it to be brought back to the court, with another lenhy hearing, after which the FDA can simply re-authorize, etc. It might be extra-legal, but so is the authority the judge would call on to "ban" the drug.
This article discusses the claims that they are making and why, legally, the approval of the drug should not be reversed. The claims they are making are ridiculous - it doesn't even appear that they have standing. They're hoping the judge puts his personal beliefs above the law.

A federal judge in Texas has a say in federal laws, much like a federal judge in California does. That’s federalism for you — the final say is SCOTUS which is illegitimate anyway.
