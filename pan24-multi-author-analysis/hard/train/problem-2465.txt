It's not just Hispanics turning away from democrats. Every single POC group is turning away from the dems right now. Even black support is waning. This is a fact.
A lot of Hispanics are social conservatives and the loud chanting by the progressives on everything they believe just shows a large portion of Hispanics how different they are from them.
it’s always so honest and devoid of right wing talking point arguments that ignore the actual prevalence of racism and the fact that the right is so tied to white supremacy that it will absolutely turn on latino and hispanic voters the second it becomes expedient!
if they weren’t fascist thugs bent on domination (dominion they call it) i would be more chill about their bullshit mythology.
fundamentalist theocrats of any race or national origin are not ever going to vote anything but conservatives.
I would Imagine that they are not any more or less susceptible to right wing propaganda/ conspiracy theories than whites.
Minorities can often be racist as well, so that part appeals, in many cases folks think it's directed at others, not realizing the GOP thinks they are the others.
