Well do I have news for your! You don't have to wait for the election cycle since I've already seen it in this thread and others on this sub.
Primaries are important, but when it comes to "The guy who tried a fucking coup" and "the guy that's milquetoast centrist skewing slightly right, I'm voting against the coup people.
I’d rather not vote for someone this old but if it’s between him and little authoritarian DeSantis or a guy who attempted a fucking coup there’s no contest. Hopefully he swaps VP, given his age it’s sort of important who his VP is and it shouldn’t be Harris. Just make up some bullshit about her needing to turn it down for family reasons.
I don’t really know who it should be, just that given his age the possibility of VP becoming President will be on people’s minds and she is way to bland and absent for that bar.
I have concerns that Biden against the younger DeSantis is the only thing that will matter to the independent voters who pay little to no attention to politics. They usually vote on how things are going economy wise but this time the "out with the old" sentiment seems to be growing.
