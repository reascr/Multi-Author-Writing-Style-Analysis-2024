I would agree with that, with the exception that corps are still acting immorally. Yes, theyre encouraged to do so by the system, in fact being legally required in some circumstances, but theyre still choosing to be immoral bastards, and while the system is to blame, dont let them off the hook because their cruelty helped out the shareholders.
These fucking companies warp our laws, ruin our kids future, manipulate our media, pay off our politicians and wal away with earning everything and contributing nothing.
These fucking companies pay no tax, get massive subsidies to offset infrastructure, lobby against clean competitors to cement their destruction of the planet, are responsible for massive atmospheric, biodiversity and heritage damage.
It’s good for us to remember that they are driven by naked greed and have none of our interests as a priority.
These leech companies have caused so much damage. It’s good for the public to see how they refuse to pay their way even when earning super-profits.
