The problem is that Canada isn’t independent from the British crown, it’s only independent from the UK parliament and prime minister. It’s still part of the Commonwealth and Charles is nominally the head of the government with the Canadian prime minister and members of parliament answering to him. So not swearing an oath of allegiance to Charles III is like refusing to take the constitutional oath of office in the US. You generally don’t get to take your seat in congress if you refuse that oath.
Are you also aware that the reason they're currently being barred from the National Assembly is precisely because they did NOT swear this oath to the monarch?
I mean, if your government is a constitutional monarchy, swearing an oath of allegiance to the monarch is akin to swearing one to the constitution. In the US we often swear an oath of allegiance to a flipping flag because it’s the symbol of our government. The British monarch kinda plays the same role in Canada, Britain, and the other Commonwealth countries.
Well here in Canada the british monarch is our head of state. So they really do have the final say on everything. They could call us to war if they wanted to, or enact a draft, etc. The governor general of Australia dissolved a lawfully elected parliament that still had the confidence of the house before. The same thing could happen in any commonwealth country where the monarch is still the head of state.
This is a common thing across many nations, even those that do not have monarchs. Oaths of Office must be sworn before commencing duties.
