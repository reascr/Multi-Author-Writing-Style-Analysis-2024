That is essentially what the “liberal” argument boils down to, which sounds far more fiscally conservative to me than cutting revenue and then blaming the other side for ballooning the deficit because they don’t want to take essential programs away. The GOP aren’t in any way fiscally conservative, they are simply using that idea as a weapon against their political opponents while acting as a de facto political wing of corporate America and the 1% with no regard for the welfare of the people of this nation whatsoever.
The Democrats don’t run on a fiscally conservative platform, but the data shows that in the last 30 years Democrats have been more fiscally conservative than Republicans, when they control the Executive Branch.
The Republican Party has traditionally ran on a fiscally conservative platform for the last 50 years, but if you look at the modern day Republican Party, it’s all lip service. They talk a big game, but when it comes to act, they never get it done.
It means balancing the budget, not spending more then you earn, reducing debt, things like that. If “fiscally conservative” was a person, they’d be a person that saves their money until they have enough to pay cash for a car, rather than a person that takes out a loan to buy a car.
Basically, I was trying to convey that on fiscal or financial matters, I tend to favor more conservative policies. Conservatives are generally considered Republicans and liberals are generally considered Democrats. (Here in the US).
