Exact India doesn’t really care. You can offer to give India the F-35 and they’ll take it and still support Russia. Their relationships with Russia data back to the Soviet Union. If India chose to be a friend of a literally regime of communist oppression, then I highly doubt they will break from Russia now.
What exactly has Germany done for India that warrants India throwing away eight years of close and warm buddy relations with Russia? France, which also has never had a close relations with India, is also asking India for the same favor. Germany or France is not exactly on that level of relations with India. Is it the lack of self-awareness or just the stereotypical European arrogance and habit of ordering other (brown and color) people to do this and do that?
History matters. The history of what Europeans did to India, it still matters to India, and it influences how India behaves and reacts to Europeans today.
It just boggles my mind that white people think that the history (of what they have done to India, Africa and other people) does not factor into the current international politics. White people do not even preface their demands with the historical context of they did in India or Africa, or even try to offer an apology/excuse/explanation/recognition for the history before making all kinds of demands from the people they have victimized. They just get right into making more new demands, as if other people have completely forgotten (and forgiven) what they did.
