Funny, as the FBI in 2008 released declassified documents showing a vastly deep network of material support for the 9/11 hijackers from people within the Saudi government/intel agencies/related networks. And quite a lot more has come out. US presidents have their head up the ass of the corrupt Saudi officials, no way they'd allow anything that explosive to come out. Also the "no way Saudis would have anything to do with al-Qaeda" is not accurate, just look at the insane funding for al-Qaeda/AQ linked militias in the Syrian conflict as well as before 9/11.
While official Saudi government money did not fund Al Qaeda, much of the funding for that organization did come from the Saudi Kingdom and an overwhelming majority of the hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi subjects/citizens. To say that Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with it was wrong too. Osama bin Laden himself was from Saudi Arabia and his personal fortune came from Saudi oil too.
The Saudi royal family has their fingers in everything in Saudi Arabia. It's how the place works. There is a 0.001% chance that they have zero ownership and zero role in hiring Ronaldo. It's part of their broader strategy of .
I don't know if I want the support of the country that murdered and hacked journalist Jamal Khashoggi into pieces.
