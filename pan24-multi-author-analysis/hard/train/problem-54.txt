"Talk into this black box? Why? What devilry is this? Where did all these miniature suns come from? What are those metal beasts rushimg down the road? By the name of my father where am I??!".
This. Evangelicals rarely do anything quietly. My interpretation is this is as close as youâ€™ll ever get to an admission they were wrong about Trump (though they did get RvW so maybe not that wrong in their own opinions).
I wouldn't be so sure that the individual quoted in this article is representative of the average Trump voter. In fact, I'm inclined to think the opposite. Republicans are the ride or die type of partisans because of rank political/social/economic ignorance, single issue folks (abortion, guns), and a deep-seated hatred for others (LGBTQ issues, racial justice).
I take no issue with the sentiment you describe, although anecdotally I don't know one person who voted for Trump in 2020 that would be moved to vote for another party. So if Trump becomes the nominee and they make it to the polls, I know damn well they'll vote for him regardless of these headlines.
