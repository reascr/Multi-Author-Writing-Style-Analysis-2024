With EU no longer buying, supply now greatly exceeds demand for Russian energy, which is why China and India are able to buy at greatly reduced prices that barely leave any profit for Russia.. especially considering how pricier and more difficult delivering that energy to east Asia is compared to Western Europe.
The current century? It wouldn't surprise me if the Russian federation collapses before 2030. I'm not saying it certainly will, but if that does happen it wouldn't surprise me.
It's ironic.. Putin wanted to be remembered as a scary ironman and the glorious hero of Russia who restored it to a superpower.. instead he'll go down history as the dummass clown who took on a nation 10X smaller and miscalculated so bad he kickstarted the collapse of his own country.
Russia has had troubles for years, but one of the reasons so much of its shit got tolerated was how Putin was seen as this iron fisted genius. Somebody that slowly was stabilizing a country wrecked by the collapse of the old glory, when Soviet fell apart. Somebody that, while not nice, was simply needed in a place of great corruption and hopelessness.
