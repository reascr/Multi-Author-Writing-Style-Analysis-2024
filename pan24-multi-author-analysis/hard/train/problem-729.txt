And the FBI still have the original laptops and aren’t releasing any information. Let the republicans hang themselves with faked conspiracy nonsense then come out with facts (if that even matters).
For folks who believe the conspiracy theories, they’ll be more radicalized against democrats. They’ll believe our justice system is broken, and sure enough, who do you think wants to overhaul our justice system?
The point isn’t to investigate him. The point is to fling mud, convince folks there’s controversy, and then when there’s another president, move on to try to assassinate the character of someone else.
The reason is that it builds up tension and makes folks angry. The lack of charges or an actual investigation into the matter is on purpose. For the law enforcement agencies - it’s because there’s nothing there. For republicans, it’s because they have a narrative.
This is an attempt to politicize the agencies that wield investigatory power. Those conspiracy theories and the (manufactured) sense of perverted justice will be used to change regulations, replace unbiased leaders, and assert republican control over law enforcement.
