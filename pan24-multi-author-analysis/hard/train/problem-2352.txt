By a long way, In fact, indications are that Ukraine now has more tanks (of Russian type) than they had at the start of the war while Russia has lost about half of its tank force.
Lol, could you imagine if Russia actually ends up losing territory to Ukraine via a surprise war that they started? That would be comical and well deserved.
Except the territory already belonged to them in the first place, so they aren't taking Russian territory, unless you're considering all of that former soviet territory, as Russian, then sure. I meant pre-2014 border Russian territory.
It's been a while since Ukraine was in control of Belgorod. More recent claims are the Crimean Peninsula and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk. I'm sure they would probably take on some territory but I don't think Ukraine is all that interested in expanding territory. They may if the local areas are interesting in joining Ukraine. Georgia will likely claim their lost territory. Hard to say for sure until we encounter that situation.
