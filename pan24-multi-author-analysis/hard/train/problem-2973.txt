It's just NK expatriating cheap labor to the occupied Ukrainian territories. Nothing more, nothing else.
North Korean personnel were assisting a WMD program in Syria, and the use of North Korean labor in Russia and China is extremely well documented.
And if North Korea sends troops to Ukraine, South Korea must seriously consider doing so as well, or at least a very large number of non--combatant Abrams and F-16 maintenance technicians, fully equipped. Just as Israel and Saudi Arabia Iraq, and Turkey must more than respond to what Iran has done in Ukraine. The Pacific Rim nations must respond to what China and India (after their abstention votes in the UN) are or are not, doing in Ukraine. As the worlds most populous neighbors, they both have the most to gain from the "support the non-aggressor" precedents increasingly being reinforced in Ukraine.
This is dangerous on it's own, because it sets a precedent for someone else to come to Ukraine's aid. A certain neighbor with an axe to grind with Russia, perhaps.
you make a joke, but if this turns out to be legit, it means another country has formally intervened in the war. (and its a country that has absolutely no business being there).
