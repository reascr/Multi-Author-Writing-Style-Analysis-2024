What's funnier? That lindell thinks he has a chance, or that the GOP suffered one of the worst electoral defeats (relative to context) after 2 other historically bad losses, and they immediately re-endorse the chair.
Two complete and utter failures in Michigan lost actual elections and then promptly said they were “running” for Michigan GOP chair.
Why do these people keep saying they’re “running” for a position that is essentially handed out by GOP elites.
I believe it speaks volumes about the Republican party when the Mike Pillows of the world naturally flock to positions of power within the party.
But it nonetheless speaks volumes about the Republican party when it attracts so many of these types of candidates.
This is what the Republican party will become: Celebrities, grifters, and extremists competing for attention and power, where the biggest factors will be name recognition and how they make the base feel. And it will either fracture itself with infighting, or hold itself together long enough to cause or support a hostile takeover of the government.
