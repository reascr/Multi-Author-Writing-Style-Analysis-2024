According to Grigori F. Krivosheev: "All losses of arms and equipment are counted as irrecoverable losses, i.e. beyond economic repair or no longer serviceable"[16].
- 37,600 Armoured car and half-track (including 5,000 Lend-Lease armoured personnel carriers lost[17])".
- 83,500 tanks lost: 5,200 heavy tanks, 44,900 medium tanks, 33,400 light tanks (including 11,900 Lend-Lease tanks and self-propelled guns lost[17]).
While it is still hard to say how many tanks Russia had pre war, it is certain they have lost a shitload of them.
From what we've seen Russia is using outdated Soviet equipment. The West is pumping modern tech into Ukraine. Putin's using up his old clay before it dries up. Somehow being able to make your enemy slightly weaker and less provisioned, dump a bunch of old equipment in a foreign country and steal/relocate families and children are his biggest accomplishments.
My theory: That giant miles long convoy at the beginning of the war was deliberately packed with old equipment. It was a bait to get the west to intervene early and bomb it and therefore get the pro Soviet half of the world more on Russia's side. The west didn't take the bait and that left Russia with a bunch of outdated equipment on the frontline. That's mostly conjecture though.
