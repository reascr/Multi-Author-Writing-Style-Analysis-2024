It's almost as though each and every piece of machinery that these counties send back results in the methodical removal of the stench of evil of the Putin Regime that was given safe harbor by these countries. Consider the implication of removal of these weapons of war. No more need for phone calls for parts. No more need for communications for infrastructure for maintenance, the physical space required to house them is now made available for something else, maybe even said country asking it's own engineers within to design and build their own defensive capabilities.
I had never really visualized what is now happening in this manner up to this point. Numerous countries whom the Russians sold their weapons of war in exchange for a strange and shaky allegiance are now sending those weapons to the Ukraine with a "Return to Sender" notice for which the very weapons the Russians used to destabilize the world with global arms races are now being used against them.
Obviously a lot of these weapons, vehicles and defense systems wonâ€™t outlive the war, but are there agreements between these countries and Ukraine on what happens to this equipment after the war?
Better to have the MIC output going to modernize NATO allies who pass aging equipment for Ukraine's defensive war, than into a dumpster fire of an adventure in central Asia.
