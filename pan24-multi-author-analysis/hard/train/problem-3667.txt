A lot of Americans attribute a bunch of fantastical things to the president. They think that they control inflation, control gas prices, control the (already appointed by their predecessors) Supreme Court, and so on. So when one or more of those things go wrong, which they ALWAYS do, they blame the current president and vote against their party in the midterms. There have only been a few modern exceptions, like right after 2001 when America was a bloodthirsty mob and would do anything GWB said.
I think that as much as people talk about abortion etc., for huge swaths of America all they care about is gas prices. That single number that they see every time they go by a gas station that tells them how good or bad the country is doing. By that one, stupid measure, Biden and the Dems are doing badly.
I wonder if they’re too dumb to ever arrive at the obvious conclusion: Trump was able to co-opt the GOP because the GOP has spent decades raising a voting base of suckers who will believe anything.
It's not Trump's fault really, I mean he exposed the Republican platform but even if he's gone we have a lot of evidence of the Republican platform, Trump or not.
They will use Trump as a convenient scapegoat - which will allow them to ignore the fact that their policies and platforms are cruel and unpopular. It wasn’t reproductive rights, it was Trump It wasn’t the fact that they have publicly stated that they want to cut Social Security and continue to deny climate change, it was Trump.
