While this stance is taken in terms of neutrality, there are serious considerations with respect to future security cooperation, to the ability to actually sell any equipment in the future due to being branded as an unreliable partner, and to be able to procure advanced military equipment from Western countries.
This is why Switzerland's "neutrality" in allowing arms re-exports will change, if it does at all: already the European MIC is making moves to decouple itself from Switzerland, so if the Swiss want their arms industry to remain successful, they will change their laws to allow countries to defend themselves according to the UN Charter.
Switzerland has previously rejected appeals from Germany to allow it to re-export Swiss-made ammunition to Ukraine, saying such a move would violate its neutrality. The export of the weapons or ammunition to Ukraine is blocked by the so-called non-export declaration, which buyers of Swiss armaments have to sign, as well as a specific embargo on arms sales to Ukraine and Russia.
__A majority of Swiss (55%) are in favour of re-exporting Swiss-made war materiel to Ukraine, according to the NZZ am Sonntag. This is currently prohibited by Swiss law.__.
