That's the first time I've read that suggestion, and it sounds like something a serious political party might consider. Maybe pitch it to Europeans and Canadians, but leave us out of it. We Democrats are busy trying to blow a general election.
The Iowa Caucuses are "a particularly undemocratic way of picking a nominee," and may have been essential in propelling a first-term senator to the Democratic nomination in 2008.
Sorry to rile you up--this is not an emotional issue for me. I really never care about Iowa unless I'm driving through it. I was merely speculating on how this alignment would have played out 15 years ago. I very much prefer Georgia or Michigan.
I would prefer a state that was a swing state like Georgia or Florida. It would do wonders to re-energize Democrat voters in those states that are disillusioned.
Those issues are germane to a cross-section of Democrat voters. If the goal is to go after Hispanic Republicans that don't share democratic values like social justice, equality, and inclusive governance I think thatâ€™s a mistake.
