I suppose I can definitely see the parallels between that and the setup of the United States if anything except a supermajority was required.
It would certainly lend credence to the Brexit mantra of independence. With the current setup, if a country enforces something from the EU, it's effectively because they chose to by way of voting or joining the EU after it was made EU law.
It also means that the members of EU retain their independency as countries - they do stuff together, not submit one to another.
And finally it will silence smaller countries of EU, may be force them to create coalitions inside EU, and that might be the end of EU integrity.
But the goal of the EU is to stick together and stop fighting each other. And you can’t really do that if you’re pissing off your sister countries. They all collectively contribute a bit to the European economy as a whole.
"They all collectively contribute a bit to the European economy as a whole." Not really. Bigger countries put in a lot of money and smaller, less well off countries get financial benefit. This is one of the main reasons for Brexit. The UK thought that the trade benefits did not stack up against the 'fees' for want of a better term.
