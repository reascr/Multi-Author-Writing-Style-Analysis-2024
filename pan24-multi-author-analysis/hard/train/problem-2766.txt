But, since Ga didn't take the federal medicaid expansion, if you're working, you basically can't get medicaid. So you're stuck with no health insurance.
Well tell you what. Since you're so freaking knowledgeable about it, feel free to get my mom signed up.
She draws a whopping $700/m from social security. That's her only income. She can't get medicaid here in Ga. They claim she makes too much. She can't get a subsidized plan through Obamacare, because they claim she can get medicaid. This is a fight I've been dealing with for years.
My SO is diabetic, and was making a mere $10k/year a few years ago. She couldn't get any kind of health coverage because of this bullshit.
The fun part is, if you make so little that you qualify for medicaid on a federal level, you can't get a subsidised plan through Obamacare.
I'm doubtful that the group of people that don't work yet qualify for Medicaid are really a category that they can extract much from. Why would this be worth lobbying for? I'm pretty sure this is just to appeal to the Republican base who wants to see the needy punished for being poor.
