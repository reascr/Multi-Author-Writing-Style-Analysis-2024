As horrible as this war is, and as much as we all want it to end - as long as Russia doesn't attack NATO directly and deliberatly, it would be a horrible mistake to intervene. A no-fly zone would be the brink of World War 3.
Its not about NATO deciding to go first strike. Its about them thinking it might happen. Its about commanders in the field, who have control over tactical nukes, deciding in a moment of weaknes. Its about false info. human error.
You dont need a long range AA missile to intercept a long range cruise missile. S-300 has just 100 or 200 km of range, more than enough to intercept low flying cruise missiles.
No fly zone would be for planes ofc but for rockets and missiles too. Maybe I am wrong to expect a jet to intercept a missile or rocket inbound from russia.
Russian missiles have been hitting the whole of Ukraine. They didn't decide to fire an air defense asset out of boredom. Or are you ok with Ukraine just ignoring civilian deaths if they dont happen near the front lines?
