Is she a warmongering insider-trading old bag who should have been put out to pasture 10 years prior? Yes.
Surely you jest. Have you not seen the pushback by the Republican Party? I will be very surprised if they put him forward. The midterms very much humbled them. I also would not be very surprised if Trump, as a result of not being selected by the Republicans, creates his own little party.
But the flipside was a political cartoon that I saw that showed that close to 50% of people STILL voted for election deniers. That is very sobering.
I just checked. It was Michelle Obama on Colbert on last Monday’s show (November 14th - available OnDemand) where she said she warned everyone while he was busy debating Hillary Clinton, that he was not qualified to be president. That chaos would ensue. That the office of the president is “no joke.“ Tragically, that’s exactly what happened. If she said it, she really was prescient. And every time they talked about chaos and how they used that as a fulcrum to get elected, I can’t help but think of Sandra Bullock’s 2015 movie, “Our Brand Is Crisis.” Obama pointed out during her session with Colbert that the last several election cycles where people used that to scare people to vote for the Republican candidate citing all the havoc that is going on in our country currently, it did not fly at all.
