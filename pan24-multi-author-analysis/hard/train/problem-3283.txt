So what? I personally think coloring the US flag to show everyone how much you “support” something is childishly stupid.
The real hilarious irony is, given the majority of the people who place value on these symbols, were the same who were furious about protests against the flag.
Show a rainbow-colored American flag to one of the people flying this shit and they'll scream at you about how offensive it is.
Yep. If a Domino's delivery driver showed up wearing a shirt that said "Domino's delivery drivers should be allowed to murder with impunity." that person would be fired on the spot. They wouldn't need to have a rule on the books for it.
