Hello, Reddit! My name is Adam Winkler and I'm a scholar of constitutional law, the Supreme Court and gun law. I've taught constitutional law and led Supreme Court simulations at UCLA School of Law for two decades.
Possibly, though it is unclear if the courts will uphold insurance requirements. The argument would be that we don't typically require insurance for the exercise of a constitutional right. And under the new Second Amendment test established by the Supreme Court in last June's Bruen case, which requires gun laws today to be consistent with the gun laws of the 1700s-1800s, when we didn't have gun insurance requirements, makes it harder to defend such a law.
Bruen states that laws must have history and context pertaining to the second amendment to be lawful, meaning only laws for restriction of the 2A are under this scrutiny. - Bruen is not a law, it does not mean that if something doesn't have history or context of being allowed by the 2A, that it is immediately considered illegal, etc. Let's not forget the 2A only speaks about restrictions on the government from passing laws, not restricting citizen's use of arms.
Even if it did matter, the purpose of the Second Amendment is to restrict the federal government, and not the people.
The second amendment is a restriction on the federal government, and not the people. It means the people have the RTKBA and the government shouldn't try to take that away from them.
