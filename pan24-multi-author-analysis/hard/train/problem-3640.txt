"If the facts are on your side, pound the facts. If the law is on your side, pound the law. If neither are on your side, pound the table.".
That's my point. If this were a copyright issue, it would be a different situation. SNL doing a Jack Daniels parody commercial, The Onion, Weird Al... that's all copyright and should be protected as parody.
How is that Loco Cola bottle not humorous? How is that decided? Parody for copyright makes sense because it's an expression, reaction, criticism, etc... as a form of speech, as opposed to producing a product to profit off someone else's brand identity.
I'm not saying this case meets the standard of confusion; that's for both sides to make the case for and against, but rather if confusion exists, "parody" shouldn't be a default excuse that could essentially always be used to get away with trademark infringement.
The rule regarding the infringement of the trademark is that the customer should not get confused between the identities of the product of the trade mark and the product having the same mark like trademark.
People are often very confused about how trademark law applies across industry. There is stronger protection for a trademark within an industry, but the stronger the brand is, the more you're going to find courts willing to protect the brand elsewhere... try to get a trademark for Coca-Cola Light Bulbs.
