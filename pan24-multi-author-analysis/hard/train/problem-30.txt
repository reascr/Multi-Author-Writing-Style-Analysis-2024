After sentencing (in Federal cases), the court requests a sentencing suggestion from the Parole Board based on Federal sentencing guidelines.
So at some point in the future, there will be a sentencing hearing where the Judge makes a decision.
Then the defence and prosecutor argue for what sentence they think she should have and why. The defence asks for lower, the prosecutor asks for higher, 99.9% of the time, they argue why, the judge rules. This can take 5 minutes, and I sat through a sentencing that took 4 hours (I was a victim) before being adjourned and finishing the sentencing, which took another 2 hours, I wasn't there because of a snowstorm but the victims advocate and probation department (who asked my opinion on their guidelines before the first hearing) kept me notified.
There's generally a low end and high end. The judge can sentence outside these, and from what I know, has to put on the record why they are having and upward or downward departure from the guidelines.
She hasn't been sentenced yet. Her bond was revoked as she was found guilty and the judge decided she is a danger in some way, or going to take off, so she is in custody until the sentencing hearing. These go towards time served.
She was found guilty, so basically the judge revoked her bond and had her remanded into custody until sentencing. It can be in a week, or months. Most states have the probation department do a pre sentence investigation and balance things like her criminal history, how bad the crimes were, aggravating and mitigating factors, etc, and come up with a recommendation for what and how long her sentence should be.
