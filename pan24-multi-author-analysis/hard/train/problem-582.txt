With more votes we could control it all and then show Americans what can truly be accomplished. This back and forth of who’s in control is beyond old.
These races are too close. I’m so happy it’s going the way it is but it’s not good enough. There’s still not enough people that get out and vote.
And there was no magical ballot stuffing. Trump simply overperformed the polling because the polling was not capturing the whole picture.
People who were doomering before really need to fucking take heart and pay attention. Republicans are rigging the board but they are deeply, deeply unpopular as a whole and they just do not have the numbers.
And before Republicans run in and start screeeeeeeeeing how this PROVES fraud, everyone would do well to remember how wrong polls were for the Trump election.
And there's a real chance Trump will sabotage and attack DeSantis and other GOP potential campaigns resulting in a split and bad blood in the GOP. Especially if Trump loses the nomination. He would likely turn on the GOP and their candidates just to spite them for not supporting him. He obviously can't handle losing.
