I've wondered about this very scenario for months. Russia is so large and ethnically diverse that a few autocrats in Moscow probably shouldn't be ruling with an iron fist. In a warming planet there's also a lot of land that might become more habitable in the coming decades. Not to mention the glut of natural resources to exploit.
Perhaps the East and the West just settle on figuratively splitting Russia right down the middle once the dust settles.
Not sure if the West will be taking parts of Russia. Probably will be a civil war over control of he Kremlin. While that happens, China will ‘protect’ and claim a very large portion that has closer cultural heritage to Mongolia than Moscow. Will come with natural gas resources, farmland and cooler climate as global temperatures rise.
Joke will be on Russia when this is over. There is speculation China will attempt to annex a large segment of Russia if Putin’s war fails. And we all know he can’t win.
Taiwan has several advantages but honestly isn’t worth China being weakened by fighting a country like the US, who is well versed at fight wars. He Siberian and Far Eastern Districts of Russia would be easy pickings during a Moscow civil war.
