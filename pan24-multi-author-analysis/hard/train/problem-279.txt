From a medical perspective, China cannot afford to have a full COVID wave even today. They have refused western vaccines and their homemade ones are lacklustre at best. If China will reopen like the rest of the world has done today, their hospitals will buckle like most other nations did in early 2020. Everyone will know someone who fell very sick or died to COVID. In the US, it cost the president his re-election. In China, it could cost Xi his career, legacy, and perhaps even more.
The only way out I see for China to catch up to western mRNA vaccine tech or to buy western vaccines, then inoculate as many elderly as they can before opening up their society.
It's a mix of saving face, low vaccine uptake among the elderly, low herd immunity, vaccine efficacy, population control and nationalism.
I don't think it's based on much rationality, considering the way they test and treat the populace during those lockdowns. It's very costly.
I think the overwhelming majority are in favor of those covid policies, the virus being seen as a huge threat due to truthful and less truthful propaganda. It's hard to get an accurate picture, since so many are voiceless.
