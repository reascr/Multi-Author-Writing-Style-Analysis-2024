I did a solo month through Colombia in the summer of ‘19. You would see entire families with everything they owned strapped to their back, and you suddenly realize they carried everything they could through parts of the Amazon and over the Andes to get there.
I didn’t want to speak to it but yes, some Colombians I spoke to were very upset by the flush of solicitors and people sleeping in the street. Colombia has its own struggles with poverty and lack of upward mobility and felt that Venezuelan migrants were seriously disrupting Colombia’s ability to bring up its own people.
Yep, there has been a Venezuelan refugee crises in Latin America for a number of years now and Colombia and Peru are bearing the brunt of it. According to the UN the Venezuelan refugee crises is among the worst refugees crises in the world right now (along with Syria and Ukraine).
IIRC, both Colombia and Peru are host to over a million Venezuelan refugees each, and it certainly causes problems. Here in Peru at least a lot of people are racist towards the Venezuelans (even the sweetest most open minded Peruvians, it’s crazy).
