Unfortunately, probably not. The Dobbs decision pretty much unconstitutionalized the right to an abortion. 2A is still very much black and white constitutional.
No. Cops should absolutely not only have guns. If you are a black person in america or a trans person in america, you absolutely be armed- because there are people in law enforcement that are part of extremists groups that will do harm to black people and trans people.
Not arguing in bad faith here, but the current makeup of SCOTUS will need an actual amendment to the constitution or federal law to ever interpret a right to abortion being law.
You may be right, but abortion was never actually in the Constitution so how could it be unconstitutionalized ? I think the bigger question here is the individual's right to sue the government without undue burden, ie having to pay the state their legal expenses. And I'm sort of split on this, while I believe anyone should be able to sue any level of government, there are also people who enter into repeated frivolous lawsuits.
As long as the courts continue to ignore the very black and white bit about "militias" being government controlled and not an individual right, I disagree.
"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people".
And the 14th also implicitly grants people unenumerated rights but explicitly prohibiting laws that reduce the rights of the people (without due process).
So really, because the Constitution doesn't explicitly say that the government(s) can ban abortion, they shouldn't have that ability.
No the words "abortion" never appear in the US Constitution, it was for almost half a century considered an unenumerated right- a right not explicitly written. There are plenty more unenumerated rights that are still considered constitutional.
