We need to end hedge-fund ownership of rental properties, end foreign speculative purchasing of rental properties, and end single-family zoning as well as go after price-fixing.
We need more supply of housing AND we need to address housing being seen as speculation, particularly low-occupancy/single family. Don't get me wrong, there will always be a need for a rental market, but we shouldn't have corporations/LLCs buying up single-family/duplex/3-level units en masse and basically setting the market.
I do mean only single family homes, duplexes and apartment buildings or even condo buildings I'm not so concerned about. I live in florida where there are entire neighborhoods that are owned by rental companies. My hoa had to put in the by-laws the neighborhood could only have so much of a percent rentals because it started to get absolutely out of hand (they didn't care about the companies raising our property values but most renters just don't care for the appearance of their home as owners do).
Honesty 4 houses isn't even that bad. If you did well and wound up with 4 houses, even if 3 were rentals or airbnbs that doesn't seem bad to me. Thats a nice little family business. It's these mega corps that own 1000s of houses where they over bid on houses and choke out people who just want to buy one house and they take over neighborhoods.
There needs to be regulation on how many single family homes one entity can own. The problem is all the home rental companies just scoop up and out bid regular people when they're trying to buy a house.
