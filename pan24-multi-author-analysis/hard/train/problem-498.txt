As shown by both Gulf Wars (ignoring if they were just or not) and the ISIS intervention, the West is actually capable of fighting wars halfway across the globe without needing general mobilization. Unlike Russia.
With the current protests being violently suppressed, this is the best time possible for regime change likely in a long while. Beginning to think that an intervention to replace Iran's government using its assistance of the invasion of Ukraine as a casus belli might be seriously on the table for NATO.
Especially now with extra-national elements popping up in this prolonged Russian attack, I simply donâ€™t understand the argument for limiting Ukraine from firing as far as they can into Russia as I understand is the agreement.
So long as Russian conscripts threaten Ukrainian civilians, killing as many Russian military, and destroying as much Russian material, as efficiently as possible is the only valid consideration.
Once Russia ceases their war of aggression and returns everything they've taken from Ukraine (seized territory, kidnapped children, stolen art and artifacts), we can mourn the conscripted Russian dead... and place the sole blame for their loss on Moscow.
My concern for the wellbeing of Russian soldiers is fundamentally and utterly a secondary consideration, to the point of being a non-factor.
