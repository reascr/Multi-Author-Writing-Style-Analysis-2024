No conspiracy theorist is interested a theory such as: during the Regan hinted (probably through intermediaries) to Oliver North that if he took the fall he would be functionally rewarded. This is an uninteresting conspiracy theory to theorists because it is just too grounded in reality and thus doesn't create this sense that there are a select few with massive control over society.
Conspiracy theorists like the idea that the world is tightly controlled by a select few. They prefer to think that the few have absolute control over far reaching aspects of society/politics/civilization. This idea that the few have this absolute control allows for these theorists to blame this control on their own personal failings (people who have personal failings often turn to conspiracies to explain these failings). This warped world view relies on no just conspiracies but extraordinary conspiracies to really make sense.
This reminds me of a flat earth documentary where one of the main figures in the movement admits he surveilled various conspiracies and intentionally chose to believe the most outlandish one. The wilder the theory, the more different and above the sheeple you are. I think what’s at play is a mix of lack of success and narcissism. A narcissist can not believe they just aren’t that successful or special, but they can believe the Illuminati is holding them back.
