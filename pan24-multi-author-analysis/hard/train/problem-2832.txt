Th funny thing is North Korean artillery hasn’t actually appeared in Ukraine yet. I don’t know what the hold up is but chances are South Korean artillery will be hitting Russian troops a lot sooner.
The other thing to remember is that there is a lot wrong with North Korea. They don’t have good infrastructure to transport shells, they’re storage for shells is probably horrible and dishonesty is endemic in the culture. There’s just a very long way from “Russia wants shells and North Korea wants to sell” to “Russia has actual working shells” and there’s a lot that can go wrong in that chain.
I agree with that assessment. My guess is the Soviet Union had huge stockpiles but a lot of these were sold off (both officially and unofficially) in the 90s plus Russia has had a number of wars and conflicts since then so they’re stockpiles got used up and not replaced. Russia had plenty of shells for a short war but they tens of millions and they just don’t have them.
One of the reasons for announcements like this is to communicate to the Russians that Ukraine will have supplies of ammo/weapons for the long-haul.
Is it a NATO or specific spec round, for instance we are asking Ukraines eastern European friends to donate their stockpiles because its not NATO spec weapons.
Interesting that the aging global arsenals are being sent to Ukraine. Basically we are sending all our old weapons to them and now we make new ones. There has to be some significance here. Maybe someone more intelligent has some insight.
