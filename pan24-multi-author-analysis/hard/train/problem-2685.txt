So this might actually work to some extent if there is still the option of vaping nicotine. If there isn't though, people will just start growing and selling tobacco, and it will be much harsher and more tarry than the one's being sold rn (although they would have waaaayyy less additives and a lot of those cause a shitton of cancer).
Oh wait nicotine itself isn't getting banned? Huh. Well in that case yeah, there's probably not much of a market for import if normal cigarettes are just replaced by vapes.
If someone really want a cigarette, there will be a tobacco flavored vape that looks and feels like smoking a real cigarette.
If that is true, then many of the people vaping wouldn't be using any kind of nicotine if vapes weren't around.
There's no need to though, as smuggling cigarettes is easy AF since no drug dogs give a shit about smoking, and they couldn't even if they wanted to. People on international airports in NZ would be arriving from countries in which smoking is legal, so most people would smell of cigarettes, making the dog useless (which they already are after 40 min of work.).
Faots. Only mostly joking. It's slang for cigarettes in England and it's Latin origin translates to "bundle of sticks(for fire purposes)". Also, it would help change the stigma of the word.
