It's not. They regularly do cruise missle tests, and a nuke is just a cruise missile with a different payload.
There is a real question of nuclear parity - as weapons grade nuclear material degrades substantially every decade decreasing its individual effectiveness. But they have a lot of nukes to spare to do tighter groupings.
Nukes don't quite work like that, a bomb going off near them doesn't mean a nuclear reaction occurs.
Creating a nuclear reaction that results in an explosion is a fairly delicate process. Ironically, nuclear weapons are triggered by explosions; a series of extremely precisely timed explosions that cause the core to implode. They're set up as a sphere around the core and if these explosives don't go off in the very specific way that they're meant to, they don't go supercritical and are basically just a 'dirty bomb'. , which are themselves the trigger for hydrogen bombs.
And it was a very obviously unnecessarily large response that was meant to be a message to the Russians to not fuck with us under any circumstance because we can bring down hell any time, anywhere…and they somehow just didn’t get it.
