To be fair that's the stupid half of the country anyways. The Smarter half will know the difference between Georgia USA and Georgia Eastern Europe. So it still goes the way of supporting Georgia Eastern Europe.
Or maybe Georgia got confirmation of support and have wanted to declare their land again now that Ukraine looks like they could pull through.
If any country shouldn't be slammed for not supporting Ukraine, it is Georgia. They already have two Russian guns aimed at their proverbial head in the form of S. Ossetia and Abkhazia. The latter isn't even that far from Putin's palace in Krasnodar. Supporting Ukraine in their situation would almost be suicide, Russian would consider that to "be asking for it" and invade them next after Ukraine!
So what would you like in exchange for the hollow claim to care about Ukraine because it's a victim being attacked by Russia to actually be consistent? Cause we apparently can't just be consistent in our view that nations occupied by Russia should be freed from it.
Because, again, we don't seem to actually care about countries being occupied by Russia. It's just Ukraine.
Gotta love people trying to insist Georgia is just some coward trying to benefit from others sacrifice because they happened to already be occupied by Russia and in no real position to lend any aid.
