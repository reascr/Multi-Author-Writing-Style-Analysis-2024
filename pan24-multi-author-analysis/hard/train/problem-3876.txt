So let me get this straight, someone in Ukraine genuinely believes that outlawing music written by a man who died over 100 years ago and was descended from a Ukrainian will help the war?
And it also said in the article that Tchaikovsky is of Ukrainian heritage so why didn't the culture minister just spin it that way?
Youâ€™re forgetting that Russia has and is preforming genocide on the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian culture. Ukrainians want a lot of there forced ties to Russia to be erased. The big reason why there is a lot of Russian speaking Ukrainians is because speaking Ukrainian was illegal and would get you killed.
There are plenty of those born in Ukraine who called themselves Russian, and you cannot really dig them up and ask them if they are Ukrainian or not.
Over night, suddenly free elections were added to constitution (first version did not guarantee it and they were only held if results suited the president), the country changed it's system from authoritarian presidency to democracy.
But it does not need to last forever, during '90s in Croatia 1/5 of all books were burned by the pro-fascist wing (Gojko Susak wing) of Croatian Democratic Union and symphatisers, and monuments to victims of holocaust, Nikola Tesla and "Croatian partisans" were blown up yet 30 years later this is unimaginable to happen again.
