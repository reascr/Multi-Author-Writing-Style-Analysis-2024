Greed paranoia and desperation are found everywhere there is human, unfortunately, but for me it’s easier to make the general derogatory characterization of the government as a whole has been corrupted by it and maybe incorrectly I still want to believe there are some good altruistic groups in both the government and media, but getting less confident of that by the day.
Agreed Fox News is an outlier, far right extremist propaganda trash, but I don’t see nbc, cbs or abc or cnn anywhere close to that level of trash propaganda, even msnbc is more objective and careful about assertions unverified.
I'm going to go with a blanket "Yes it is" because the people who own that media and who make sure that those "news" sources constantly repeat disproven politically based points are the same people who are providing the money that is corrupting the whole process.
Arizona Governor claims voter fraud and rigged elections... Mainstream media goes out of their way to NOT point out that there are no verifiable fraudulent ballots to back up that claim. But if you do a search "Heritage Foundation voter fraud" you will find article after article 'proving' that the fraud exists. And no counter-claim articles at least from that search disputing them until the second or third page, as of this morning. And I'm not going to discredit USA Today as a source, but it was the first one I found that questioned the Heritage Foundations Claims but its not a news name that carries a lot of clout.
Fox news still says that Covid is fake, and the vaccine is not just worthless, but actually harmful. If you really want I can find lots of articles for that.
