Yea, they're old and becoming mechanically unreliable. Been marked for the reserve fleet for now, not immediate scrapping. Vella Gulf was in the defense news quite a bit before her retirement due to mechanical issues. The rest are due to be decommissioned before the end of the decade.
Agreed on many nevers, but the Tomahawk is 100% off limits. Despite the average /r/worldnews poster's belief, Russia is 100% a nuclear nation. Escalation is a major issue, the US is playing a dangerous game just like it has many times before during the Cold War. Giving Ukraine the ability to strike virtually all of Western Russia, much less their nuclear facilities, is not a option.
Yes, but not even the Ukrainian government is talking about getting "first strike" (read: nuclear) weapons. Conventional long range weapons would be very unlikely to trigger a nuclear response by Russia (Russian red lines have already been crossed and Russia fears the condemnation of China and India), and even nuclear usage by Russia would not trigger a nuclear response by NATO.
