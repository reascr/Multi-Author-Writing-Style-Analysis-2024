They literally had a negative interest on accounts with more than 1M in them. They wanted people to sell of Swiss Francs but instead rich people just got the money in cash and stored it in stacks in bank safes.
Switzerland exports quite a bit of tech products and if the Swiss Franc doesn't devalue like the rest of the currencies, people stop buying swiss Products.
They are trying to devalue the Swiss Franc because everyone is buying it as it has one of the lowest inflation rates for a stable currency.
The Swiss franc is an international reserve currency along with USD, Euro, Yen and GBP. It turbulent times it is seen as a safe currency and so as money flows out of other reserve currencies and into Swiss francs, itâ€™s relative value has gone up, irrespective of their economy. That makes imports super cheap and their exports super expensive, which is very bad for their balance of trade and their economy overall.
The strong franc makes problems of course, especially in the economy that is focused on exports. But it has also positive effects, like when you import resources and goods, you pay less because of the strong currency.
