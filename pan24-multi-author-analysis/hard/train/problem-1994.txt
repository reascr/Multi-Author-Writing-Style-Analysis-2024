If someone has a history of domestic abuse and was never charged, then they should be able to buy a gun? Even if they express a desire to harm?
What is a "desire to harm others" here? Because if they made an actual threat, then thats a crime. The police can arrest them for that. They have literally never needed red flag laws to do so, thats always been illegal.
Red flag laws are utterly disgusting and contemptable. A total nullification of the presumption of innocence, the right to arms, the right to property, the right to a trial before jury of your peers, and the right to face your accuser, all in one tyrannical package.
So really we are talking about removing the rights of people who have committed no crime, who have not been arrested nor charged, for not even the suspicion of a crime, but the suspicion of maybe a potential future crime with zero evidence beyond hearsay, hearsay that the accused has no right to defend themselves against.
If someone did something bad enough to justify stripping them of their 2A rights and their property, then charge them with a crime, arrest them, have a trial in a court of law before a jury of their peers, convict them, and then you can do that.
No, if they actually committed said crimes, then the solution here is to charge them for it, have a trial, convict them, and then they can be barred from purchasing a gun.
If someone committed an act of violence, you dont need red flag laws, you can just charge them for the crime they committed.
