It is also worth mentioning that Appalachia, and especially West Virginia, have political roots that are pretty damned hard left. Labor uprisings in the region did a lot for labor rights throughout much of the twentieth century. A huge number of younger Appalachians have come to proudly embrace that part of Appalachian history and culture while recognizing the systemic injustices and corporate exploitation that still plagues the region, and so there’s been a major revitalization of leftism here.
Although it wasn’t West Virginia, I grew up pretty close to there in one of the most poor and rural areas in Central Appalachia. I’m a younger millennial, just on the cusp of being Gen Z. From what I’ve observed, younger people tend to skew left in general - even in areas where older generations tend to be overwhelmingly conservative. If the Democratic Party continues to view traditionally red states as political monoliths, it would be a mistake of massive proportions.
Unfortunately they're not wrong... WV is deep red, and won't vote for a Dem senator again for a long time, unless there's a huge political re-alignment.
"hmm he votes different from party line 11% of the time, so why don't we exchange him for a corrupt ultraMAGA GOP senator?".
I don't get Manchin criticism, he's from one the most conservative states in the whole country and people are think.
As a West Virginian, I can confidently say there's not a Republican in the state savvy enough to run against him. There are some moderates left here who vote for him every time. The Republicans always nominate the quackiest jackasses and lose big time. The Democrats may not like him, but they know they'll permanently lose the seat if they successfully primary him.
