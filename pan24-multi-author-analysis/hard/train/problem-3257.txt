The Bush and Blair administrations were aware of just how incredibly piss poor their evidence was which is why they spent so much effort trying to convince the public that these inspectors were clueless.
It isn't a false equivalence. The USA and UK invaded a sovereign nation over what we knew even then was almost certainly not factual. The fact that one nation is democratic and one was authoritarian is irrelevant as the claim I replied to was regarding the invasion of a sovereign nation.
You might not like the idea that those nations invaded Iraq over what they knew were lies but that does not change the truth.
The UNSC never agreed to the invasion of Iraq, that is a blatant lie. Multiple permanent members explicitly spoke out against it. It was an illegal invasion, stop living 20 years in the past.
Fun fact, "illegally" (is there a such thing as a legal invasion? No. It's just were you successful in justifying it to your constituents) invading a country isn't a war crime.
Its how you invade and act during the invasion. Which all things considered in the rankings of invasions it was probably one of the least war-crimey of all times. But don't let facts get in the way of whataboutism. Next you'll be complaining about "russiaphobia".
