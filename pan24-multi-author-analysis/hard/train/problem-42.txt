This is calculated, if you look at Russian media or videos interviewing the public on their opinions it shows that a significant portion of the population either completely believes this dialogue or are otherwise turning their heads and nodding along to try and avoid getting caught up in it. This is exactly what happened with Germany's citizens pre-WW1 except it's been drawn out over 30-40 years rather than 10-15, and that's far more terrifying imo.
The real issue we're facing is that the cold war never really ended, Russia conceded but never backed down and that has allowed them to privately continue their current regime without the gaze of the world.
Now lets reimbuse Ukraine the nukes they gave away to Russia after collapse of Soviet Union, when they were given security guarantees from Russia, USA and UK if they do so.
I’ll say it again: the fact that NATO refuses to join the war even when it’s Russia that started it is a clear proof that NATO had no intention to invade Russia at all, so Ukraine joining NATO can’t pose any threat to Russia. The only difference is that if Ukraine joins NATO, Russia will no longer be able to invade it, that’s why Russia wanted to do it before it’s too late.
Also they pretend it's weird that America thinks they want to take the whole Ukraine while saying earlier that they will take to at least the dnipro the next 3 years, preferably further.
It was interesting to see that they didn't play back a clip from the press conference but only showed the footage and let the host give some highlights. To be fair I haven't watched it either but it's very easy for them to change what has been said if viewers can't watch the original footage.
Also, who are they referig to with the messy haired clown they should have taken out earlier? Are they meanig Boris Johnson or Trump? Because they were pretty close with Trump I think.
