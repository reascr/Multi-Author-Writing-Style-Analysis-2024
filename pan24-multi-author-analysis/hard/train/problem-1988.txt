Fwiw usually authors don't write their own headlines. And I perfectly capable of forming my own opinion without needing the author to hold my hand.
The proposals are progressive. Its being framed as centrist to appeal to those it needs to appeal to. Some people saw the headline, made their opinion, and that's that.
But you are telling everyone that your opinion of what the title and article is about, is the truth.
Centrists are bringing the same problems progressives have, yet offer no solutions that anyone other than a republican would want.
But several folks have told you that the SOLUTIONS Centrists bring to those problems never work out.
Framing progressive goals as centrist proposals is a very effective way to do that. That's what I feel this article is doing. Hell, Bernie made a whole fucking campaign based on that tactic. But now it's a problem because the article used the word centrist.
So my issue here is that many are attacking the article for using the word "centrist" regardless of what the article actually says. It's just reactionary.
