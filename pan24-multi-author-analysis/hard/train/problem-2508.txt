Maybe you didn't hear me. Giving the people who can not afford health insurance the money to buy health insurance is not a conservative position.
You can use sub labels all you want, and you can keep your analysis of all that is wrong with the ACA going, but the simple fact is that expanding public welfare is a progressive position. Money goes direct from the US Treasury to people so they can buy health insurance. It just just skips going into bank account of the individual and goes to their directly to their selected health isurance provider.
I never said it was perfect. I said it was progressive, but obviously not progressive enough for many thus why the discussion is not whether she is progressive and is instead of how progressive she is.
The discussion is probably not so much whether she is progressive and more so whether she is/was progressive enough.
It was not progressive. Progressive would be getting healthcare to all citizen without giving massive give away to insurance companies that continue to deny claims and gouge on pricing.
