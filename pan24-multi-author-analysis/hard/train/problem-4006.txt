Dynamic pricing really just means they think demand is high enough that people will pay more money. That said, dynamic pricing should result in relatively high attendance, if prices are high and the stadium is half empty, that is more like monopolistic pricing.
My understanding is it is really the other way around, the venues all basically purchased ticket master, and the fees are more like hiding the blame. “Don't look at us, ticket master is doing it.” Ticketmaster just lets the venues and performers pretend that they aren‘t behind the fees.
How does one go about selling tickets without outrageous hidden fees? I still fail to understand the fees for an online transaction. Just add it to the original ticket price and stop dicking people around.
Ticketmaster makes more money on transfer fees for resellers than they make on the initial sale of the ticket.
On the initial sale, they'll keep 5-10% once, but on every time a ticket is resold by a third party they have to transfer it in Ticketmaster's computer systems, which is like 4% fee (when I was there, but it changes).
I've sometimes done Will Call for the same reason and just pick up my tickets at the venue, but a lot of places don't do that anymore, or make it a big hassle to do it, along with charging a fee, of course.
If you want to get these tickets you may as well skip all that nonsense and go right to the reseller's websites because that's where the tickets will be (with a mark-up, of course).
