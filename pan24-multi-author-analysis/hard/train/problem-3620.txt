When all you can do is attack from the right then these kinds of layup questions for Pete is all he is gonna get.
What else can Fox News attack him on? They can't ask him about what he is going to do to prevent more mass flight cancellations or if the US should straight up nationalize airlines like Buttigieg once claimed he would do to health insurance.
I'd be much more impressed with Pete's debating skills if he was willing to go on progressive media right now than Fox News.
The guy always comes off as ridiculously articulate and would regularly appear on Fox News, where heâ€™d dismantle their talking points one by one.
He has an insane talent for cutting through GOP talking points and bullshit and making them look like the charlatans they are on tv.
know Pete is unpopular on this sub but he is the most effective communicator in the Democratic party.
I actually love Pete and think if he wasn't a gay man with "Butt" in his name, he would be a lock for POTUS in the future but this country is fucking stupid and I'm not sure we could overcome such a childish obstacle.
