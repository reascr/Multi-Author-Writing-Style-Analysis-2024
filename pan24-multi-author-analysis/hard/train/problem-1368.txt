You are right. Self preservation is extremely hard to ignore. In their situation you’re probably going to do whatever it takes to survive. Follow orders so you don’t get shot, then do what you’re told but take advantage of any opportunity to get the fuck out, by either surrendering or deserting.
Yeah fuck that, if I was in my right mind I’d surrender as soon as I got the opportunity then spill my guts. “Those motherfuckers abducted me from rehab, threw a rifle and some ammunition at me then forced me to the front. I don’t wanna kill my countrymen, honestly, I just wanna get fucked up on Quaaludes and walk around town with no pants.”.
Like, if I’m a homeless alcoholic, I’m still going to be enraged by an invading force killing my countrymen.
I can’t help but feel that if I were a homeless alcoholic forced to fight my own people, the moment I had the chance I’d kill the highest ranking “friendly” pos I could get in my sights.
Or b) wait for the right moment to cause as much destruction to my oppressor with the weapons they gave me as possible (and probably die from the fallout).
