Not really. We ungerrymandered the legislature via ballot proposal. trump only won Michigan due to a protest vote in detroit that cost Biden 80k votes in a state trump won by 10k. And in this election we overwhelmingly passed three ballot measures that.
WI had the highest turnout (percentage-wise) this election. Referendums would draw out even more voters, and the GOP here simply don’t want to allow that.
They simply don’t want referendums; that would threaten their stranglehold on power in the state. I can count on one hand the number of referendums I’ve seen on the ballot since 2011.
Do y'all have voter referendums? Mi did this first, have the entire populace vote on mail ballots, and then took redistricting out of the hands of politicians. However, the MI supremes not being R kinda helped in some key spots. The trick is getting things in front of all voters, not the R legislature.
Looks like voters are figuring out local elections matter. That, and probably some zoomers who either couldn't or didn't vote before are also getting in on the action. Love to see it.
