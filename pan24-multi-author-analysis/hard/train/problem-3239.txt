There are very few people that push for abortion to be made illegal And are athiest. Also the loudest and most ardent supporters of infringing on LGBTQ+ peoples lives....are also religious.
People don't have to be atheist to be pro-choice or pro-LGBTQ rights, so by making it about that instead of the issue, you're severely limiting your own support.
I'll be totally honest...I don't know why the abortion stuff and LGBTQ+ stuff aren't being framed by democrats as a religious issue.
I'm not saying you make it a war on religion. People are free to get an abortion or not. To express themselves in how they see fit and to love whom they love. What's not ok is when a religious minority is sculpting the laws and pushing their way of life onto everyone else via legal means.
No. What I'm saying is that the people arguing to make it illegal are doing that on the basis of their religion.
Because most people are religious, or at least see themselves that way, and attacking religion like that would just serve to rally conservatives. Also the constitution says the government can’t establish an official religion or favor one over another, but it doesn’t say one can’t try to pass laws based on their religious beliefs. Maybe it should, but it doesn’t. People can try to pass laws based on their personal morality, whether that morality comes from religion or not.
