Their entire war strategy revolves around throwing everything at Seoul and causing as much damage as possible, with no plan after that 30 minute window it seems.
The war ends in 30 minutes. NK shoots all it's conventional weapons at Seoul, and SK responds and it's over. The thing is, those artillery pieces are within range of Seoul, and it doesn't take artillery long to fly through the air and hit, giving citizens very little time to seek shelter.
So Seoul proper and southern Seoul metro may be a bit of a stretch yeah depending on how modern their artillery and ammunition is.
The source below says that only 1/3 of Seoul is actually in range (only the northern part), which is less dense populated than the rest. And the farther south you go from the border, the less artillery is able to hit those long ranges. They may have some 30-40km artillery, but those are few apart and not in relevant numbers.
Looks like one of the current US artillery pieces can barely make it 40km with the right type of ammunition.
One question, does NK have artillery that has a range of 30+km? And if they have, how much of those do they have?
