I don't remember him being demonized for being a warmonger. I remember him for siding with people we shouldn't be friendly with. Making peace with your enemies by selling your ideals is not my idea of right. It matters why we would be going to war.
You mean you want to go to war? If you do and fully support that... Would you feel and say exactly the same if Trump or a conservative was President?
I'm honestly amazed that leftists are apparently so hardcore... That there's absolutely nothing Democrats are doing wrong... Criminals are now victims and released regularly, committing murder and more crime; inflation radically jumped because Democrats (and yes others prior) are absolutely out of control on printing paper that is becoming more meaningless (trillions and trillions of dollars), and now the hardcore bent toward indoctrinating children as homosexual/trans and encouraging them to have permanent body surgery (reasonably called mutilization); energy costs, food costs, have doubled in the last 2 years (yes, and guess who is President right now?).
There it is. Follow your media handlers and deny, obfuscate, ridicule. All while these fuckers rape our children, drag us into meaningless wars, burn down our country. Right. Just kidding folks. Hunter is a model citizen. Uncle Joe isnâ€™t even a little bit creepy. Have some more koolade.
