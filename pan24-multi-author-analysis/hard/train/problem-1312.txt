How did Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and/or the feds respond to this? Surely at least the feds said or did something about Bolsonaro being a wanted fugitive?
It's not just a haven for Brazilians. It's also a tax haven for a lot of rich and wealthy politicians and other major figures from across Central and South America. (More recently, it's also became a haven for Russians hiding their ill-gotten assets.).
2. Because of Lava Jato’s corruption that Lula can’t be trialed again. Lula didn’t create any law, and didn’t destroy due process. If impartial judges and prosecutors were doing their work, maybe Lula would have being sentenced. Maybe, but we’ll never know because they unjustifiable tried to convict him before he could be a candidate in 2018. They acted politically and created this mess, not Lula.
It was political persecution so Lula would not be able to run for president in 2018. The judge of the case conspired with the prosecution, and after Lula was arrested and Bolsonaro won, the judge became Bolsonaro's justice Minister. Lula's conviction was reverted later and if you're Brazilian, you know that.
Bolsonaro got in presidency, Lula got in jail, all other participants got the money back, but Lula didn't. He procrastinated all he could his processes untill they run out of time. He's basically a convicted without a sentence. Hence the strong support for Bolsonaro.
Historically, Bolsonaro defended the Republic and went there to take out the 2 major parties, that together stole more than 3 trillions.
