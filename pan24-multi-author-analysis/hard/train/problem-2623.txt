Fuck Trump, but assuming I had started a charity that was doing work I thought was worthwhile (presumably I would), that's probably the primary place where I'd put my donations.
I'm the last person that would defend Trump, but he didn't say he was foregoing his salary but rather he said he was going to donate it to charity. So yes, him earning the salary is correct.
You mom gives you $100 to pay the landscaper and you put it in the bank. When the groundskeeper comes, you write him a check for $100 from your bank account.
We're not discussing whether or not Trump is a fraudster. We have proof he is. We're discussing whether or not he donated his salary as he said he would.
He never said he would not take a salary, just that he would donate it all to various charities. So the question is did he donate it all like he said?
Any proof that he did donate his money? Cause he's had charities before and all of that money went into his own pocket. But now it's different? He promised to use campaign donations to help fellow Republicans in their races. He never did. But this is different though...
