Why just a race war? What about a regular kind of war like the one going on in the Ukraine that turns into a world war and goes nuclear?
Other nations: Be careful Bulgaria, we cannot be openly seen to be taking sides with weaponry in case it causes the war to escalate.
I don't know what Eastern European nations think (we are Southern more than Eastern), but the majority of Bulgarians had no issue with Russia, before this war, and even now many still don't.
Also historically we have a lot of good will for Russia, since it was them who liberated us from the Ottoman Empire, after 500 years of occupation.
Not how many people view it in Bulgaria. While the majority of younger people (as far as I've seen) are anti-Russian and pro-West, the older generation who lived during our communist phase are generally pro-Russia.
Those people liked communism (we were much worse before it, my grandmother has stories about hunger and how a single orange was a treasured gift for Christmas), some studied in Russia, have friends there and consider them "brotherly" people. They've watched Russian cartoons as children and read Russian books as teenagers.
