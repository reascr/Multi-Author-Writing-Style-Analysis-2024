In line with this discussion I am curious as to why the coverage of Wagner group activities in Africa never gets an appropriate amount of media coverage, it's all over the news when it's in Ukraine and even Syria gets mentioned, but the activity in Africa is at a whole other level and has been increasing for about 8 years now.
There is a long list of injustice enacted all over Africa but if it's ever going to end it would be logical to start with highlighting the most egregious actions by outside actors.
doubt that ... African governments, elites and rebel groups are just as deep into the exploitation at the expense of their own people as everybody else.
Capitalism is looking to destroy and reduce the lives of Africans, and everyone here is focused on religion?
What does that have to do with the growing threat of exploitation of Africa? Foreign companies and nations are in bidding wars to control the region right now.
It’s as if you’re all incapable of seeing the world with any nuance. Perhaps the church is and its effects are not to be seen in black and white.
