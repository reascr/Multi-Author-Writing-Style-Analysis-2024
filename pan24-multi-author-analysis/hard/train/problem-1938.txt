I am hoping that he will self incriminate so spectacularly that there is no ambiguity or legal wiggle room. Something along the lines of "sure she said she didn't want it at the time but I convinced her afterwards she did" in A Few Good Men style melt down.
He's such a narcissist he cannot really comprehend consent as he would have to acknowledge someone else. I actually think this is him coming to terms with being a rapist for a brief moment. His head will spin it as "she didn't want you it, I had the power, women want powerful men, she wanted it, it's not rape".
So bad phrasing on her part that he is trying to use to suggest "I didn't rape her; she's too ugly for me; but if I did; she loved it bigly.".
Whether he succeeded or not, he attempted it and twisting her words doesn't change that. This attorney isn't letting his weasel words slide and neither is the judge.
This is by no means siding with the creep, but out of curiosity I read the interview with Anderson Cooper. She isn't a hell of a lot better with words than Trump and suggested that some people like rape... it's sexy... By that she we alluding to role playing.
I watched the clip that someone posted above and her comments about some people thinking rape is sexy were cut off by the commercial break so she didn't get a chance to explain herself. I don't want to put words into her mouth, so hopefully clarifies at some point, but this is my take on what she was saying...
I think she was saying that Trump thought it was sexy. It seems like the kind of display of power that might turn him on. I can see her wanting to not associate with rape if she thinks that would be a sexy thought in Trumps mind.
Edit: Prior to this, it was believed that Donald John Trump raped women. I think his statement solidifies the fact that Donald John Trump is a rapist.
