Alright, so you're a cop and you open the door and there are 2 guys holding a hammer. Which one do you tackle/shoot?
How were they supposed to know who was the victim in this case if they are literally both holding onto the hammer?
Any reasonable juror would determine that a rational person striking someone in the head with a hammer would understand that the hammer blow could cause death. The attacker was aware of this. He hit Pelosi in the head with the hammer anyway.
The attackers stated intent - an intent to inflict bodily harm on Nancy Pelosi; specifically, to smash her knees with the hammer - doesn’t fucking matter to the prosecutors at all.
He tried to kill Paul Pelosi, in his bedroom, late at night. The only reason he was there to begin with was because he planned on being there. He thought (meditated) about his actions before (pre) he did them.
It would be fairly easy to show premeditation and intent. He broke into someone’s house and hit them in the head with a hammer. Where did the hammer come from? He brought it with him, to use against people. It was in the backpack, along with other tools for murder and terrorism.
