Because they’ll never be able to qualify. FIFA still loves money, but if you aren’t hosting, you actually have to perform well in international qualifiers in order to make the tournament.
Qatar has never qualified for a World Cup and their entry this year is just because of their hiring gig. If you suddenly think Qatar is going to be good enough to qualify for United 2026 you’re crazy. If you think Qatar has enough money to make FIFA let them host again after this shit show, you’re also crazy.
It is a clean up because fifa took bribes from Qatar to put wc in Qatar. That's not the case whit U.s that's why it's good.
They meet about 4 weeks per year and play together compare that to the club where they play like the rest of the year together whit the team, its just better quality when playing club fotball and you don't have to deal whit fifa.
Haha do you really think there will not be security around the arenas, they have sport events every months and weeks whit no mass shooting or suicide bombers and car bombs.
