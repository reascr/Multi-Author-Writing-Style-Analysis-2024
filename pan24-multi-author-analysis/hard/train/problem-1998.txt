Hopefully, it will be like the morons who tried to burn down an immigration services center and not only ended up setting themselves on fire but dropped their cell phones while getting away.
And then there's the man accused of mugging a woman who chose to defend himself and asked his alleged victim on the witness stand "Did you get a good look at me when I stole your purse?".
True enough there. I’m more or less playing “devil’s advocate” here and trying to point out that it isn’t nearly as hard as it used to be to find enough information about things to do very stupid things in somewhat effective manners now as it once was.
If you want to do it yourself, type the following into your search engine of choice: “EATON pad-mounted three phase transformer maintenance manual.”.
Also of note it took me all of 30 seconds to find the maintenance manuals that include parts diagrams for substation transformers. It doesn’t take nearly as much specialized knowledge to commit grievous acts of stupidity as it used to before the internet left government and university computer labs.
