Early in the war, I read an article by a NATO anylist who specialized on Russia. In the article, he explained that Putin could lose 1 million Russiin soldiers before the war became a political issue for him at home.
the problem is not how many millions of russian soldiers will die but if Ukr can support the cost. reports are coming from Bakhmut tell about massacre (hundred of deaths daily on both sides) that in reality only Moscow can really afford on the long run.
The rapid accelerated death of Russia is what we are all watching, if we do see One Million dead, combined with longer the youth that fled Russia stay away, the less likely they are ever to return.
My thought is that the ratio of deaths on the Russian side will continue to escalate this year, as Ukraine rolls out more armor and weaponry + the Russian jam less and less trained and lower moral conscripts into the hellstorm.
I don't think the Zerg rush tactic will work this time around for Russia, and in truth, that is their only strategy in war.
There is no scenario here where a nuclear strike would make any sense. You can argue that they could throw one at Ukraine to force capitulation, but a nuclear strike would not be just a Ukraine issue, it could easily irradiate and affect a swath of Europe and require a NATO response.
I watched the Peter Zeihan JRE episode today and he was citing 500K as the number. His point was that Ukraine now has more armor and weapons than they did before the war (between NATO and EU contributions and the insane amount of things Russia abandoned) that once all of that gets put into the front, you will see a huge fire superiority discrepancy and Russia will have to use the only asset it can to try and balance the scales: men.
