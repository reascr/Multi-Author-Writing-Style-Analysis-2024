Ukraine has already been attacking military targets in Russia proper, so that's definitely something they'd continue to do if Russia refuses to give up. Sending troops in any significant number over the border seems unlikely tho.
Neither Ukraine nor Russia seem to show a lack of manpower anytime soon. The issue for both sides are mostly material, which much depends on how aid Ukraine will get and how large Russia's weapon stockpiles actually are.
If the Ukrainians want to fight to the last Ukrainian against the Russian menace, what's so bad about the west arming them and benefiting from it?
I'm going to play devil's advocate here: several years is bad for both Ukraine and Russia. But, keeping the war in Ukraine (with only Russia as the other war party) is in Europe's and USA's best interest. And as long as the west is only supplying arms, Russia has a very weak case to get more direct help from / involvement of friendly nations (namely, china and India).
Not my preference at all, to be very clear. I would love it if the Ukrainians chased out the Russians tomorrow and reclaimed their full territory. I also do not allege that western nations don't want to help Ukraine - but they have to think of themselves first.
I get your meaning, but I don't think Ukraine's agenda is different from the US / NATO / rest of the West.
