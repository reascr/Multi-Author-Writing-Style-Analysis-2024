Here's a different example: I do not have a million dollars in $1 bills in my wallet right now. Would you also argue that that is impossible to prove? Might the bills be hiding from you as you look?
At some point it is. I don't think Trump qualifies, but at some point being unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy certainly counts as insane. It's a reasonable concern for a prosecutor. Fortunately Trump's ego would never let him plead insanity regardless.
No, contrary to popular claims, it's easy to prove many negatives. They just need to be specific and limited. What you can't disprove is a general negative ("there are no black swans" vs "there are no black swans in my back yard right now").
But if your back yard is, you know, a back fucking yard, it is not hard to verify the absence of fucking swans.
How would you go about proving there are no black swans in your back yard? All the strategies I can think of involve proving a series of positives and then showing that they are logically incompatible with the negative.
