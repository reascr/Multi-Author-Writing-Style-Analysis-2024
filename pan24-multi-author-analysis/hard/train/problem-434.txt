The states that go early have a more influence on the nominee than the states that have a primary in July or August. The media will start spinning up narratives about the horse race in anticipation of Iowa and doesn't stop until we get a presumptive nominee.
The real problem is that Iowa and New Hampshire are not as diverse as other states. That matters to democrats more than republicans.
Itâ€™s farther from the median Democrat voter profile. As I already detailed with actual statistics. If you have different statistics to show it is closer, I would love to see it.
That's now how statistics work. A 19% voting group nationally representing a majority in South Carolina represents a lack of representative diversity. To take your example even further, under your rationale, a 99% black state would be "diverse". You're just using diversity to mean more of a single group of people. Thus inverting what diversity even means.
The party moved from an unrepresentative state to a less representative state of the party as a whole.
I've seen you also comment on the nation v the Democratic Party voter mix. I and others responding to you have already accounted for that. You've just dug a hole for yourself factually and keep digging deeper.
