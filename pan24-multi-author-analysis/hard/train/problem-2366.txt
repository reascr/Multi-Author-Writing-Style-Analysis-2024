What if instead of trying to be a career politician she just focused on doing her job of being a good representative she wouldn't have to campaign so much because her "good work" would be enough for people to remember and to continue to want her to be their representative. Also feels like these jobs were created in the first place to be temporary positions of public service not lifelong jobs.
Congressional term limits would also help create a government that actually represents the country it is meant to.
It's strange that most of our Congresspeople live so differently than the people they are meant to represent. Sure, legal expertise has its value, but more important the ability to empathize with the people you serve is what we need. If an elected official cannot even fathom the struggles of their constituents — and makes no effort to do so — how fit are they really to be an advocate?
Maybe forbid consecutive terms so that they're relieved of the burden of campaigning while also serving, but you always have experienced reps tagging in. You'd need to tweak pension rules, unemployment benefits, etc, but nothing unmanageable. A House-owned block of flats would also be a sensible thing to make available, so that renting in DC is no longer a job requirement.
As much as I dislike her DC is crazy expensive and you legally must maintain 2 residences while in office. AOC said the same thing and every conservative pundit poured out of the woodwork to dump on her...
