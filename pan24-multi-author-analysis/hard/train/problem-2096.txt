Lololol westerners view Christianity with a naive quaintness mostly because of how NON-foreign it is, but it's just corrupt and fucked up religious institution lololol.
Westerners view Buddhism with a na√Øve quaintness mostly because of how foreign it is, but it's just as corrupt and fucked up as any other religious institution.
Probably part of a larger, ongoing crackdown. My wife is Thai and she says this kind of thing has been going on forever (decades), it's only recently that the issues have gotten so much spotlight. They even have their own kiddie diddling scandals as well just like Western religious institutions.
Meh they're more aware of the recent stuff the pedophile priests, evangelical priests being arrested with drugs and hookers, etc. They're less aware of the fact that they're likely only catholic because their ancestors would have been killed by their roman emperor, king, feudal lord, inquisition, or reigning imperial power if they weren't. Also some assorted/attempted genocides have been swept under the rug. Look up the popes response of what to do with Muslims in Spain after the reconquista, he told the Spanish king to put them on a ship without sails and push them out to sea so they would die to the ocean. I could go on but the list is way too long for one reddit post.
