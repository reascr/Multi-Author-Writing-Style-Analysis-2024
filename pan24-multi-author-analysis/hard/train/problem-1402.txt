Navalny himself previously based his positions on . The Venn diagram of Navalny supporters and Z supporters exactly comes from this nationalistic base.
Russia needs leadership that is not jingoistic and National-supremist in order to make amends and integrate into the world community. Navalny is not a candidate for that.
Navalny is a russian politician. He can think of Russia first in terms of being a reliable economic partner and not an empire. But he believes in russian superiority. Read up on Boris Nemtsov. He was the guy that people imagine Navalny to be.
Why should I align or not with Navalny's outlook? He's a typical representation of an Eastern European, but this cultural gap doesn't allow you to make things up to feed your own bias.
He is a russian ultra nationalist who sees russians as better than Ukrainians, and I don't think that should be glossed over.
I also thought Navalny's position has always been that Russia should take Ukraine by force - seems that has conviently changed if it makes him more popular in the west (I doubt he has lost his hatred for Ukrainians).
Regarding Ukrainians, you could at most blame him for the "Pan-Slavism" which was common in people before the war, the idea that Slavic countries should have closer diplomatic relationships. There are plenty of videos online where he answers his position regarding Ukraine - he stated multiple times that Russia is interested in a strong, peaceful, and independent Ukraine.
