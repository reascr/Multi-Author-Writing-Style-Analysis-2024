Theoretically but considering a recent trend of running as one type of person and suddenly being another person once elected there needs to be more rules in place to discourage that.
If your state votes you into office under one party, switching parties should trigger a special election to give voters a chance to decide whether you represent them or not.
But if the party changes, then shouldn't the representatives be able to divest themselves? Forcing special elections for party disloyalty gives a huge amount of power to the parties.
For instance the GOP could have removed Liz Cheney for going against Trump and forced a special election to remove her.
If you made it so you could force special elections on political opponents, then parties would definitely force members to change membership to pressure them.
It is changing parties. The party has the ability to control membership. It can make someone an independent. The only reason this is never leveraged is because party membership cannot be used as a weapon.
