I'm certain that had russia not launched 100 missiles at Ukranian targets yesterday, to include cities near the Polish border, this never would have happened.
Are you actually this stupid when Zelensky claimed it had been Russia or do you think Ukraine doesn't know where it's "defense system" is firing missiles to?
Some might say that if Russia hadn't been launching missiles into Ukraine, then Ukraine wouldn't have had to launch interceptors.... Making the outcome very much something to do with Russia.
- Russia wouldn’t have nukes if the us didn’t place the ussr in a position where they felt they would be next after ww2.
- Germany wouldn’t have attacked Russia if the west would have given them support like they did Britain.
- Russia wouldn’t have invaded if NATO would have kept their agreement of non expansion from the 1990’s.
So, from Putin's perspective, Russia had no NATO countries at their doorstep, and had secured a deal to keep it that way. Now, he had Ukraine openly speaking about joining NATO and several US lawmakers publicly saying that the US would join them in an offensive against his country. Thus, I believe, Putin took the opportunity to make the first move before he had his own Cuban missile crisis.
Ask yourself what would happen to Cuba if Russia were to install "missile defense systems" on the island.
