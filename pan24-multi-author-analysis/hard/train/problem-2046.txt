Suprise mechanics is when I find extra fries in the bottom of my McDonald's bag. They where always part of the fries I got, but they are a nice suprise.to find anyway.
If it crashes we might just go back to an age where actually good games are made to earn a profit instead of scummy practices.
Game franchises like age of empires and sim city made money without loot boxes and folks still play . Unreal tournament GOTY, DOOM .. etc . No loot boxes .
it had nothing to do with ethics, the states just like to steal peoples money without ever giving you a service in return because they are absolutely shit at budgeting. So they tax something to make up for the shortfalls of mismanagement. They contributed nothing to indie developers who struggle to make games. They contributed nothing to help online market places like steam.
there was a time when the sin tax seemed to make sense, but after years of data to evaluate we find that it does nothing for the reduction of alcohol and smoking use. Then a paradigm shift occurs, vaping becomes popular. People have a somewhat much safer means to consume nicotine. AND THEY TAX THAT.
The problem is that gaming companies are bloated with upper management that are more concerned with profit and stock prices than actually make a simple and fun Game.
