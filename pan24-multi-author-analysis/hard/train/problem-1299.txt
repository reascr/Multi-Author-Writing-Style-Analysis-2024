If he starts his own party and takes his huge block of cultish followers with him, there's no way they'd continue to help him.
If this criticism continues, he’ll be driven to “prove them all wrong” by starting his own party to show them he’s still dominant. At this point I think the main reason he hasn’t already started his own party is because he doesn’t want to pay for it. But if the pressure on his narcissist ego gets bad enough, I can see him doing it. And he’ll take down those he has dirt on in the process to punish the GOP for disloyalty.
Since he’s a malignant narcissist I guarantee he is going through absolute hell. He’ll eventually figure out who to blame and how in order to make himself feel better, but right now he’s in meltdown mode. I also guarantee he has started a running list of who is blaming him and who is hinting at supporting desantis. If the challenges to his ego are sufficient enough he’ll split from the GOP and begin his own party, tearing down everyone on those lists and anyone else he perceives as having been disloyal in the process.
I don’t think the crazy hate is going back in the box. They’ve always been this way, but they were just better at hiding it before the tea party crap began. And once trump appeared on the scene the lid to Pandora’s box of fascism got ripped off and will never close again.
