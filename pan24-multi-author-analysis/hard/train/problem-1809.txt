Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine â€” The week before Christmas, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived unannounced in the eastern town of Bakhmut, right on the front line of his country's fight against the Russian invasion. He was there to boost morale and hand out medals.
In the eastern city of Kramatorsk, right back in the thick of it, Chernyavsky told CBS News the war along the front line, which stretches for hundreds of miles, "would be very different" if it wasn't for the heavy American weapons.
Instead of humbly accepting the Ukrainian military's Cross of Merit, Chernyavsky handed it right back to the president.

As Trump would have just let Putin roll into Ukraine and take over, installing a puppet government as he intended to do, they really owe Biden their highest honor that Ukraine has. It is unlikely there would have been as strong of a coalition without US leadership/military/dollars involved to support. Biden has a lot of faults, but he did the right thing here and is instrumental in Ukraine being able to persevere over this horrible war.
that being said though, the Ukrainians have a hell of a fighting spirit, they have not let this break them and that has been imperative to their successes so far.
