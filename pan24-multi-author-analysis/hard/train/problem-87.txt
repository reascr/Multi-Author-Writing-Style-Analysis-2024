Absolutely not. Recall is a bad solution. This is not a parliamentary type system. If someone votes for someone they need to live with that choice and next time not make idiotic assumptions and actually spend time researching candidates. I hate recalls with a passion because it can and will be abused.
In all honesty. They were a bunch of fucking idiots who voted for him and resigning isn't going to happen. Hopefully next time they don't take a maga candidate at his word but they need to live with there own idiocy until the next election.
My concern is that every Member of Congress would have to stand for election, then defend a recall the next year, then stand for election again.
A mechanism for Congressional recalls should move forward considering the barking mad grifters that now hold positions of power.
And it wouldn't just happen to grifter weirdos: the howler monkey contingent would try to recall the Speaker, and every committee chair, and anyone who ran for Senate.
Santos had zero chance... until the legislative maps were shifted after he had already run unopposed for the Republican nomination.
The Speaker of the House has the ability to uphold the reputation of that body by calling on all of its members to expel him.
The other answer would be having Congress expel him, but again, Republicans are shameless enough to refuse to hold him accountable.
