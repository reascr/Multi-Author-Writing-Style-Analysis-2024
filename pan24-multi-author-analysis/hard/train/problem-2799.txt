How is this any different than the inflation they were railing against a month ago? "Vote for us, Democrats made your expenses go up by 10%. We can do 30% in perpetuity instead!".
How can a party that insists taxation is theft propose a brand new federal tax that would severely impact most households? Do Republicans hate progressive policies so much they'd rather spend 30% on top of their 0-10% existing sales taxes just to prove they owned the libs?
Explanation: it's a horrible Libertarian idea that cuts taxes on the wealthy & increases them on the poor & middle class. Nothing 'fair' about a fair tax.
How's this for a fair tax? Taxes are fair when the people who benefit the most from society's infrastructure (ie, what the taxes pay for) pay the most in taxes.
And that right there is why "fair tax" is a lie the same way stairs are "fair" to both people in wheelchairs and people who can walk.
Tennessee, as a great example of a shithole, has almost 10% local sales taxes. Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, etc are all 9% or higher sales taxes.
Equal very often isn't fair. Republican leadership knows it's regressive so they come up with piles of shit, like calling it fair tax, to drum up support among people with room temperature IQs.
Also it would make life extremely miserable for the (mostly) shithole states that rely solely on sales/property tax rather than income taxes.
