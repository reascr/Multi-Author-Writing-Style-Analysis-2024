The biggest feasibility issue with bioweapons is that once you deploy them, they're completely uncontrollable. It's practically guaranteed that they'll end up infecting a ton of people you don't actually want to kill, like your soon-to-be-former allies or your own population. And if your enemies know what you've done, you've just started an open war of annihilation with them. Some nations will even respond with nuclear weapons, so it's got pretty much all the cons of nukes without the ability to direct all the death and destruction other than in a very vague way at the start.
I still can’t imagine Russia would be stupid enough to launch a nuke, knowing that there will be severe repercussions for that and there will be retaliation. We’ll see how this plays out, but it is a bit unsettling. I also don’t think China wants direct involvement in this mess.
If China starts sending weapons to Russia, it will be a big geopolitical shake-up, but I don't think WW3. I mean, when you think about WW3, either Russia or China will need to directly attack NATO first, or NATO will need to directly attack one of them first, or there has to be some sort of accident that demands a military response. (someone accidentually shoots down a NATO plane, for example).
So when people bring up WW3 breaking out, I have to ask who is attacking who first? We will not attack China directly if they start supplying ammo and drones to Russia. We will sanction them. Russia will not, and has not, attacked NATO directly because they cannot handle us in a conventional conflict. It would be nuclear, and would be suicide, and the Russians are not suicidal yet.
