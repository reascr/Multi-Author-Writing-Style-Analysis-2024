The water rights to the Colorado have been an issue since the settlement of the West began and the way this has been handled is testament to how.much of a disaster it can be when individual states "work things out" without a federal apparatus to manage things.
"All [they] need to do is form a water district"=political issue, especially given the article addresses this and the political failure of their attempts to do so.
In the 1960s, Arizona accepted junior priority rights on a portion of its Colorado River water in exchange for federal funding for the Central Arizona Project (or CAP, the 336-mile long canal that delivers Colorado River water to the central, populous parts of the state). As such, Arizona has stepped up and taken water cuts, sooner than originally anticipated. That’s a good thing. But if Arizona is forced to bear the entire shortage burden in the Lower Colorado River Basin, the impacts to millions of people, including vulnerable communities, will be considerable.".
Oh yeah. That’s right. They did ask citizens to try to use less water and also we couldn’t water our lawns while churches and (other) businesses kept their grass green. I suppose the data behind who or what entities use the lion’s share of water in our state. There was less than a 2% reduction in water use from doing that. The reason these idiots aren’t doing anything substantive is because their idiot base doesn’t believe in science and they’re brainwashed enough to think capitalism is the most important pillar in their lives, well, right after the church I guess.
