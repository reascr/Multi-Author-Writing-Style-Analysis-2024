That's interesting, I didn't expect it would be so high, given some of the signs and barn paintings I've seen from the Interstate. Could this be a case of "Reddit effect" where there are actually a lot of rural Democrats, but they're afraid to speak up because they're not in the majority?
The complaint about "it's over before my state votes" is a bit bogus as the general election itself is like that for Western US. If someone gets 270 before CA votes for example.
Mr. Shakir forgets that Biden's win in SC primary was reflected in Biden's win in GA which ended up giving the Presidency and the Senate to Democrats.
The flaw that dooms Mr. Shakirs's complaint is we are talking about a subset of voters in SC, Democratic voters, 23% of voters in SC and that subset is 60% Black voters.
That is the objection that Sanders campaign manager makes to the changes in the Democrats primary which he, otherwise, applauds.
Its because the democrats in SC are fairly moderate, and would never vote for a candidate like Bernie. Its to help take steam out of the momentum of potential progressive candidates.
Likely too worried about a progressive candidate gaining too much early ground. Some Dems unfortunately still see Clintonâ€™s triangulation strategy as viable so we get diet right fiscal measures and a group of people slow to codify the social issues they campaign on.
