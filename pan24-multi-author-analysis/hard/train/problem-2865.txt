or "Jesus" disagrees with everything they are saying. If they try to tell you that abortion is murder, just say, "I just spoke to Jesus last night, and he told me you were going to say this. Jesus told me abortions are just fine, that you're an idiot and that no one should listen to you." Anything they try to claim is "God's will", just immediately dispute while claiming you spoke directly to God and that he agrees with you.
If the "Christian" tries to claim authority based on the Bible, just tell them they're reading the wrong Bible. Tell them that Jesus gave you a copy of the "true bible" and told you not to show it to assholes because they like to misinterpret things to their own benefit. Any passage they try to read from their own Bible, simply comment that Jesus told you he redacted that section. "Jesus told me that they stopped doing this shit in the middle ages, and in the 2023 version, that section is removed.".
P.S.: it's a bad political move for the left to rag on religion so much. Polls show that most people are still religious to some degree; it's a part of being human for a lot of people. The left has to show some of that nuance they're famous for and be more tolerant, too OR at least get their message straight that they're not God haters and fall right into the hate preachers' "us v. them" agenda. If you actually read the Gospels (& ignore the stuff written/approved by the authorities), there's not a lot of bad things that can be said of Jesus. People just don't read the Bible is the problem......and it's not even the 1400s. lol.
It's not happening fast or strong enough, but REAL CHRISTIANS, especially their leaders need to separate themselves from these Bible illiterate hate mongers. Those "Jesus Gets Us" Ads (if genuine) are a good first step.
Read the 'Parable of the Unjust Steward' in Luke. I mean, they're spending their own money on good messaging like thinking about the poor, powerless, and migrants. I don't see a problem with that.
