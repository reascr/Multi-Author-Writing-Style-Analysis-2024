Yes and no. I think if we see a scenario like we did with the Speaker vote, where 6-20 Republicans are holding up their own party it would behoove Democrats to play some hardball with Kevin and threaten to side with the loud minority in calling for his removal unless he gives the Democrats some of what they want.
One of two things happens, either Kev loses his Speakership and the House goes through Hell again to pick a new one, or he folds to Democrats, which saves his Speakership but further pisses off the extremists in his party which all but ensures another one of these votes comes up again.
“ As he worked to flip holdouts within his party and secure the votes he needed to take the Speakership, McCarthy agreed to lower the threshold for forcing a vote to oust the House Speaker to just one lawmaker.”.
I am thinking that 2 weeks into the inevitable government shutdown there will be at least 5 moderate republicans that are willing to work with the dems and nothing will stop them from removing McCarthy.
The freedom caucus has given themselves a lot of power to pass virtue signalling bills that go nowhere but weakened their influence over the only things that matter in this session.
I get a little sense of panic every time the Republicans announce one of their disastrous bills they’re going to pass, before I remember there’s no way it will pass the Senate. There’s still the debt ceiling and budget to worry about, but the Senate holding the line gives me some comfort.
