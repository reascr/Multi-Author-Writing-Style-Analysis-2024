"Typical symptoms of croup include: a bark-like cough a hoarse or croaky voice difficulty breathing a harsh grating sound when breathing in, called stridor Stridor is often most noticeable when the child cries or coughs. But in more severe cases of croup it can also occur when the child is resting or sleeping. Symptoms tend to be worse at night.".
Yes. Entirely anecdotal evidence that I catch very few colds when I keep my house cooler and more humid. But it works for me. I was also wondering why no mention of viruses and dry conditions too.
I've read that viruses die 40+% faster in humidity of at least 50-55% than in dry air. It's actually written in the paperwork on my humidifier, which I initially bought to also help keep us safer from viruses. I don't understand why humidifier vouchers or something similar weren't ever even mentioned or suggested. It's really a no brainer.
Saying disease transmission doesn't happen in your house is like saying you can't get sick breathing inside a hospital or inside a lab, and you certainly don't need to wear special gear. What planet are you from? MOST disease transmission happens inside.
Completely wrong. For one, forced air most definitely dries out the air inside, to the point of chapped lips,bloody noses, and wood shrinkage. The more your furnace recirculates and heats, the drier the air gets.
Heating air will increase the amount of moisture it could hold, but won't add any new moisture. What follows is that air humidity falls, and you need a humidifier in winter.
Also living in low air humidity isn't good for you either. Your skin is dry, your lips get cracked, breathing through your nose becomes uncomfortable, etc.
Having higher air humidity raises the perceived room temperature, which is a plus if you're trying to save energy.
And in your office, you most definitely CAN do something about humidity. Small desktop humidifiers work quite well on the immediate surroundings.
