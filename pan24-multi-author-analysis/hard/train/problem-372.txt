>“He just felt like there was so much drama really over the situation, and especially what we’re doing to work to remove Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee,” she told CNN.She added: “But Mr. Santos’ statement in there was just saying that he spoke with Speaker McCarthy and made this decision on his own.”.
Ohh, he's stepping down because they want to remove Rep. Omar from the intelligence committee and it's easier without Dems being able to point to Santos being a security threat. CNN pundit just said he thinks it means that McCarthy doesn't have the votes and is using this as a next step.
McCarthy doesn’t want him to resign because the seat would undoubtedly go back to the Dems. However, his position on committees undercuts his argument for Schiff, Swalwel, and Omar to be removed.
McCarthy is currently trying to make up reasons to remove Schiff, Swalwell, and Omar from their committee assignments for trumped up reasons including “integrity.”.
So McCarthy pretty much tells Santos to “step down” from his committee assignment of his own accord. This way he doesn’t have to set the precedent of actually holding someone accountable for anything other than badmouthing Trump, and he can use Santos as an example of GOP members being “responsible and serious” about committee assignments.
