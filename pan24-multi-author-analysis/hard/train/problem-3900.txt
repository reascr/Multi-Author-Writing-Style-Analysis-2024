Still allowed but doesn't have access to the information that would be available in say for example the intel committee when something pretty big like covid is on the horizon circa January 2020 that could effect slcertain stocks and shit. That's the important stuff and nobody is gonna leak that stuff to Santos cause nobody likes him they just need a warm body in his seat.
Nah thats true but not true committee participation has tons of lucrqtive perks: insider trading, big companies owing you favors for helping, etc. His congressional pay is unchanged yes but nobody is in politics for their measly state given salary, they want powerful connections and the ability to insider trade with impunity.
Now that's convenient, he's going to stay on as a Congressman and continue to make his salary, but not serve on any committees and actually do some actual work.
He won't resign, but he's going to step down from serving on committees until these issues concerning him are resolved.
Seems like this guy is in over his head and knows he will be exposed by his fellow congressmen as being truly unqualified if he spends any duration of time working on the committees.
Yup, actual committee work is often pretty tedious ... besides, he expects to be much too busy doing Faux shows, setting up the next stage of his "careerx" and stashing some money (got them lawyers to pay now!).
