Yeah hopefully in the future it just gets ignored. Conceding is a nice gesture, but it is meaningless as far as who won and who lost. The jets lost on Sunday. Them refusing to admit they lost doesn't change the outcome.
I don't get why we keep hearing about which loser refused to concede? The headline suggests there's something fishy about the winner of an election starting to prepare for doing the job.
Which is normal. That is always what is done. That someone bothered to write an article and publish it suggests this is not normal. That something is happening that we should take notice of.
It's like if every action Biden took was reported as "Biden does X without consulting president Trump first.".
That's what is supposed to happen. Conceding is a tradition that I would argue is good anywhere with elections, but it is not at all necessary.
Actually it shows that we all will work together by respecting the results of the election. Not conceding gives voice to disgruntled losers and allows them to foment rebellion/resistance. Concession is key to a peaceful transition.
