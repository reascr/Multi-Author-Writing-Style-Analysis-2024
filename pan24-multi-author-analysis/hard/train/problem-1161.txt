That's a power move. Only the Gigast of Chads would wear that outfit and them piss themselves on live TV.
Only cowards use diapers. Real MenTM just piss themselves and own it, like this clearly most Manliest of Men.
I mean that's as good an option as any other really. We shouldn't have one 'leader' or even a small number of leaders to be honest, but we're not there yet as a species so while we're still too dumb collectively to rule ourselves and need a leader, why not have an 80 year old pisschad?
I’m the first one to say our leaders shouldn’t be so old they can’t function, because they don’t have any bearing on society.
However on the other hand, this man’s bladder incontinence doesn’t reflect his ability to lead. Judge him on his policies sure, I know nothing about them so I won’t comment on them, but man he’s old, the pipes just stop functioning after a while.
Ahh figured be was just playing it off hoping it wasn’t noticeable. When I was like 3 or 4 I remember accidentally shitting myself in prekindergarten or kindergarten(hard to remember which) but playing it off like that haha.
