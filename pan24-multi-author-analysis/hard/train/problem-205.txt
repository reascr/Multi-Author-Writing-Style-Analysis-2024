Same, got Covid during Omicron. Was boosted. Though, and this is very important, COVID-19 symptoms were much more severe and deadly pre vaccines/during OG Covid.
The vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting it, but it probably make the illness more mild when you do catch Covid.
Yes. I’ve had four vaccine doses and caught it from my wife who has had three doses, and she caught it from a coworker who is also vaccinated.
Yeah i have a coworker who is 3x vaccinated and has had it 3x thanks to his kids. I'm 4x vaccinated and have never had it, sibling got it for the first time last week! We spend a lot of time together, had just been out shopping together but I haven't tested positive yet and feel fine. (knock on wood). My turn might be nigh though seems everyone is getting it this round.
You're like a friend of mine. Has traveled to see family on different coasts quite a bit to help take care of them, has been much more social than me the past year, has a little in elementary school, still has never gotten it. I just tell her she has great resistance!
And of course there's always the chance we've had it but been asymptomatic. With how much trouble I have finding words sometimes I do wonder if I've had it without symptoms. That could just be stress/trauma though from everything in the past 3 years lolz.
