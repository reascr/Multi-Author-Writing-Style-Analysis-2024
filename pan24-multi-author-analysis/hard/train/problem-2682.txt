The long haul stuff is a bigger challenge, but one that can be solved in a variety of ways. The best one, in my opinion, is fast chargers along major road ways. These trucks will need a few hundred kWh of batteries - even at 350kW that is an hour charge, and I think getting that down to 30 minutes is necessary. And the chargers need to be built with bathrooms and food courts nearby.
Another option is what Tesla is aiming for - 500 miles range and 1000kWh of batteries. Not a new type of battery, just lots of batteries. This will work, it's just very expensive. The battery pack alone will be $150k.
If each truck can get 200 miles range in 30 minutes, that is a pretty good ratio of driving : charging of their time.
Brake time is every 4.5 hours for 45mins so as long as you start the trip close to a full charge that should be enough time. The problem is the lack of charge points the UK is quite poor when it comes to this but is getting better seen quite a few pop up. The problem is there needed along the Motorway as that is a place most of our trucks end up when the brake timer hits.
