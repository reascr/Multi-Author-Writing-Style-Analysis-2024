As much as I agree with this, Supreme Court Justices have historically been expected to speak at Law Schools throughout their time on the bench. The practice has been largely helpful, allowing specific justices to explain their rationale to upcoming constitutional lawyers and help shape the way they view the constitution and its interpretation.
The most important part of a court’s history, especially in a common law jurisdiction, is its written decisions.
Side note: I read the other day that some SCOTUS justice apparently postponed the hearing of certain cases so that a lower court’s precedent stands (or is it some circuit court justice?) Can’t remember whom or retrace where I read it. If any kind stranger knows I would be very grateful.
In general, be courteous to others. Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people. Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
