having not been at war, I cannot comprehend being distorted into doing such things. though, I'm not sure it was war trauma that made these people behave in this way...guess it can't be discounted.
In some cases I'm sure that's true; but I imagine there's also many cases of war transforming people into something that their loved ones no longer recognize as the same person who left.
That's actually really interesting. It just seems like it would be the further the distance the less PTSD (killing someone hand-to-hand vs gun for example; I'd imagine being close enough to look them in the eye would be more traumatic).
Maybe they meant it more that if you send people off to legally kill each other, witness their buddies be killed, and go through various other traumas that you can't really be shocked when those conditions turn some of them into monsters.
That doesn't mean it's acceptable and good or something. Just that war is awful and changes people, its not really surprising that those experiences can turn some into monsters with no regard for human life.
Oh I know, and that somehow makes it worse with regard to dehumanizing the people who lost their lives. I mean if he’d said “Lol it was like a video game, just straight merc’ing fools,” it would only be marginally more offensive.
If he’d said “I was there, I had a job to do, I disconnected from the human aspect and focused on my objectives and what I felt to be my duty,” totally different feel. But that’s not how he explained it, and not how his editor suggested he rephrase himself. And here we are.
Yep. Used to work on a large Marine base in the US. Went to a bar one night close by and started talking to a group of Marines about to get out. The guy who actually killed people didn't talk about it, but everyone else was really excited to tell me about how that guy killed 6 people.
