What a bigoted comment. I don't think it's much different from any other faith you're born in to. Be it a jew come back to life and sits in judgement of all mankind, an Arabian man jumping into heaven on horse back, xenu collecting thetans, a white farm boy with a golden book, or an Indian prince escaping the cycle reincarnation after an orgy, it's all quite unbelievable on its surface to an outsider. When it's the story you're told is truth from infancy, it's no different.
I didn't know that. Being ex mormon, I thought that we were particularly susceptible. I suspect we still might be with so many mlm's that come out of Utah, and we're trained to proselytize from the moment we're born.
Edit: I should say that not all Utahns are, but so many of them are. It also doesn’t help when sales pitches are structured in the way of “I felt the spirit tell me to do this…” and then they use LDS tactics to sell to their fellow members.
Have you seen the Multi-Level Marketing and other schemes in Utah? Utahns are EXTREMELY gullible. (I’ve lived in Utah and have worked for a few of these companies…).
I had them when I lived in Utah. They're good- I mean, how can you go wrong with cheese and potatoes?- but they're very bland. Adding a bit of spice goes a long way with them.
