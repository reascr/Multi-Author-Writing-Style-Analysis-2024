We also don’t have condos in Australia or New Zealand. We have apartments which you own or rent from a private owner. The owner of the apartment pays fees to the apartment buildings owners corporation (strata) which every owner is a part of and to the local council for things like garbage and water.
Cause in Australia that's still an apartment. I've lived in a 6 million dollar apartment on harbour with a rooftop, gym, and full time concierge but it's still called an apartment. I bought a very nice but small apartment in a low density block that has no amentities and that is still called an apartment.
In Europe dense neighborhoods are allowed which makes renting a much more affordable and preferable option.
People generally buy Condos for the convenient urban location and/or less maintenance than a house. Same here in Japan, though I don’t know what they call the equivalent of condos here. In everyday Japanese they just say (literally) “bought apartment”(買うマンション).
Wait, condos don’t exist in the UK, or they go by different terminology in the UK? I thought the concept of a condo existed pretty much everywhere in the developed world.
