This is already happening. That's why there are like 4 "rainbow mountains" in Peru now, the glaciers are gone.
Reminds me of the signs they had in glacier National park in the US that said the glaciers would be gone by 2020. They quietly removed those in 2020 when the glaciers were still thereâ€¦.
The history of the Earth shows the growth and retreat of glacier ice. If not for retreating ice, Seattle, Chicago, and NY cities would be under a mile of ice. Which, I point out, receded before the Industrial Revolution.
The United States had made great strides in reducing our impact. We are 300+ million in population. The real question is how we reduce the impact in other regions without condemning large groups of people to continued poverty.
I think you made a part of my case. The media sells death which sells advertising. How do we effect global change as proposed by wealthy people, without condemning Billions of people to poverty?
My point is, it is a much more complex and nuanced discussion than just "people are bad and caused it". Scientists in the 1970s decided we were going into an ice age and humans were responsible. So which group is correct?
