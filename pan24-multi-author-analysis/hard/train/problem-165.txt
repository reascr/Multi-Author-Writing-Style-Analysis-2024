Have had 18 year old kids, they were more mature and more adept at critical thinking and empathy than some of our National representatives like Boebert and Green.
If someone like Taylor-Greene or Boebert is mature enough to be in the US Congress then I'd say an 18 year old is capable of being a member of a state house.
I think that if an 18 year old wants to serve on a state legislature, more power to ‘em. I can joke about the giant man baby who was in the White House from 2016 to 2020, and say there is no way we could have anyone more immature than this almost-80 year old.
Some 18 year olds are sheltered, naive, and immature. Others have held down jobs and done volunteer work and have an idea of how the world works. I am sure it is Type 2 who would succeed on a political job; Type 1 would think it was too hard, thus selecting for Type 2. If anything, I argue we get more mature, well-rounded 18 and 19 year olds by giving them problems to solve and people of different ages to get along with. That’s how you create worldly and unspoiled and mature for their age young adults.
