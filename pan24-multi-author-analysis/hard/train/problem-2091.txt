I think you're talking about Epic Systems out in Wisconsin. They're in the medical systems field. I had an ex who almost worked there after college. The brochure for company was awesome, from my understanding the campus was just as amazing looking in person.
I know Mon/Fri travel isn't uncommon for consulting. But it was the necessity be at HQ for face to face meetings that seemed overkill. Remote work life might not have been as robust as today, but even 15 years ago we were thinking "couldn't that be a phone call?".
Same. I work for an old line industry. We built a new office with more of a tech look and feel and added a recreating area with video games and ping pong and such. No one used it.
Idk. I'm a manager of software engineers and I want them to enjoy some of their time more. I don't encourage it "just because". I encourage it because employees that are happy do better work. Plus, if they build a social group at the office via this activity, it makes it even harder for them to want to leave.
