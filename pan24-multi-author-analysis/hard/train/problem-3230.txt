This is just silly though, it looks like they’re saying Facebook cant track user behavior within its own app…. This is necessary for an app to function well…. And the users are gonna get horrible stupid ads without it too.
Meta will probably lose money from this, as they make money from showing you those ads. If people choose not to accept them, Meta doesn't make that money. Poor fucking Meta, eh.
That breaks the EU rules, and they fined Meta for not giving people a choice. This also means that Meta has to take that rule out of their terms of service and ask people's permission properly.
Meta decided not to ask people's permission, and just put a rule in their terms of service saying that you have to accept these ads - you don't like it, you can't use Facebook.
The decision does not specify how the company must comply with the ruling, but it could result in Meta allowing users to choose whether they want their data used for such targeted promotions.
The case hinges on how Meta receives legal permission from users to collect their data for personalized advertising. The company includes language in its terms of service agreement, the very lenhy statement that users must accept before accessing services like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, that effectively means users must allow their data to be used for personalized ads or stop using Meta’s social media services altogether.
