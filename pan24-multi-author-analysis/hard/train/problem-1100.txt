Believe me I’m making comments like this to someone I know that’s in his circle. Telling him that trump is a winner and winners would run for President regardless of party. Unfortunately unlike trump, this guy is really smart and just laughs and tells me to go fuck my mom (he’s a gentleman). Lmao!
Yup, I’m all about saying that he won’t because he’s a coward. Only winners run on a third party. If he doesn’t it shows that he needs the Republicans party.
So even if Republicans aren't working against him, they clearly aren't eager to support him anymore.
The alternative, losing the GOP nomination and "giving up" and accepting the country hates him, is worse than running 3rd party.
He's led some of the worst political losses in American political history for a party. I'm not sure that GOP can recover at this point with or without him to be honest, he has completely hollowed out or was left of that organization.
I would be amazed if they ever won a popular election again on the up and up, without some significant sea change happening.
