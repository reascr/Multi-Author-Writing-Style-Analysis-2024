From a performance perspective they wouldn't gain anything by playing such a much weaker side, and it would only be damaging to the level they're used to playing at.
Just squeezing such a weaker side like that into their busy schedule rotation is always an unproductive move, competitively speaking, so the top teams don't really enjoy the obligations that come with playing these much weaker teams because it cuts into their performance flow.
It's funny because it's ironic. Professionally it would be a waste of time for Australia to play them anyway because the very top teams like Australia are way too good to bother playing a team like Afghanistan.
Why is everyone pretending that a lack of a pathway for female involvement in anything in Afghanistan is the most important reason why Australian cricketers shouldn't tour the country? We boycotted Pakistan for years over safety concerns.
Boycotting Afghanistan is no different to when South Africa was boycotted during apartheid. It was the right thing to do then, and itâ€™s right thing to do now.
