This doesn't mean South Africa as a nation has a strong connection to Russia today, just that there is something of a residual familiarity.
This is what I find weird, Russia isn't even close to being an important trade partner of South Africa. China, the US, the UK, Germany and Japan are your largest export markets. You don't even import a notable amount from Russia either. Western nations are by far a more important partner.
Of course, South Africa is also a large trading partner with many western nations. So they position themselves between the sides.
Yes, I understand your perspective. I'm just referring to the BRICS group as it is described by those who analyze these things. Once again, I refer you to the various experts who know more about this than either of us do.
They consider themselves neutral. I'm sure, if asked, they'd claim that they'd sell arms to Ukraine too. They'd argue that their position as a neutral is no different from that of the US in the years before the War of 1812 - a war that was started in part due to the US insistence that their neutrality allow them freedom of the seas, and the UK's insistence that anyone taking part in trade with a belligerent makes them less than neutral.
