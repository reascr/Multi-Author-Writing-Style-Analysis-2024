I remember watching that play out live back when I would still watch the news on occasion. I was so depressed at the outcome because I thought that the secularists were actually making a strong move for control of the government. But then it all fizzled out in just a couple of hours. So I’m happy to see this headline and I think the Turkish people have a lot to contribute to the world without the yoke of religious oppression.
Which is wild because any abroad living Turk I’ve met HATES Erdoğan, but these are all young progressive people, so I imagine the support comes from the older traditional crowd.
And its good to add that Erdogan is losing every election when taking only the In Turkey votes, but the diaspora massively votes for him.
82% of around 4 millions turks voting in Europe voted Erdogan despite not living in the country, im always blown away by that fact.
In the same vein, in this post people are talking like Türkiye before Erdoğan was a "EU worthy" country but in reality they wouldn't let us join even without Erdoğan. Yes there are differences between now and then but not as much as people make it out to be.
Like others said Türkiye isn't as Islamic as people make it out to be. Yes there are problems but people talk like everything was roses and sunshine before Erdoğan but in reality it wasn't. For example another comment under my first one said public kissing is banned but it isn't. It is frowned upon(and not everywhere) but before Erdoğan hugging in public could've gotten you the same snarky remarks too. That doesn't mean hugging was banned before Erdoğan. It just means there are assholes out there who can't keep their dumb ideas to themselves. Like, in the city I currently live no one would care if you kissed in public but the further east you go people will start to care. It is more about the people themselves then the law itself.
