India haven’t even commented the the brutal killing of Iranian women and men protesting. And is now making trade deals with them?
With Russia not helping Armenia broker peace, EU is now taking full responsibility to find a peaceful resolution of the conflict. What is India doing to help?
That’s better than what India is doing right now, who is actively supporting the Iranian government.
Don't really understand why you are so agitated about the fact that India 'supports' Iran, whatever that means. It's clear India has massive projects in Iran which was literally started years before. Also, India condemns the actions of Iran (and Russia for that fact), however, they can't choose an extremely aggressive stance like the US without the risk of losing a fuckton of money, resources, and time invested in the Chabahar Port project.
Bold statement that I'm lying, literally see the official statement of India regarding Russia's action on google, and regarding Iran's action, they literally mentioned the condemnation of it in the recent statement regarding the continuation of the Chatabahar Port project.
