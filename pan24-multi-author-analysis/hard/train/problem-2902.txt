"You don't know what you are talking about" because a guy in an American website talking about an event in Ukraine doesn't know an obscure fact about Latvia lmao.
I'm from Spain myself, and "deport" here ("deportar" in Spanish) doesn't have any connotations. It's just the act of expelling a foreigner from your country. I can't talk for the whole of Europe, but it definitely isn't "the entirety of Europe". "Russia is expelling Ukranians from their homes" or "Russia is ethnically cleansing Luhansk", in my opinion, are better descriptions of what's going on there.
They are now ‘evacuating’ or more accurately ‘kidnapping citizens’, moving them from their home, to other parts of Russia far away.
They've been kidnapping Ukrainians and deporting them to Russia since the invasion.... Not specifically kids, but.....
They steal ukrainian kids, take them from their parents, and really try to wash their brains. And are VERY surprised that those kids aren't happy. They say - hey, we're saved them from ukrainian nazi, feed them and they wish all russians to die. Curious, why children aren't happy? Hm..
