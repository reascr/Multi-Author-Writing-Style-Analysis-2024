Nobody remembers this, but in 2016 Trump faced an honest to gosh minor scandal, one that would have seriously damaged another candidate, when he suggested there should be criminal prosecutions for people getting abortions.
In less than a decade, we have gone from the most prominent pro life groups actively fighting against the smear that they would ever support criminal charges of any kind for those receving an abortion.... to those same groups trying to outdo one another with more and more extreme positions, up to literally the death penalty.
There is also the deeply unfortunate reality that the pro life movement is now proposing killing one person on the grounds that the state must save another, which doesn't seem like a "pro life" position to me.
No, the pushback primarily came from Republicans and from pro-life activists, who were quick to point out (accurately) that their platforms have long made clear that a person seeking an abortion should not be charged with a crime: only the doctor should.
So if the right wants to ban abortions because"we value life", then they should not only pay for all the woman's medical care, but pay at least $57,000 per pregnancy that they are forcing the woman to undergo. (This also doesn't include extra pay for delivery and, having seen my wife deliver two babies, that would be a huge additional cost!).
Uh uh. No. We are NOT going to let this pass. If it does, I can't see the SC government making it much longer before it's overrun by half of its population and chaos starts.
Not to mention the cost that the death penalty in general has on the economy compared to being imprisoned for life.
