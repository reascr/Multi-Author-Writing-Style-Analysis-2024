"In particular, Barclays named CCH, Henkel, PMI, JDE Peet's and Carlsberg as having the largest sales exposure to Russia within the European consumer staples sector.".
So, here's my thought. How many US officials were tried and convicted of war crimes against humanity for dropping -- not one, but two -- atomic bombs on Japan?? Let that sink in. War crimes are determined by those who "win." There is no such thing as a "good war." There is no such thing as a "clean victory." There are, however, individuals -- atrocious individuals -- who use war as a way to release their inner monster. But, I find it offensive to declare Russia -- all of Russia -- guilty of crimes against humanity.
Secondly: US crimes, current or recent are no where near the scale or extreme of Russian crimes. Comparing US crimes to Russian ones are like comparing a mugger to a murderer. Sure both committed crimes they shouldn’t have, but don’t pretend they are equally bad, and don’t use the muggers crimes to justify the murderer.
No it’s not. I’m not making excuses for the USA’s terrible actions, that’s not the point I’m making and if you think it is you are part of the problem.
Edit: and to clarify I’m not making excuses for the USAs past war crimes. They were terrible and never should have happened. However they shouldn’t be used to justify Russias war crimes. And the Us had every right and obligation to call out Russia on their bullshit. Don’t @ me with “wElL tHe Us dId xYz…”, how does that justify Russia doing worse things on larger scales to the Ukrainians? And how do those long past actions prelude the US from rightfully calling out current Russian war crimes?
In any case, even if I’m 100% wrong, why exactly would that make Russias actions now ok? Please explain why Russias genocide against Ukraine is ok.
The Russian state has committed all five of these in Ukraine, and Putin's statements have proven genocidal intent.
