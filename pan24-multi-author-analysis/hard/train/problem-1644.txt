Which is the most baffling. These people hear it from the leadership in the places they live, they don't want people there making more money, they don't want new businesses opening up unless they're partners and most of these places already have all the partners they need going back a few generations. Like they come straight out and say it and then somehow people still believe them come campaign time when they say they're gonna bring in jobs.
I don't actually think they DO believe the GOP politicians when they say they're going to bring in the jobs. It's that they are soothed by the way the GOP talks to them. It's not about being informed and rationally weighing what politicians say and whether you think they will fulfill their promises. It's about what team you're on, and it's about your feelings. It's never JUST about whether the people you elect will do things to better your lives. It's also about whether those politicians will hurt the Other who they've convinced you is responsible for why your life is bad.
I would be satisfied if we merely taxed them at Reagan-era levels, nevermind Eisenhower-era levels! (But, you know -- apart from other factors, that taxation level on the wealthy was at least part of what drove U.S. growth in the post-war period through the 60s. It was always just a fiction to think that we could do away with that tax revenue and everything would just continue to work as it had up until then.).
Wow. I thought that MAYBE the clip of him talking about uprooting Medicare/SS was going to be kind of out of context or ambiguous. He really left nothing to the imagination. Unreal.
Unpossible. McConnell is like a shark in the ocean. I have a healthy respect for a strong murderer when itâ€™s in its environment.
