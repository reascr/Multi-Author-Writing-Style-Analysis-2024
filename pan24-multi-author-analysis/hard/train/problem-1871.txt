It's a shame the most dramatic race has to be Arizona. Kari Lake has already been election denying all week. Now she's using the time frame it takes to count votes,to say Arizona has Democratic cheaters at their voting sites. It's wild to see someone make such bold claims about election fraud like this. Personally I hope someone finds a way to sue her because she's hurting democracy by questioning every single thing about her election.
She was election denying since the primaries where she was going after her own voters IN A PRIMARY ELECTION. Never took it back, just accepted the victory and moved on.
The only Republican to win a state wide office in Arizona, was the non GQP lady for State Treasurer. She didn’t jump through any of those delusional hoops just basically “I was good at my job.” And she won her race very handedly.
Locally speaking, the only TV station who would give her any amount of it time is her former employer and quite frankly her ingest critic. And they’re far more likely to never give her the time of day.
