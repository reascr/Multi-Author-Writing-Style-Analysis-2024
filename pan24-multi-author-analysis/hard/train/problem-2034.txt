It isn't, Amsterdam loses money on tourism... The amount of money spent on police required to keep them in check and the amount of damages the tourists cause doesn't even get covered by what Amsterdam 'earns' on tourism. Also almost all employees of restaurants and whatnot in the city centre are people with work visas, most money doesn't even end up in Amsterdam. There's Dutch articles on this if you want a source, couldn't find an English one sorry.
Tourism is very lucrative of course, but that's not what I meant though I probably didn't explain properly. What I meant is that inhabitants of Amsterdam such as myself don't see any of the money being brought in by tourists. The main effect these people have is driving up prices for basically anything from housing to groceries in the city, and the money they do spend disappears in the pockets of a few rich multinational corporations. While there's shockingly little insight into where exactly all this tourism money goes, it's an undisputed fact that housing has become ridiculously expensive in great part due to tourism (AirBnB for example).
I agree with you on that tourism will most likely suffer, but almost negligibly so. Most tourist I talk to (I work in the city centre) are there for the grachten and the tulips and the cheese and all those cliches, very few of them are there for weed and prostitutes.
I always thought that district was for prostitution and the rest of the touristic area was for weed, never really saw people smoking while looking for sex workers there.
Edit: seems itâ€™s in the entire inner city tho. Just means the coffee shops will move to the edge, honestly.
