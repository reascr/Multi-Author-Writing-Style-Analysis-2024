>"Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other areas in the Donetsk region are under constant Russian attacks. There are constant attempts to break through our defence. The enemy does not count its people and, despite numerous casualties, maintains a high intensity of attacks. In some of its wars, Russia has lost in total less people than it loses there, in particular near Bakhmut," said Zelenskyy.
Russia has only lost 10% of their military forces, but on the other hand, Russia has lost 50% of their armored vehicles.
When Russia invaded they had 3,300 armored vehicles and have lost 1,700 of them (according to the British). Another year of war, especially with the new top of the line Western armor that shreds these 30-40 year old tanks with ease, and Russia won't have much armor to speak of.
Just going to point out that we didnâ€™t lose a single tank in the Gulf War, except to friendly fire, against tanks Russia is currently using in Ukraine.
Ukraine can push all of Russia's army out of the Ukraninan territory, but what's stopping Russia to just keep pushing forward, when they have strenght in numbers and don't care how many people they lose?
Also, if all of Russia (politicians, generals and majority of Russian people) is pro-war, and won't accept losing this war, in the event Russian army has been pushed out of Ukranian territory and they don't actually have means to keep attacking - how can we be sure they won't use nukes? If that's their last option, and losing isn't an option, then the situation might seem to them like they've got nothing to lose, in which case they actually might use nuclear warheads.
