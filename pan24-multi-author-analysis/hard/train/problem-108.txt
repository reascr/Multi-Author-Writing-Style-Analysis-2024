The USA literally supported a dictatorship here that suppressed our people in the past. I dont like Iran either but geopolitics isnt a friendship game. If your country doesnt like Iran just invade them already and handle the consequences yourselves.
We dont need your "democracy" also known as coups, discrimination and some of your own political shenanigans (that were imported to here by a certain ex "president" of ours). China and Russia are just as terrible but its better to be on the neutral side and reap from both beds than to become a puppet of either side.
We are happy being nobody's puppet over here. Better be neutral and friendly to both sides and get something from it... Brazil cant do everything yall want just because.
Here's the thing guys, we(Brasil) cant choose one side, we cant afford that. If Brasil chooses one side for ever our economy will go bad, Brasil always must be a neutral country because that is better for our economy.
Brasil always wants to be everyone's friend until someone attacks us.( like WW1 and WW2) OR some other country forces a dictatorship in here( like how the USA did).
