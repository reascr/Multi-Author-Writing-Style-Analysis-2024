The military industrial complex is going to make money hand over fist either way. I’d rather it go towards helping Ukraine defend its sovereignty than starting yet another hopeless war in the Middle East.
But the only reason the west decided to aid Ukraine was because they decided to defend their country. Ukraine's announcement of self-defense against Russia led to the west uniting.
Ukraine stood strong because the west is united against Russia. Ukraine would have lost months ago if all the western countries hadn't (and still are) sending them constant weapons, vehicles, and money.
If Ukraine had surrendered you’d be watching a whole different story now. Imagine if all the power of Ukraine was used by russia against West. Just think about it what kind of problems West could have. This is what Putin wanted, but never got.
If you don’t know the history of Ukraine or even the history of Europe, that is your problem my friend, if you think that Ukraine is a random country in geopolitics.
If that “random” country surrendered all of the power of that “random” country could be used against West. You just don’t really understand the threat that the West is facing today. Just because it is not you who is fighting at war now, and you have no idea what that means.
