The difference is that this is an official statement from the US gov't, which means they already have solid evidence and probably the entire supply chain mapped from the factory floor through shipping to detonation inside Ukraine.
This statement is intended for the Iranian regime, not the rest of us, and Iran would be wise to heed the implications.
If the conversation was "hey Iran be more cautious of what your arms sales get used for" then sure that's a conversation to have. But this ain't it. This just adding to the list of reasons the US "can't deal" with Iran because clearly they are the baddest of the bad that ever badded no takesy-backsys.
Like if we all lived in a Buddhist utopian paradise world, then sure I would love to see that charge be made. But not only do we not, there is an entire industry specifically for producing and selling weapons of war. And guess what they kill people. And again the US is one of the biggest arms dealers + also arming at least two nations currently participating in genocide...
So... since US has also committed war crimes too, and are hypocrites at dealing with war criminals, you're ok with Iran selling drones to Russia and killing civilians with it?
Now Iran sells arms to Russia who uses those arms to attack civilians directly and you're all like "oh they arent responsible".
