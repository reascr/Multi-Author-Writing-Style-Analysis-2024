It's not nonsense, and even if they can rebuild the nukes, they're very cash strapped to the point they sold many airplanes, tanks, and ships for scraps. Including the hull of a Kuznetsov-class carrier to china for only $20m.
Irrelevant, where is the final warhead? Where is the rocket? I asked for sources on ukraine having the capability to deploy nuclear arsenal, funny how you based your fantasies on this instance, hell, why don't all countries have nukes if it's this easy?
Itâ€™s not a what if scenario when the surrounding countries proved a willingness to do it several times until nukes were built. Israel is still at war with Syria, has terrorists in Palestine funded by Pakistan and Iran lobbing rockets over the border daily, and has Iran openly stating their goal to be to obliterate Israel while trying to get nukes.
Iran is not gonna invade Israel ever, the Israeli fear is that they can no longer win wars by dropping nuclear devices on their neighbours without getting one back in return.
I'm waiting to be pointed to anywhere that Iran says they are getting nukes to attack Israel, even if that was true, they wouldn't be saying that would they.
This is a warning to Iran that Israel knows what they are doing, they know where they are doing it, and the F-35's are already on standby ready for takeoff to wipe Iran's nuke program off the face of the earth.
Producing bunker buster bombs is well within Israel's capabilities, considering they've been preparing for this OP for more than a decade im sure the capability exists.
