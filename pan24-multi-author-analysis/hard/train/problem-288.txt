No one but McCarthy will win in a straight vote. However, it's possible that enough Republicans will refuse to support McCarthy that we'll just have no Speaker for a while. Voting "present" would make it a little easier, but they can't do that too much either, otherwise they'll give the Democrats a majority. After a few months of chaos, we could end up with a weird compromise involving some Democrat votes and a "neutral" Speaker.
Electing the Speaker is different from electing the Minority Leader. McConnell needed 26 votes out of 50. McCarthy needs 218 votes out of (probably) 221.
EDIT: To clarify, McCarthy can win with 214 votes if some of the protest votes simply vote "present". If not, he'll still need 218.
If there are 221 Republicans, then there are only 213 Democrats, so McCarthy only needs 214 votes. The protest votes will come from the MAGA side and Dems most certainly won't be voting for their candidate.
The MAGA Wing of the GOP won't go for this since they only want those who bow the knee to their demagogue.
