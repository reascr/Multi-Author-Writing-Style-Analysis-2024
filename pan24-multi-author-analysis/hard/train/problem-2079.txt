Goddamn. I understand why insurance is a thing, but the government making it law to have it is wild. They’re driving profits toward a private company. I’d really like a law that holds the rich and powerful responsible for the things they do.
You hope to never use the gun. Paying insurance on it is a straight up scam and it’s unconstitutional to prohibit someone from getting a gun unless they pay a private company first.
Charging fees for things like licensing and insurance which have obvious direct costs is not unconstitutional. States have always had a right to regulate 2A, just like other constitutional rights.
It says well regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state. That is about as far is it goes regarding any requirements in the 2nd.
Isn't equivalent either. It is about utilizing public spaces and infrastructure. You aren't required to get a permit to just tell other people your opinions.
Except its not like cars at all. Cars aren't an enumerated right. Cars have issues with very high rates of accidents and that is not the issue with firearms. The issue with firearms is intentional criminal violence, which insurance generally doesn't cover. Cars only require the insurance to operate on public roads, you do not need insurance to simply own a car.
As a note though, cars only require insurance when driven on public roads. So this would be more equivalent to carry guns needing to be insured (which MIGHT have more than a snowball's chance in hell of passing). There are some things that could be thrown into the bill to garner support as well, namely deregulation of silencers, SBSs, and SBRs.
