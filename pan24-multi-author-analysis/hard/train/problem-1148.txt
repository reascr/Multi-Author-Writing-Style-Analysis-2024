So what’s your solution? Simply tell the countries that contributed the least to climate change, will suffer the worst effects, and with the least capacity to mitigate resulting problems, to go collectively fuck themselves? This appears to be a popular attitude at the moment.
It’s a bandaid that everyone here seems to think is completely unjustified and shouldn’t be given to these countries in the first place, never mind the prospect of something more substantial offered for this bullet wound.
Oh yes? Do you need money to fund relief for worsening natural disasters in the global south exacerbated by climate change? Do you need funds to build out green energy and transport technology as a poor developing country trying to raise the standard of living for its people? Are you someone who’s contributed virtually nothing to emissions in terms of global averages but is set to receive some of the worst consequences of climate change?
We know from other reporting that they made no meaningful progress towards solving the root causes of climate change, so say that instead of framing it like a limited number of people's opinions on the matter.
