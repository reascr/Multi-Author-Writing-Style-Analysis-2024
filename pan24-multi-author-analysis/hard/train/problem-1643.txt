Like I hated Schrader too, but the district was a highly competitive one, and even strong incumbents have been struggling in a lot of places. It wasn't an unreasonable decision to prioritize other races they thought they had a better chance in, especially when money doesn't translate directly into votes. It's not like we can say "If they'd spent X million, she WOULD have won" - all we can say is "Maybe she would have, maybe they'd have wasted a ton of money that did more good elsewhere.".
The bottom line is that progressive candidates just don't have a good track record of winning highly competitive districts, especially in challenging election cycles. And if progressives want to count on establishment support then the burden is kind of on them to prove they're good enough to win, especially when you're in the process of knocking off establishment incumbents.
I can't imagine why, in a year that was expected to be really bad when Democrats were trying to defend a ton of seats, that they would decide not to fund what they saw as a risky challenger likely to lose.
Maybe if the Dems campaign arm did what they should instead of refusing to help a primary winner we wouldn't be having this conversation.
