I remember a pill that had all the leading Democratic candidates, and all of them showed “favored/against” except for Sanders, which was “against/favored.” It made it seem like Sanders was the least favored candidate unless you looked closely at the description.
WHY IS IT ALWAYS BOTH SIDES?? Why does congress need to do anything to favor the employers, when it’s the employers that are the reason this strike is happening?
Why can Congress force workers to work for lower wages and less sick days but can't pass legislation forcing companies to pay more and offer sick days?
I think both parties do NOT want to set any kind of precedent guaranteeing any workers PTO or sick days- if they give in to the railroad workers maybe the rest of America’s workers will demand the same.
If congress is gonna step in and end this, they should end this on the side of the workers instead of the railroad bosses who seem to completely resistant to any sick time for their employees.
Seriously more pressure needs to be put on them in order to change their tune. I can't imagine anyone, not even Republican voters, who would think that denying sick days to workers is a good idea.
