Both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 98. Ukraine didn't call for sanctions on Pakistan and supported them.
Ukraine could have stayed neutral then. They picked sides and that was a poor choice. They can remain grateful that at least India is staying neutral instead of picking Russia's side.
Even at international level, there are consequences to poor choices. Ukraine cannot expect a country who they acted against to back them, especially when it is against the latter's interests to do so.
Ukraine is only important to people because Russia is viewed as an enemy of the West, so the media tells us to care.
The reason Ukraine is on the front page is because Russia is/was a Global superpower. If India was at war with Pakistan today it would be front page news. Because you both have nukes...
Because they built up a nuclear arsenal. Which Ukraine opposed and then supported sanctions on, while Russia backed them.
No one needs to to justify not supporting Ukraine. If it isn't important to them or their lives. They can say "Oh, that's too bad, Russia shouldn't do that." and move on. Us and our government react that way to a lot of things and it'd be hypocritical to condemn anyone for not showing enough support.
