Never. Nukes protect both countries from invasion, they are more than capable to deal with internal protests, and regimes wont change themselves of course.
Dump their only sort-of-ally and end up facing entire West alone? China is not that dumb. It needs Russia as a buffer against West. If Russia can win in Ukraine, good. If Russia cannot and will become weaker and depend more on China, thats good, too.
I actually think that this benefits China because it means that the West has no internal scruples regarding Russia anymore. Ukraine essentially has ended the Russian threat for the west without a single western (official) casualty.
For what it’s worth, Putin DOES see himself as representing the Russian people, and he does see the Russian land as a kind of motherland. He is in that sense closer to, say, Hitler than say or Stalin or Mao. He doesn’t see the idea of a “motherland” as functional to himself, but as a function of itself.
If the last year has shown anything, it’s that western military might is but one thing of the many weapons that make up western power.
