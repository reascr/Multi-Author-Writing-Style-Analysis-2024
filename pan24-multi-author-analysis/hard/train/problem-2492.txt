I work with a guy in his mid 40s who’s a retired cop (injured on duty). Really nice guy, fun to shoot the shit with. A couple years ago he was working on some pro cop bill with some cop org (no idea what the details were… maybe some kind of compensation program for families of injured cops?) Anyway he’s telling me about the time they went to the capitol to lobby politicians and present the case to congress. And he’s got these fun anecdotes about people you’ve heard of.
The gist of this story is that he was surprised that of all the people they tried to shake hands and chat with, only one republican gave them the time of day. But they got loads of time with “the people you wouldn’t expect” Pelosi invited them to her office, Bernie Sanders shook all their hands and listened to their cause, etc. He’s got a picture with Biden who signed his bill into law after getting no response from the White House in the 5 years they were trying. And he was like, the people in congress are nothing like how you expect from seeing them on TV. Weird!
Gosh! That’s rich. How much more does this guy have in his past, keeps on giving. If there was such a thing as an Ignoble prize, give it to him, he is richly deserving of it, for the body of work he’s done.
