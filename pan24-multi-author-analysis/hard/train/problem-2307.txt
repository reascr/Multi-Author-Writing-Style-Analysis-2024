Then you got all mad at me and saying I didn't understand. I told you Bernie would only force a vote on both bills. Guess you were wrong huh? I guess you were the one that didn't really understand after all? I'll accept your apology now with you admitting you were wrong.
You were wrong. You were certain Bernie would force both bills passing. I said that wasn't going to happen and that the 1st bill would pass, the 2nd bill would get a vote, and it would fail.
He used his leverage for a vote which was a mistake because the vote wasn’t gonna pass. He should have used his leverage to delay the process and give the workers a chance to strike. But really the anger needs to be directed towards the entire party. If the democrats voted no the workers would be striking. The reason they won’t be is because the democrats are either cowards worried about political fallout, corrupt and bought by large interests, or stupidly think that anybody will care about this issue next election cycle. But this will make the problems in our railroad system so much worse.
They just voted it down and now it’s going to pass the original deal and force workers to take it even after they voted it down. Anybody claiming the democrats as a whole really wanted this to pass is delusional. Maybe certain members like Bernie did but it doesn’t matter. This is what complete corporate dominance looks like.
They literally can’t by law. The congress is or already has voted to take away their say in the negotiation process. Every media outlet will say congress reached deal to avoid shutdown. Really it should read congress has forced railroad unions to accept a deal they voted against.
The railroad barons have no incentive to negotiate with the unions knowing that Congress will force a settlement. The only way the workers will get paid sick leave is if they walk off the job.
