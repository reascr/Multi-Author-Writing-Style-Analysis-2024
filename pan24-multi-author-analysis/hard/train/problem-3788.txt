Ukraine will lie and exaggerate to have the world support them, like when they blamed Russia for the rocket that hit Poland.
And Ukrainians saying Russians committing war crimes is credible? Iâ€™m not pro Russian or anything but both sides have and are doing terrible things to eachother.
I'm a Pole and despite what you're saying I still blame Russia for this accident. If Russia hadn't attacked Ukraine, they wouldn't need to use their anti air defenses.
Not an awol defense Rocket, a Russian fired rocket. Now obviously this is just a blatant lie from Ukraine in order to turn more people against Russia.
Your reward is many downvotes. If you want more, comment on all the 'goodwill' Ukrainian videos that are very real and clearly not propaganda that is planned and sent out by officers in order to hide the atrocities of war from other soldiers in order to keep their moral high and to follow orders.
The difference is that there are videos (like the many videos of what is verifiably Russian planes launching rockets into apartment buildings or the video of Russians slicing a Ukrainian man's testicles off with a box cutter) that are irrefutable evidence of Russian war crimes.
