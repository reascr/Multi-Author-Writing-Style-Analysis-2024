It took 30 years of constant right-wing attacks to bring Clinton down, it took a pile of lies so deep you can't even reach the floor to bring Clinton down, it took conspiracy theories about chanting Satanic prayers at her Goldman Sachs speeches to bring her down, it took James Comey having a red, white, and blue stick up his ass to bring Clinton down. Pull out any one of those elements and she'd be President today. If Donald Trump had never been cast in The Apprentice, or Fox News hadn't bent over for him, or the mainstream media hadn't given him billions of dollars in free advertising, Donald Trump wouldn't have won.
But the thing you have to think about is how much work and how much luck it took to get Donald Trump that victory.
It really was a culmination of everything that let Trump win. Without decades of attacking Hillary she would have won. Without Russia interfering in the 2016 election she would have won. Without third party candidates she would have won. Without the October surprise she would have won.
