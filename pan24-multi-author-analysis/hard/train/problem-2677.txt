It's an excuse for losing. "They only pushed us back because they attacked when we were having a cease fire!".
There’s more to it. In Russian orthodox tradition, Christmas is on 7th of January. More Ukrainians than in 2021 decided to celebrate it on 25th of December to have less “ties” with the aggressor in their derussification attempt, but for Russians it’s like a blasphemy and spit in the face. So refusing to cease fire on Dec 25 and proposing it on Jan 7 is basically a big fuck you.
It’s not about believing. It’s just Ukraine’s proposals that Putin refused to accept are not told about to Russian population, but Russian proposals are. So on TV, Russians are generous and mad Ukrainians just want the war no matter what. Like they show that those pesky Ukrainians blew up a bridge, but they never show how they killed a 4 year old in Vinnitsya or claim that a supermarket with civilians inside was actually a storage of ammunition. They’re not straightforward lying, they’re showing a convenient part of the truth to their citizens.
