He's talking about theocracy which tends to be beholden to an ideal or religious belief ergo conservative typically.
A theocratic regime is essentially a part of the spectrum of Conservative ideology. And that's the reason theocratic regimes suppress knowledge. Cause and reason, are different things.
The real cause is regimes that follow Conservative ideology suppressing and controlling the population through heavily propagandizing stuff.
You are correct, except with the claim that conservative ideology is the real cause; Authoritarian governments are the real cause and suppress and rely upon propaganda to establish and remain in control... it's similar to how narcissistic people control things around themselves. A market system only functions as effectively as the government allows it to. You can have a more socialist economy and have an Authoritarian government and the suppression and propaganda will be, essentially, the same or at least very similar. Left and right market systems are different from north and south governmental structures; it's the north and south that establishes how effectively the market system can work and how much they will try to suppress.
