AOC will probably not end up in a party leadership role. Like Bernie, her job is to move the Overton window left and get the rest of the party to consider legislation that would have been considered too far left in previous years. And like Bernie, she understands that you make constructive criticism of the party in the primary, but when the general comes around, you choose pragmatism and support whichever Democrats are on the ticket.
This is what the policy consensus of conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans have left us with.
You're a policy conservative who is liberal on social issues... after those issues reach mainstream acceptance. Just like a lot of the Democratic party. Which makes you center-right.
How is it a right wing talking point? It's just true that she and especially her husband used her place in government to have one of the best performing stock portfolios ever (i'm sure is just totally random, and also random she was against many insider trading laws). There's PLENTY of non right wing sources on this.
