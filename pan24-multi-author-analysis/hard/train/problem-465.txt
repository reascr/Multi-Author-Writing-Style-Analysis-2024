I would gladly have my taxes go to that instead of the billions we flush down the drain for militarizing the police to deal with citizens with AR's.
But then we couldn't sell more guns to deal with the guns we sold because of the guns that were previously sold.
In 10 years a lot of weapons will wear out from shooting and parts for non-hunting weapons should be denied.
Only ban certain guns and make it harder for people to get them not easier. Education on how that gun you are about to buy to protect your family is more likely to be used to kill a family member either thru suicide or accidental discharge than it will ever be used to protect anyone. Some people simply shouldnt have guns especually those who have no idea how to use them or a respect for what they can do.
Assualt Weapons designed specifically to kill humans causing as much damage as possible so more soldiers are taken off the field of battle (to treat their wounded) don't belong in the hands of Law Enforcement either.
We have an "intrinsic" right to self-preservation, life and liberty, but anthrax syringes, nukes and fertilizer bombs arent very good at enforcing those rights, while firearms are. Its about the effectiveness of the tool at enforcing our rights as humans.
I wish we lived in that inclusive, civilized society, but we dont. And we never will. And it wouldnt matter, because its not just about society. Its also about having authority and agency as citizens as a collective in making sure the entity which we give so much power follows the will of the people and acts in our best interests.
Additionally, citizens as a collective own semi autos in order for us to have any sort of leverage in getting the state to conform to the will of the people. Rather some than none. Just ask the Jews in Nazi Germany, or Ukrainians today.
