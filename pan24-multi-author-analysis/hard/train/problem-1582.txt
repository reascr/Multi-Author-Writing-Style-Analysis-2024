Yup. That's the republican ethos: "I only care if it personally affects me. I got mine, so fuck you.".
Yup. I'm a liberal gun owner who is all for stricter gun control... but dems have to stop using phrases like "stricter gun control", or any other words or phrases that's going to scare socially liberal and moderate, 2a supporting voters over to the right.
So what your saying is that they shouldn't just state the facts, but come up with some catchy phrase like "Stop the Klassroom Killings"......or maybe "Fuck Burying Toddlers".......sorry, ANYTHING that is proposed that doesn't make gun ownership even easier will be considered an attack.....and I am also a liberal gun owner.
Yea, having to wait an extra few weeks while an enhanced background check is done is a real hassle......same with those stupid Red Flag laws......all garbage....../s.
