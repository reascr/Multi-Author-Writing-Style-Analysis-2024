While we'll have to respectively disagree on some points, the idea of applying the law is the key. Their interpretation of how the Constitution/law works is what separates us. They are applying the law but to their understanding. Notwithstanding Roe v Wade, both have and show their creditations.
I'm sorry, but 'Notwithstanding Roe v. Wade' ignores the entire recent history of the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court shouldn’t even be hearing this case. It’s open and shut business discrimination based on inherent characteristics (being gay) and has nothing to do with private speech.
The scary part is it’s clear that justices like Alito and ACB don’t believe in protected characteristics. They don’t think a history of discrimination is evidence of anything, taking a completely ahistorical view towards America. Because they are there to reinforce white supremacy and Christofascism. They believe that systemic discrimination, far from being a settled academic fact, is a “woke myth”. Unless someone is shouting the N word and maybe even then, there’s no proof racism is involved.
Eh, it still seems a bit racist to me. Just because you want a red car doesn't mean you will accept any red car. I wanted 32 G of Ram in a computer, but I also had quite a few more criteria.
