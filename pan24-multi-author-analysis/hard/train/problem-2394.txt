They said the same thing about the Red Army during WW2. Russia has borderline endless manpower, and we all know they are willing to sustain MASSIVE casualties to achieve their goal. The west is sending tanks, sure….but the Taliban countered tanks easily by burry absolute sht tons of IEDs non stop.
Yes I’m aware, this has been discussed if you read the posts. I’m saying as far as retaining or retreating…..mines and IEDs have been proven. Taliban and Isis who are having a grand old time right now have already tried and tested it.
Are you aware how tight the Russian Orthodox Church and the government are intertwined? Putin knows the more the west, Black Rock, JPmorgan etc run their mouth about being involved about “rebuilding” Ukraine post war…..the more Putin will be justified. This war is just a repeat. The west does not want peace. They wanted Russia to invade so Ukraine has to beg for help, help that will come with insane strings attached…..strings that can never be cut.
Now Russia know the last tactic won't work, they know Ukraine will resist, and Ukraine is supported by the WEST and have modern NATO equipment. They will try to gradually soften up Ukrainian lines of defence with war of attrition, and a Zerg rush, obliterating everything, and obviously they probably want to do a massive missile and drone attack on Kiev, they wish that city is reduced to ashes.
Yes but this time Ukraine is fortified, and they have been surveilling every single Russian unit with Satellites and recon Drones, they are armed to teeth, at least comparing with what happened with the first time I am sure they are well prepared and armed.
Ukraine has better air defences, they are currently getting trained on Patriot system and Israel is Hinting their will supply the dome defensive system to Ukraine in some future.
