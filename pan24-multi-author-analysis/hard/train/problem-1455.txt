And that boggles my mind! I get the libertarian thing, but even that, in the US it co-opted and backwards IMHO. Not trying to start a fight, because I know a bunch of those people. But do they honestly think the Dems or the Christian conservative block in the GOP are more "controlling".
Or it's also likely that our democracy is in a death spiral in which the GOP manages to seize power because the system is designed to uphold minority rule. Dems are likely to lose the Senate in 2024, and because of the electoral college the GOP could certainly win the presidency, not to mention their firm control of the SCOTUS already. And then that could be the end of democracy. In the end it doesn't matter how unpopular the GOP is when they don't need popular support to win.
Republicans donâ€™t want to win elections any longerâ€¦ they only want to seize power nowâ€¦ theyâ€™ve given up, know theyâ€™re unpopular with voters and donâ€™t give a ðŸ’©.
Republicans seem pretty confident they're long past needing to actually convince anyone to vote for them. Abandoning debates like this is a pretty clear admission they no longer consider undecideds to either a) exist or b) be useful enough to bother appealing to.
Sounds nice, but the only people who would watch that are those already planning to vote for the Democrat. Its essentially preaching to the choir. By all means do it, but it likely won't effect the outcome of the presidential race any more than regular political advertising.
