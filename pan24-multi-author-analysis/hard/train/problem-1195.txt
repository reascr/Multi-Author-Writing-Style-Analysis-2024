NATO squabbling is politics, and them trying to figure out exactly how far they can go without “actively” stepping into the ring. Right now NATO is just tossing in weapons and help from behind the ropes and making sure Ukraine has a fair shot at the bigger opponent.
Twas a tad different, the enemy was hiding among the populace. They weaponized children and women to suicide themselves into troops. The taliban weren’t exactly wearing clear identifying army clothing. I’m sure the USA still killed tons of innocents but maybe not quite so blatantly. Russia’s strategy is basically inflict as much damage as possible, bomb civilian buildings, make them give up.
You’re using two incidents which involved ONE soldier and making it scale to the concerted effort by the Russians to kill civilians.
Two of your links is about one solider and you’re comparing that to the concerted effort by COUNTLESS RUSSIANS who are actively killing civilians whether it be with tanks, guns, drones, etc??
I love this logic. You mind finding me reports on US committing genocide or causing this many intentional civilian deaths? I’m all for it if you have the numbers and reports.
The first is a general statistic. The second is an incident from 2012. The third is an incident from 2010 (from Afghanistan, but points stands).
