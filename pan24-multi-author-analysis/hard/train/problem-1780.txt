There is also currently no war between Russia and other countries that they made peace with once upon a time. Putin attacking Japan is somewhat unlikely, as it doesn't advance any of his strategic or ideological goals the way that attacking Ukraine does.
How much did America coerce Japan to do that... Japan doesn't exactly have great history between Ukraine as Ukraine sold Russian weapons, tanks, battleship, missile technogoly to countries like China, and North Korea which currently terrorizing Japan. Not to mention that, Japan is located right next to Russia and have some ongoing problems and projects.
On top of that, Japan just had serious dispute with a Korean cult called Unification Church which has a strong tie to Ukraine and one of the most prominent "online" speaker for Ukraine is with that cult, obivously it doesn't really look good.
But besides that, enough people also have bad image towards Russia and have strong belief that they need to be on "the winning side" for whatever wars to get on top of the food chain.
