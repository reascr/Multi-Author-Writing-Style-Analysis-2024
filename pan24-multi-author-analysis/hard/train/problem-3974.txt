Just because its popular doesnt mean its right, or makes sense. The issue isnt the drink, its the fact that they are driving drunk, hence drunk driving. It also just doesnt flow right because drink is not a descriptive word. It sounds more like an unfinished list.
I started writing out a full explanation with examples, but it got a bit long, I doubt its going to change anyones minds, and may end up with additional responses that I dont want to deal with. To be brief though, this isnt about the meaning of the words, but the structure of the language. If you really care check this out It doesnt exactly apply here, because "drink driving" is using two nouns, and this article mostly talks about word order, but its kind of the same idea. Also, the actual term is "drink-driving" which I dont know why, but the hyphen seems way more correct and less confusing.
Doesn’t really matter, language is a form of communication and I think just about anyone would understand what is meant by drink-driving.
Anywhere in north America, where majority of the primarily English speaking population of the world live, you would be mocked for saying "drink driving".
I get the sentiment that even one alcoholic drink can reduce driving capacity but it's a bit confusing what they are referring to because for English speakers drink is both a verb and noun. It also doesn't need to mean alcoholic.
Like somebody else put it, you don’t need to be drunk to be over the limit. In Australia your BAC can be 0.1 - 0.4. So 4 standard drinks do nothing to me, for example, but 0.5 is where it becomes illegal to drive regardless of whether you’re drunk or not.
Though over here I frequently hear them say ‘driving under the influence’. Where I’m from in South Africa I heard them say drink/drunk driving more.
