The threat of nukes is very hypothetical. Russia's murdering people every day, Ukraine can either do something about that or not.
Oh fuck off, Russia had no problem killing Ukrainian civilians so spare us the crocodile tears, besides who cares if they unite? Do you think Russians uniting is going to magically rebuild their arsenal? Good joke, Russia is no match for western weapons, deal with it.
Ukraine committing war crimes is a good way for Ukraine to find itself with no more western weapons deliveries. Those have been an absolute game changer for Ukraine, and Ukraine must do whatever it takes to keep them flowing.
Also, from a cost perspective, I would consider Ukraine to have the upper hand. The only profitable targets for them are military facilities that would aid in the war effort, whereas Russia has been focusing on civilian infrastructure, which doesn't tangibly benefit them on the front line. They're sinking absurd amounts of money on scoring a "win" for the Russian public.
I think the real question going forward is "Is Ukraine worth taking at the expense of critical infrastructure and military bases deep into Russia?". So far, they've been able to assume relative safety behind their borders, but with this change in stakes, continuing the war is sounding more and more irresponsible.
