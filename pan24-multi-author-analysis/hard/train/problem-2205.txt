I don't expect it. I think we're too late to stop where we're headed. Best case at this point is to maybe delay the due date and soften the blow. That is an important enough reason for me to vote, but I'm also doing other things.
I get how polls work, but the point again I’m making has nothing to do with polls. RvW was absolutely a reason people voted, however in my opinion it didn’t factor in the elections overall outcome. Republicans won where they were expected to and so did Dems. The Senate was always projected to be +/- (1-2) seats in either direction. The results show a lot of split tickets from Congressional to Governor races when you compare them, in some cases again where GOP did better then usual. The red wave was an over sell based on historical precedent and not the political realities of now imo.
I don’t even think that was a major factor, Red States kept their governors and even competed in some blue states(by competing I mean got a larger then normal vote tally even if lost big) I think it was more a bigger push against Trump and the election deniers honestly.
