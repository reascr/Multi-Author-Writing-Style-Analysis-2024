Talking about all this somewhat I feel government somewhat at a point have done something despite all this corruption and all.
The fact that pandemic just caused the of loss of lives and it was the duty of the concerned government to aware and take care of the people!
If you want my opinion on this whole thing, of course he has a significant responsibility in the death toll. But to be honest, I'm not sure that things would have been very different with someone else in power. And I'm not sure things will be very different if an opposition party comes to power in May. In any case, Istanbul is fucked. There will be hundreds of thousands of casualties when the big one strikes the city. In this disastrous economy, there's not enough time and money to destroy, rebuild, strenhen, renovate, etc. And for that too he is partly responsible...
ErdoÄŸan was mayor of Istanbul in 1994-1998. The statements quoted in the article are from 2019. How is him being mayor 30 years ago relevant to the discussion ?
