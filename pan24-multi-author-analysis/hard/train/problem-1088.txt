Not quite but very close. Technically they are now what is called client state but they are (or were) bordering on being a puppet state. If Russia was as strong as they pretend to be then Belarus would be more like what the Warsaw Pack states were back during the height of the cold war; little more than a puppet that does what the Kremlin commands. Right now Putin's regime isn't actually powerful enough to force Belarus to join the war in Ukraine but everyone is still pretending that is real. We know this for the simple fact that Belarus has stayed out of the war despite Putin wanting them in it for more than a year. That is, if Belarus were actually a puppet state then they would have marched off to war by now but they haven't so what does that tell you?
It would take balls of steel for Lukashenko to give firearms to 1 million unarmed Belorussians… I’m not so sure Ukraine is the place they would storm….
The thing is: Lukashenko right now is shitting bricks with the possibility of Russia going after them too.
This bravado has two meanings: while he wants to show Putin his loyalty, Lukashenko is also telling Russia that they can defend themselves.
The primary threat to Belarus and Lukashenko is Russia and its armed forces, many of which are already inside Belarus. If Belarus talks about defenses, it's to discourage Russia.
I don't think Lukashenko wants this war to exist. It makes everything worse for him. It now looks like they may be annexed by Russia if they are not careful and talking about a potential the big militia should probably be seen as a warning towards Putin.
