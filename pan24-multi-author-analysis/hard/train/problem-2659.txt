People make the same complaint of BMI. however, as there is yet to be a better tool produced, it is harmful to discourage the use of BMI as a measure of better health for most people, since it is not a tool intended to cause harm. MBFC could and should maybe be better, but the issue remains they are still providing a needed service in good faith. As such, your opinion "they are also trash" is simply that: your opinion. And since you are also obviously not an expert on the matter, or you would have provided an alternate source, I do hope you can understand why people don't put much faith in your opinion.
Unless you're willing to provide evidence that the site is an authoritative source with expertise, I'm not interested in furthering this conversation. Particularly since you're weirdly making it personal.
That site isn't wrong about Judicial Watch, but the site is also not a credible source of actual media bias. I get into arguments on here all the time, but none of the people associated with that website have any actual media/communications expertise and their grading rubrik is subjective and unserious.
What is unsound is that nobody -- literally nobody -- has ever once provided evidence that that site actually has the kind of expertise that justifies people sharing it as an authoritative source on media bias.
You're demanding I prove a negative and an alternative source that doesn't exist instead of providing evidence the site is authoritative.
