That's basically all you said yes, and "insurance" companies. a very simplified approach to the profit minded nature of all things.You really think the privatized hospitals even if they are "non profit" in organization aren't just as complicit in all of this? On top of the largest generation all being geriatrics, the supply and demand for hospitals is atrocious. There's fewer people trying to care for more and more. The older generation with more wealth and population will literally price us out of the sector.
It's deeper then the pockets of the megalomaniacs that operate this country. So yeah it's pretty unconstructive and disregarding of all nuance to say it's "fund mismanagement".
If that falls within your definition of "mismanagement" then the term is so vague as to be meaningless. And it would also apply to your example of someone on minimum wage who can't afford to live.
Medical procedures in the US cost 10x more than in other countries and the government has no ability to regulate prices.
Yet for some reason its never a problem when they want to cut taxes or increase military spending. No, it's only an issue when we want to provide healthcare.
You’re saying from a patient side as to WHY it’s unaffordable. One doesn’t disprove the other. His wording is more correct as to why it’s foolish the government has nearly a half of its reps fighting against one payer.. they are mismanaging the 914bil/year towards wrongful expenditure.
