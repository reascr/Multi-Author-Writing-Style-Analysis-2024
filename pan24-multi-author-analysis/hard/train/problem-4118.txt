It's the arctic so most likely the buoys were retrieved from the Northwest Passage if they were anywhere near Canada. The status of this area is contested, Canada considers it to be their territorial water, but some countries including China consider it to be international waters.
Some countries consider it a international strait where foreign vessels have the right of transit passage but it would still be Canadian territorial waters.
“Under Operation LIMPID, the CAF monitors Canada’s air, land and sea approaches, and since 2022, it has stopped attempts to surveil Canadian territory,” he added.
“The Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) are fully aware of recent efforts by China to conduct surveillance operations in Canadian airspace and maritime approaches utilizing dual-purpose technologies,” he said in a statement. Dual-purpose technology is equipment that can be used for both civilian and military applications.
Now Canada and the US are on pretty good relations but the US navy definitely doesn't want to broadcast the locations of where the subs are by needing to ask permission to transmit the area.
