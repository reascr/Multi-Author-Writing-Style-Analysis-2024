Kansas is an interesting state politically. The state legislatures are always red, but the statehouse is definitely not. If this were a recent development I might say it's because of an increase in city (and thus more democratic leaning) population, but this change in party for the statehouse has been happening regularly since the 1900s (except for a 20-year span after WWII when Republicans held it).
I'm honestly not entirely sure. Kansas is conservative overall, but more traditional conservative rather than the current definition. I think the idea that balance creates good results is appealing, and that probably plays a part. I also imagine there's a lot of conservative leaning moderates in the state that will vote for either party based on what the current needs of the state are.
For sure, and that's even with efforts from our legislature last election redrawing the districts to heavily favor Republicans.
He's a republican and a lot of people in the state only vote for republicans. Western Kansas gave him this win. Also, it didn't help that hardly anyone knew anything about Chris Mann. A large chunk of his votes were "Fuck Kobach" votes.
