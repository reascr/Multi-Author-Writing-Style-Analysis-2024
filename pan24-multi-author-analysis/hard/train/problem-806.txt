I live near big rspids Michigan where ferris state university csmpus is and a spectrum health facility that does exactly what you just mentioned, they use students to fill in at no cost to them and spectrum health is on a mission to buy up every medical facility in the state and it's straight up disgusting.
People should not be with out sick pay , employers need to realize a majority of illnesses start in a work place , it's not like they get a lot time off to go get sick.
Edit: I understand not everyone is fortunate enough to have sick days, which is exactly why the millions of people who do need to stand up for those who don’t.
We should all general strike in solidarity, using our sick days or whatever if we have to. It's time this shit stops.
Better, just all quit. If they’re that badly understaffed to not manage sick leave, unpaid sick leave mind you, not even a majority just walking away will grind them to a halt.
Sick leave is “hey I know I should be on my way in to work, but I seem to be shitting blood, out my eyes. I can’t be in today.”.
