The lakebed is lined with all sorts of industrial leftovers from decades of dumping. Without the lake, the wind is going to blow dust storms of arsenic, lead, cadmium, mercury (etc), into the city.
I can’t believe how far I had to scroll to get to the health impacts of this lakebed dust blowing through the state’s largest population center. People will die from this.
Yes heavy metals, but also just breathing in fine grained dust from dry lake bottoms is terrible for your health, regardless of what is in it. If you look at Owen's Lake, which LA drained in the early 1900s, the dust gets so bad that communities around there call it, "Keeler's Fog.".
Granted, the reviewers point out that Owen's Lake seems uniquely bad, but is is uniquely bad because of all the salt. "The surface is commonly crusted, especially during the late winter and early spring, with salt… that is extremely vulnerable to erosion by saltating particles during the frequent high winds in the Owens Valley." Unfortunately, droughts in Utah are also driving higher winds in SLC. However, Owen's Lake only cover about 110 square miles. The GSL covers about 1700 square miles, so I don't want to imagine how much dust winds could pick up...
