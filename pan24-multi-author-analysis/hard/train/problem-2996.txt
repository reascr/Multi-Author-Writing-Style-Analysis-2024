My point in general was that there is no morality when it comes to government decisions. The West isn’t interested in a conflict with Russia, or what happens in Ukraine. It’s all those sweet resources that the West wants access to, and by extension to keep Russia from controlling them. No-one is going to convince me any different without solid proof, which won’t be forthcoming.
Nations don’t have morality. Look at Swedish neutrality in WW2 where they supplied loads of iron ore to Germany. That allowed Germany to build plenty of military equipment, tanks, ships, guns, etc.
In response to what you wrote: A point so often missed when made about Switzerland in WW2 when it was completely surrounded by Nazi Germany and her allies. Yet people still mention it all the time. Also Sweden was selling iron ore to Germany before the invasion of Norway as well.
Sweden's options were to sell them the ore or get invaded and have the ore stolen. Germany had just overrun Norway and was allied with Finland. Sweden was literally surrounded.
