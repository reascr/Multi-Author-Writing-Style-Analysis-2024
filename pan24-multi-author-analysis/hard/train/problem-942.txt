You and I strongly disagree on a great many topics, but this is absolutely 100% correct. Why was he never prosecuted after being arrested for threatening to use a homemade bomb to kill his mother? Why was his arrest record sealed? Why did police never red flag him? There are a great many questions I would like answered. This was not a failure of the law, the laws to prevent this were already in place, but police and prosecutors utterly failed in their responsibilities to protect the community.
Doesn't matter if it's true or not, it is a failure of the system either way. It just changes which part of the system we blame. Either the Prosecutor was incompetent, the police were negligent or the grandfather conspired to cover it all up.
The one thing that changes is that if the grandfather conspired to cover it up, he should be sharing a cell with his piece of shit grandson.
There’s more at work here. I get that some sheriffs, including the sheriff of this county, refuse to enforce gun control laws. That said, the shooter was arrested and charged for threatening to blow up his mother with an improvised explosive device. That’s a bit more than breaking gun control laws.
As far as the sensible gun laws go, we're not there yet. In the end, constant blue voting to reverse the dobbs decision is what will get us the common sense gun laws that we want. We're about 8 years away. Hopefully less.
