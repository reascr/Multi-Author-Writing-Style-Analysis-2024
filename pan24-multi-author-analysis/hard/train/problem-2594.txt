The political science definitions are the ones we should respond with, and nothing else. A democratic republic is a democracy but it is not a direct democracy. The peddlers of anti-democratic politics are pushing a false dichotomy of choosing either a democracy or a republican model. Itâ€™s counterproductive to cede any ground here in a vain attempt to lead those who buy into the narrative by the nose. Either they must be educated or they must be defeated at the ballot box.
When you give people a way to prevent people from voting, they will do so. It creates a perverse incentive. Same with felon disenfranchisement. It just incentivizes criminalizing actions disfavored people engage in, for the purpose of disenfranchisement. Or extending sentences to make them felonies to the same end. Consider sentencing disparities between powder and crack cocaine, and who tends to use which.
You're saying you'd allow them to both disenfranchise people and cut down on taxation at the same time? You want to let them get two birds with one stone?
Even men who want to punish and control women, and/or who are worried about "replacement theory," should be concerned by those scenarios.
It is about punishing women for having sex (outside of marriage/procreation), and not even all women, just throwing up enough barriers and controls over those most vulnerable.
It pains me deeply that very few seem to see the sentiments about single women highlighted in the article as a precursor to even more control over womens bodies and repressive measures taken against them via legislation.
