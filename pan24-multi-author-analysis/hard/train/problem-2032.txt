"He had spent the previous seven years living inside the diplomatic premises to avoid arrest after failing to surrender to a UK court on matters relating to a separate case.".
Wasn't that a rape charge? Not even commenting on the merits on the espionage question, but the above quote is dancing very hard around a rather important part of Assange's legal history.
Contrarily to what many here seem to believe, Assange is not pursued because of the late leaks influencing the 2016 election but:
That said, I agree that this bullshit about Assange is mostly a distraction from the war crimes he did expose. Everyone implicated were quick to point the finger. No one has been brought up. There was little in the way of accountability because of a deeply corrupt government.
I'm very much for illegally exposing government corruption. And I'm grateful for some of the information he DID release. But what Assange did went beyond that. What he did was closer to espionage than whistle-blowing. It was a very biased political attack. If he had aired out everyone's dirty laundry wih little no partisanship or ulterior motives, that would have been something. But he didn't, did he?
But it doesn't change what he is and what his motivation was, which was decidedly NOT journalistic. He attempts to hide behind the cover of journalism to sheild his behavior as a partisan political operative.
Giving half truth is not journalism.he had the whole story, And he withheld half of it For his own political agenda.
