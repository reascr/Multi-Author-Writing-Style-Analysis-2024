So let me get this straight. Russia is taking criminals. Putting them in situations where either they die or learn how to use weapons to survive. Even if they do survive, the environment they were subjected to is so hostile that most survivors walk away with at least some form of mental trauma. Added to that is that a good percentage of the people already have substance abuse problems and lack impulse control.
Them to top it off you organize them into a for profit criminal gang led by a guy determined to be the next dictator of Russia....
In a country led by oligarchs and kleptocrats, where even the military is super corrupted from top military general all the way down to mere squad leaders, money always talks. As long as one can pay a sufficient amount of big bribes, he can walk away scott free and makec a \lot\ of "behind the scenes" deals. Or be relatively treated ok (or even with favors) while remaining in prison.
This does't include those that were super duper filthy rich: those just bribed their entire sentence right away in the first place, and never went to prison.
If all the dewad since the start of this stupid atrocious war were there, the graves would fill up (assuming a conservative 60000 dead --- not just specific Wagner loosses, though) then you'd need over 2400 of such cemetary plots. Take the \full\ image, make it about 5 times wider and 5 times talller (i.e. 25 times that image), and that would be much closer that the minimum "real" size of Russian dead troops.
No need, it likely looks close to , once the war is over and the Russians keep burying them instead of cremating. Though likely not as nice as the one in the video but the size matches.
