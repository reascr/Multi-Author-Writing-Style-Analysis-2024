There obviously is but they'll just be way more open about it until they have complete control over everything. Which at this rate they definitely will. Bo regulation over gerrymandering, filibusters, voting rights being shafted from ethnic minorities, we're kinda fucked. But hey as long as "JuST VoTE" is our best bet then we can oat ourselves on the back for doing fuck all.
Just vote was our best bet. People squandered it long enough that Id say next years elections is probably most definitely the last chance we get to stop this shitshow.
The same thing will happen with this crew; the more extreme and annoying they become,the more national elections the GOP will lose. The current House leadership will be mocked by the GOP senate as an embarrassment, and they’ll ignore everything thing they try and pass unless it’s bipartisan and reasonable.
I expect McCarthy won’t last a year with these idiots calling the shots. He won’t be able to censure them without them trying to remove him.
Koch’s admitted they funded idiots. They’re rapidly funding other primary candidates now for the GOP to challenge Trump. American politics has been here before with Joe McCarthy in the 1950’s. Eventually people got wise to his bullshit and walked away from him.
Reagan said this. He was a total ass and helped create the homeless crisis by refusing to fund community support for the mentally ill, and created the wealth gap through his fake tax policies. Not only that but the Christian right gained power with his help. The guy was essentially a corporate shill (he worked for General Electric for several years).
