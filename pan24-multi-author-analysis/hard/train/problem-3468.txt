Yeah sorry for anyone sitting there hoping this was the start of WW3 but anything short of definitive proof that Russia deliberately targeted a fucking farm in Poland this wasn't ever going to go anywhere. Poland is going to invoke Article 4 (not 5) and probably end up getting a ton of missile defense systems as a result. That's it.
Maybe to some extent. But after this I would imagine they just get more aggressive with their own defense and start covering anything near their border, including over Ukrainian airspace.
Genuine question - what happens if it was a Ukrainian anti air missile or whatever it's called? Are there going to be repercussions for Ukraine? I mean they're (Ukraine) on defense and obviously it wasn't intentional by any means (in the event it was from Ukraine), so it's not like it was technically an 'attack' on NATO?
They are trying to feed the story that it was Ukraine defense missile, if it was true a lot of support for ukraine would drop so it makes sense Russia denies it.
So far Russia has not used S-300s to attack Northern Ukraine and I don't know if they are even in Belraus operated by Russia. Since it's unlikely Russia would somehow make the same mistake of Kyiv-Lviv in multiple Iskander systems that basically leaves the S-300.
The only systems that can fire from occupied Ukraine and Belarus would be Iskanders and S-300s. Iskanders are a single missile launch system, S-300s can fire multiple missiles but they are only in range of Poland from Belarus.
Two missiles apparently hit Poland simultaneously, since it seems unlikely they came from Russia that leaves Belarus and occupied Ukraine.
