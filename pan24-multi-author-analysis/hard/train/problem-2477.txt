IQ is also relative to people your age, so it isn’t absolute across every age group anyways. This kid is probably way smarter than mostly everyone his age, but is he smarter than Einstein or Stephen Hawking (even if those estimates of their IQ are accurate)? You’d have to do statistics to tell for sure, but I’d guess not. Most kids are pretty dumb (and don’t tell me adults can be dumb as well, you know what I mean).
Yeah, a lot of people don’t understand that, they just think the IQ measurement is bogus. They’re right, but for the wrong reasons. He might have a higher IQ, but doesn’t matter if he actually isn’t smarter than Einstein/Hawking.
If anyone is interested, people have surely given estimates for Einstein’s IQ, and 160 is laughably low. But that’s if you’re into the IQ thing anyway. I don’t care for it, but it’s an interesting discussion hence Einstein and Hawking as a comparison here.
The two points between his 162 and the 160 that Einstein and hawking are “thought to have scored” surely make all the difference. This young man has already developed SUPER special relativity and disproven the theory of Hawking radiation using only his microwave oven and a styrofoam cup!
