I was about to say, people in this thread are acting like he knows it's false, but authoritarians tend to believe this shit. Putin almost certainly believes that he is necessary for the survival of Russia.
It is a war for Russia's survival. A former soviet state became a democracy, and they are not interested in having closer ties with Russia. If Russia were to win, other countries would be afraid to be invaded by Russia. But now, the Ukrainians called their bluff and Russia's true power is much smaller than anyone thought.
Strange what happens when Russia put themselves in a pretend noose and then learned that it was real after the fact... Putin's survival is the issue. He won't. He will take as many people down with him as he can though.
LOL, yeah, he's kind of forced that on himself. He could have easily gone in the other direction, been a partner with Europe as a counter to an emerging China and a turbulent middle east but instead he had this egomaniacal dreams of Russian imperialism and it is all crashing down around him.
