The irony is getting a little warmer might make Russia a bit more liveable. Putin will not live to see it.
Russians KNOW full well what is going on. They can watch it in real time. And they are celebrating it. They are proud of atrocities they committing. They want to commit more. They are proud that "Russia is expanding". They want to expand it more. They are proud they are genociding Ukrainians.
You know, seeing how Russia is once again terrorizes Ukraine with missiles, and bombing our cities, i feel that i need to reporst this once again because they launched another missile attack on our cities.
Again, not inciting violence in the middle of a genocidal attack by Russia, just want Ukraine to be able to defend itself.
It was reasonable to expect Ukraine to fight back, and we kinda knew Russia wasn’t at NATO level, but what we’ve seen has been next level.
The fact is, many Germans are very tepid when it comes to military support for Ukraine. Where it comes from — whether from from fear, greed, pacifism, or fondness for Russian culture — I will not speculate, because I am not a German, nor I live in Germany — all I have are stereotypes. But it is true, and we have to work with, or around that.
