That’s why in ireland we had a booming export business of our women taking the ferry to the UK to get abortions performed over there. It’s still happening as far as I know because the abortion services in ireland are only in the process of being set up.
Nowadays I believe it’s becoming part of your hiring contract when you work in a hospital. Eventually the list of things your conscience can absolve you from will not include abortions. So no punishment for abstaining medical staff yet but that won’t be the case forever.
I'm not saying that medical staff shouldn't have choice. I'm saying that their choice shouldn't override patient's choice. If doctor is not comfortable doing certain procedure then it should be his duty to find/refer someone else who is able to do it. That would respect patient's wishes, that would make me trust him as I would know that he has best interest in my wellbeing. But Conscience clauses are commonly used as "I don't want to do it, so you shouldn't either'.
That's true, but how do conscience clauses apply? If anything religious doctors would be more in favor of circumcision. Isn't a conscience clause basically "my religion says I cannot do this" for doctors? The parents already have a choice in that matter.
What do you mean? Are you saying doctors can currently refuse to give circumcisions based on supposed faith? Which doesn't make sense since it's a religious thing. Idk how else to interpret your comment.
