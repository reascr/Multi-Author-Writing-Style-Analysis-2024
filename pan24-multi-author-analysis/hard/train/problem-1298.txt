Evangelical Christians who previously backed Donald Trump are now accusing him of using them to further his own goals, after he gave them everything on their agenda.
Trump’s fixer, Michael Cohen, helped bury this story all while Falwell, Jr was praising Trump and promoting him to other Evangelical leaders. Will Evangelicals ever admit that they were duped by a con artist and a pathological liar? My guess is no. It is very embarrassing and reeks of the hypocrisy in the party that has intertwined religion with politics. And keep in mind, this is all while Michael Cohen was paying off porn star Stormy Daniels who Trump had an affair with.
The new documentary on Jerry Falwell, Jr. is very revealing. You had the leader of the most conservative religious university in the country ask Trump for help to bury a story that was a major scandal. You can’t make this up. His wife seduced a 20 year old pool boy, brought him back to their place, and asked if it was okay for her husband to watch. In walks Jerry Falwell, Jr.
Evangelicals don’t get a pass on this. They don’t get to say Trump is behaving badly now, so we are not supporting him. They never should have supported him to begin with. You know it, we know it, we all know it.
Yes, this is spot on. Devastating how a father and son could have such a devastating impact and bring us the most corrupt President in American history.
