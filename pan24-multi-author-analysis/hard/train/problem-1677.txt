It’s not about Trump. It’s not about Desantis. It’s not about Ryan. It’s about demonizing the political opposition whoever that may be.
It literally makes no difference. Ryan can publicly denounce Trumpism ad nauseum, but if he’s the Republican “face of the future” he’ll be hated with fervor by the same people that hate trump.
Ryan also made clear he would not endorse Trump, who he earlier this year described as a “proven loser.”.
Okay but a reminder Paul Ryan supports the same policies as Trump and the rest of the republicans. Ending all social services, keeping wages low and people desperate to work, deregulations in the name of profit, voter suppression, gerrymandering , Opposing women's health choices, criminalizing LGBTQ, and establishing a Christiaan nationalist autocracy .
In 2023 there will be local and state elections near you. Vote out as many Republicans as you can to stop them from using tax money for campaign stunts like they are in Florida Texas and the house. Pave the way for their defeat in 2024 and beyond. Vote every time you get the chance.
