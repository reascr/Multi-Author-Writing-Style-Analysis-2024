The more I think about it, the less convinced I am that she actually runs in 2024. She seems to absolutely hate the job itself, outside of the attention she gets. She doesn't meet with constituents and she underwater across the board among all Arizona voters. In addition to the signature hurdle, who's going to want to work for her to even gather those signatures? The Democratic party won't. The GOP could maybe, but it'd be just as much of a risk for them as if they nominate another Blake Masters, Sinema could end up pulling some R-leaning voters that'd otherwise go for them.
I mean there's definitely a chance, more-so than were this just a D vs. R race, but the one poll I saw on the matter (in fall 2021, when Dems were slumping in polls in general) had it as a 38R-36D race, with Sinema taking some portion of that remainder. A GOP lead, but not insurmountable by any means.
The deterioration of that friendship - Hobbs mentored Sinema as a social worker, helped run her early state legislative campaigns, and in turn got Sinema's support when she ran for the State House seat Kyrsten was vacating in 2010 - is honestly some Greek tragedy shit.
