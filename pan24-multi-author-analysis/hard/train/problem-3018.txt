Yes, that’s why an investigation is being done, and why charges brought about on the basis of negligence could be completely warranted. This is still, once again, a far cry from Trump’s malicious intent and active obstruction.
Trump had hundreds of documents intentionally taken off site, after he left office, and refused to give them back despite multiple requests until they had to physically be raided from the property.
One intentionally stole hundreds of documents, many that literally aren’t supposed to leave the room they’re in, concealed them, refused to give them back, pretended to give them all back, and then had to have his home raided to get them all back (but there’s still some missing).
Only because trump and his supporters cant understand nuance and think missing some documents after leaving office is the same as intentionally stealing thousands of, many above top secret, documents and then intentionally withholding them and lying to investigators until ultimately your house has to be raided by the FBI because you won’t comply.
However, the other commenter isn't wrong that each party went about this in completely opposite ways and Trump's resistance and lies are what led to FBI searches and the involvement of the DOJ and judicial branch. He certainly provoked the steps that have been taken against him and now there is the question of "Why?" that wouldn't have been there if he'd just taken them by mistake and returned them as soon as he realized he had them.
