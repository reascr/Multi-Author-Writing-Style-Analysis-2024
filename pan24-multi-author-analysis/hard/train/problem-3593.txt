The real core issue is Xi. He reversed China's previous direction which both makes them a less valuable partner to the west and threatens their economic rise.
Modern China would not be possible without the participation of the US, and the US is withdrawing its support. It's only a matter of time before all their accumulated problems drag them down. All the US has to do is go home.
which isn't to say the US shouldn't just go home, they should. but business isn't going to like it, and that means capitalists probably will try to China it as long as it remains profitable.
China's model was to dominate industries by price, whether or not it was profitable. Or whether or not there was even a demand for the product. That kept their numbers very high and that practice continues today. The mandate is not profit, but jobs. That's one great weakness of the Chinese system, many of those companies were not profitable. Even if the company was failing the government would keep it afloat by giving them unlimited loans, another weakness of the system. Virtually all loans were direct from a government bank and up to one third were simply ghost loans that would never be repaid.
