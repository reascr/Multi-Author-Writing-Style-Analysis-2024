Yeah but I'm an idiot and put 2br when I meant 1br. It was a kind of cottage. But a BR, a bathroom, a living room and small kitchen, all with a fenced yard. That was in Phoenix, and prices went way up just a few years later. They have continued to rise ever since.
I'm GenX and for like ten years I was able to rent a house alone, pay my car payment, and save money too. Rent was $650/mo. for a 1 br house with a nice yard. That was only about 20 years ago. Wages have not gone up much but that same house probably rents for $2k now.
If you can pay $2,000 a month for rent, but the cheapest possible rent you can find is $2,100. You can’t make that rent payment. If you live at home for two years and save that $48,000 instead of blowing it on luxury goods you can pay the extra $100 you don’t earn monthly on rent for 480 months.
It doesn't, I know people who could afford to pay rent but live at home to save money for a house instead so they can buy one quickly instead of paying rent and saving which will take longer.
If these people are also saving (which they should be when not paying rent) I wonder what this will do to house prices in a few years time when they come to try and buy a house?
