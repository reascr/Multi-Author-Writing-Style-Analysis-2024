Oh ya any day. But if became a pandemic(it's dependence on liquids deters this) it would make COVID look like nothing. Hospitals had a hard time getting people to work with COVID it would be rough getting people for an Ebola ward. Or getting people to work.
I mean ya by the same angle airborne HIV COULD exist. Super deadly diseases tend to wipe themselves out. Either they are so lethal they kill the host before it spreads or it wipes out the host species if it can also spread super well.
The most deadly virus kills its host before it has a chance to optimally spread. Or makes them feel like crap so they stay home. The virus with the best rates of spreading spreads the best. Over time viruses that are not too harsh on hosts and spread easily like colds etc spread well and stay in the population.
The most likely situation is probably going to be something like Avian Influenza that finds a way to mutate in such a way to transmit between people. Scientists have been warning governments/the public that it wouldn't be some huge evolution of the virus for that to happen either.
A harmless virus could spread to everyone in the world but it can't gain traits all at once like in pandemic. If an individual of this species gains lethal traits it will have to spread to everyone all over again since the other varients will all still be harmless.
