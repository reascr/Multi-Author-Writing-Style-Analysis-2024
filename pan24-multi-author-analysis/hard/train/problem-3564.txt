Only idiots need a reminder not to travel to Russia when practically the entire news cycle has been dominated by Russia’s invasion. And up until a few months ago it was all about Brittany Griner.
Even if you don’t watch the news you would have to be intentionally ignoring every source of media to not be aware of what has been going on for over a year. And that’s unfortunate if people have family in Russia, but if you choose to go back there, you can’t say there haven’t been countless warnings for American citizens who travel to Russia.
This is a warning/reminder for Americans who are tourists, curious thrill-seekers, vloggers, etc who probably shouldn't be in Russia and may expect consular services in case shit goes down.
I wasn't going to Russia anytime soon regardless, so I'm not particularly worried about it; but I would be worried about visiting Russia right now. Tourists getting drafted may have an infinitesimally small chance of happening, but if it did, I think the tourist would be fucked.
I agree, Russia drafting some random non-Russian citizen sounds absurd, and would be highly illegal. It would be closer to abduction at that point. Probably not happening.
2. Let's say the absurd happened, and you were taken to Russian boot camp. What would you do about it? What authority would you seek remedy from, and what would you expect them to do?
