Make the case for reelecting Biden right now, because Marianne Williamson just announced her candidacy.
The democrats held both houses of congress for 2 years and had every chance to pass the John Lewis Act and fix gerrymandering.
And frankly, too many Democrats are afraid of what Republicans would do if they regain power to aver swing killing the filibuster. Two years ago I would have disagreed, but looking at how quickly the MAGA brain worms have infected the rest of them since 2020 I'm afraid too.
It's important to remember, ANY legislation that can't somehow get folded into a major spending bill needs 60% to pass, so until Democrats can pick up more seats, get some measure of Republican buy in, or they can convince the small handful of Democratic holdouts to kill the filibuster, nothings going to happen.
But again, even if in theory there were 50 senators on board for this from the democrats (which there probably AREN'T to your point) it would need to overcome the general filibuster.
Probably the only point I would straight up give you here, it's obviously a massive conflict of interest and all legislators are currently complicit in this who aren't voting for it.
Republican legislators are NOT going to read a Washinon Post article pointing out their hypocrisy, and suddenly wake up and say "Wait - the voters don't like this We're actually...wrong. We need to shape up".
We need to wake up. Democrats in power aren't doing anything because they are friends with GOP criminals and they do not want to help us. They had the Presidency and both Houses of Congress for years and didn't even legalize weed or protect Roe v Wade.
