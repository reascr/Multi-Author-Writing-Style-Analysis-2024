Well, to be fair, every time the virus takes a step is by the means of a mutation. This means that the emerging virus is a different virus. Sure, it doesn't look good, but nobody has a clue about the virulence of a hypothetical human bird flu virus. We'll can only know if it finally happens.
For the comments, it seems nobody has read the article. It basically says that, for the first time ever, we have observed a mammal catching bird flu from another mammal. Until now, we only saw mammals getting it from a bird, but the virus was unable to go further.
They didn't say a complete change, they said a different virus, which is very much true. Mutation is difference, and they are right that we won't know how dangerous it is until it happens.
Sure, same virus as in it's the avian flu. It's different in that it behaves differently than the avian flu currently does, by being transmittable between humans. That's all this person was saying, not that it suddenly becomes some completely novel virus.
there is another thing to consider, which is how infectious the virus is. Some sexually transmitted diseases satisfy the two criteria you listed, but since they transmit via bodily fluids they don't spread nearly as rapidly as something airborne.
