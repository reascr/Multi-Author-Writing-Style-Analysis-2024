Really the " i fell down the stairs " is a common excuse for many things. For this well I wish he died from it as the world would be better off. Still 5 stars isn't far and he has the normal human thing of it hurts to sit while my body is recovering from hitting it against hard surface with my full body weight.
He has cancer it reads to which well the majority of humans I know who are over 80 also have or have had cancer so it isn't surprising that he does. Putin is human and thus can die just wish he would get along with it already.
In general, all these rumors about Putin's illness remind me of Himmler's wish for Stalin's death. He wants it so much that, looking at the newsreel, he begins to notice confirmation of his desires. Putin is hated by so many people that they cannot help but project their desires onto reality.
I was reminded of the Soviet spy mini-series "Seventeen Moments of Spring". There, at the beginning, Himmler (Reichsfuhrer SS) and Schellenberg (head of intelligence) watch newsreels from the Yalta conference. Himmler looks closely at Stalin and says: "Don't you think he's aged?".
