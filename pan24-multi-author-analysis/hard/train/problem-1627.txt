Also I think it's important to note that much of the material that is portrayed as "bad info" is not nearly as bad as it's made out to be, and in some cases actually reflects quite well on Twitter and the individuals who work there. The idea that the 'twitter files' is a scandal is in many cases contradicted by the actual substance of the information being leaked.
I agree with this statement, and I think the key point here is that nothing in the 'twitter files' shows any evidence of this type of activity whatsoever.
But, the goal was to have the Twitter files articles provide quotes for right-wing media to amplify to a base that would never read the evidence or possibly even the original article.
I guess from what I’ve seen, this is nothing and I feel like we’re following Republicans down this rabbit hole that in the end will show that Twitter moderated content and may or may not have considered, among other factors, whether the government thought the content was factual or not.
I’m not surprised that Republicans are the ones trying to censor voices they disagree with on Twitter. I mean, after all, they accused Democrats of doing it, so you know that was a Republican admission.
You’re probably a bit more sanguine in the prospect of Republicans engaging in self reflection than I am. I see no reason to believe they will ever stop and think “Wait, are we the baddies?” But I take your point there.
