And not just the population increases but more and more newly getting access to electricity as well. For example a third of Indians got access to electricity just within the last decade, and now close to 99% Indians have electricity access. India had to pump up more coal based electricity for more of her citizens to get better living standards aka electricity during a short span of time.
There isn't any major difference in coal emissions between India and Europe. But the overall per capita emission across all sectors (phew) gives the actual picture.
India consumes about double the amount of coal consumed by Europe, and India has double the population of Europe as well.
The world is burning more coal, especially third world countries where their population continues to grow. Until you can find something as cheap and efficient, coal is the primary choice.
Article claims world has cut coal use in half during the last decade. If we're now burning 40% more than we did last year, we're still in a better place than we were 10 years ago. Not the progress we want to see but shite happens.
