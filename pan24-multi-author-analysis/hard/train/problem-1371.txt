My son’s autistic, every New Year/Bonfire Night/Diwali is a whole thing, he gets really scared. We’ve tried getting him used to them with videos etc, he even likes fireworks, but it still disturbs him in everyday activities and when he’s sleeping.
Funny enough with the PTSD, I’ve known both migrants of war torn areas and veterans to be affected by fireworks as well.
I’ve heard for decades how fireworks scare veterans and have been scolded by people for scaring them. I’ve never met a veteran who is freaked out by fireworks and definitely not professional fireworks, which means there’s people stealing valor from veterans to complain on their behalf, usually because fireworks scare their dog and they don’t even know a veteran.
The next morning the streets were clean. No debris, no red paper, it’s like it never happened. I’m not sure what is happening with these attacks, but it’s not typical NYE behavior. It’s not fireworks, it’s people trying to hurt emergency responders and that needs to stop.
There was a lot of gunfire in the Midwest US city where I live, and absolutely none of people throwing fireworks at strangers. Probably related to there being a lot of strangers with guns.
