So, to the extent it's in Finland and Sweden's hands, they want to join together, or "hand in hand" as the oh-so-popular catchphrase goes.
In reality, Finland's position is quite consistent: They want to join together with Sweden, as quickly as possible. But if Hungary and Turkey ratify their accession protocol and not Sweden's, Finland will not withdraw it's application and say "screw NATO, we're not joining after all".
On topic, as a Swede, I support Finland being admitted to NATO as soon as they are accepted and waiting for Sweden to be admitted when the Turkish election is done. Assuming that's what Erdogan is waiting for.
There are arguments to be made that buring the Koran is hate speech, which is illegal in Sweden. Not to mention that it's disorderly conduct, förargelseväckande beteende, in Swedish. I'm a staunch supporter of free speech, but Paludan's motives aren't about an opinion, they're about creating controversy and provoking violence. There's plenty of precedence for denying him permits for demonstration.
