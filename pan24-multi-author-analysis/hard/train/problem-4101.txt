Remembering exactly where you were when you gained rights is a truest bizarre experience. I was in middle school when DADT was repealed. I was in high school when Obergefell allowed gay marriage nationwide. I was in my mid 20s when Bostock extended workplace protections to LGBT people.
I feel similar. Catholic upbringing, religious parents, years of fear and anxiety. I’m a bit younger than you from the dates but I remember things vividly.
These past few years have made me realize that we are nowhere near a point where our rights aren’t still threatened. I was so hopeful in 2015, in 2023 I’m scared.
I don't like the future, though. The last time I felt this kind of hatred from the right was when I was like 12-13, in the early '90s.
I vividly remember one very clear time my dad stating that if his son brought home another boy that boy would be lucky to leave alive. It's why my adolescence was mostly just fear. I really didn't get it back then, and I simply believed it to be literally true. (I tend to take things literal.).
Okay. So this guy is horrible and I don't actually want this. But this guy as a speaker of the house would lead to some funny introductions of people messing it up.
