They have to call them "objects" until they can confirm what they are because if they announce they blasted a balloon out of the sky and it turns out to not be a balloon it would be a massive scandal that would make the current administration and the military look bad. The 2nd and 3rd objects have been upgraded to Balloon Status in the last day.
I imagine they are just restructuring their pilot's schedule to -1 target practice sortie, +1 Balloon Hunt.
Am I the only one imagining thag, after the first pilot shot that balloon, all the other pilots wanted to shoot one too.
Godspeed if they ever have to use their guns against an actual target if a near stationary balloon is too hard for them to line up.
Also, you don't need off bore axis and variable thrust to hit a balloon, that's for shooting down migs.
I know the first balloon was shot down with the 9x, and any other object an F22 popped was probably also the 9x, and the other ones that got bopped by the F16 was probably also a 9x.
The hours and fuel costs are probably a wash because they are counting it as training flight hours that would have been flown anyways.
The flight would have been considered training hours anyways, so the fuel and hours on the airframe would have been used anyways flying figure 8s over an airbase somewhere instead.
