Both McCarthy and McConnell said it was a good thing for Pelosi to go. Sure they had reasons why they didn't like it to their expectations, but both agreed that is was something Pelosi should have done.
That was the complaint about Pelosi going over there, which I agreed with, and I agree McCarthy going there is wrong as well.
Isn't the US fundamentally changing the Status quo by sending the speaker of the house and others and using language that implies that Taiwan is it's own entity and that the US is taking sides?
You realize, don't you, that it's the official position of China, Taiwan, and the US that there is only one China, and Taiwan and what we call China are all the same nation, right?
Hindsight is 20-20 and no one can be right 100% of the time, but I belive there is a strong argument that it is in the United States interest to defend Taiwan should China invade. The ball is in their court. The decision is just whether to defend an ally/partner from naked aggression should that day come.
When the day comes for the US to decide on whether to defend Taiwan from the PRC, understanding fully what that decision will cost in terms of lives and money, these types of visits will come to the minds of those in power and hopefully convince them that Taiwan is worth defending.
Still there are almost no feasable scenarios where the PRC would try to take taiwan by force without hitting US forces on day 1, so the question of whether the US would get involved is kind of a mute point. The PRC sure seems to think we will & they get a vote.
