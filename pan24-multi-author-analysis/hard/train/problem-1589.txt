so will probably be some repercussions at some point, but Iran tends not to like getting its hands dirty, so will probably get some terror group or other to act as a proxy.
Well Iran supply’s the people lobbing rockets at Israel every other day so I guess it’s tit for tat, but my feeling is this may escalate more because of the Iran nuke stuff.
Iran already supports the ongoing war against Israel by supplying Palestinian terrorists with weapons, but engaging in open war would bring the US into the conflict directly, which Iran doesn’t want.
Israel mostly attack Iranian targets in Syria, which is valid because Israel and Syria and still technically at war, and sometimes conducts small attacks in Iran, mostly assassinations.
Iran is funding multiple terrorist orgs by Israel's borders, but they themsevles don't want an open war with Israel because it would escelate into a larger conflict very quickly.
Nobody else will get involved because (1) western countries tacitly support Israel here because they are neutralizing an enemy’s weapon supply, and (2) Iran’s allies won’t risk a broader conflict over something minor like this. Most of the Middle East won’t get involved because they hate Israel and Iran, but view Iran as the greater threat.
