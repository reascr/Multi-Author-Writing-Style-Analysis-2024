A hurricane locks up so much water that it drops 2.4 trillion gallons of water per day. Even if every car had hydrogen fuel cells, we would be locking up about 60 billion gallons at a time. Notice the scale difference?
352,000,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water. I think evaporation can replace the pitiful amount we would be taking quite easily, don't you?
If we took water from the air, water from the ocean would just evaporate and replace it. There's no way humans could ever take enough water from the air that the ocean wouldn't be able to replenish it. Especially since we'd be using the hydrogen to burn or run through a fuel cell which turns it right back into water.
When exposed to sunlight, the device absorbs water from the air and produces hydrogen. The hydrogen produced in this way could be used as fuel or for the long-term storage of solar energy, the authors wrote in the scientific journal “Advanced Materials” on Wednesday.
__EPFL scientists have developed a prototype of a solar-powered device capable of extracting water from the air and converting it into hydrogen.__.
