Biden literally plagiarized multiple times in his professional career and he’s been caught lying about his personal background multiple times. I have to ask myself. What does the Democrat bingo look like? It must look very similar to whatever card you’re playing.
Arguing magnitude of qualitative characteristic is pointless. We’re not talking about little white lies. We’re talking about direct deception intended to deceive voters.
Whataboutism only applies if I didn’t concede that that santos has lied about his past, which I accept. So now it your turn to accept that Biden is a habitual liar.
While it’s good that you accept that Biden is a chronic liar, the next step is not bring up your favorite politician, Donald Trump, in every political argument. This must be the whataboutism that the left is always talking about.
Whataboutism or whataboutery (as in "what about…?") denotes in a pejorative sense a procedure in which a critical question or argument is not answered or discussed, but retorted with a critical counter-question which expresses a counter-accusation.
