Can confirm. There's was not a single power outage since February, 11. For comparison in worst days of December there were no power for up to 20 hours per day.
I live in front of a major power station and witnessed more than 10 rocket strikes on that power station and a herd of Iranian drones. Luckily for the power station Russian cruise missiles and ballistic missiles are shit. They hit in radius of 1.5 km. Because of these terrorist strikes innocent people die. And no I'm not talking about intercepted missiles. Russian missiles are really this terrible.
On the other hand, the Russian Navy has always been several steps below awful. That's neither new nor surprising. "Russian Navy continues to be terrible" is a nonevent as far as naval analysts are concerned, because it is exactly in keeping with all of their past performance for decades.
Then the Russians used the videos to study operational tactics, brought in extra AA, and a bunch of Bayraktars went down, so Ukraine stopped posting footage from them but also curtailed their use. This dropoff also aligned with when Ukraine got HIMARS, which have similar capabilities in terms of range and accuracy but are much harder to intercept.
> According to General Viktor Nazarov, an advisor to the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, the HIMARS multiple missile launcher system has replaced the Turkish drones to some extent. "The Bayraktars are now focused on other tasks, mainly reconnaissance. They were very helpful in sinking the Russian missile cruiser Moskva.".
Oh, that could be it. Probably wanted to show the world how big and fearsome their new rocket is, and how it could reach every part of the world in 2 seconds flat.
