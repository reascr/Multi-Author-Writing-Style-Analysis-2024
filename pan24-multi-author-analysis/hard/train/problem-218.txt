Joe Miller interestly is the attorney who is currently representing AK House member David Eastman in a disqualification bid. David Eastman is an Oath Keeper member and has said some very racist and sexist stuff during his time in office. He is kind of known as a pariah. But he keeps getting elected in Sarah Palin's former district of Wasilla. Eastman has a court case going on right now due to this disqualfication provision on the Alaska Constitution that may remove him from office. The main part of the trial is just before Christmas with Miller as attorney. .
For now. I hope it lasts. The talking heads are hard on the attack of rcv here. Dems need to fight to keep it. I won't be surprised to see a repeal initiative on the next ballot .
The AK Republican party is completely run by Trump loyalists. It needs to be flushed down the toilet and rebuilt with people who represent the conservative views of alaskans. Instead of shoving nationalist, culture war bullshitters down the voters throats how about listening to them and representing them? I know plenty of conservative folks here that don't want to vote for these shit candidates but aren't left with much choice. Murkowski is your standard Republican of yesteryear.
