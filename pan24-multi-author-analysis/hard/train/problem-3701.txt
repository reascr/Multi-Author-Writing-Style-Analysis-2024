For people thinking, "Fuck this, I'll just move abroad," it's not as easy as it sounds. Most countries where you'd actually want to live make it pretty hard to get legal residency there, let alone citizenship.
So the people most likely to be unsatisfied in the US are the people least likely to be able to find a country willing to allow them to move there.
Outside of that, chances are that other countries have little interest in whether or not you want to live there.
As an American that has lived overseas on and off for over 10 years, starting in the 1980s, here’s a bit of reality, the rest of the world probably doesn’t want you.
As someone that has lived overseas in and off since the 1980s, it’s just sort of a rule of thumb that you shouldn’t be too friendly with anybody that’s been here less than 5 years since there’s a huge, huge chance they’re going to end up going back home.
The vast majority of expats that I’ve met over the years either fall into one of the above categories or, they started their own or bought a business, or they networked their way into a job.
