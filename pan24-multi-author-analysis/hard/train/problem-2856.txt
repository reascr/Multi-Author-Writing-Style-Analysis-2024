Funny how you were downvoted for telling the truth, and China, unlike Russia is not incapable of producing many of the more modern stuff including microchips, sure they are behind by and are banned from being able to buy the lithography machines, but they recently are showing that they are able to produce 5 nanometer chips, which are only a couple years behind at most. From both high tech and low tech manufacturing, China is taking the cake and eating it. The less educated who are looking at this with prejudice are pretty much in denial, maybe to stroke their ego, or hopping on to the China-hate wagon.
The first sea trial probably saw issues and the ship thus has to be refitted. And this all is new for China.
Which brings me to the real threat of China. If they ever decide to simply support a country like Russia with military aid, it would be devastating. I also believe that's what the no limits friendship was about. But sadly for China that didn't work out as Russia attacked Ukraine, one of China's best friends. Before the war there were talks about Ukraine being China's gateway into Europe. Then Russia became nothing but a gas station to China.
Then finally France has 1 carrier. China has 3, though with no pilots. On a pure number basis, China wins that conflict. Assuming the get the pilots.
60 aircraft. 40 is just the fighters. So yeah 20 more aircraft particularly things like AWACs and other EW jets are certainly going to turn the tide in an actual conflict between France and China.
The fact that France has fielded a nuclear powered catapult aircraft carrier for 20 years while China still does not have one operational means France is further ahead in aircraft capabilities vs China.
Also, France has built 10 aircraft carriers in their history, they have one operating now but there is a difference there and lots is learned in the building process (something China has very little experience with).
