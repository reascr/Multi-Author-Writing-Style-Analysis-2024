Was looking for exactly this response. And to extend the line of thought here further: if Russia wants to pretend Wagner is a PMC and the US, in turn, designates Wagner as a terrorist organization, then the US (and allies) should be free to directly target Wagner leaders/operatives for assassination just as we have with ISIL and al-Qaeda leaders.
But when you designate Wagner a terrorist organization then you're also - passively or directly - stating its a Russian-state sponsored one.
Agreed, which is why the political ramifications of calling them a terrorist organization are complex.
Anyway, classifying it as a terrorist organization is the correct response. If Russia wants to pretend they aren't their military and they aren't legally a PMC, a terrorist classification is a no-brainer before we even take a look at the atrocities they commit. Also, it should be made clear by NATO and especially Ukraine that Wagner members are not granted protections and rights as Russian military under the Geneva convention.
