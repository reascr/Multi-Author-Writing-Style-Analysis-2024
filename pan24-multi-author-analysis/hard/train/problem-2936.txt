He's running. He's said he's running, and he has not said anything different since saying that. Any other discussion on the topic is idle speculation, which is all well and good if you're just chatting with someone, but to put into print as if it's real is dishonest. News media seems to need either fear or excitement to drive clicks, and when it doesn't exist organically, they manufacture it.
He said he's going to. Multiple people who are going to run haven't officially declared (DeSantis and Pence, for example), but to pretend like that means they won't is disingenuous.
Biden spent most of his adult life trying to run for President, and you all really think he's going to leave office willingly now that he's in and (generally) doing well?
But I don't want to get my hopes up, because I know there's also a decent chance she won't be open to any sort of agreements because she'd rather gamble on Biden dying in office, instead of worrying about ever winning an election. And while he technically could, I doubt Biden will replace her without her agreeing.
If it's not Trump as the opposition Biden is a less attractive candidate. I know some people think that if he does great over the rest of his term his age won't matter, but I don't think that will be the reality.
