If there’s potentially classified documents out there, and they’ve lied about that multiple times, now none of his lawyers want to go on record saying there’s no more documents, how is that not probable cause for a warrant for all of his properties?
I’m leaning towards number two. I wonder if what’s going on is the government doesn’t actually know what of its (our) property is missing, which is embarrassing. Stands to reason the judge won’t hold somebody in contempt for not turning over something that anyone is sure exists.
I kind of wonder if some judges have cold feet because they don't want to be known as the one who pulled the trigger. We have to remember we live in a world where some rando thinks he can solo run an FBI office so I'm sure lots of people in power kinda worry about someone showing up at their house.
I get that we can't bow to fear but it's not our children or spouses in the LITERAL sights of a Q persons weapon. For us it's figuratively being held at gun point by crazies but them it's literal.
So back when people brought up the 25th amendment a lot, senators were saying they don't want to be responsible for a "Constitutional Crisis".
