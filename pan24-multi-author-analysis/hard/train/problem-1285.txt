Idk. If you hang out on liberal circlejerk forums (like this one) on liberal circlejerk websites (like this one) it can get pretty hard to know what actual conservatives actually believe - you'll encounter a million folks claiming that, say, conservatives believe a black dudes criminal history justifies police killings him before you'll actually encounter a conservative saying it.
In one sense your question is odd because its akin to asking why you'd want to discuss any background about a person so famous. And your inference is as nonsensical as saying that the people who discussed the positive parts of his life only did so with the intent of trying to make the killing look unjustified.
To more directly answer your question, though, there are a lot of possible alternatives. One that springs to mind is that his background doesn't justify the level of grief/angst/martyrdom following his murder. Not being sympathetic towards the murder of a bad person is arguably pretty callous, but its not the same as saying them being a bad person justifies the murder.
edit: all bad reasoning at that, since they ignore the issue of whether cops should be murdering people.
Okay, so maybe people don't say they deserved it, they say the police were justified. Which is functionally the same exact position.
