"Iranian Sunni cleric" in Iran means the guy has negative influence because pretty everything he says will be seen with suspicion from the start by pretty much everyone in the country except sunnis which is like 10% of the population (almost everyone else is Shia).
In case you don't know, the whole region is locked into a political power struggle between rival powers roughly on sectarian lines, and Iran is the spearhead of the Shia bloc, so anyhting sunni is immediately suppressed into submission and irrelevance, or used against the very cause they try to advance.
Yeah he can probably agitate quite a bit regionally and get things moving underground, but in term of actually promoting a referendum, or any official move, he's got less than zero influence .. The mullahs will never move in a direction pushed by a Sunni leader, barring a major shift in political and diplomatic direction.
Bear in mind that he's part of the Sunni minority and doesn't necessarily reflect the views of the leaders despite being a cleric. I don't know much about him, but a quick google seems to show that he's been critical of the regime in the past.
