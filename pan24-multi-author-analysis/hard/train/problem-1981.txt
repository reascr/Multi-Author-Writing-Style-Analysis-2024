It's not that there's no option, it's just that you can't get enough Republican votes to reach the 2/3 threshold.
If you accept that two parties are the only options, outside of a general ass "independent" vote. What's actually happening isn't possibility reflected in what's being talked about in political circles, where outcomes in politics are more important than the substance of voters/issues.
What a stupid take by 538. Shoehorning all voters into two parties makes these conversations moot. It's more of the inside baseball type shit we get from major news networks. There are only two boxes to choose from. Of course people will keep picking one or the other.
I'm saying that it's not that there are fewer non-independent voters, I'm saying that there aren't enough descriptors for it to matter. It's bullshit because it's presuming that reality is what politics says it is. It's not.
Nah. Even though itâ€™s a token gesture, they need him as the poster boy to show the new generation of the republican party that they are tolerant of that lifestyle. Very much like when people are called out for being a racist and their first response is "but I have a black friend, so I can't be racist".
