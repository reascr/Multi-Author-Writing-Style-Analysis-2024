When I was 16, I was pretty much an idiot who thought he knew the whole thing, beginning to end, smartest kid in the room anywhere. That kid would have totally agree with this decision, and embraced it, and engaged in the whole process.
And then maybe for the third, I thought that a capable person would just choose where they wanted to go, and then work toward that, and it would work out. In other words, you find yourself in a certain place and wish to go to another place, then you proceed until you get there. Of course in practice there are all kinds of random twists and turns, and half the time you can't even remember where you intended to go in all the windy paths and curveballs life tends to throw at you. I thought it was all about deciding, then applying one's will. In reality we don't really have many actual decisions in life, and most of those we hardly know whether they are going to work out or not.
Yeah, those things have significant personal consequences that come about through one's individual choices so I don't think they can be equated. The consequence of voting for a muppet polician on an individual level is not similar.
Given voter participation rates in under 25s, I don't think this will make any real difference to the outcome of our elections.
I wouldn't expect a 16 year old to have the foggiest understanding about how their vote would affect things. Would their input really be valuable? Do you really want 16 year old kids to have the power to influence important decisions? I dunno, I'm not against the idea neccesserily, but I understand why they currently aren't able to vote, let's put it that way.
But if we're letting old people vote and they have hardly any real skin in the game, I don't see why 16 year olds shouldn't have the chance.
well, a 82-92 year old can vote too, so should we let 14 year olds vote as well ? a 96 year old can, should a 10 year old be able to vote ?
