The report on the removal of the Israeli diplomat was published for the first time on the Lebanese "Al-Mayadeen" channel, which is affiliated with Hezbollah. The channel also reported that the deportation was due to pressure exerted by the two countries, and sources in the Algerian media told the newspaper that during the summit the issue of removing Israel's status as an observer in the Union will also be on the agenda.
Israel had observer status in the "Organization for African Unity" from the 1960s until it became the "African Union". In 2002, under the Libyan presidency, the Libyan ruler at the time, candidate Gaddafi, decided not to grant Israel observer status. Since then, several attempts have been made on Israel's part to return to the organization, and in 2021, after a great effort during the tenure of Yair Lapid as Foreign Minister, Israel was once again granted the status of an observer state in the organization, which is the largest and most important in Africa and includes all 55 countries on the continent.
“Until the AU takes a decision on whether to grant Israel observer status, you cannot have the country sitting and observing,” Clayson Monyela, head of public diplomacy in South Africa’s department of international relations, told Reuters.
Sorry. You seem expert. It seems they were kicked out for being part of the Is real delegation. They are upset at Israel's interference in their elections No?
Israel was meddling in elections all across Africa in recently released reports. This was probably done as a result of their actions. Stop trying to paint this as anti-semitism.
