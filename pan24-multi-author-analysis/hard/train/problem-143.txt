The bunker covers those first two, but limits the last. If that limitation has been mitigated elsewhere, fine. Security is about trade offs. But having a bunch of airplanes grounded because you can't get the blast doors to your bunker open seems like a horrible point of failure in planning.
Or you just hit the entrances with penetrating bombs and just in case fly the occasional combat air patrol that can spot these ancient planes from hundreds of km away.
They’re just showing off how well defended some of their bases (bases like these are protected largely from bunker buster bombers and more conventional munitions which is what destroyed a lot of Iraqi bases) and that they have a large amount of them.
They don’t have missile capabilities that can destroy the base most likely, Iranian bases were labeled as a reason to invest in underground warfare as they couldn’t easily be destroyed.
It’s an effective counter: for example a scenario where Coalition Forces wish to limit Iran’s air so they target their bases using a purely air campaign which is the most likely situation these bunkers would face. These bases for one, will be much harder to find. Two, will be well defended against missiles and even bunker busters. Three, if you find them and the exit they can easily clean the debris out the way.
TLDR: If the Pentagon calls these bunkers an effective threat, and trains their troops to counter such a threat, redesigns bunker buster bombs to counter these threats, the bunkers are an effective threat.
