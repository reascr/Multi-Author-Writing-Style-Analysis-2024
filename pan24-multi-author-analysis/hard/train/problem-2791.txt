I'm sure Cuba has a bright future ahead of itself in the next 60-125 years. I think younger Americans are too quick to sympathize with Cuba, and don't understand how terrible of a place it really is due to Cuba's own decisions.
Something tells me Americans feel like the United States owes something to Cuba (spoiler alert: they do not). Cuban dictators and the people that have stayed and followed them made their own bed. The US is not going to be gracious partners with Cuba until they fix their own problems, and install a real democracy.
Cuba doesn't need a "real democracy" it needs re-integration into the world much like China and Russia got.
Let’s just pretend like Cuba wasn’t a lapdog of the Soviet Union. Or that they didn’t base ICBMs there.
Last time I checked, people are still trying to get away from Cuba in droves and despite the internets best efforts to convince me otherwise, I don’t see a single communist based nation on this planet that’s capable of existing without being 100% dependent on outside western trade.
Instead - the trade embargo continues its six decade-long failure at dislodging the Communist from Cuba, stands as a thorn in the side of general U.S. - Latin American foreign relations, and allows Havana an ever so convenient bogeyman to blame for their own self-inflicted policy failures.
