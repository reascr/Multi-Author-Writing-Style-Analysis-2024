Don't be a fucking idiot. Calling all Republicans "literally Nazis 2.0" says more about your own lack of critical thinking than anything. The only way we as a country can move forward is if we learn to shut up, listen to each other, and have a discussion without it turning into each side throwing insults at each other like monkeys with shit. And that does go for both sides.
So America is a god awful society because of all our violence? Gotcha. Does that include all the death and destruction that we've exported all over the world? We've bombed whole countries, destabilized and overthrown governments, illegally detained and tortured innocent people, supported dictatorships. That's just off the top of my head lol. Maybe you're right, the worst violence is, the worse (it's spelt W-O-R-S-E, btw) the society.
And the worst the society is the worst the violence is. You want to get into it? Where are they beheading and beating people in the street? It sure aint denmark.
Banning guns is a bandaid solution. We need to address the state of the people. A happy and functioning society doesn't have shootings every other day.
