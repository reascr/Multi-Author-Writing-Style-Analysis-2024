I'm not sure where you're getting that idea from... The US openly admits to actively destabilising other countries and regions, it's not the global force for peace it is often portrayed as.
Historians attribute this to the creation of the European Union bringing stability to the contingent that seemed to kick off another global conflict every decade, not to the US.
The US was the biggest guarantor of European security and its likely NATO, not the EU, that most contributed to the long peace that we've had in Europe.
It was the US's presence in Europe to contain the influence of the Soviet Union that lead to the conditions that allowed the EU to form in the first place.
Except that the time between WW2 and the creation of the EU was 40 years which is longer than the gap between WW1 and WW2, so what do you attribute that safety to?
Because having the most peaceful decades in the human history was so bad and having the biggest war in Europe since WWII now is so good, amirite? Who needs that status quo, lol.
