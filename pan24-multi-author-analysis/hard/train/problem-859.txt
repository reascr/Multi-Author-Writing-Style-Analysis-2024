As a Chinese, I really hope that Chinese understand that the US has always been the nicest country to us.
But that’s how the Western system can seem to Chinese people (especially during Trump’s term). Makes it look like someone with zero experience or ability in politics can be put in the most senior political office because of wealth and becoming a beloved celebrity. Whereas a Chinese leader has always had decades of experience in governance.
And, given China's long, long, rule by emperor; it is quite different than the path democracy took in the West.
The term democracy 民主 has been coined in chinese by a westerner that chose that term to translate a book who dealt with forms of governments.
All in all, 民主 has always meant "democracy" in the western sense, and that "rule for the people" narrative has been pushed by the communist party to gaslight its population. Same for the "meritocracy" or "full process democracy" (which is a term used by chinese propaganda): in reality, leaders and officials are chosen through nepotism, and even the lowest echelon officials the people can vote for are chosen by the party.
In China’s mind, their system is plenty democratic - anyone can be a politician, and you work your way up the ranks to the top political jobs much the same way you would as a civil servant, or lawyer/judge, or doctor.
More than once I was told both in academic and business settings that an example of Chinese-style Democracy (Democracy with Chinese characteristics) is that in today's China the workers have the right to talk to the Boss (laoban) about work-related problems.
