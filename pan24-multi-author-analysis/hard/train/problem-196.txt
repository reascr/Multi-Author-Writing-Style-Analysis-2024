I'm sure people who can't see what the US is might think this way. It's not fooling anyone who pays attention though. The narrative that NATO expansion caused an existential risk to Russia who have invaded their neighbour out of necessity is in no way dead. And the US considering Ukraine to be important enough to shell out $60 billion of tax payer money shows where they think their borders of influence are. Pretty hard not to call that US imperialism.
Please understand that I'm not saying Russia are the good guys. I'm saying there are no good guys, and least of all the US. What you are right about is that the points you have raised will all be used in western propaganda to convince us that spending our money on US imperialism is justified.
The US didn't get involved for the first 5 years of WW2, instead choosing to profit from weapons sales. It is difficult though to compare getting involved in a world war, with interfering in a conflict between two neighbouring countries on the opposite side of the world to you.
Maybe the US didn't get involved early on because it started out as a 'conflict between two neighboring countries on the opposite side of the world'. At what point does it become acceptable for the US to intervene in far flung conflicts? When 3 or more countries are involved? When the fascists are on YOUR doorstep?
