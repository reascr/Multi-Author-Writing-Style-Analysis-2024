I think his point is that reducing the complexity of a war to “good guys” versus “bad guys” is a dramatic oversimplification of the facts. You can support whoever you support, but it is never as simple as “good guys” versus “bad guys.” Indeed, your conception of it as such is largely a product of confirmation bias and the type of media you are consuming.
Not to mention you are a fool if you think Ukrainian soldiers would not be committing war crimes left and right if they weren’t worried about losing Western support.
Ukraine are the “good guys” because they are innocent victims acting purely in self defense in this war of aggression and attempted genocide on Russia’s part. Therefore everything Ukraine does in this war is morally justified, and nothing Russia does is with the exception of fucking off and paying reparations for the war.
So your whole premise of belief is literal Russian propaganda that this war started over some attempt to allow Ukraine in nato. That is bullshit and never happened. Ukraine has wanted to join nato since they became an independent country. The west does not want them in nato.
