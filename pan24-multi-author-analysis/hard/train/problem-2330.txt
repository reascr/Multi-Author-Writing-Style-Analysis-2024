Trump has REPEATEDLY sided with Putin against the United States, even/especially when he, Trump, was IN FUCKING CHARGE of the United States. Trump has been screaming from the rooftops his admiration for Putin for a long long time.
It’s fucking insane that we had a President who acted directly and deliberately on behalf of Russia and Putin, but we did. Trump talking about trusting Putin is like the least shocking thing he’s done re: Russia.
It's slightly less shocking than the other 40 times he's said he trusts Russia more than America... and less shocking still than the fact that millions of people can look at this man and think "Yup, he's the one I want to follow".
I'm pretty sure he's been compromised since the 1980s - he visited Russia and came back and published a letter in some news paper trashing NATO and applauding Russia.
He’s been in bed with Russia almost as long as Giuliani, who the Russians helped take out the the American mob back in the 80’s for a little bit of fame and camera time.
and oddly enough, 3 trump executives died in a freak helicopter accident in 1989. What are the odds, right?
