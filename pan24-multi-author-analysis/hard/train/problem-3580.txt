Using the F-22 gun would've been risky. The plane to shot would have had to get close to the balloon. Now a balloon being shot could behave unexpectedly and as it is so big, it could create a problem for a fighter getting too close to it at high altitudes, where the thin air affects the maneuverability of an aircraft.
The Oakland Oceanic Air Traffic Control was reporting sightings of the balloon, with multiple commercial pilots saying theyâ€™d seen it. Reports were that it was flying at an altitude of 40,000 to 50,000 feet.
There are now new reports of a large white balloon spotted about 594 miles northeast of Honolulu, Hawaii.
Plus the US military wanted to recover the balloon in shallow waters where they could get it. A gun would need many shots (1,000+) to bring down a balloon while a missile is an immediate kill so the balloon going down could be in a place you do not want.
Thanks, I am guessing now since the F-22s max ceiling is 50.000 feet (but likely higher probably secret) and the balloon was at 60.000 feet, the pilot would have to be a like a sniper pilot, probably not possible but a missile would guarantee a hit. Plus at that altitude I would not know how it would affect things like bullet drop.
Anybody know why they would use a missile to down the last one and probably this one if Chinese again, instead of just firing a few rounds in it. Because a missile is much more expensive than a few rounds.
