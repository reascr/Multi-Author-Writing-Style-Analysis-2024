But 1. the LNG will come online in the coming weeks 2. Germany also still gets Gas from the other countries in all that time ... so no storages most likely "could not get empty before spring".
Under normal circumstances when gas is still coming in it is enough for forever, because Germany would use the gas that is still coming in.
It means every gas storage tank in Germany is full to the brim. How long that is going to last depends a lot on the weather but from what I've read a full supply is good for about 3-4 months of normal consumption. I would imagine Germany would try and ration that if they though the winter is going to be especially cold.
If I buy gas at 10 dollars and price it at 12 so I can make a profit I'm not selling it for less than 10 unless I have to. Who do you think can wait longer, the guy with the gas in his storage tank or the power plant, factory, or home owner who's choices are: buy the 12 dollar gas or the lights go out/widgets don't get made/heat turns off.
So yea, there really is one price and it's the price the guy with the storage tank says it is and he's not going to lose money. At worse he'll break even.
