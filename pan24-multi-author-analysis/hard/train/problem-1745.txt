I wouldn’t necessarily call this scapegoating. It’s likely that Surovikin has amassed significant personal power as overall commander of Russian forces, including direct access to Putin that bypasses other powerful actors both inside and outside the Russian MoD. If so, that would be a situation intolerable to other members of the Russian military-political elite, in the long term. Gerasimov is a member of this elite. This could be an example of Russia’s corrupt patron-client network cannibalizing its own military’s chain of command. It would be fascinating insight into how Putin’s patron-client network functions.
The Russians may have no choice. Regardless of Gerasimov’s aptitude as a military leader, he likely retains significant influence within Russia itself. Putin is a dictator, but one that relies on patron-client relationships with other powerful figures in the Kremlin to retain power. Gerasimov is one of these figures. Putin may have had little choice but to appoint him to retain the support of elements of the Russian MoD for the war. Not saying this is 100% true, but it is a distinct possibility. I don’t think the failures of Gerasimov as a military leader are lost on any in the Kremlin - but neither is his influence among the Russian political-military elite.
might see him again though -- feels like each of their army leader generals gets multiple turns to be leader because Gerassimov kind of already was leading this war sitting with Shoigu at the other end of that longgggish table from Putin a while back...
