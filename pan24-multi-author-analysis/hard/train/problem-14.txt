Given that recent strains have been exceptionally agressive in birds, and the beginnings of more mammal to mammal transfer, I think we should be spending a lot of money figuring out what industries to eliminate while bird and mammal to human transmission remains at an all time low. Otherwise it seems like it's only a matter of time before we get an unfortunate surprise..
It's not a lot of money to make sure you study properly and eliminate industries that are pointless. We spent trillions on this pandemic. Could have literally ended world hunger for a decade.
They can write that on our mass graves in 20 years when this catches up with us. "They really needed eyelash extensions and mink fur car dangles".
They can also be used for eyelash extension, but it's not the primary use of mink fur. However it produces masses of trash fur, which is good for extensions. They don't have to be attached to the skin, and they don't demand a whole pelt. Broken and otherwise unused pelts are often sold to make extensions.
