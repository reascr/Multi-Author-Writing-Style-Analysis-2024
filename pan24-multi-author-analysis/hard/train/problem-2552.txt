Nobody loves Russia. It's more about mistrust of the west for historical reasons and disdain for what some consider a condescending attitude towards South Asians. Ironically though, the Modi administration in power since 2014 that gets a lot of hate from westerners is actually the most pro-west/US administration India has ever had. They have been slowly reducing the heavy military reliance on Russia over the years and turning to western countries like France and Israel instead. Such decoupling doesn't happen overnight though and is a multi-decade process.
For starters, I see you stating this over and over in multiple comments. . Would appreciate it if you stopped pushing this implied narrative of China having massively bigger trade with India than the US.
Not to mention the fact that many imports from China are critical, whereas India can and wants to move away from US dependence.
The nationalist comments that dislike the West and like Russia are indeed a plurality, if not majority.
They resent and despise us for the actions undertaken by our great grandfathers and beyond (Cold War) and later (War on terror + Pakistan).
