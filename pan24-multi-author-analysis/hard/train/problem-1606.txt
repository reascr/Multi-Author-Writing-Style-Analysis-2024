i think that for now, this is just posturing. China doesn't want to invade Taiwan this year or the next. If they ever feel like they have the clear military advantage (say in 5 years) then yeah it could happen. But i doubt they want to get in a stupid situation like Russia.
That is very possible tbh. Behind the scenes maybe China is like "hey we're gonna keep pretending we are threatening you, but no worries, its politics".
you're reading that hella wrong, unless you're suggesting nobody should interfere and let China/Taiwan sort it out cuz that's what it sounds like you're suggesting.
He's saying ignore China's continued crying, because if they actually tried anything they'd find out how hard it is to invade Taiwan and they'd have a bunch of allies ready to help.
Lol yeah it's not like the US has a huge 800 billion dollar military with an incredible presence and strategic stronghold in SEA. Lol we don't even have a need to trade with them it's not like we nearly rely on them for a few things.
