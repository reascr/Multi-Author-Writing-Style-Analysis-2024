RNC donors who contributed between $50 and $100, received autographed copies of the book “Liberal Privilege.".
They all do this. It’s like money laundering. They funnel campaign money to themselves by buying up all the copies of their shitty books then give them away at campaign events.
Or do you mean that by having a PAC buy the book that it is skirting campaign finance laws? The article addresses that, and that isn't laundering.
Obviously, there's money moving all over this, so it could be used for laundering. I just don't know why that's the assumption. Seems pointlessly high risk.
Edit: I guess the idea is that this is self-dealing. A way to get "campaign" donations into his pocket. That's not really money laundering. And it doesn't appear to even be illegal since he isn't a candidate, although I'm not sure I follow why the law is like that.
Seems like it just a straight forward way to make money: write a book for a particular group of people (right-wing wackos in this case), and boost visibility by doing shady stuff like buying your own books. Profit.
