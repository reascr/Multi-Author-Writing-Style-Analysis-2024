Please identify a communist “state” in the first place. Because as far as I’m aware, even the ones you assume to be communist all relied on the accumulation of capital at the end of the day.
I suppose we should just take the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at face value because they appeal to democracy in their name. Is democracy now illegitimate because they’re a leading example of what democracy is?
There are multiple examples of democracies around the world, some are doing okay, some not so much. Others don't know how good they have it while others can't stop making deals with the devil and repeating the mistakes of the past.
Honestly every system is idealistic to some degree. The issue with basically all systems is human corruption. Corruption through greed, corruption through religion, corruption through favoritism, the list goes on and on.
Which why a system that concentrates all power in one central authority always descends into corruption. Balance between many different sources of power is what works.
