Democracy is obviously better than dictatorship, but sometimes it can be really tiring to see policy just shift on a dime for no other reason except that a different political party got voted into power. For a while South Korea and North Korea really seemed like they were making actual progress, but then the government changed and now it's back to saber rattling.
North Korea knows better to start a war, to be honest it should be fair game for South Korea to shoot down anything that threatens them. North Koreans retaliate with anything they've not just South Korea to worry but the US itching to remove a thorn on the worlds ass for so long.
Right now a decapitation strike would be better than live to regret what much worst shit they'll pull with nukes as their bargaining chip.
The moment you let them build their own nuclear arsenal then they'll have way too much leverage. Especially with their dumbass regime they'll be asking for the most stupidest concessions just so they won't fire a nuke.
