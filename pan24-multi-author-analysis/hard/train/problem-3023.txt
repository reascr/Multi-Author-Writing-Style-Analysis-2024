lol She isn't a fucking linguist she should keep her mouth shut. Linguists consider a language endangered once it reaches less than 20,000 speakers, and only if few of the next generation are learning to speak it. They eventually get to Critically Endangered (less than 5,000 speakers) then Moribound (only those who learn the language as non-natives are fluent, with no native speakers alive) then Extinct or Dead (no one learns the language to fluency, no one uses it for any daily reason, and there are no native speakers left alive). Afrikaans has 8.4 million speakers. 8.4 Million speakers is far from "dying", and if I'm not mistaken, much better than a lot of languages.
In a country with such a diverse population, I'm sure it is very common for people to speak two or more languages.
There are plenty of people who speak the same language who grow in different cultures and have different experiences. A native Spanish speaker in Argentina experiences a vastly different culture than a Mexican or a Spaniard.
Yeah, I get what you're saying, I just don't think that the different language has much (if anything) to do with it.
Why does something have to be in a different language to offer a "unique cultural perspective"? Again, if anything, having to navigate a foreign language reduces the ability of people to gain unique cultural perspectives rather than increasing it.
I'm saying that speaking a different language and growing up in a different culture gives an individual a unique perspective on various aspects of life, which in turn leads to a more diverse and creative world.
