However, based on what we've been told, there were three separate batches so far. People contorting themselves to say otherwise or lying about the document counts is looking kind of weird and partisan, as even if you were right it wouldn't change much.
1. Old office at his Biden-Penn think tank where they were found when the office was being repurposed for someone else to use.
What's weird here is it doesn't help the story, and the more you know about classified documents the worse it is. That these things were mixed in with other documents is craziness, they're generally checked out and accounted for go from place A to place B and kept in specific types of boxes otherwise.
Which pretty much indicate that they were just boxes packed by his aides and put there as storage without realizing it had a few "classified" documents. Republicans are really gonna be disappointed by the special counsel result i feel like.
1- Biden lawyers didnt have classified clearance of any kind and its better to let the DOJ handle it than risking messing with evidence.
He did have “improper” possession of sensitive classified documents , he also has done the proper thing and let the justice department do their job.
Where Trump lied and tried to impede law-enforcement from being able to gather all the classified documents to secure them properly.
The issue with Trump was never the classified documents themselves. It was the lying, impeding the investigation, and the fact that these classified documents for in an area where known foreign spies and nationals have been.
