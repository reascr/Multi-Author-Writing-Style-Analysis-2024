Quickest way this ends is with Putin being removed or Russia collapsing. Which might happen. But also might not and if not, it’ll be a grind until Russia is pushed out.
Probably not, but Russia can’t keep this up forever. Their financial and Human Resources are being expended. Ukraine is obviously suffering but as long as NATO countries continue to provide aid, Ukraine can keep it up however long is needed.
Ukraine and the country that send the equipment like the US in this situation usually send crews either in Ukraine or somewhere in the EU to meet with their counterpart. All the training happens right then and there in the use and maintenance of that gear. Then, the ukraine crews go back and use what they learned to teach more Ukrainian crews. I'm sure they get to have some kind of visual instructions that they get to keep in video form on top of actual manuals for maintenance.
Modern military equipment like this is usually designed to be simple to learn, operate and maintain anyway so its not a huge task for anyone that is semi intelligent and has the spare parts needed. I'd say that it should take less than a few day for the initial training and maybe no more than 1 or 2 weeks to spread that knowledge along all the relevant Ukrainian crews but this is the kind of information that isn't really publicly accessible.
