NY acually has a bipartisan redistricting commission. The problem this year was that the Republicans on this commission refused to approve any maps. So Dems in the legislature got tired of waiting and decided to draw their own. These were shot down by the court because the maps have to be bipartisan. Dems then also decided to give up since R's weren't cooperating so the court drew their own maps, in quite a hurry. This created maps that were mostly "fair", aka competitive, but ended up splitting communities in odd ways because they were drawn up so quickly.
Other way around. Cheney has no allies, pretty much every Trump impeachment Republican lost or resigned baring one (who is in a close race). McCarthy is part of the MAGA side but there is an even more ultra-MAGA side who hates him and would prefer someone like Jim Jorden or Greene. There are about 40 of them as per the last Congress.
A majority of those 11 will actually go to Democrats, it just depends how many. Most predictions have at least 7. That means Dems will have 216 seats to 219 for Republicans. There is a 25% chance that Dems win 9 and clinch the majority.
Right now, the betting markets give 55% chance of McCarthy winning, 22% Pelosi... And thats it. The other 23% is Cheney.
