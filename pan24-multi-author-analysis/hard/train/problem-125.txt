Yeah. Also I don’t think that disposing of a properly working car to manufacture a new EV has such a great impact on the environment... Especially since Poland’s electricity is 83% fossil fuel….
But in the end, people with functional cars will be forced to buy new cars, so theres a forced demand for car manufacturing, which is not good for the environment I guess?
Isn't part of the issue that older cars were made when fuel emissions standards were more lax than today (and presumably cars today are made with more lax standards than the future)? Being well maintained or not doesn't change that.
This wouldn't be forcing a change all at once. It starts with petrol vehicles over 27 years old. I don't know what percent of vehicles are over 27 years old in Poland, but I can't imagine it's a lot.
The US did something similar around the same time. It was partly for environmental reasons and partly economic due to the recession. I know here it initially looked like a massive success, but ended up actually being a disastet.
