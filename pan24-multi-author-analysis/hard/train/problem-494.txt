If the Russian soldiers (or their wives back in Russia) hear this, it could keep the already low morale of the Russian solders low….
This is Ukraine pushing against the Russian narrative. They are saying that the coalition of countries helping Ukraine is giving them everything they need—and, everything Russia doesn’t have: ammo, new tanks, long range weapons, winter uniforms, armor plates, Javelins, planes, etc.
Also, it is controlling the narrative against Russia. Russia has been telling Ukrainians that their armed forces are surrounded in Bakhmut and that soldiers are surrendering. It’s not true—but, Russians are trying to break the feeling the Ukraine will inevitably win this war.
I'm sure to the Russians it's great propaganda because they see Ukraine as a NATO puppet. Meanwhile in Ukraine they say "We will suffer all the real hardship and loss of life in this war as long as NATO keeps helping us to reclaim our freedom.".
While true that we need to care about what Russia considers escalation a little bit, it's important to both distinguish between escalation and anger (a lot of things the West does merely angers Putin) and to think about what escalation really is in practical terms rather than a more nebulous "bad thing." addressing this topic in depth.
