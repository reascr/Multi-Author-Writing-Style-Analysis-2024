It is hard enough to get people to care about evolutionary biology without having to constantly explain why one of the most important timing proteins is called sonic hedgehog.
It was 1st discovered in fruit flies when a particular group of them was developing spikes all over their body. It was being passed on in a way that suggested it was a mutation of a single gene, so that gene was labeled the hedgehog gene.
It was just the 1st gene in the hedgehog family to be named after they ran out of names of species of hedgehogs.
In all honesty, that is actually a pretty good statement. It makes it clear that this is an invention primarily to simulate the vagina's environment for the purpose of studying it and products that interact with it, and I can actually see how that is a thing worth having.
“Scientists replicate the cellular environment seen inside the vagina on a small device” is more accurate but less clickbait.
From what I read, it’s a simulated vagina for experimentation for women’s health. Because animal testing maybe actuate, having something more similar to the human body makes better results?
