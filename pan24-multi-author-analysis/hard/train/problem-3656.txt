Do you have a source for these statistics? I'm not saying you're wrong, I've just never seen anything that supports that claim. I imagine it would heavily depend on distance to the intruder, what weapons the intruder has, and how proficient you are with your weapon.
It's is unrealistic to think that robberies can not end in the murder of the victim. You're right most home break-ins happen between 10am and 3pm. Just so happens a lot of people are home at that time. Even more so now that work from home is more widespread. Stay at home parents are at home during those times with their children as well. It is a very real possibility an armed person comes forcibly into your home with the intention of doing you harm. Less than 1% of gun homicides involve innocent bystanders, so you're argument of accidentally shooting family members is invalid.
What happens when you exclude the 1% of the population who are accountable for 80% of gun crimes is that clearer and more relevant statistics emerge. Why include people who are constantly in and out of the criminal justice system. To include them is cherry-picking for an agenda.
