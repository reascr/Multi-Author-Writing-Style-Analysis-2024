Nixon was consulted by every subsequent president because he was a foreign policy genius and was still a patriot- Trump is a narcissist only looking out for 1, at best.
Nixon was a crooked politician, but he was smart and knew how to manage the presidency, and of course he knew when to resign. Trump takes all of Nixonâ€™s bad qualities with none of his few good ones.
Nixon also had a few good policies (ending Vietnam, OSHA act, forced desegregation) whereas Trump was just a stream of steaming bullshit.
Because it is a fact the Nixon admin ended the war as he was the commander in chief as that's how America works.
But I also think Nixon had an agenda besides himself. Sure, he wanted to be great and was driven and probably narcissistic. But he did stuff, and did compromise at times. Trump would never do that.
Maybe. But we had lots of cults back then without the benefit of internet social media. Nasty ones. And some even earlier, based on radio. Demagogues too, like Father Coughlan, the Radio Priest. He started as a sorta lefty support of social justice, nationalization and the New Deal, then begin with anti Semitic propaganda and pro Nazi propaganda as the Nazis rose to power. Sound familiar? .
I said not because I like the guy; in fact I hated him. But it shows just how far off in right field the USA has swung since his time, and that goes a long way to explaining why a turd like Trump floated to the top of the bowl and won't flush down.
