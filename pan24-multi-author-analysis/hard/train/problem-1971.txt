EDIT: and to clarify, I interpret "declare war" to mean that we do more to ACTIVELY defend Ukraine as opposed to the "passive" support of equipment & intel. By no stretch of the imagination was I thinking we would be invading Russia or anything like that.
(Especially since Russia has already signaled that would be viewed as ur declaring war on them, etc.).
Yeah. But Putin is willing to push a little, see how other countries react and then go based on that. That is kind of why supporting Ukraine is important for nato because letting Putin take Ukraine without any resistance would make it more likely that he thinks that he can see how nato reacts if a nato country is attacked. Kind of how appeasement pre WW2 only lead to hitler finding excuse to attack even more countries.
More pushback will probably come from other major nato countries as long as Russia got nukes. No country willingly wants to fight a country with large amount of nukes.
Nobody wants to go to war fucko. Why is Russia so afraid of everybody? Do they think if they don't inflate their chest and make the most threats that other countries are waiting to pounce?
I doubt their arsenal will be useful if the UN doesn't want it to be. May even be a case of decay and poor maintenance that renders if useless. Anyway, stuff a sock in it Putin, you got nothin'.
