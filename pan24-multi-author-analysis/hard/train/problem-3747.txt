Why would the US announce it? Upgrades that affect one country's strategic capabilities are a matter of national security. There's really no need to classify this kind of intelligence.
All of the things I mentioned, the militarizing, the technology, etc. - it's all starting from way behind the US. And they're designed to threaten the US as the US exists today, but of course the US will adapt its defenses. And this is part of that: recognizing what China can/wants to do, then finding new ways to counter it.
I'm not saying that this makes China a threat, but that making it public is an attempt to make them appear more threatening.
There's also the possibility that China changes its course. This is Xi's course, but Xi won't be there in 10 years.
And your last question: war. China is prepping for war with the US. They're militarizing faster than any nation in history, they're building weapons systems with the sole purpose of hitting US ships, carriers, and planes, and they believe we are on a collision course for war.
