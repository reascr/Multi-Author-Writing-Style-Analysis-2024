I am pretty sure these are just the Ukrainian MOD numbers. They are probably a bit inflated considering the source, but they also don't really define what "losses" means in terms of troops. Is that dead, or dead and wounded? Similarly, counts will vary wildly depending whether you count Wagner and DPR/LPR soldiers.
I mean Russian numbers are just a joke. It's not even in the realm of reality. But if the UA MOD number of 140k is dead, I'd say that's probably a bit high tbh. I do agree I think US/UK numbers seem the most reasonable.
This is on purpose. And lets just be real, it's a not a legitimate offer. It's an attempt to portray this as a war between the US/West/NATO and Russia rather than between Ukraine and Russia. It frames Ukraine as just some middle man being used by the west to fight Russia, which is their narrative. So their exclusion of Zelenksy and Ukraine is not an accident and it also is something they'll pump into the state media non-stop - that the US is refusing to end the war, a war Russia didn't even want and was forced into.
They are just immune to the idea that "IT ISN'T THE US's DECISION" Like i really believe they are so caught up in their own reality of dictatorship and puppet rulers , that Putin and Co. can't actually understand Ukraine wanting to choose it's own path.
Russia and "allies" whole narrative is that Ukraine isn't a real country and as such can't have any agency in anything. Which is why they're always trying to call for negotiations with the U.S or NATO or the EU, because then that confirms to their true believers that they're actually fighting all of NATO... instead of losing to one of the poorest countries in Europe using NATO's hand-me-downs.
