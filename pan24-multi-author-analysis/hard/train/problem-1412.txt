State Police could still arrest you in a city that decriminalized marijuana. And yes a Fed could as well but the likelihood is far smaller especially given current guidance.
I'm all for legalizing recreational marijuana and it's legal in my state but I imagine having city laws that run in direct opposition to state law could create some major challenges.
Texas will unfortunately be one of the last states to legalize or make any meaningful progress on cannabis due to their part time legislature, recently enacted voter restriction laws that are clearly targeted at populations that tend to vote democrat, and their lack of a state-wide voter initiative/referendum process. The latter point is really the key to meaningful progress on this issue in majority Republican states.
I’ve read lawmakers in some majority Republican states are actively trying to change existing voter initiative/referendum laws in to give lawmakers veto power if they don’t like what the voters decide. Once upon a time my family considered a move to Texas to be closer to extended family but over the last 10 years or so I’ve become so much more grateful to live in Washinon State that I could never move to Texas or another state that doesn’t have the voter I&R process.
