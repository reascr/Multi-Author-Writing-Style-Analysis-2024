A story I may not have exactly right but they were showing him NASA and after that they took him to a Randall's grocery store in Clear Lake. The Russians thought it was a set because they couldn't understand the abundance. But Gorbachev says "we have lost the Cold War.".
Yes. It's about wrongheaded ideas about escalation. It doesn't even make any sense, its not like Bradleys can shoot missiles all the way to Moscow. If Western leaders are serious about Ukraine taking back all of its occupied territory from Russia, then Ukraine needs a huge increase in armored and mechanized forces.
Giving the Ukrainians a random selection of tanks would make logistics way harder, plus probably concerns with sending their latest stuff to Ukraine for security reasons.
Because the US and most NATO countries donâ€™t have 30+ year old Soviet tanks laying around, and training the Ukrainians on the Abrams tanks would be too expensive/take too long.
Ukraine already has experience with anti-tank TOW missiles and TOW missiles on Bradleys destroyed more Soviet-made Iraqi tanks than did Abrams tanks did.
That still wouldn't explain why no Western/NATO IFVs have not sent to Ukraine in the 10 months since the war begun, since they are lighter and uses less fuel than the Abrams tank, which are your main gripes. In fact the government of Germany failed to authorize the sale of Marder IFVs to Ukraine.
