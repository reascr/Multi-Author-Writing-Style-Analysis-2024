And in our capitalist system, the return is too long and too little to compete with other investments. So private capital seeking return doesn't seek to educate, it seeks a quick return speculating or maybe innovation if it can get Uncle Sam to throw it enough bones to make it a sure thing.
So, looks like the solution is to accept your new normal or accept that “a well regulated militia” isn’t one where 1st graders are shooting people.
So gun laws can't be changed but having more teachers would help the situation since you can't guns out of bad hands anymore.
Or, are we talking about the problem where kids get access to guns and shoot their classmates, and teachers? Where Christian fundamentalists shoot up concerts, and nightclubs? Where an 18 year, mentally unstable kid can go buy a military style weapon and shoot someone later that day. That's not a non-sequitur for you?
It has nothing to do with the teacher(s). You think classroom size has a correlation to school shootings? And, what is your data set to support this theory? And, nothing about guns? It's not a classroom size problem, although we do need more resources for teachers.
You're blaming the school system, and classroom size? And, avoid the entire situation that a 6 year old had access to a firearm. That is just something that doesn't even register?
