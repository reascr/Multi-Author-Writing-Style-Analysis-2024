So what country is it going to be to help them out? Probably the US, Canada, or even France I'm guessing.
Haiti has been out of control for quite awhile now "decades," but recently it's worse than just uncontrollable pure madness and chaos.
Currently, Haiti is anarchy. The country isn't run by anybody, but the groups with the strongest power are violent gangs. The country is suffering from cholera outbreaks. There is rampant poverty and loss of life.
Haiti is in this position primarily because of its history as a colony of France. They had a slave revolt, and defeated France for their independence, but the peace deal required them to pay crippling reparations to France. This set them up for failure. There have been numerous periods of intervention since then by the United States and other countries. This has been helpful for short periods of time, but the long term result has been undeniably bad for Haiti.
3. Diplomatic communications between the Haitian government (which is effectively non existent at this point) and the American government.
At this point, they aren't going to fix this situation without outside intervention. Based on historical precedence, it's hard to argue that foreign intervention would have a long term positive benefit. It would help in the short term though, and it might give Haiti a chance to form a legitimate government. That is Haiti's only chance at stability.
Silly question but what is the solution for Haiti ? How many times we going go back there? Can the US military run the government for x amount of time before we turn it over ?
