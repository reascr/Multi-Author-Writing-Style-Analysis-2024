Bro. It’s 2022. Taylor Swift’s first album came out 14 years ago. Her presale mainly affected people of all genders and races in their 20s and 30s. Nobody cares about teenagers because they’re not a voting block. Swifties are.
I’m suggesting that she has a lot of fans of voting age and that’s why she matters. Why you’ve chosen to fixate on teenaged white girls when that describes a fraction of her fanbase today is beyond me.
Because it’s effecting white teenage girls, it sure didn’t matter in the 90’s when Pearl Jam tried to take them on because it mainly effected white guys.
“Mainly effected white guys” are you arguing that most fans of Pearl Jam were female, or did you just ignore the part that would make your comment irrelevant?
I don’t understand why you’re getting so defensive, I know older people like her music too, my gf is a fan and she’s 50 years old. But those of us that have kids that are teenagers are fans also and they would love to see Taylor Swift just as much as everyone else. Stop acting like I’m attacking you.
