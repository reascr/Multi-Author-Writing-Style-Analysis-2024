So you're lecturing about helmet wearing and you don't even cycle? I ride 1000s of km a year on my road bike as well as commuting. Was recently hit by a car, helmet saved my life quite likely. I still think helmet laws are stupid and people should make their own decisions.
Btw, I also think the law is stupid. Less because I think adults should make their own decisions, and more because like usual there is absolutely no backbone to it so nothing will change, therefore thereâ€™s no point to it. Except another thing to stop foreigners for, as someone else pointed out.
Okay. Some things to note. First off, the article argues a general decline in biking among children, but children up to middle school here already have to wear school-issued helmets when they bike to to school, and elementary school students are not allowed to bike to school at all. They walk. This law isn't going to affect younger children, because they are not the target for it.
HS on isn't required education in Japan therefore the students can choose to continue on or not, and they can choose their school and how they get there.
