The Bill previously passed the House and the governor has already said he will sign it. The bill bans gender affirming care in the state for anyone under 18.
It really is. Back when North Carolina tried to pass their bathroom ban, there was a much bigger coordinated outcry especially from corporations. But the attack on trans rights is so constant and widespread now that we're seeing more restrictive bans pass every few weeks now with no major resistance from business groups. And unfortunately you only need to succeed once to strip away someone's rights while you need at 100% success rate just to maintain the status quo.
Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, & South Dakota all banned gender affirming care for minors through the legislature. Florida did it through the medical board. Texas de facto did it by classifying affirming a trans child as child abuse and sending CPS after parents. Missouri, Oklahoma, and Montana are all likely to pass their own bans soon as well.
Most of these bans are only a few months old and more are coming. We're in a pivotal moment in US history where trans people are being actively stripped of their pre-existing rights.
Trans movement is a gift to the current social and political order. Itâ€™s important that it be furthered and funded.
The more social division you bring, the faster society will collapse. Please keep pushing your agenda, it is most welcome, most beneficial.
The trans community, the race baiters, as well as the feminists, the radical right, the kleptocracy on Wall Street, the neo feudal politicians, the pacifists, please keep going.
