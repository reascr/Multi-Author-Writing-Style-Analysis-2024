They are already dying en masse because NATO is giving them the weapons to prolong the meatgrinder so the US can sell Europe expensive LNG. That is why the pipeline had to explode. What does winning even mean? Ukraine will be a shell of its former self for decades.
I am sad for the people of Ukraine. But there would have been less death and destruction if the US stayed out of it. They are being used as cannon fodder for finacial and political gain.
Like all wars this one is about money and corporate interest. Russia is defending the wolves of NATO at their doorstep. The US is seeking to corner a market. At the expense of Ukraine and Russia.
This is now America's war against Russia using Ukraine as a proxy. Notice one thing that wasn't talked about yesterday? Peace. No one said peace. It's all war. This could go on for years. Bleed trillions from both America and Russia, and leave Ukraine in ruins.
The only Peace is Russia fucking off back to Russia entirely, likely out of crimea too, or getting crushed utterly.
