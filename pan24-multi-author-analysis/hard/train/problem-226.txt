That Republicans would stoop that low to getting Biden caught doing something Trump was caught doing, I would sadly not be surprised.
After the GOP planted the evidence how did they get the democrats to go find exactly where they are, do you think the GOP knew Biden’s lawyers would be going through his office closet and garage? Does that seem to make sense?
I believe I read some were top secret, and of course now theres been some found in Biden’s home. So that increases the number and has to make one question where else may he have some.
But then you open up the argument that some of the FBI still have an “insurance policy” against Trump and he stated the documents at his house were planted too…..so if you believe secret service loyalists set up Biden then at least some credibility is granted to Trumps claim that FBI loyalists set up Trump. Since it’s no longer out of the question that the government could do such a thing.
He’s not getting busted for 1-6 either. He wasn’t at the Capitol and there’s no evidence he wanted people to attack the Capitol.
