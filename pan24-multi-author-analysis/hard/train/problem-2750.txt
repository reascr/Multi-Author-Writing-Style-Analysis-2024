But this doesn't get covered that way in the corporate media, because untold death and suffering and robbery are just fine so long as the ruling class is profiting.
Not only does corporate media ignore social murder they normalize it. They knew very well that public insurance would save lives but they let Biden pretend it was too expensive to expand in the debates (despite being untrue in every other country that has it).
If the Dem establishment referred to Bernie as a moderate socialist and Biden as a radical corporatist I think we would see different outcomes.
These are all things you should be telling Bernie Sanders when you ask him why he never called himself a moderate instead of asking everyone else why they never called him a moderate.
Has Bernie ever referred to himself as a moderate socialist or a moderate of any kind? Why would anyone portray Bernie as more moderate than he portrays himself? You're right that Bernie's identity as a socialist hurt him severely, but that came from Bernie and he was stubbornly determined to fix the "socialist" label in the middle of a presidential campaign instead of just picking a different word.
