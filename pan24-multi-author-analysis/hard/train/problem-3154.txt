And families forced to lose their wife/mother due to pregnancy complications with doctors not legally able to provide appropriate care. This is as much a health issue as a reproductive rights issue. Republicans have relegated all women of child-bearing age to a lesser standard of care. Thank you to all that voted and continue to vote to protect women’s (and family’s) health and reproductive rights!
I hope those abortion rights voters will continue to show up in every election; it’s our only way to defeat the Republicans and bring back Roe v Wade someday as a Constitutional amendment.
And yet in those red states, there were people (probably women) that voted for reproductive rights but then turned around and voted for the men (and women) that put their rights in jeopardy in the first place. Unless it directly affects a Republican, they don't care.
I really wish we would just make "state rights" be about letting the popular vote decide legislative shit. Marijuana is a state issue, let people in the state vote for it. Women's health is a state issue, let the people in the state vote for it. I'm tired of gerrymandered assholes in my state decide for things that the majority of people don't want regardless of party. I just want Texas to do what other governors are letting their states vote on. But then Texas would have to admit the only reason they win is that our low voter turnout, especially in cities and among young people, are the only thing keeping reds in charge. Let's see if people care if you actually let us vote for something that affects us.
Not as easy as you think since lots and lots of states have Republicans in power that KNOW that any meaningful ballot question will drive voter turnout and hurt them.
That's what's so confusing, like if you don't like what your politician is voting for or is not voting for in Republicans case, Why keep voting for them?
