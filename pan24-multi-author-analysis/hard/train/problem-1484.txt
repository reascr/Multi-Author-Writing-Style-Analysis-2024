Obviously this is just some quick maths and oversimplifying the situation but generally speaking, if it's for a country or a private person, investing money and putting the profits to work instead of just spending the money itself is not such a bad idea after all.
Investing a large sum of money and putting the profits to work can go a looong way and personally i have a feeling that Ukraine will still be feeling the effects of the war 10 years down the line (rebuilding stuff, clearing mines, ect.).
I mean. It's also weird for balance sheets. Give me 300 billion of someone else's money. I promise to give them all of the returns.
If the EU invests it. They will without a doubt take fees from the money under the guise of needing to pay people to invest it. That $330 billion in money will net some bankers some nice fees and some nice bonus checks. All while locking the money up for years and trickling it into Ukraine.
This is weird to me. Why invest and give profits? This seems like a really round about way to essentially take the money for your own use.
