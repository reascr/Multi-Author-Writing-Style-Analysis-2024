Lukashenko is barely holding on to power and needed Russia to bail him out after the last election. The only thing keeping him in power is this army, and Russia's, which indirectly mean that he's beholden to them because there's nowhere else to turn to except for Russia. Compare that to Putin who has many PMC groups and militarized police forces that can be used to ensure that no one military faction can get strong enough to threaten him.
Russia has a sizeable presence in Belarus right now, probably for this exact reason and also to train Russian conscripts. Any protest at this point would get put down hard by Russia and they would probably end up conscripting the protestors.
Belarus has an army that hasn't fought anyone or really upgraded anything since the cold war, if even then. They have like 50k troops who've never seen a day in combat and a bunch of old Soviet shit that probably barely works because they've given all the good stuff to Russia.
It might not be good, they could be simply moving them so the Russians can invade and the Belarus troops will not be targeted by the Ukrainians when it happens.
My comedy brain wants Belarus to 'invade' Ukraine, then as the troops cross paths, about face and lead Ukraine to invade Russia.
I'm guessing this is to make room for Russian troops to invade from Belarus. Putin and Luka know they aren't gonna be able to committ Belarus troops into this conflict.
