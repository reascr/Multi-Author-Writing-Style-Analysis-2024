My Dad was watching so I caught a little from the kitchen. Trump promised the crowd that Biden would be held accountable/prosecuted when heâ€™s back in office.
Why does that sound familiar? Oh yeah, he ran on the same promise in 2016 regarding Hilary. Is she in jail? Prison? Prosecuted by the court of law? Hmmâ€¦.
Like... Yeah no shit. You mean to tell me you get a sense of happy excitement on Sunday nights? They're called the Sunday Scaries because no one wants Monday to come. Ain't nobody got the Sunday Jollies.
Idiot opened up talking trash about unions. Like dude, if you franchisees had a union? You'd be sitting pretty right now, and the top rungs of your corporate ladder would only have 6 homes instead of 10.
I gave some poor fuck a wake up call recently. He was in my bar sulking about not being able to find any employees for $16.50. And that he couldn't pay more.
To me it felt like messaging from a corporate takeover. Like "if we find out you're not enjoying working here, you can work somewhere else ðŸ˜ƒ".
