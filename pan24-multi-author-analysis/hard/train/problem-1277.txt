Doing great back in India though I still haven't gotten used to the honking and general chalet\_hai/jugaad attitude.
3. (If I may go on my soapbox) India intrinsically doesn't believe in a universal arc of justice/universal rights granted to all humans. Everything is relative/negotiable/fate. This causes Indians to disengage from politics because "what's the point? Everyone's on the take." This means there is no market for polarizing narratives to develop because the minute you point out hypocrisy or an abuse of power, the response is "what's the point? Everyone's on the take.".
Idk. When I was young I was always told/thought everyone wanted to move to the US. But when I lived in Cambodia in 2012 nobody wanted to move to America, they all wanted to move to Singapore. I suspect it might have always been a bit of American exceptionalism in America to think that, at least since the 2000s and the Bush Era. But who knows, I could be wrong.
I read your comment and you're still wrong. The wealthy are renouncing US citizenship less in recent years. There's not great incentive for them to renounce. Most decent places to live are more strict with extreme wealth. They can get away with more in the US. And nobody wants to live in Kitts and Nevis or wherever buy-a-citizenship island country the wealthy had invested in, in small numbers in the past.
