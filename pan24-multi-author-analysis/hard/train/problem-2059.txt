"Threatening the government officials of the United States is a felony under federal law. Threatening the president of the United States is a felony under 18 U.S.C. § 871, punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment, that is investigated by the United States Secret Service.[1] Threatening other officials is a Class D or C felony, usually carrying maximum penalties of 5 or 10 years under 18 U.S.C. § 875, 18 U.S.C. § 876 and other statutes, that is investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When national boundaries are transcended by such a threat, it is considered a terrorist threat.[2].
When a threat is made against a judge, it can be considered obstruction of justice.[3] Threatening federal officials' family members is also a federal crime; in enacting the law, the Committee on the Judiciary stated that "Clearly it is a proper Federal function to respond to terrorists and other criminals who seek to influence the making of Federal policies and interfere with the administration of justice by attacking close relatives of those entrusted with these tasks."[4]".
Oh look, another right-wing emotional nut job making terroristic threats to a Democrat after listening to another right-wing nut job's comments.
They have been egged on by Republican representatives, where dehumanizing Democrats, calling them baby killers and evil, etc., has become the norm, and done in the hopes a crazy person will threaten or actually act on their threats. I truly believe Republicans hope that their Democratic counterparts get killed or harmed in some way. Shoot, just look at Pelosi and the things said and done by Trump and Republicans that lead up to him being attacked. Then, look at how many Republicans publicly made jokes about it.
Or the fact that this kind of vitriol will only get worse now that the republicans have the majority again. There’s no accountability or recourse for lies in politics, so there’s no reason to ever stop!
