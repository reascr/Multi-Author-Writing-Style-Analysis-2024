I dont think the West wants to pull India Away from Russia. First, the West needs a democratic India, an alignment of Values.
Second, a democratic, non-aligned India Could offer a model to Russia. The Russia- China alliance should not Last beyond the personal.
Finally, economic cooperation with India and with the central Asian countries Could support the Russian economy in the future and give Russia Access to warm Water ports at the Indisn ocean.
Maybe Western governments see Russia as not being a threat anymore in the future and want to lay the groundwork for good relations with India now for a future Cold War with China.
I mean, I get why India has been so neutral; their military worked closely with Russia's, the west has previously favored Pakistan, and India can use ties with Russia for leverage to keep relative peace with China. All of this excludes the obvious reasons India doesn't get along with former European colonizers. Its a shame they didn't make a stand from a point of fundamentally opposing all imperialism, but I can see their reasoning.
