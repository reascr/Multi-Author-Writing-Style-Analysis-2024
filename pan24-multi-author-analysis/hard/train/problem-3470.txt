This generally doesn't happen if he takes strong red stances like DeSantis or Abbott. I think there was a Republican governor of Massachusetts. Indeed, the new governor of Maryland is a Democrat, one again.
He’s a Republican governor and I believe Maryland is blue state. I can’t say that he was a critic in the beginning but he was an early critic.
It’s almost like claiming The Civil War was about states rights. Especially when this specific claim never occurred to them until decades after the Civil War.
‘It’s just amazing how many Trump supporters have adopted this rewrite of history as well. But then again I had a right wing nut refer me to an article on Breitbart once to prove how much he wasn’t a racist and it was an article about their replacement theory.
Regardless he’s not the kind of Republican that stands a chance in hell in todays Republican Party especially outside of a blue state.
Hogan is what you would hope for in a republican politician he advocates for positions because he believes they are best for the state, not out of hate or shock value. I haven't agreed with everything he's done as our gov, but at least generally, you get the feeling he's earnest about what he's trying to do.
He of course wasn't perfect, and I still think he isn't someone I'd vote for ever given that during his whole tenure he was kept in check by a democratic state super majority. His covid response was flawed in that he let the counties decide on their own for mandates which led to a lot of confusion within the state. At every chance he had he vetoed legislation that would help Baltimore, the African American community, the red line for the metro, etc. Additionally, while he never voted for Trump he couldn't bring himself to vote for Hilary or Biden, instead choosing to vote for Reagan.
