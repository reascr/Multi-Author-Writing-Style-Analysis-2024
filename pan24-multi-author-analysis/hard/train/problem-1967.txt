4 hours after your comment, Fox News has almost completely removed the story from their front page. You have to scroll down about 10 times before there is any headline related to the Jan 6th Committee. It looks like Fox is trying to bury the story by publishing a ton of light weight articles.
This is a great example for why Republicans live in their own world. The article you can find from the front page is calling this political theater. So even looking for the info, you are service partisan crap defending Trump.
Just a friendly reminder to all the lowlifes defending Trump that he named his attempt to steal the election after __Mein Kampf__.
"All this was inspired by the principle – which is quite true within itself – that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.
“The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!” he wrote.
"The lie is so big that it reorders the world. And so part of telling the big lie is that you immediately say it's the other side that tells the big lie. Sadly, but it's just a matter of record, all of that is in Mein Kampf.".
Yes. If something actually comes of this, we really need to look into every single person who enabled him. Do not let Trump be the scapegoat here. He committed these crimes, yes, but he wasn't alone.
