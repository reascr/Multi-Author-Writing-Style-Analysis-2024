this is very true! I have an ex from Tunisia who talked about this a lot. The population there (especially in the cities) are quite European in mentality and lifestyle but the govt and external pressures hold rhe country hostage.
mmmm it's not bad for me to be lgbt because i'm a foreigner so i have less social pressures, so I have some priveleges (anonymity, not an arab) but i've also lived in Lebanon and Jordan where there are very active LGBT scenes. I would compare it to my life in Indiana where people gossip and disapprove and it's possible your family will disown you depending on how religious they are.
you made the most intelligent comment in this entire thread so succinctly! i'm gay and i live and work in Yemen. my national colleagues talk a√±l the time about how the Saudis are pushing extreme versions of Islam incessantly across Yemen (and much of the Middle East and North Africa) and they lament how just a few decades ago women dressed colorfully and could walk around in long skirts. The average Yemeni is not hyper-religious and the current civil war really has nothing to do with religion, and is more of a power/land grab by the Houthis, Saudis, UAE, Qatar and Iran to control major shipping routes and some oil deposits. I'm not super out at work, but some of my colleagues certainly know, and i work with one gay national guy who the women will take their hijabs off around when they are in private (technically a big no-no, but shows they accept him for what he is and dont see him as a threat). Of course there is a ton of sexism and homophobia, but I don't think Yemen would be anywhere like it is now without Saudi Arabia's relentless influence.
The fact that the marriage was allowed already says something about yemeni society, but you hear some people say "we dont like that" so you generalize the whole yemeni nation as one? That's disgusting.
