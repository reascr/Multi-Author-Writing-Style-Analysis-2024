As one of Lady G’s constituents (who has never voted for him), he’s a hypocrite turd. However, he has been extremely consistent on his Ukraine support and will not change since he’s a MIC booster.
He isn't stopped because despite what the administration claims, their goal is to bleed Russia slowly not to defend Ukraine. At the end of the day either one of two things is true, Russia is willing to use nuclear weapons to conquer Ukraine or he isn't. If he is we should just give up Ukraine (and every other country that borders Russia) right now, if he isn't we should defend them full force right now.
If he wasn't a supporter of Trump they would have been getting weapons they needed all along instead of him using blackmail of Ukraine (see first impeachment).
I agree to support Ukraine with tanks, but when you're actively helping Trump, who was impeached the first time for blackmailing Ukraine by withholding weapons...
About sending tanks to Ukraine, all one had to do is read my posting history to see just where I stand.
Continued edit: To clarify my position, despite what the administration claims their policies have been to bleed Russia, not to defend Ukraine. We should have been training the Ukrainian soldiers on US tech and supplied man portable anti-tank and anti-air weapons BEFORE the invasion that we telegraphed to the whole world we knew was coming. We should have given them HIMARS before they were terrorized by Russian artillery targeting civilians and infrastructure were used. We should have given them anti-air tech before Iranian drones targeted civilians and Russian missiles targeted hospitals, residences, and schools. We should give them IFVs and tanks NOW!
