They've had enough time to correct my tax stuff after it turns out my employer didn't do withholdings for a year and didn't tell me, but I'm just a tiny nobody and it probably took them 5 seconds to come squeeze me for my unemployment funding back.
I dunno, but it seems like they should do the big guys first? Maybe we should spend a little of that defense budget on more IRS guys to do those folks? Maybe??
"Fund the IRS!" would almost certainly backfire but it would be gratifying to see the biggest tax dodgers handled while the rest of us benefitted more from the leeway they seem to have gotten used to.
Fuck that, maybe the IRS should be forced to work top down and only come after people making less than a million a year AFTER every fucking corperation and billionaire has paid their fair share.
Already seeing Trump supporters saying his lenhs to not pay taxes are just "smart" and "good business" but then will bemoan "ThE eLiTeS" when celebrities and other rich do the same.
They love to feel slighted that they pay taxes and imagine that some strawman millionaire like Pelosi (or whoever else on the left) somehow isn't paying taxes. Yet when you get concrete proof that Trump is not paying his fair share, it's crickets. No morals with these people.
