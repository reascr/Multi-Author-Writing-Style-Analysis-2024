I think so. The winner has to get 218+, but it doesn't have to be the R party's candidate of choice if the votes are there for a coalition. Any R who voted with the Ds on a compromise candidate would probably be expelled from the R caucus as a traitor, so there is that cost.
Hmm.. it sounds like if the R vote is split in any appreciable way the democrats could have their choice of which one they want to win by voting as a block for them. Or just letting it be chaos.
How does speaker voting work, can like every dem secretly convince a dozen moderate gop folks to vote for one of themselves and the Dems agree to vote for them too? Seems like the various groups within the gop should be courting that Dem vote.
The voting is almost always along party lines. The Constitution doesn't require the Speaker to be a member of the House so theoretically someone outside of the House could be elected Speaker (that has never happened).
While the house can indeed not take up a vote, it will force them to respond and members of the house will have to answer questions why they havenâ€™t taken a vote. If the democrats work on meaningfully legislation in Senate and use the bully pulpit of the presidency to set the agenda, keeping the focus on things that actually effect voters. One thing that can be done to take the wind out of their sail is addressing the border issues.
