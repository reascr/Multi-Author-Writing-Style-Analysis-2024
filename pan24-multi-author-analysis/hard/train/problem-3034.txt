I skied Ruapehu back in the early 90’s. They’d had like 20 feet of snow. At one point we tried to ski to a cafe on the slopes but couldn’t find it, then we realized we were on its roof. Only a chimney was sticking out through the snow.
And even outside of ski stations, we get less snow and it rarely lasts more than a few days. I'm "only" 29 and I remember the countryside being entirely white for weeks on end during the winter, that just doesn't happen anymore.
I've been told that my great grandfather (born 1909, died 1998), who was a farmer all his life - so he knew a thing or two about the climate/weather - said that the seasons had become all messy compared to what they used to be. I wonder what he would think of our current situation...
Ski stations in other places in my region (canton of Fribourg) rely more and more on artificial snow each year, despite their higher elevation.
In Switzerland, we have always used snow sport transportation in summer as well (as far as feasible, e.g. T-bars of course won't work), we love hiking in the Alps (hiking in general is considered our national sport) and with the advent of eMTBs mountainbiking has increased in popularity in recent years as well.
Should have updated it to carry up mountain bikes and create trails, always fun going down hill, I lived on a ski resort in the summer (crazy cheap rent) and there was no snow, we used to bring bikes to the top and ride down, was fun as fuck.
