Welcome to the US War Zone. Almost "40,000" dead from fire arms in 2022 alone. Some "600" Mass Shootings. These numbers from an MSNBC News story today.
First off, these numbers are for "Gun Related Deaths" from a graph listing many other Countries. I have seen similar graphs before. Second, I gave my source. What is your? Fox?
As my last reply stated, the numbers were for All Gun Related Deaths. And, Suicide is made so much easier when a tug on a trigger does it. If it were not simple, many might not happen. And, pray tell, why gang deaths should not be counted? And, you have derided MSNBC, but, failed to mention your News Source.
And you didn't provide any source other than saying you watched MSNBC, of which MSNBC is well known to be a disinformation network.
The 40,000 number includes suicides, which is a common dishonest method of inflating gun violence numbers without informing viewers that half of those are actual homicides. Suicide is a mental illness, not gun violence. It's equivalent to saying suicides by hanging is rope violence or jumping off bridges as bridge violence.
