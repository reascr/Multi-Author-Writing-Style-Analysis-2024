Nah, more like Nicholas taking personal command of the Russian Army thereby pinning all the blame everytime the Army loses.
If Nicholas did not do that, there is a chance the Russian Civil War might have been different or completely avoided since Nicholas being present at the Imperial Court might rein in the shenanigans of Rasputin.
Nicholas the II worried that revolution might come to Russia and make it incapable of continuing to fight the war. A guy by the name of Lvov came to Nicholas, this was a lesser prince in Russia. Lvov convinced Nicholas the II to abdicate the throne and allow a government lead by him to rule.
Had Nicholas the II not abdicated the throne, he might still be alive. But that's not how history happened.
tl;dr If Nicholas the II was more of an autocrat his family would still be in power. The story of Nicholas the II doesn't remind us to be better people... but worse.
I agree, I don't think Nicholas the II could have stayed in power. But peaceful transition of power just didn't serve him well. He was just significantly better off fleeing the county and just letting Russia collapse.
