Having a former American president living under Russian protection in Moscow would be incredible victory for Putin and Russia.
Even as a propaganda tool (for both Russian and American consumption) Trump would be Putin's most powerful weapon by far.
He would definitely be a propaganda asset for Trump especially if he is given safety and able to convey his messages to his base in the US. Very well could try and start a civil war if he gets away OR ends up in prison.
Oh, believe me, that's why I say attempt. I think he is either surprised and it's quick or he's tipped and he will go for it. It is hard to tell. This is uncharted territory.
You can bet your ass it is. The more likely it becomes he will be indicted, we are pretty close to certainty already, the more likely he attempts to flee and makes all this shit 50x worse for himself.
Trump in an old man sprint into the back of a black SUV with toilet paper stuck to his shoe ðŸ¤£. Realizes nobodies coming with him and he's in the back by himself.
