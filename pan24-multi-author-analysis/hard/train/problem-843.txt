Again, I don't support the settlemsnts, but you surely can see the difference between "builds houses on contested territories" to"pays people to murder random civilians".
This are literally spontanous riots done in response to the murder of 2 children from their community and the celebration of these murders in the palestinian village.
This year the Palestinians have killed a 5 year old and 6 year old at a bus stop, a 15 year old at bus stop, a 14 year old in a synagogue, a 16 year old and his older brother yesterday and then filmed their bodies as they mocked them. And that's just the children they have killed this year.
But yes, let's talk about Israel's moral advantage because the Palestinians sure are winning on that front /s.
I'm surprised nothing as large as this has happened before. I guess Palestinians killing two civilians, filming their bodies mocking them, then dancing in the street.. crossed a line. Still, cars can be replaced. Let's be thankful that the settlers have not copied the Palestinians and started shooting at Palestinian civilians at bus stops, restaurants or stabbing them to death in their bedrooms.
When Israelis force people into ghettos steal others homes and properties murder children for over 50 years it's okay. It's amazing how big of a pass they seem to get.
