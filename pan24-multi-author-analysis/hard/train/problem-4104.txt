Support secessionist movements also. Creation of governments in exile for different regions. Provide over and covert support for those willing to fight for independence. There is more that can be done to not only defeat the fascist regime in the battlefield but make sure they will never be a threat again for centuries to come.
State Department made clear not to attack Russia proper with NATO equipment. Also intel on Russian formations is only given for the occupying forces.
Deterring a Russian attack is whole different ballgame than using troop buildups to force Russia to make concessions.
NATO has certainly has the military ability to enact a blockade in the Baltic Sea even without the two new members.
Finland's membership provides NATO the ability to defend against any Russian aggression in the Baltic. Sweden's addition now lets NATO close off both military and trade access to the Baltic Sea.
NATO has only to decide that it wants to stop Russian access to the Baltic Sea to make it happen. Just as with seizure of frozen Russian assets, the legal work follows the decision to seize the assets, it does not frame or limit the decision.
The West has $600B in frozen assets owned by sanctioned Russians that it can seize, sell off and pay Ukraine.
Their best strategy seems to be (I have no idea, I'm no general) to hang in there and destroy Russian assets as they enter Ukraine.
