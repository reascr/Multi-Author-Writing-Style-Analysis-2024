No way Republican Santos needs to grab the microphone and demand that the spotlight be shone on him And, the media needs to respond—maybe get a taste for uncovering bald-faced lies of politicians.
Republican Paul Gossar, Republican Andy Biggs, and Republican Mo Brooks all helped plan the January 6th 2001 Insurrection—I bet they have some “untruths” that could be unraveled.
I mean—there are some shady things in Republican Lauren Boebart’s past that could be investigated. She has sworn that the user profile on the call girl website wasn’t hers….
Seriously—Republican Santos seems like just the guy to draw a spotlight on corruption and lying in the halls of Congress.
Why would Santos resign when Santos excellently represents the GOP who to date stands firmly behind the professional fibber who has lied about all aspects of his life. Just some of the few big ones that are completely made up: attended prestigious universities, is Jewish, has grandparents who fled Ukraine, worked at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, and his mother died in 9/11.
