I know, I didn't say anyone said the invasion wasn't justified, I said inb4 people say that. I also understand nuance, while I don't think he should ever get a war memorial, I also won't celebrate the fact he had to die defending his country. Nazi or not.
I'm not denying there are Nazi's amongst the ranks. But suggesting that Azov Batallion is presently a Nazi organization, officially sanctioned as such by the Ukrainian government, is a false equivocation at best, and Russian propaganda at worst - they literally have said they are fighting the Ukrainians to eradicate Nazi's. The presence of Nazi's, and even a fascist element in its formation, is not enough to throw the baby out with the bathwater today... Else there is not a single gun-carrying group in the eastern or western world that is not also a "Nazi organization". Hell, has the US government ever indicated that "Operation Paperclip" was unethical? That's where we assisted actual Third Reich scientists in coming here because we wanted their rocket tech.
Can we also acknowledge that 1. Picking apart the people fighting for Ukraine is not the top priority while they are actively getting fucking attacked 2. Ukraine has a lot of complex issues, including but not limited to having "their Trump" as PM or President for the better part of 12 years, ending just 9 years ago, at which point Putin invaded Crimea?
I am not sure how you do not understand that if Russia is successful in their invasion of Ukraine that it presents a problem for all of Europe and the world.
Don't get me wrong, I respect Ukraine for fighting Russia but for us the US is to Latin America what Russia is to Eastern Europe.
As Latin American, our history has taught us to fear and not trust the US rather than the Russians (I don't give a fk about Putin though, we don't support him).
