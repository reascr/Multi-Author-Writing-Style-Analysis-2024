You're also acting like you have any idea behind the circumstances of her still being there at that time (May - only three months into the conflict and obviously her protests came before that), when she was far from the only one in her town trying to take a stand about the occupation. Her real mistake was using social media.
You're literally saying she's a victim and blaming her rather than the actual cause of her being one.
Blaming someone, and saying that someone is not without blame are two very different things. And I've been saying that she's not without blame since the beginning.
Whatever reason why she's there when it's already May, is not of concern. She had November, December, January, and February to leave. When Russia invaded and it became a warzone it was already too late. You're just ignoring all my arguments and focusing on the circumstances where she had no longer had control.
Oh I agree. But was she expecting to correct the whole of Russia by staying as an activist in Ukraine, as it is being invaded?
