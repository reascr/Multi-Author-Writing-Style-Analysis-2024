We need to understand that modern GOP politicians don't care about governance they are influencers, they keep coming out with stuff to keep their followers enraged, that generates money, views , impressions, retweets and, as Trump proved, votes.
DeSantis figured out that anti-woke themes resonate with the base and as governor he had a leg up to his competition by being able to do performative art with it and what better antagonist than a multi billion corporation that everyone knows and had enraged his base by showing some signs of openness?
Disney is a global company, it has a market cap of +180B with over 220k employees, and only the massification of A/C is more important than Disney in creating a modern Florida economy.
Anyone that thinks Disney will just up and leave their 27,000 acres of land, on which sits 32 resorts and hotels and 4 whole theme parks which generate them $20 million per day, has obviously never been to Disney World in their lives.
I'm not saying close Disney World in Florida, but expand and give families more options and it could give Disney options if shit like this continues.
As the governor of Florida he can only affect what's in Florida, which is the Disney World Amusement Park. The divisional headquarters themselves for the Parks Division and Cruise Line can easily be relocated. Disney itself, along with most of its other divisions, are headquartered outside of Florida.
