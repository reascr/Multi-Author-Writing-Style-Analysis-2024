I know some people who are Russia-friendly and the newest KGB idea is served to them by Facebook within a day or two of anything happening that Putin does not like.
But they are helping Brits do it. It's so easy, all they need to do in encourage conflict wherever it arises. They support both sides of the argument, as long as anger flourishes ... and Brexit was one of the results.
Basically, the actions of the Cameron Government show that they wanted Brexit, even if their words claim otherwise. Either that, or they were even stupider than the Truss government.
Or so they claim, but when the so-called "advisory referendum" went marginally in favour of Brexit, Cameron voluntarily and immediately stepped aside to let the overt isolationists take control.
Had he truly been opposed, they could have shepherded us into EEA membership; or begun defining what Brexit means in advance of a third referendum; or declared that votes in border regions might have more "advisory" weight than rural Middle England; or used the significant rule-breaking as grounds to nullify the result. And so on.
There was absolutely no need to call the referendum in the first place, and they chose to call it after several years of blaming everything on Johnny Foreigner, and having just returned from an EU negotiation where he didn't get everything Murdoch and the Barclay twins wanted.
