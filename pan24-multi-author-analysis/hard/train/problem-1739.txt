And the final boss is a huge ass balloon with tentacles that shoot out missiles. and once you shoot all of them down, you target the balloon itself.
How does the government react to the balloon? Do they reach out to the government they suspect sent it? Do they alert the public immediately? What do they do about the balloon? How quickly do they notice it? How long before they say anything? Do they try to collect it? Destroy it? Will they retaliate? How much political posturing? Where can the balloon drift to before action is taken? Will they care if it floats over specific areas? What about infighting among politicians and political parties?
That social data is just as valuable as the pictures they could be taking, that balloon’s basket could have some insanely high new groundbreaking tech, but it could also be empty. Why spend a shit ton of money on something that you know is going to be shot down and recovered or risk that stuff ending up in enemy hands?
Decent chance they actually wanted to see how different governments and civilians would react to “spy balloons” from hostile governments hanging out in their air space, or are testing the waters. Everyone talks about pictures and data and radar and etc, but there’s valuable social information to be gained.
What about the general public. Do they call for blood? Do they panic? Will they criticize the way their government handled it? Does it cause discourse? Let’s take a look at the conspiracy theories, maybe get some data on how different demographics respond or talk about it, using their device data that can be harvested from different apps or bought from big companies.
