There's nothing genius hackerbrain about it. It's just plain criminal and anyone with a few ECTS of programming can do it.
Consider this: Russian "hackers" steal passwords, troll social media and send the occasional ransomware.
Anonymous, Ukranian hackerd, Russian IT defectors, Oligarchs clenaning up files, databases etc. When you have so many enemies as Russia and the country is a damn shit show.
Seems more like a way for and outside force to cause chaos inside of russia. These places are easy enough to hack vs national Russia data. It isnt that hard to have a good security at high levels if you cash. Those locals places dont have the cash.
These local places definitely don’t have the cash for something like this. But some oligarchs with a shady criminal record or a president that’s having a humiliating defeat in a war. They definitely have the cash and the reason to clean up before checking out. Or being checked out by someone else.
Ukraine definitely has the cash and the reason to do this. But I get the vibe of someone removing their tracks.
