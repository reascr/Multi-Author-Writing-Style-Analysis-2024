The amount of apps that track you is obsene. I have some apptracking software on my deivcie and in the last 7 days i got somthing like 36,206 tracking attempts from 13 apps. everything from GPS coardinites to screen resuliton. A while ago I also got a tracking attempt to see Headphone status. It is insane so much personal info from so many componies. and such a wide variety of stuff they want to know my exact location and wether i have headphone conected. Privacy is so hard to get in this digital age.
