You're saying that like Russia isn't at war. You might be one of the "special military operation" people, but in case you didn't notice, diplomacy has not worked for Ukraine in preventing a Russian invasion.
Maybe they could have beaten just Ukraine-- I'm really not sure, given the incredible resolve of the Ukranian military and my lack of knowledge about Ukraine's pre-war supply situation-- but they're not fighting just Ukraine. They're fighting Ukraine and a massive pile of weapons and supplies from third parties who want to stop them from taking territory.
They're losing, but they're losing against an incredibly dedicated military that's being funded by... pretty much everyone relevant, at this point, and doing a lot of damage in the process. Russia claims to be fighting NATO, and they're only slightly lying about it. (To be clear, so no one thinks I'm a troll, I'm not saying anything Russia has done here is in any way acceptable-- just that it's not wrong to say that NATO members [and possibly other nations as well; I'm not sure exactly which ones have provided support] have contributed enough to Ukraine's defense efforts to be considered involved in the war.).
You're not wrong that they're taking a lot of losses, but you are wrong about "Ukrainian farmers." Ukraine has likely been actively building up military power for nearly a decade now, if not longer. They should have recognized the threat after Russia took Crimea and been preparing ever since, possibly even sooner.
