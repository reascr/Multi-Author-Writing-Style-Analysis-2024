On its own, probably not. In combination with RCV, I think it would limit extremism because you'd be more likely to have moderates who can pull from a broad range of voters politically most likely to succeed. It would also make it more difficult to game the system and make gerrymandering much more difficult. I think it would also change the dynamics of electoral politics because no candidate would be running against any other individual candidate. I think strategically, in general, it would necessitate candidates who express more positive visions of what they'd like to do and less negative personal and partisan attacks against a singular opponent.
My preference is for both ranked choice voting and multimember districts. That way more people have an opportunity to have someone that represents them that they voted for instead of winner take all where you end up with up to 49%+ of a single member district not having any representation.
2) It can help break the stranglehold that the two party system has on our politics in that a vote for a third party, or independent, candidate is essentially a vote thrown away. But without throwing us into the chaos of a multi-party parliamentary system.
