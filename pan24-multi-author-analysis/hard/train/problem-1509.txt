Also 'we' isn't accurate. While there's issues with immigrant policies no matter who we're talking about, there's only one group kidnapping migrants for political points.
There's been a lot of dehumanization of immigrants so Republicans have no problem doing this to immigrants because "it's not like they are people." It makes it easier to do worse and worse things without any outcry.
Just to clarify, the VP's residence was the final location as far as Abbott was concerned. He didn't care after that if they got assistance or died of frostbite on Harris' doorstep. If anything, Abbott might have preferred the latter for shock value and headlines. ("Harris lets immigrants die on her doorstep rather than giving them shelter! See how hypocritical the left is?").
THAT is what is going on here. These are the people who are doing exactly what we've asked of them. And this is how they get treated by some moronic Republican Governor?
Imagine you are legally moving to Italy. You show up to customs, they put you on a bus, and drop you off in the middle of Rome at night. It is freezing. You have no food. You have nowhere to go. You might not even speak the language.
