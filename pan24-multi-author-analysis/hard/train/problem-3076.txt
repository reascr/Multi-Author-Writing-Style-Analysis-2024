Given that Russia might be running out of tanks to generously abandon in Ukraine, since they've been reaching into museums to refurbish T62s, I think I can comfortably say "bout time!".
The SU57 is more or less the same story, but you also have to remember that Russia uses its planes much like flying artillery and have demonstrated less skill with deploying their air force than their tanks which is a statement. They stand to gain little and lose a lot from risking SU57s in Ukraine instead of their older jets.
They are much better than the planes Ukraine is using today and getting a steady supply of planes would allow them to step up their air operations.
But F-16 will improve Ukrainian airforce alot, and their airforce still fly missions to this day, this is crazy to me.
Also they can be used to shoot down drones or cruise missiles and launch stand off attacks within Ukrainian airspace.
Ukraine with more planes could afford to risk them for wild weasel missions. Force the enemy AA to turn on their radar to engage them only for them to be destroyed themselves for their trouble.
