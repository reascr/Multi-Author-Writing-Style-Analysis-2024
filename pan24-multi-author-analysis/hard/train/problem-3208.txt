There is no reason that traitortrump being a candidate changes DOJ investigations or indictments of trump. I dont know where people get that idea. They are still interviewing witnesses and waiting on the special master. After that if any of the 3 federal grand juries decides to indict then Garland will indict him.
Except that is nonsense. Investigation into multiple trump crimes well underway before he did his bs announcement for an election 2 years away. Only his lunatic cult can claim its political and nobody cares about that. That position is laughable. He has committed proven crimes against America and must be held accountable. And MAJORITY of Americans support that.
Garland is not done with the 3 investigations he has sitting grand juries for. They continue to interview and subpoena witnesses and are waiting on getting documents from the special master. I believe there will be indictments and some may even be for sitting seditious traitor GOP mocs. He builds from the ground up and does not lose.
He’ll lose. 2016 happened because people thought there was no chance he’d win and some stayed home instead of voting. And he still lost the popular vote. He’s lost his own reelection since and he’s lost republicans elections since 2018. Nothing motivates dems to come out and vote after 2016 like him.
