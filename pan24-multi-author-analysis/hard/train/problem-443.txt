Removing books from libraries is far short of censorship. Your local library doesn’t have every single book written. They choose what they want to stock. Every library does it. Are they all banning books?
It's not "essentially book burning", it's removing the books from the public libraries. Are this books banned? No. Are they destroyed? Also probably no. Can you still buy it? Yes. Is there enough research materials for historians? Hell yeah, and if not, contact me and I'll lend them my grandma's library, there's a good hundred of soviet books. And mind you, they are intact, once again, Ukrainians aren't "literally burning" anything.
Also one shouldn’t forget that the language of the Ukrainians is Ukrainian, not Russian. They are in essence removing the books of their colonisers from public eye and replacing them with their own.
For everyone insisting this is totally wrong, you are not really understanding what is happening. They are not expunging these books from history as was the goal of real book burning, they are removing them from the limited shelf space in their public libraries. These books can still be accessed, they just don’t want them displayed in public.
Removing LGBT books is not ‘literally the exact same’ as removing the books of your colonisers that aren’t even written in your language.
