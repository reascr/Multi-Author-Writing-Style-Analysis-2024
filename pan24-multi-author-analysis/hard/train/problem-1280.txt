Didn't the clown prince of Belarus accidentally leak this in the first few weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine? Like he showed a map on TV that pointed to where they'd invade Moldova once they were done in Ukraine.
I said it before the Ukraine invasion; the only way to prevent an invasion is to have western troops in the threatened country.
Yeah, to really invade Moldova from the black sea, the only real option unless they want to go through the air, they'll have to do a big push in southern Ukraine. They'd have to re-conquer Cherson and Mykolaiv, then push on towards Odesa. If they are able to do that, they would be able to take the now cut of part of Ukraine that's "between" Moldova and Romania.
I mean, Moldova is just Romania's split sibling. They could try but I can see that a LOT of romanians could volunteer for Moldova.
Romania has a deep hatred for anything russian, my grandmother told me that under russian occupation in the moldavian area they starved while the soldiers stole their food and my grandfather's sister was executed by a russian soldier by a nearby river where they washed the clothes cause she resisted the rape.
Even Ceausescu, the former communist leader of Romania hated Russia lmao, there was a myth in my country that Russia tried to invade Communist Romania and we retaliated with lazers that melt their tanks lmao.
