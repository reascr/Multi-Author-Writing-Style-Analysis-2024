Plus kosher laws are stricter than halal. They share the restrictions on pork and shellfish, but kosher has additional rules such as the milchig/fleischig thing.
Halal meat is not kosher (e.g. it's not slaughtered and salted the way kosher meat is). And once utensils are used for non-kosher food they cannot be used with kosher food (with exceptions).
This is correct, but Muslims and Jews have some similarities in the foods they don’t eat, like pork. But I agree that it’s more looking like anti semitism than anything else.
And not mixing milk and meat, so a cheeseburger isn’t kosher. Any Muslims reading this feel free to correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought Muslims eat cheeseburgers? I’m Jewish. So I could be wrong.
It's okay to admit you were wrong. You don't have to double down and lie when your comment is right there. Take your L my dude, realize that no one gives a shit about what Reddit thinks except for Reddit.
No, you said the viewership won't be nearly the same. Then you went off on a tangent about how you apparently think that Germany and Turkey drive the view ship numbers lol.
