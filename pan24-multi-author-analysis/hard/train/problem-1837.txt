Have you ever responded like this to a comment about AOC or Hilary, or are you just deeply disingenuous with your concerns about misogyny towards female lawmakers and politicians?
So, TL;DR is: No proof she is a sex worker, but despite being elected, she is neither a profound (nor qualified) lawmaker, or has even shown a margin of critical thinking on how to propel this country forward. This is why I wish everyone who represents us in this country actually has an accredited law degree instead of just having a big enough cash injection to be seen.
Outside of a handful of bills that I would support (environmental bills, some critical care health access, a couple others) likely driven by more coherent lawmaker(s); are all about ridiculous bills that continue to fan the flames of culture wars, political targeting, or general political destabilization.
Yeah, so far it appears that it was bogus. Boebert is suing the PAC that circulated the rumor, it'll be interesting to see what happens. Edit\ But at this point, they're innocent until proven guilty.
