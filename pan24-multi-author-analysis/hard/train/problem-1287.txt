This is the mindset that has led traditionally purple Florida to become a Republican stronghold- while one of the strongest arms of the GOP is in Florida arguably the weakest democrat one is there to contend against them. Florida has a LOT of electorals you don’t just give up on that.
You can’t gerrymander the governors race he trounced the democrats in. If democrats don’t wake up and realize strategy changes are needed, Florida will be solidly deep red for a generation.
I live here, I am surrounded by democrats. Not one was “scared” to go vote. Most didn’t care for Christ and are sick of our state party. They’re uninspiring and run questionable candidates. It’s not a moderate/progressive issue either (see: Andrew Gillum). It’s a, they don’t have good people to run issue.
Blaming shady tactics for a ten vote defeat could be reasonable. Blaming them for a ten percent defeat is straight up denial of reality, and implies nothing should be done. Clearly, Democrats are not appealing to voters in Florida, and they need to change something. This is a state they should be competitive in.
