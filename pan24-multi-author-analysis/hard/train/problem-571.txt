A lot of Canadian tropes are actually just Americans who met people from Minnesota and seemed to have extrapolated that everyone north of that is the same. A Minnesotan even has something much closer to the stereotypical Canadian accent than a Torontonian.
You think I’m joking, but I’m really not - east coast Canadians are next level nice/hospitable, the rest of us are just a pale imitation.
Also, I assume that this happened somewhere other than the Atlantic provinces, because those dangerous miscreants will straight up walk/drive you to your next destination if you show even the slightest sign of confusion.
(And yes, am almost pathologically chatty and spent yesterday afternoon handing out balloons to a bunch of 4 and 5 year old boys - truly terrifying stuff, sorry).
Was too busy being queen of “balloon punch castle” (new game that just dropped, highly recommend), but I did apologize to the parents for coming to the park with so much energy and so many toys, being a Sunday afternoon aunt fucking rules.
