I don’t know how it worked tbh. I heard about it from a pilot who saw the plane in the ME years back and then read about it later. Some kind of biased gyro I guess.
This wasn’t the 747 with the prayer room that always pointed towards Mecca, was it? I could see the resale market for a super-customized $500 million plane fairly small.
It'd cost more to retrofit it as a cargo plane than it would to buy a new cargo plane. Nobody's flying passenger 747s anymore - they're all being phased out, sans a few notable exceptions like Air Force One. It's a shame, but that's the reality of where these planes are with the economics of flying them.
Now billionaires are being embarrassed by their emissions while the globe is burning down, so... gotta shuffle off the gas guzzling airplane and pretend they don't have twin-engine narrow bodies they fly around as private jets.
Honestly I'm not sure if there would have been many takers if they offered to give it away for free, net of anything. The scrapyards might have fought over it since it does have a few million dollars of scrap value, but... not much beyond that. (Frankly, moving it might have eaten so far into the costs that make even scrapping it a net loss, depending on the state of the plane's hardware and how thorough of inspections it needs.).
