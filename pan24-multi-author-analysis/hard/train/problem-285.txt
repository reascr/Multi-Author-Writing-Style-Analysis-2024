He's hysterical and quite obviously playing to whichever side gets him the most views. Even when he was parroting more right wing talking points, he still got millions of views because he's just hilarious to watch. Not the best human being in the world, but I can't blame him for doing what he's good at lol.
He's not a sympathetic person for sure, but I think you picked out the wrong things about him. Having multiple partners is not Hershel Walker's biggest problem, and being a kid from such a relationship isn't either. Someone who is famous because of their rich and famous parent isn't really new either (see the Bush, Kennedy, and Trump families).
There is a lot to criticize about Christian's views, and maybe about how to political systems work to raise up people like him, but you missed the mark.
The hypocrisy is the problem there, not the action itself. I wouldn't, for example, advocate for an anti-abortion woman to be denied reproductive healthcare.. because the abortion is not the problem.
