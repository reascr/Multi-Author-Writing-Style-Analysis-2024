When they changed Senate elections to a popular vote instead of an appointment by the state to represent the needs of the state, they should have made Senate seats represent districts with roughly even populations - the original design was to have some protection of states autonomy etc which might be different than a popular vote in the state. That might mean having 13 senators from California and 1 covering all of Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas. (The 13 from the CA part would be more like an 8/5 split. Illinois would have 2 from Chicago and one for the rest of the state etc. Some things might cross state lines.).
Yes. Look at the real Taliban. They waited 20 years on exile to come roaring back to do the same thing, and the people forgot how awful they were and let them waltz into Kabul. The GOP will do the same thing. They’ll be the “we’re not crazy anymore™️” GOP until the moment they see the opportunity to go back to the fascist well to propel them into power. And we’ll go right back to the overt racism, unqualified candidates constantly blowing racist dog whistles and all the while every republican furiously lining their pockets.
