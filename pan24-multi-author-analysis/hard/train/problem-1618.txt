Ah, another generation of black Americans stuck in poverty and/or routinely brutalized and managed by an always-growing carceral state supported by both parties, but at least a few more of them have $50k in debt for a mostly useless degree (or none at all), which is unforgivable and can't be discharged in bankruptcy (specifically because of the current president).
Simply throwing somebody into college without the requisite skills or knowledge means you're just saddling them with debt and an unfinished degree after they fail, especially if they're still in poverty, or you're lowering standards and giving A's just because they're black. In which case, everyone knows and the university becomes a joke and the degree is useless.
It doesn't, because there are many years and factors before college in one's life that sets one up for success. The system we live in is also not meritocratic.
So if merit as all it is, what happens when the most qualified are minority and get hired. They going to change the law to make sure, so dumb white guy gets a job.
