And by hesitate, I mean they will form LLC subsidiaries and manage risk without harming their name brand.
They will swoop in to maximize exploitation. Look what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Russia will be no different.
However, Russia is a bit unique due to their situation. They have lots of land and lots of resources, so they can power the economy just from internal resource extraction.
A country without those rich resource deposits would essentially be screwed. You need iron to build cars and houses. Copper to build wires for electricity. Oil, gas and/or coal to power your factories. Fertile land to use for farming. If some of those things aren't available, you absolutely need to trade with the outside, otherwise your population would suffer.
It'd also be awful for climate change since photovoltaic power would be unavailable and other forms of climate friendly energy production would be less efficient. Nuclear power would be an option, but Russia might not have the knowledge or tools to build such a power plant without outside support.
