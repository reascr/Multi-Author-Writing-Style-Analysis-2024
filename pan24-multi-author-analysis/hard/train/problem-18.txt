I believe people are just as upset about the planet, but where do you direct that anger? It’s literally every corporation doing it. People bitch about this because it’s a specific news story. It’s dumb and misguided.
What a dumb comparison. These kids are not destroying art to hide it or deny it’s existence. The crime here is more akin to taking hostages in a desperate attempt to get the word out about a global government conspiracy that will result in billions of deaths. They are using this as a platform to promote conversation, not stifle it.
People are ridiculous, this art will not matter if society does not exist to protect it and allow us enjoy it communally. We are on the brink of collapse and the kids doing this shit are more brave than any of us keyboard warriors. How do you suggest they protest to raise awareness?
What type of protest is most convenient for you? A convenient protest CERTAINLY has no impact either.
Do i think that non violent protests are an effective way to enact political change? Yes. No one was hurt, 2 frame's were lightly damaged, and the news travelled round the world.
