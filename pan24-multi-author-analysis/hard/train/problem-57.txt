He voted against gay marriage more so than voting for protection for interracial marriage. It’s the fact that they’re tied together that makes it an easy headline grabber to demonize him. He’s a piece of shit but the fact is he prioritized being against gay marriage rather than codifying protection for interracial marriage. It actually shows more that he won’t back down from gay marriage regardless of the benefits that would help his own.
3) Marriage is religious and our religion is allowed to ban gay marriage. You can have civil unions if you want, but I'm going to vote against that too because gays are gross and I just feel so icky whenever anyone respects them. It's unnatural.
Listen, buddy, we all struggle with how hot men can be. You see that Channing Tatum in Magic Mike? You better believe I'm at full salute. We all are. It's how you deal with it that determines whether it's good or bad. You just marry some gross woman, and when it's time to make children, you close your eyes and pretend that she's Magic Mike and not an icky female.".
Yeah. I want to always say something like "where does Jesus say anything that remotely makes what you said make sense," but they have no freaking clue.
