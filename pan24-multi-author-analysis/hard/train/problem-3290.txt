Great news hopefully these gun control laws get scrapped since it's just taking guns away from law abiding citizens, more guns than people in U.S too easy for criminals to get one.
Anyways, that was a lot but my point is that I hear this a lot, “a hill to die on”, why are gun laws the thing that goes too far?? and I guess since I’m vocally pro bill of rights all the time, im always puzzled by this. I’m as angry about Republican attempts to suppress minority votes via mail in ballot laws as I am with democratic attempts to prevent gun ownership. Maybe it’s a good idea for people to reflect on how to be more pro-everyone. Support your neighbor and your fellow countryman’s rights and not get so focused on why he needs them. I assure you, he knows what rights he needs.
I don’t exactly know why some people get so specifically concerned with violations of the 2nd amendment and not so concerned with others, I assume it’s because they’re heavily rural people and this might actually effect them, but rather than try and knock people down, I try and build people up and maintain the best possible outlook.
And what about our right to vote? Voting is probably the closest approximation of the sort of abstract force for violence as widespread gun ownership; for instance, voting for George Bush Jr. led to him winning the election, which led to millions of innocent people dying in his fake oil wars. Same for Nixon, and so on. Voting has caused lots of death and societal chaos and suppression of rights, arguably lots more death than caused by domestic homicide by gun violence alone.
