How many shootings are full on man in a school or store with a gun murdering indiscriminately? I'm sure that's less that 3% of shootings. Of course people aren't stopping drive bys or stuff like that. You wanna use stats, use them correctly.
Technically it has. Guns have been allowed for 250 years in this country and I'm pretty sure crime has been on a steady decline since the early 90s. Never even got more violent after the AWB ran out of time.
That's still the same, they do stop them sometimes. Maybe people just need to stop shooting places up and then people not even from the US wouldn't want to change rights that don't affect them?
Not trying to say guns should be allowed, just pointing out an incompetent, racist, ultraviolent police isn't exclusive to the US.
Eeh, ours are just as bad if not worse. That militarization of police that has been creating so many problems in the US? Happened to us in the early 70's. We have the most lethal police in the world and 68% of the population fears the police.
