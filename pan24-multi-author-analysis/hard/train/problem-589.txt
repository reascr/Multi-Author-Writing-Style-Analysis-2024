I mean, hunter Biden isn't an elected official, doesn't have a security clearance, isn't one of Biden's advisors.
It’s outrageous that Hunter Biden continues to be a political punching bag for the right anytime Biden or the Democrats do something they don’t like. He’s never been charged, tried or convicted of a crime. He doesn’t hold public office. I don’t think the laptop narrative is particularly effective politically but there are tens or perhaps even hundreds of thousands of slobbering mouth-breathers who think Hunter Biden is da debil and probably want to do violence to him.
I don’t really give a shit about Hunter Biden but it’s super disturbing that media outlets were publicly blasted and shunned during the election for sharing “Russian disinformation,” yet two years later the laptop has been verified to exist and the contents Hunters.
Why lie about it’s existence and gaslight the public? That’s pretty disturbing and I don’t think it makes you a weirdo to question why they tried so hard to cover up its existence.
