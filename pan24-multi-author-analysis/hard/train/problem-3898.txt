The 2022 midterms have rebuilt the Democrats’ presidential bench, providing the party with a host of ideological, geographical and biographical options for the party’s next nominee after Joe Biden — be that sooner or later.
Two events this week highlight this new bench: The reelection of Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) in a runoff on Tuesday night put the spotlight on one of the party’s highest-profile Black leaders. And the Democratic Governors’ Association’s conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, featured a host of would-be presidential contenders.
While November’s midterms were far from a complete success — Republicans took control of the U.S. House — Democrats won most of the country’s marquee swing-state Senate and gubernatorial contests, with presidential buzz developing around some of the victors even before their races were called.
Dems have been winning statewide elections there pretty consistently over the past several years, and with different types of candidates top. Biden, Warnock, Ossef,...No reason to believe there aren't other liberals in the state that can't win.
Republicans can also win in Georgia, I'm not disputing that. Georgia right now is VERY inelastic, and has a very split electorate. It's reasonable to assume there are other Democratic candidates that can also win, but they need to be very high caliber. Same goes for republicans. Not every republican can win in Georgia. Kemp was a high caliber canidate, who shunned Trump and many of his most outrageous claims. He won.
