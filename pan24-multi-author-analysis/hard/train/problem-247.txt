I found some very easy and robust ways to get it to demonstrate how not smart it was. Basically, it can't lie because the bot proceeds with all inputs as if they are related to the material it trained on. So if you ask it to do something over false premises it fails immediately. It can detect nonsense and gibberish, but it can't detect that something was just made up.
It will say something like "The [] conjecture does not apply to []'s postulate. []'s postulate is best understood as the blah blah blah blah. []'s conjecture has been shown to be true when blah blah blah blah.".
Good. Every Iranian weapons factory needs to be cratered, given that 1) They're a murderous regime oppressing their own people 2) They're supplying weapons to another murderous regime (Russia) who invades and murders other people.
Wait? You boys have been swarming all over this thread for the last hour chanting "Saudi Arabia and Yemen" all in unison together with other tired bits of cobbled-together whataboutism. And you appear in packs too, quite interesting. Silence, then a rapid pattering of whataboutist comments, then silence.
