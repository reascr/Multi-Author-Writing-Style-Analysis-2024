I admit, stripping of license is harsh for what they've done, but Latvia does not fuck around with russians, and for a good reason.
First of all - it's a law in Latvia. Broadcasters have to provide a translation of their material in latvian, period. It doesn't have to be the only language, but it has to be an option, which it wasn't.
Certainly, you would want a Rain TV article where they write out a confession of their bias and the desire to distance russians from the war and hence the consequences.
Not going to lie, even before reading the text of the doc, I presumed, the Latvia govrmnt did an inquiry into the channel and found that Rain's activity helps Russian war effort more than it hurts.
If Latvia and the West would have them lose all credibility to the Russian people (especially those still within Russia) then what use would they be as an opposition news source?
At the end of the day, Russians lost a voice of opposition and a voice of reason in amongst the propaganda being spewed at them by both Putin and the West.
Any people who would flock back to Putin just because the russia's neighbours and prior victims didn't take "these people in" deserves what's coming for Putin.
"Our boys" as in "our poor boys forced by bad Putin to do bad things" and not "guys ravaging neighboring country for personal gain and delusions of grandeur". You should watch their lives, the theme ov russia being the victim is noticeable.
