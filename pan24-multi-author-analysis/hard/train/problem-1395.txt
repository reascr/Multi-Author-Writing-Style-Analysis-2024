That is not what's going on right now. Russia is throwing everything they've got at Ukraine while they prepare for another major offensive. Ukraine is losing ground very slowly in the East and while it seems Russia is losing men at an unsustainable rate, they also have seemingly endless bodies to throw on the pile. Ukraine needs help more than every now because Russia may not be the force we all thought they were at the start of this war, they're still a massive military 100% committed to this war and causing massive destruction in Ukraine.
When Ukraine wins the war there will still be a peace of mind, it's just a choice of when and whether it's NATO soldiers or Ukrainian soldiers dying to defend the West, and whether our direct involvement could in any way trigger a nuclear response. It's this last point why we are probably not going to directly intervene unless Russia does something to make such a conflict unavoidable.
“ but no one here has actually felt any pain or real cost directly from Russia's invasion of Ukraine”.
Apologies if my above comment sounded like i am saying Ukraine wanted war(as its clearly an invasion by Russia).
