it gained traction about 3 years ago and we were moving forward with it, suddenly France comes out of nowhere and hijacks it saying they’re going to print it and “use the new currency to replace the CFA Franc” (which France still controls 80 years later) and “any other west African countries that want in can join” (of course under Frances terms).
example: we have ECOWAS (think EU but for west Africa, and it’s a mix of Portuguese, English and French speaking countries, but the French countries outnumber every other), we already have free movement, one passport, free trade, right to live and work etc etc, and we’ve been pushing for one currency for the whole subcontinent for the last like 20 years.
our government along with Ghana, Liberia and the other non french speaking countries filed a complaint but the french west africans once again bought into french imperialism and coercion.
“Many Africans in regions without French influence view France as the enemy of Africa as a whole at this point”.
Many Africans in regions without French influence view France as the enemy of Africa as a whole st this point...
interestingly enough 3 years later, France and the French Africans are still yet to even begin talks to implement this, almost as if France doesn’t want to.
When the Mali junta, while being a weaker state than say Ivory coast or Senegal, asked France to leave, the french forces left without delay nor any discussion.
