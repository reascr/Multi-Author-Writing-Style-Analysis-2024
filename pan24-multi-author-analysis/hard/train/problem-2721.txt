I feel like so much of it is what you're used to. If you go to Santa Monica you see women walking down the street in string bikinis and nobody bats an eye, but if you try that in Minnesota there would be traffic accidents. So the answer is more topless women, not less.
Because it increases freedom by providing women a right to choose to be topless or not. Nobody is forcing women to go topless, but those who choose to have the freedom to decide for themselves.
Ones wants to ban topless people, the other wants to ban alcohol at concerts, the next wants to ban some books, some music or some movies, so will want to ban dark humour, another will want to ban flying some flags... We end up with a society of bans instead of a society of freedoms.
Trying to accommodate everyone by curtailing freedom always results in no freedom for anyone, because everyone has a different idea of what should be acceptable and what should be banned.
Every country curtails freedoms and it doesn’t automatically result in zero freedoms. Just because the government restricts the right to go around bottomless doesn’t mean they have to accommodate someone wanting to force women to cover their hair.
