That just breaks my heart. This is why parents not only need to be parenting their kids from a no violence/importance f empathy standpoint, but also why we have to stop pussyfooting around the concept of death with kids. No more lying about the dog going to a farm to live. No more "grandma went to a better place" with no context on the physical "dead" part. Kids can handle learning about death and what it is, and we do them a grave disservice by sheltering them from such an important and unavoidable concept in the world. Every fantasy story and video game shows death as a temporary affliction, and if we let that stand as their only experience of it, why are we so surprised when they act like killing someone is no big deal and they'll just respawn at the hospital and be back next week?
Having a gun with a kid in the house is a huge safety risk. If you can't ensure safe storage, you shouldn't be allowed the gun. We make people pass a test to get their driver's license, and it should be the same for a gun license, and it should include inspection of your gun safe or other locked storage.
However, in just four instances did the adult owners of the weapons face any criminal punishment for not having locked them up â€” and none of those prosecutions stemmed from safe-storage laws.
If you own a firearm you are legally responsible for its safe storage. No different than fencing your pool or leashing your dog. These parents will be held criminally liable.
