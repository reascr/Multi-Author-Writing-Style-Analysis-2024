Why the downvotes? This is a valid concern. It has happened very recently to Kurds and Afghans. West countries just said:
"We got bored with this war, so we'll pull the plug. I guess all you will just die. Goodbye and good luck".
The only difference now is that there are NATO and EU countries that don't want to be the next Chechnya/Georgia/Crimea/Ukraine so they're now pushing for curbing Putin's aggressivity.
Nope Russia are a strategic threat to the west and only partial normalisation should ever be on the table. Any material that can be used for military purposes should be barred from sale to Russia on an indeterminate basis.
All expectation is Russia will be forced to accept the reality of losing the war without anything materially changing in Russia. That doesn't allow for what happened with West Germany.
Please don't act as if "the west" was a single bloc. Letting the kurds die was primarily a US-thing, heavily criticized by everybody else.
Just to get a bit more detail into this, the germany-russia-thing is not really primarily based on cheap energy.
