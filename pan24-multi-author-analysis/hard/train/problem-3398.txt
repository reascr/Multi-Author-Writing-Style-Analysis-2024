Meanwhile the rest of Russia can get on with living and trying to not be shit. Maybe setup some hidden cameras in the bunker too, the world would pay good money to watch that version of the Putin Show, especially if you slowly jump the shark with it all just to see if he ever notices.
Use some footage of scale models getting blown up, and tell Putin he has to stay in the bunker because shit's crazy up top, but going really well and everyone thinks he's the best.
The problem for Putin is that even if he knows that a lot of the info is bullshit, he also knows that the bullshit is the only info he has to work with. There's no second source of information that he can use. So the best he can do is take the info he has and do some guesswork as to what the original message was before it got warped by bullshit telephone as it worked its way up the chain of command.
It doesn't suggest he's an idiot. Putin doesn't believe his commanders unquestioningly. That's why he's replaced the top commanders in Ukraine several times over and he stopped taking briefings from Shoigu, instead getting the info directly from the generals.
