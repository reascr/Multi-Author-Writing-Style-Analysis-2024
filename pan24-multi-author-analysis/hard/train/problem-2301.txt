Everything is so cheap there, it was amazing. Nice dinner, drinks, leaving drunk and stuffed, was probably around 30$ a person. Live music everywhere. All the musicians are amazing. We actually went there because my fiance's brother writes music for movie trailers, and they use an orchestra in Budapest because it is cheaper.
I loved Budapest and it is on the top of my list of places to return to. We actually know a few people who started to live there after college and one of the people is still there. Highly recommend.
We were just in the touristy areas, went to szimpla kert a couple times and just wondered. It was 3 days worth, but the limited people I met were nice. The friend I have, who has lived there for 4 years and is from the US, also said people there were nice. So I guess it depends who you ask.
Well yeah, who else. We're talking about Ukrainians. But aside from bordering Ukraine and people transitioning through the country, Hungary has less refugees from Ukraine than Portugal...
