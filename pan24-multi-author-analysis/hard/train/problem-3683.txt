Ironically if it HAD broken, it would have inundated all the Russian troops on the east bank, doing more damage to themselves than Ukrainian forces. Of course the civilians would suffer, but it would also totally cut off water to Crimea, which Russia still controls and will until next summer probably.
Restoring the water supply to Crimea is definitely one of Russia's goals with this war after Ukraine cut the region off. I have to imagine that Russia's retreat in this region will center on keeping the water running.
The dam supplies water to Crimea, which they still control, so they wouldn't want to destroy it (yet).
In this case, though, it's likely the damage was incidental, because the Russians need this dam in place to provide the water height necessary to feed the canal that provides fresh water to Crimea. At this stage, I would assume the Russians still have not abandoned hopes of holding Crimea, and thus would not blow this Dam.
That entire massive 'lake' in the center of Ukraine is the reservoir created by this dam. If they blew the dam, the results would be catastrophic.
I saw the video, it looked like they were trying to take out the bridge over the dam without destroying the dam itself. They want to slow the Ukrainian's ability to follow them over the river.
