Over at r/conservative they're blaming everyone and everything but themselves, pretending like they weren't practically blindly supportive of the GOP, of Trump, of every poor candidate, of regressive policy (or lack thereof), of obstruction, of a lot of the far right nonsense that's all of a sudden being condemned by voters. I mean, they voted for these Republicans and only began changing their tune once they realized that the election wasn't going swimmingly for the party.
Also the Republican absudity that when we win, the election was fair but when we lose, the election was rigged. You wouldn't accept that logic from a 4 year old.
Roe is the big one. You can't turn over half the population into second class citizens and not expect serious opposition. I think future history classes will teach that overturning Roe was one of the greatest political miscalculations of all time.
At the moment the Republicans have been shocked into dumbfoundedness by the election results and are holding their breath to see if the Dems may end up controlling the House, but I expect them to start doing some serious doubling down on all their worst ideas at any moment, especially if the Republicans end up in control of the House.
