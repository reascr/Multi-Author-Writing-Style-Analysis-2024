I've never thought the "lab leak hypothesis" was total nonsense. The people who are saying it was on purpose, especially those who say it was to make Donald Trump look bad are obviously just making shit up. But an accidental leak from a lab with China covering it up....we still need more evidence but it doesn't seem like something that should be dismissed as a conspiracy theory.
Reminder to anyone who believes the lab leak and the China is in control theory, before anyone knew what it was China sent samples to other countries to help with identification.
Which is of course exactly what a giant country obsessed with control of information would do had they assumed their lab working on SARS leaked.
Nope not at all. Well it was a consensus from conservatives and conspiracy theorists who knowingly push false theories, but never by any scientific journal.
Well it's not surprising considering the media and health agencies spent an entire year saying this was a baseless conspiracy theory. Politicizing covid is the dumbest shit I've seen in my life. The waters are muddy and internal documents from NIH only created more questions. Grants were givin out to create a stronger coronavirus. Here's a good read about some of the issues and touches on the complete lack of transparency and oversight.
