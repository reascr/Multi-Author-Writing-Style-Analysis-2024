Right, like this war isn't the greatest promotional tool ever for America's military industrial complex. America is going to make billions in weapons sales over the next couple of years.
The USA spends $801 billion (2021) on defense while Germany spends $56 billion (2021), or 7% of what the USA spends. Repairing tanks dragged back to Poland (where western arms are repaired) will always be easier for the USA because they have more billions to put to the task. The USA can fly their parts to Poland. Planes literally fly around the world in hours. Maybe a truck from Germany would beat the plane because the plane has to be unloaded into trucks. But those hours are not significant with regard to the task. And only applicable the first time as an inventory will be built up in Poland.
The different fuel is an issue but presumably the USA has worked out how to get jet fuel etc. - and lots of it - to a battlefield or else the tank is a white elephant.
The turbine in an Abrams tank is less complex than the diesel in a Leopard tank. The rest of the vehicles are essentially the same complexity. So the Abrams tank should break down less.
