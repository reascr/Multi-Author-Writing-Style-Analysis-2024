Edit: But it doesn't look like this is going to lead to anything in the near future. It's a high-risk treatment being used for people with both cancer and HIV.
And if you survive the cure, you'll live a life needing more medications and constant checkups than a person with HIV would.
This will require a lot of extra research and a working cure for AIDS could still be years in the future.
......however, the mechanism which protects patients from the HIV-re-infection does offer some hope as the immunity of the CCR5 gene mutation might be "spliced" into the genes of infected people at a cost which could be affordable on a global scale. It might even be enough to come up with a partial immunity-protection for the immune systems of AIDS-patients to reduce their reliance of "the cocktail" which suppresses the spread of the virus in infected bodies.
I'm just saying this method is not a path for a general cure, it's less about HIV and more about full bone marrow replacements - which as a side effect, "reboot" the immune system including the cells infected by HIV.
This "cure" is literally killing all your bone marrow (and therefore your immune system), and transplanting in bone marrow from a person who is immune to HIV. The chances of finding a donor who is both compatible with you, and has the rare genetic mutation that make them immune to HIV is way less likely than winning the lottery. And the chances of dying during this incredibly risky and complicated procedure are high.
