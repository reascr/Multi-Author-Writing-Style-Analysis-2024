If Putin gets away with it, you're just kicking the can down the road because he'll be hell-bent on revenge, spend all his time rearming and preparing it and the next time the death toll might be much higher. Terrible idea.
Reparations? Putin, Shoigu, Naryshkin, the Wagner creep etc. need to sit in a boxes in the Hague wearing orange. That or the Russians rebel and they swing from lampposts outside the Kremlin.
Which doesn't change the fact that Putin and his fascist apparatus will seek revenge on the west and will aggressively rearm and rebuild their military. With one single goal: revenge. Sure, there will be more fireworks when that occurs because everyone else will arm too. But does that sound like a recipe for "saving lives"?
It was more of an answer to your question about a recipe for savings lives. I just felt that your question came off as “let’s not arm ourselves against Putin because he will seek revenge.” Regardless if the countries around arm themselves or not, his plan isn’t much different from WW2 Germany. It’s expansion and becoming a world power. However, before he only thought he could get away was because no one put up a fight. Well in the future, he won’t start another because he doesn’t have what it takes.
It would take decades of investment in military for Russia to even be on par with NATO if NATO would actually bring out their arsenal. Russia economy and demographic in on downward spiral. Just to bring them back to what they were a year ago economically will take a long time.
I doubt every nation around Russia isn’t quadrupling their military arsenal after this war. Either that or they are negotiating with the EU, NATO or the USA for some type of military contract. Be it arms or protection.
Has their old recipe worked? No. Putin has been killing, invading, annexing regions and destroying governments/nations because for the longest time there wasn’t retaliation or consequences.
