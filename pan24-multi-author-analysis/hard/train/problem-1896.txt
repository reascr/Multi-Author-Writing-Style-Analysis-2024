Honestly, I think most Americans are in favor of protecting reproductive freedom in at least the first trimester, and even after that in cases of rape, incest, or the health of the woman. Beyond that, let the states decide. (I know there are loud extremists on both sides who want either a total ban or no restrictions whatsoever.).
Since reproductive freedom was protected by voters in MT, KS, and KY, Republican senators from those states should vote in favor of federal legislation, but I know they won't. They're so out of touch with their own constituencies.
Have Manchin and Sinema both said they won't vote for it? Can legislation be passed in the House before a possible Republican majority takeover? Is Congress just trying to keep this issue alive to drive people to the polls in future elections?
Put it to a vote Especially while people are paying attention. I think we are moving beyond debating our loved ones on the interwebs and actually paying attention to what is going on and its encouraging people to vote. We need to keep this momentum up and really put the GOP on the defensive. We want to know who to vote out next. We no longer want to be stripped of our rights.
