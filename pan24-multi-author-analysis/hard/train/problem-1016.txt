Todd is a full throated republican apologist. just because his clock was right in this instance with jim Jordan, I could go on and on about all the obvious questions and pushback he didn't give to good old Gymbo in this pathetic interview.
If you think Todd is a fair and balanced you haven't seen much of Chuck Todd (or you are living in a republican paranoid fantasy).
I've seen quite a lot of Todd, and If you think hes a republican apologist you must be viewing him through the eyes of a delusional 25 year old still assmad over bernie, hoping to blow the cover off the DNC machine.
Nah he's probably a fed up conservative who's capable of some critical thought and can't excuse or bear the circus anymore. Some of these ex-R anchors are late-comers to the party, but welcomed, at least.
This is what Trump seems to be counting on.. again... for his 2024 run. After the last loss and everything that's transpired since then, you'd have to be an idiot to think you have a fair shot with a normal campaign, or a 2nd-chance coup leader who knows something's coming or being set up.
