I still have adult-onset asthma that I developed only after getting the Swine Flu in 2009. That shit wrecked me. I never had respiratory issues prior to that.
I started having breathing issues. My job requires walking around a large campus, doing technical support, so I was struggling. Took a month before the random coughing to the point of wheezing would stop. I think I got an upper respiratory infection the first week of November, was down for the duration. I am still always short of breath. I used to run 5Ks. Now I'm winded just walking to the mailbox. I do it anyways because I need the exercise and fresh air.
Sleeping as much as I can, eating good, getting outdoors. None of it seems to help, I'm tired from when I open my eyes to going to bed, not sleepy tired, fatigued tired.
I'm wide awake right now at 2am on the West Coast, due to insomnia. I also have really bad joint pain, so it makes it hard to get comfortable laying down. If I do finally sleep, it's for three or four hours at a time. I just rest whenever I can't stay awake anymore. I've been having fevers and night sweats on and off as well for the last month.
I had hayfever symptoms and a bit of a cough a week after I tested positive, but I was a little more tired than normal. Napped etc.
