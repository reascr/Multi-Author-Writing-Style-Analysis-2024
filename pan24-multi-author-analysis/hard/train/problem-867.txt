- I don't know if Santos has a history of illegal arms trafficking, but Trump Azerbaijan is a warehouse. No people ever stayed there. According to news reports, it was financed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and it is used to smuggle arms into Iran, including the missile/drone guidance systems used to attack Ukraine by Russian forces.
- Trump sent goons to his doctor's office to take his medical records. This probably was primarily to destroy any X-rays or other records that showed he never had bone spurs, and that he illegally evaded the draft during the Viet Nam War, but possibly this was also to conceal his history of Venereal diseases, and prescription narcotics used (Percoset and amphetamines).
- Both Trump and Santos have lied about their maximum net worth, exaggerating by about a factor of ten in each case.
A lot of Trump's lies are gross exaggerations with grounding in reality, whereas Santos' are entirely made up.
Actually, looking at the list of accusations, all backed up by evidence against both persons, I wound have to say that Trump takes the prize for breadth of lies.
There is plenty of evidence that shows that Republican voters are more than willing to elect liars/frauds, even with damning evidence of it being the case. They vote Party purity over values, all the damn time.
