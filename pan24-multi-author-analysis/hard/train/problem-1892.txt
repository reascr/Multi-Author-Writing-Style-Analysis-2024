That's the downtown Orlando district though. Val Demings won it with 65% and then 64% of the vote. Maxwell just got 59%.
It's Texas. Neither liberals or progressives are going to flip it anytime soon. I know reddit hates "moderates" but they are the only ones with a chance in solidly red states. You really think Texas is going to flip for a AOC like candidate?
Yeah Demings had won it by far larger margins in the last two elections. It's silly to say progressives are the answer to flipping seats given that they never win purple districts and only win in dark blue districts.
That's untrue given there are several purple and red district Progressives won in over the past two years. Not to mention Progressive Fetterman just won a purple state. After having a stroke and being unable to ideally communicate for months.
Progressive Fetterman just won a purple state and several Progressives won in purple and red districts over the past 2 years. Progressive Mandela Barnes also came far closer to beating Ron Johnson than Modetate Val Demmings came to beating Marco Rubio.
