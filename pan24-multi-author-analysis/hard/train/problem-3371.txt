Republicans are also a lot better at killing themselves. There are a lot of factors nipping away at Republican life span when compared to democrats and a lot of it rests on denial of the actual problem whether itâ€™s Covid, gun prevalence, mental health, etc.
I'd like to point out that democrats are more likely to live/work or generally be in and around crowded areas (see cities), yet Republicans still outpace democrats in deaths.
Republican counties had a 20% higher death rate the democrat counties in 2019, despite that repubican and democrat registered voters had the same age adjusted death rates at that time. Starting in September 2020 the registered republicans started to die at a faster rate then democrats did, and that gap has gotten wider over time.
From what I can tell taking all causes of deaths together there were 200k more republicans who died then democrats in the last 12 months. That sounds like a lot but spread out over the country its only like .2-.3% of the electorate in any given race, so in reality it probably only effected a handful of races. If it stays at this elevated rate going forward then maybe it will be enough to push them out of power forever, but who knows if they will change their ways.
