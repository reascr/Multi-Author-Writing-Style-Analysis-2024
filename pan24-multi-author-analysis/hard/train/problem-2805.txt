Fascism always seems to find no shortage of pawns who dispose of other pawns. At that top level, they're not just dimwitted goons hopped up on ultranationalism and myths of glorious conquest. They're fully in on the scam, they have already clawed and backstabbed to climb the hierarchy of other backstabbing bastards. But somehow, they always think they're too special to meet the same end as all the rest. Perhaps they're not as clever as they've convinced themselves they are.
"Look Frida, this is an opportunity that I've just got to take. Well they were hardly going to give me the job when everything was going well, were they?".
Yes. They want both. People who don't care believe the state tv line. The rest understand the threat. It's like how dictators don't lie to convince you, they lie to insult you.
But the fact that everyone steals means the leadership has dirt on everyone. So you can use corruption as a way to imprison whomever you want in the power structure.
If it was possible to get in trouble for stealing too much, Russian forces wouldn't be going into battle with literal cardboard armor plates.
