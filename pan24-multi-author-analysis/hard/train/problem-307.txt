I struggle, knowing just HOW MANY Germans fell for the Nazi ideology and participated in the holocaust, to be so bold as to say I would have done any differently if I was under that regime.
It’s good to remember there were people (even in small groups) in Germany who were very vocal about dangers of the Nazis and crimes they were committing. They were also killed. People were warned or told and often attacked those trying to stop the Nazis. You kinda don’t know what side people take until it happens and how they react to opposing voices or violence taking place against minorities and opposition groups.
Also the word ‘Nazi’ was started as a joke which was at the time calling their followers red necks type thing. People I think were attacked in Germany at the time of their rise to power for calling them that.
Ah yes, thats why we did this to all the Nazi’s in Germany right? Right? We executed hundreds of thousands of Nazi supporters right?
While Hitler was a brutal dictator, he often did not resort to killing (German citizens). There are only two large instances where he directly ordered the murder of German citizens (Kristallnacht and post-Operation Valkyrie). In other words, no one is gonna die for quitting.
The Germans were more concerned about hiding their genocide, as shown by the mass graves, the disassembling of camps in days, and retreats into Germany with the dubbed "death marches".
