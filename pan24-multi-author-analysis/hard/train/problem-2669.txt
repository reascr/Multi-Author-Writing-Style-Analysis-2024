I hate to be that guy, but people familiar with Putin's style recognize he's deliberately being humorous here. It's meant to be tongue in cheek kind of in the way that GWB would say something like this during a press conference and people would chuckle. His delivery is just very typically Russian.
People in the West probably have a hard time picturing it without watching a lot of Putin's translated speeches, but he's a really good politician in terms of speaking in public. He's very good at making jokes and using funny folksy Russian idioms and he's remarkably quick witted.
Putin is a murderous dictator and completely intimidating and evil, but he also is well known for having a very dry sense of humor and banter in public. If you watch a lot of Putin speeches and interviews, it starts to make a bit more sense.
I wonder if the same phenomenon is at play when people diagnose Putin from pictures and videos. Every week some journalist or talking head diagnoses him with something, but most doctors interviewed seem to be saying, "could be cancer, could be something else, come to the office". I think the media does this to give people hope.
