Disticting doesn't really matter for state-wide races. And while I'm not 100% sure about FL in particular, generally the state house draws up the districts, not the governor.
But even if you live in the most gerrymandered district, your vote still matters for local and statewide elections, even if less for the House or state legislatures. And non-GOP actually turnd out, they'd probably win a lot of elections anyway.
Gerrymandering doesn't help state wide elections though, except by discouraging people to vote at all.
But voter turnout was shit, and it wouldn't have taken that many more voters in any of the swing states to have pushed it over the line. Because people didn't like her for whatever reason.
Hey, all you folks who didn't vote in 2016 because HeR eMaILs or whatever, how are you feeling about that choice now?
I think it's time the left stopped blaming people who "don't vote." The last several years saw record turn out across the board, despite incredible levels of voter suppression.
Then there's the stuff that the left does to completely alienate hidden swing votes in purple areas -- specifically Texas. If Democrats would drop their obsession with gun restrictions like the hot mess it is, you could likely flip Texas. Even the Dems in that state don't want that, but folks keep banging that drum to tickle the fancies of firmly blue areas like California that don't matter and would still vote blue without it.
The left keeps pushing it anyway, and the right just sits there and goes, "Hurrhurr, see, Dems want to take your rights!". It's an easy win for them and they don't even have to pretend to fight for anyone's rights.
