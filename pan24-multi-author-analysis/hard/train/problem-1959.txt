You know we have laws like this in the US for example, if you are robbing a store and someone dies as a result, even if you do not kill them, even if they were killed on accident by the police in response to your crime, you will be charged with murder.
At the same time, to use another example from US law, if you are in a situation where you are forced to use a firearm to defend yourself, but miss and hit a bystander you will be held accountable. Though you'd likely be held less accountable than if there was no defensive situation.
While this is likely what would happen in terms of criminal liability, you will almost certainly be sued and situation dependent face civil consequences.
Huh, I don't think it's that way in most states though I'm not familiar with other states laws. But I can say you'd face civil action in my state of MN.
Again, that's obviously much less responsibility than if you were just out there firing off a gun for fun, but you would still be held accountable again situation depending.
